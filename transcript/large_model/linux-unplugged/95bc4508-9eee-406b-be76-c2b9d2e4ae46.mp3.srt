1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
You remember the Runs Linux segment on Linux Action Show?

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,440
Oh yeah, of course.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,480
Check out this Runs Linux for this week.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,640
NASA, NASA Runs Linux.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,520
You know, there's this recent epic landing on Mars.

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,360
Heck yeah.

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,200
And on the live stream, I got a screen cap of it here.

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,520
I noticed up on the projector,

9
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:20,260
a kind of older Plasma desktop running VNC,

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,600
looking into another Unix box

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,200
to pull the images down live from the landing.

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,040
All on Linux.

13
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,000
You've got Linux, Linux,

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,240
and then I think that might be some old Unix possibly.

15
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,080
Chris, when you're landing on another world,

16
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,120
you don't have time for proprietary software.

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,600
That's right, you gotta make sure it works right.

18
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,280
And VNC is the old go-to remote control,

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,860
even for NASA.

20
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,640
This is Linux Unplugged,

21
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:58,840
episode 277 for November 27th, 2018.

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,960
Welcome to Linux Unplugged,

23
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,400
your weekly Linux talk show

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,040
that might be slightly distracted

25
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,440
by that keyboard over there

26
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,320
that's got a Linux box built into it.

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,160
My name's Chris.

28
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,440
My name is Wes, and I know I am very distracted.

29
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,920
It's the Keyboardio.

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,480
It's a wood keyboard with a pretty eclectic layout

31
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,940
and Arduino boards built into both halves of it,

32
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,080
connected via an ethernet cable.

33
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,560
And then USB-C back to the machine.

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,900
And it's all programmed.

35
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,960
You got LED lights.

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,640
You could do RGB if you wanna be a elite gamer.

37
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,480
So Wes is gonna be putzing with that project,

38
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,640
but that's actually not what we're here

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,240
to talk about today, no, no.

40
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,760
We're gonna do a bunch of community news.

41
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,860
A nice batch, not too much, but a good solid batch.

42
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,520
Wimpy whetted my appetite recently

43
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,960
with some really cool home server setup talk.

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,120
So we'll deep dive with Mr. Wimpress on that.

45
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,000
And then after the KDE Corner,

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,400
we're gonna talk about this proposal by the Fedora Project.

47
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:56,920
After Fedora 30, they wanna punt an entire release,

48
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,320
take a year and focus on themselves,

49
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,520
and wait for 31.

50
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,080
Now that's a massive proposal with huge ramifications

51
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,280
and kind of a precarious timing

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,040
with the other news out there.

53
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,320
So we're gonna bring on the project lead, Matthew Miller,

54
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,680
to explain what's going on, what the objective is,

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,720
what might go wrong, and what stage this proposal is in.

56
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,880
We're gonna get the whole scoop from him.

57
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,280
That's like everything.

58
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,600
He's gonna be on it a little bit

59
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,000
to tell us what's going on there.

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,360
And then we'll wrap it up with some pics,

61
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,600
some interesting year-end news,

62
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,240
including like when we're doing our special

63
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,360
for predictions and stuff like that.

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,200
We got all that nailed down.

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,160
And then for one last time, hopefully,

66
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,440
I'll tell you my current Dropbox hack,

67
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,760
which those bastards at Dropbox.

68
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,160
I sat down in a machine upstairs,

69
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,320
I started popping up that error message.

70
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,200
I just got so disappointed.

71
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,640
The XT4.

72
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,040
Oh, so frustrating.

73
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,880
You know what?

74
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,800
Let's focus on something positive.

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,120
Let's focus on that virtual log.

76
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,640
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

77
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,480
Good morning.

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,320
Good morning.

79
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,160
Hello.

80
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,000
Hello.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Hello.

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,680
Hello, everybody.

83
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,520
Good to have you with us.

84
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,640
Thank you for joining us.

85
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,040
We're gonna have a great show today.

86
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,480
And I wanted to start with a topic that just won't go away.

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,400
And Wes, you set it up so beautifully

88
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,280
the other day in our chat.

89
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,440
You said we're in the ascendancy of these projects.

90
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,960
And so we are not fully realizing

91
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,000
all of the long-term ramifications.

92
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,120
And what you were talking about

93
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,600
is how everything has its own package manager right now.

94
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,520
And we're gonna get to a new story that just happened here.

95
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,640
But we've talked about this before.

96
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,400
Docker Hub, flat pack apps that have been packaged

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
with old libraries or elementary apps

98
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,440
that aren't properly supported and distributed as flat packs

99
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,680
or snaps that had a crypto miner in them

100
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,120
or the most recent one that I think

101
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,640
has gotten a lot of attention is this Node.js package hack.

102
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,120
So for some context, a widely used MPM package

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
was discovered to have a dependency

104
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,800
with an encrypted payload in it,

105
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,800
which then tried to steal bitcoins.

106
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,640
Of course.

107
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,480
I mean, that's what you do.

108
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,120
That's always what they try to steal.

109
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,280
But when you start reading through the community reaction,

110
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,800
there is tremendous outrage at the developer

111
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,960
for essentially screwing millions of people.

112
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,160
People are very, very angry.

113
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,840
And they have not really a lot of ground to stand on.

114
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,160
Cause if you look at any open source software,

115
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,520
it generally comes with, it's provided as is,

116
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
use at your own risk.

117
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,960
I think that's what makes it so interesting

118
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,880
is because none of these are hard and fast rules.

119
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,480
It's all about community norms

120
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,040
and what we expect from software.

121
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,880
And these days, like everything you build

122
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,520
is gonna be pulling in six, 10 more libraries

123
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,920
that you're linking features and adding value on top.

124
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,160
And that's great.

125
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,680
But we do have to question,

126
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,400
like how do we be responsible about this?

127
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,080
And yes, it's not your responsibility necessarily

128
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,000
to do any of these things

129
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,760
if you're an open source project maintainer,

130
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,320
but if you're interested in doing that well,

131
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,000
what are some guidelines that can help you do that?

132
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,560
How do you, and when you're ready to not do it anymore,

133
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,840
which is totally reasonable,

134
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,280
how do you transfer ownership to somebody reasonable way?

135
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,640
Right, so it doesn't just die and become vulnerable.

136
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,840
But I mean, how deep does this rabbit hole go though?

137
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,640
Because you've got a distribution package repository

138
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,800
and maintainers, then you've got things

139
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,120
that have their own package managers built into them,

140
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,600
lots of software does.

141
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,360
Then you've got containers that have hubs

142
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,760
that people have automatically submitted software to.

143
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,440
Then you also just have rando drive by websites.

144
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,080
So like this rabbit hole is never ending to me.

145
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,560
And we're just building on top of it.

146
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,000
Like building a package manager now

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,840
is like the keen thing that's the bee's knees,

148
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,080
that everybody's doing.

149
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,440
And it seems like we aren't appreciating

150
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,280
the amount of work it takes to sustain these systems.

151
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,960
The more packages a system has,

152
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,120
the bigger it becomes, then it becomes,

153
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,720
it's like it's on a Richter scale.

154
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,480
Like it becomes way more work to actually maintain it all.

155
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,080
Maybe we need a minor free certification process.

156
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,760
There are three layers to this, right?

157
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,800
There's the ethical component,

158
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,320
there is the trust component,

159
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,160
and then there is the legal one.

160
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,400
Ethically wrong, just throw it away.

161
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,480
Trust, well, people trusted the repository

162
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,720
where things were sorted out.

163
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,800
So the responsibility really gets attributed to them

164
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,200
in my perspective, not so much the original developer

165
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,280
because transfer of ownership

166
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,680
is not immediate transfer of access to a repository.

167
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,920
When I think of that rabbit hole,

168
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,360
it seems insurmountable to solve at the management layer.

169
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,200
In fact, it seems like ultimately the responsibility

170
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,720
is on the sys admin who installed that on his own server

171
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,800
or the end user who decided to install

172
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,120
that desktop software.

173
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,480
I kind of like to get your perspective on this Brent.

174
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,720
I'm not saying I audit all of the things I installed,

175
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,440
but don't you think ultimately if you installed something

176
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,720
that stole your Bitcoin wallet, it's your fault?

177
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,800
Yeah, I think that is the case.

178
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,760
And we have to be careful

179
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,000
with the end user perspective there,

180
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,160
is that not all of our end users are educated enough

181
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,760
to know to look at all of that stuff

182
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,040
or pay that much attention, right?

183
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,280
Like Linux, we sometimes tout as really quite safe

184
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,400
for end users, but in this case,

185
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,240
they may not even know

186
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,360
what they're installing in the background.

187
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,960
So yeah, absolutely, especially as a sys admin,

188
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
should feel responsible for that.

189
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,640
But as an end user, you need to kind of have your eye out

190
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,600
for that kind of stuff too.

191
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,680
I'm on Arch and as everyone knows, the AUR is great

192
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,840
and can have some pitfalls, right, in that respect.

193
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,360
So I think, yeah, it is ultimately responsible

194
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,600
for what you're installing.

195
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,800
But I will say there's even a bigger catch

196
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,840
that is often missed and with this one,

197
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,680
which is companies that tend to use open source packages,

198
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,000
they generally will have some sort of artifactory

199
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,800
or internal repository that they clone.

200
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,560
If they can't just easily pick up from the original source,

201
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,440
they will stop contributing back

202
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,280
the little they already contribute back

203
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,720
because at this point, the risk is too high.

204
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,320
So I would refrain from trying to put these things

205
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,160
into this perspective of, hey, let's just,

206
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
the user is responsible because a company

207
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,800
really doesn't want to do that all the time

208
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,040
because then it just worth it to pay the developer

209
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,320
to write it in the first place

210
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,920
and we're the ones to lose.

211
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,120
So I really think that we want to take ownership

212
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,800
and responsibility for it while it's still convenient

213
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,680
for us to have that responsibility.

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,560
I think one of the problems that we see here

215
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,520
is in our quest for more software availability,

216
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,120
we've made it easier to get software

217
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,840
and that can make, like with the AUR,

218
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,440
it can mean that you can rebuild things

219
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,960
from Git really easily and get the latest security patches

220
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,640
or things can never get updated.

221
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,400
But I think some systems are doing it

222
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,240
in a little bit different because you'll never be able

223
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,640
to solve, or at least it doesn't seem likely will solve

224
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,160
the problem of people just didn't update

225
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,280
all their dependencies the right way anytime soon.

226
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,600
But maybe another approach is limiting the damage

227
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,320
that can be done like with snaps, right Wimpy?

228
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,560
Yeah, this is an interesting conversation.

229
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,560
So when we think back to 1970s Unix,

230
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:49,800
everything's a string, do one job and do it well,

231
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,000
and pipes, these were profound ideas

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,520
that have stood the test of time

233
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,160
and lasted for 40 plus years.

234
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,520
But back then when Unix was being created,

235
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,400
there were a handful of people

236
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,520
that were building the system.

237
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,120
And there was implicit trust that existed

238
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,800
between all of those people that were working

239
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,440
on the Unix derivatives.

240
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,240
And you can even trace that back to the level of trust

241
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,240
that existed in the networking tools back then.

242
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,240
Everything worked on a trust relationship.

243
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,200
Everybody knew who everybody else was.

244
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,560
Now, when you roll forward 40, 50 years,

245
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,280
that's not the case anymore.

246
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,800
There are tens of millions of developers just on GitHub,

247
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,200
and there are other places that you can manage

248
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,720
your source code in the world today.

249
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,760
There are millions upon millions upon millions of projects

250
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,920
in GitHub and other public source code repositories.

251
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,400
You as a sysadmin or a DevOps engineer,

252
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,720
or a developer who are pulling in components,

253
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,320
you may just pull in component foo,

254
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,880
but component foo may have dependencies upon dozens

255
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,640
and dozens and dozens of other libraries.

256
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,640
You can't trust all of that other stuff.

257
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,960
And this is where snaps are a re-imagining

258
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,480
of old 1970s AT&T Unix,

259
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
where you take all of those things,

260
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,760
you put them in a container that can't tread

261
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,680
on the host operating system or the other applications

262
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,360
that are installed in that way,

263
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,920
because we can't guarantee these trust relationships

264
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,080
that used to exist in the distribution models

265
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,480
and the creation of the distributions

266
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,320
in their earliest forms anymore.

267
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,040
It's a new era, and it seems like something that's actually,

268
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,240
now that we're this far into it,

269
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,240
has been a long time coming.

270
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,560
So, and there's also, obviously, as technology gets better,

271
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,240
there's other ways to solve this.

272
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,480
Almost every major repository is built in

273
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,280
some sort of basic scanning for malware

274
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,480
or trust verification system of publishers.

275
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,520
Like, there's other ways of tackling this

276
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,720
at the distribution end as well.

277
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,120
Somebody could build a machine learning model

278
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,680
which is good at smashing crypto miners or something.

279
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,720
Yeah, I bet you it's in the works.

280
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,560
That seems like something that would get a lot of hype.

281
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,280
Crypto miners by themselves are not illegitimate though.

282
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,560
True, true.

283
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,600
Yeah, basically scan for anything

284
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,960
that's not specifically flagged as a crypto miner.

285
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,320
Like, when you upload your package,

286
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,080
you get a flag that says, this is a crypto miner.

287
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,920
Yeah.

288
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,480
And it would come up on when you install a package saying,

289
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,840
hey, this is a crypto miner.

290
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,840
Are you okay with that?

291
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,680
You're like, yes, I know.

292
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,720
I want to get onto Bitcoin.

293
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,320
Yeah, let's not talk about Bitcoin right now.

294
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,960
It makes me sad.

295
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,320
All right, well, I wanted to also discuss this story

296
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,760
that's coming out of the United Space Alliance.

297
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,360
When's the last time we got to do that?

298
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,760
Too long, too long, I say.

299
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,200
May have been never on this show, actually.

300
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,040
We're going to take a look page

301
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,520
from SciByte here for a moment.

302
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,760
This is the group that manages the computers

303
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,880
aboard the International Space Station,

304
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,480
and they work with NASA.

305
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,360
And they just recently announced

306
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,120
that the Windows XP computers

307
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,320
aboard the International Space Station

308
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,960
have been switched to GNU slash Linux.

309
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,800
No way.

310
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,040
Wow. Isn't that awesome?

311
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,080
That's fantastic.

312
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,920
Yeah.

313
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,800
Yeah, they write, we migrated key functions

314
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,720
from Windows to Linux

315
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,400
because we needed an operating system that was...

316
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,480
Stable. Stable and reliable.

317
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,320
Of course.

318
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,000
Yep, yep, in specific, the dozens of laptops

319
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,760
will make the change to,

320
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,880
can you guess which version of Debian?

321
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,720
Oh, it's Debian.

322
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,640
I was going to say Fedora 29,

323
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,480
but no, that wouldn't make sense.

324
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,920
No, they had to wait around for 30.

325
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,360
It's going to be supported for a while.

326
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Okay, so Debian 8, let's say.

327
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,200
Yeah, give me the number

328
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,480
because I don't remember all the Debian names

329
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,120
off the top of my head all the time.

330
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,320
So, all right.

331
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,040
Okay, let's see if anybody can,

332
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,160
see if you can guess what version of Debian

333
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,880
it's going to be up in space for a long time.

334
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,520
So you're going to want something probably recent, right?

335
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,040
Something current and well supported.

336
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,200
We'll have security updates for going forward.

337
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,360
It's an old one.

338
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,920
It is, you're right, it is.

339
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,760
All right, okay.

340
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,880
It is Debian 6.

341
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,720
The laptops will join many other systems

342
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,520
aboard the ISS that already run

343
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,920
various flavors of Linux.

344
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,720
These ones will be running Debian 6.

345
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,040
There's also Red Hat up there, as you would imagine,

346
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,000
and some scientific Linux, as you probably guessed already.

347
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,040
And after the transition,

348
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,000
there won't be a single computer of the ISS

349
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,680
that runs Windows anymore.

350
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,600
It was kind of interesting that

351
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,480
another reason they liked was that

352
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,800
they wanted in-house control,

353
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,960
which is a thing we talk about,

354
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,760
but you don't always actually see people using it, right?

355
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,160
But here they can just,

356
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,840
they can mess things up as much as they want to

357
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,560
and customize it.

358
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,800
Yeah, well, you know, they got a virus back in 2008.

359
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,960
I guess they blame it on a Russian cosmonaut.

360
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,880
Those Russians and their viruses.

361
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,360
Brought about a worm, I guess, technically not a virus,

362
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,040
which then spread to the other laptops.

363
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,160
And they think that switching to Linux will

364
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,960
essentially immunize them from that particular type

365
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,720
of attack in the future.

366
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,560
I mean, I guess against casual malware,

367
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,960
not perhaps a more malicious attack.

368
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,160
Yeah.

369
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,520
Yeah, but I don't think any of us

370
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,040
are too surprised by this, are we?

371
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,960
Because Linux is the scientific community's

372
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,280
operating system of choice.

373
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:59,640
We know that the Large Hadron Collider is used by Linux.

374
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,160
It uses Linux and uses KDE Plasma.

375
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,480
NASA and SpaceX ground stations run Linux.

376
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,480
DNA sequencing labs technicians use Linux.

377
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,440
It's pretty much anybody that has a serious job.

378
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,040
Yeah, a lot of astronomy software and packages

379
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,880
for analyzing images you get from telescopes.

380
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,240
That's already running Linux, too.

381
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,320
So kind of part of the course.

382
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,080
Did you see this bit on here about the robot?

383
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,640
They got a robot up there, too.

384
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,240
In other news, yeah, the first humanoid robot in space,

385
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,120
Robonaut 2, also runs Linux, is due for an upgrade.

386
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,000
So they got Robonaut.

387
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,640
And Robonaut 2 is also going to be like they got two robots,

388
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,800
but only one of them is in production.

389
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,000
And the one that's up there now, the one that's

390
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,280
being reassembled and built, has been delivered in pieces.

391
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,560
The last big pieces actually went up in 2011.

392
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,600
Right now, it's just a torso with two arms.

393
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,280
But they also have legs that they're

394
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
going to be giving it soon and a battery pack

395
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,800
that will be delivered soon.

396
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,600
And then eventually, it'll be able to perform

397
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,240
menial tasks like vacuuming, changing the filters,

398
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,160
the air filters, and possibly dangerous tasks

399
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,360
like during spacewalks.

400
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,320
Space butler.

401
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,520
You saw it here first, folks.

402
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,360
Running Linux, Wes.

403
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,000
How about that, huh?

404
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,120
If you like running Linux, friends,

405
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,480
if you enjoy the GNU slash Linux operating system.

406
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,120
And you like talking to people who also

407
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,320
enjoy that operating system.

408
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,560
Then I invite you out to Linux Fest Northwest,

409
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:22,600
coming up April 26 and the 28th in Bellingham, Washington,

410
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,800
the beautiful Pacific Northwest.

411
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,640
And it's at the Bellingham Technical College,

412
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,800
which is a great campus because they

413
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,720
got all kinds of things like robotics there

414
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,640
and they have gaming labs there.

415
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,220
So it's great for kids, too, if you've got little ones.

416
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,080
They have things for little ones to do.

417
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,500
They have a gaming room that is a ton of fun

418
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,160
that my young ones like.

419
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,560
And there is tons of talks to attend.

420
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,120
And of course, we're going to be there.

421
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,840
We're going to have a booth.

422
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,040
And we're even considering doing a little bit more this year,

423
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,720
maybe having a room where we're giving talks all day

424
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,680
and things like that.

425
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,320
It's all in the works.

426
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,240
It's all early days.

427
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,280
But I wanted to mention it now while we're still in 2018.

428
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,300
So maybe it could possibly be on your radar

429
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,880
because we're hoping to have a hell of a party.

430
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,320
It's been a good year for us.

431
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,320
We've had things to celebrate.

432
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,440
A year like no other.

433
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,800
Not only have we joined Linux Academy,

434
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,440
and now we have full-time people on our team.

435
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,860
And we have new hosts in the works

436
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,440
that are going to be able to join us there that you haven't

437
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,480
even heard about yet.

438
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,800
It's been a really good year for us.

439
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,420
And we're going to have a great party.

440
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,120
Plus, it's the 20th Linux Fest Northwest.

441
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:26,840
20 years.

442
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,880
20 years of Linux Fest Northwest.

443
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,560
Wow.

444
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,680
So they have a few things, a few surprises in the works

445
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,920
to celebrate that.

446
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,360
And they're doing a big past, present, and future theme

447
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,320
to kind of bring it all together.

448
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,080
All this kind of sounds like if you've

449
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,520
been wanting to go to one of these,

450
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,280
you want to go to a conference and hang out with us

451
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,200
or other JP fans.

452
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,080
Yeah, this is the one.

453
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Yeah, this is the one.

454
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,680
And last year, we did a barbecue outside of Lady Joop's.

455
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,160
We had a couple of barbecues going.

456
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,600
Plus, we had the kitchen inside Lady Joop's going.

457
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,360
Just a tremendous party that was a huge success.

458
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,080
And so I think we're going to do it again.

459
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,080
I haven't talked to the folks at System76 yet,

460
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,080
but I know they thought it was a huge success.

461
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,800
Yeah, I'm sure they'll be back.

462
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,600
And if not, hey, we've got the crew.

463
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,560
I mean, maybe we'll be lucky enough

464
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,920
to see Brent there joining us.

465
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,560
I can carry two barbecues on Lady Joop's alone.

466
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,600
So I'm just saying.

467
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,600
Yeah, Brent, are you planning to make it back this year?

468
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,320
I'm definitely going.

469
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,960
I think after the experience last year

470
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,080
and just the huge connection to the JB community

471
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:22,040
here over this year, there's no reason not to go, really.

472
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,720
Even if it's across the continent, really.

473
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,440
I'm feeling like this is going to be one of our big years.

474
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,280
I'm really excited.

475
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,120
I've talked to Noah.

476
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,200
He's going to be there too.

477
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,520
He'll be at the booth.

478
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
And we'll be doing live shows.

479
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,600
And it's just, oh, it's going to be fun.

480
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,840
JB family blowout.

481
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,720
It's going to be a JB family blowout.

482
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,840
So if you want to come out, and so far, it even

483
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,160
sounds like I've talked Joe into coming out and doing

484
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,360
the live Linux action news.

485
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,560
That mysterious, mysterious Joe.

486
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,400
The first live Linux action news

487
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,360
we'll have ever done live at Linux Fest Northwest.

488
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,680
And the first time we've ever seen each other in person.

489
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,120
So I'm looking forward to that just alone.

490
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,080
That's going to be great.

491
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,840
So if you can make it, it's one to go to.

492
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,440
Anybody else in the mumble room, anybody?

493
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,000
Anybody in particular?

494
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,760
Might make it for the 20th anniversary, yes.

495
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,600
Thinking about it.

496
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,520
Gosh, that'd be great.

497
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,120
That would be wild.

498
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,160
That would be so great.

499
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,080
It would be great to have a barbecue at the same time,

500
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,480
I think.

501
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,000
Absolutely.

502
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,120
Just a crazy suggestion.

503
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,320
A barbecue, we almost always have an after party

504
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,960
at the studio.

505
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,840
Although this year, I have a restaurant in mind

506
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,440
to go to just because the crowd's getting bigger.

507
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,080
And the studio's not that big.

508
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,440
So yeah, but we almost always have an after party.

509
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Well, we try to have an after party each night.

510
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,600
So it gets a little ridiculous because you've

511
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,560
got Friday night, which is set up night.

512
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,280
And then the-

513
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,160
You need to blow off some steam after that.

514
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,520
The actual Fest is Saturday and Sunday.

515
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,600
So then you've got things to do at Saturday night and Sunday

516
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,320
night.

517
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,280
And then it's like Sunday, you're all done with the Fest.

518
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,320
You've done your live Linux action news.

519
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,360
Well, now you want to go have a party.

520
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,400
So then there's another party.

521
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,360
And they're not like crazy blowout parties.

522
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,160
Well, actually, sometimes they are.

523
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,880
It just depends on the crowd every year.

524
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,360
But I'd just love to have you there.

525
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,280
And you can check out and get more information

526
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,040
at linuxfestnorthwest.org.

527
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,920
Also, as we do this recording, there's still 65 days

528
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,680
left to submit papers.

529
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,600
I'm encouraging our team, Wes, and others on our team

530
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,480
to submit papers and for talks because I

531
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,720
think we have a lot to contribute that we don't

532
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,960
normally do those things.

533
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,240
But because we're going to have such a big crew,

534
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,400
we'll have plenty of coverage at the booth and stuff

535
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,480
so we can do that kind of thing this year.

536
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,000
Wow, very excited about that.

537
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,640
Well, Wimpy, I really, really do hope you make it.

538
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,120
That would be one of the highlights of the year, I think.

539
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,840
But while I've got your ear, you really

540
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,160
kind of piqued my interest on a recent episode of Ubuntu

541
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,280
podcast, big fan, as you know.

542
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,640
And you touched on a new setup using some software

543
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,340
that I have heard mentioned several times

544
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,000
by the audience, SnapRaid, and a couple of other projects

545
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,520
to really build yourself what sounds like, oh, I mean,

546
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,400
this might, you could correct me if I'm wrong,

547
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,200
but it almost sounds like a free open-source Drobo,

548
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,000
like a home-built Drobo in a way.

549
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,400
Yeah, I think a comparison with a Drobo is fair, yes.

550
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,840
OK, so this obviously sounds very tempting.

551
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,800
I just had another drive die in my FreeNAS server.

552
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,560
I don't know why this happens to me.

553
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,200
And I don't know, I don't grok in FreeNAS's UI

554
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,280
how I'm supposed to solve it.

555
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:16,960
I don't get it.

556
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,800
So then I get.

557
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,120
That's funny.

558
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,640
I had the same.

559
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,520
I just bought two replacement drives on Black Friday.

560
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,800
So I'm going to be rebuilding the array myself.

561
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,360
I didn't even notice until yesterday.

562
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,760
So I didn't even think to look.

563
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,640
So I don't know.

564
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,400
I'm just kind of sick and tired of this.

565
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,560
It's not that FreeNAS is bad.

566
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,000
I love FreeNAS.

567
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,160
But when I have disk die on me, I

568
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,480
feel like I can never clear the error messages out of FreeNAS

569
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,000
for the rest of the life of that install.

570
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,040
And it's just because I'm an idiot.

571
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,240
Because Alan sits down, and he has it figured out

572
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,880
in two seconds.

573
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,320
So it's my fault. But I have been thinking about,

574
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,200
if this was a Linux-based system,

575
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,640
I could probably just take care of it.

576
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,240
And it's because it's this quasi-appliance

577
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,200
without a full user land, running

578
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,560
on top of a kernel and system tools

579
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,800
that I am not as familiar with, that I feel like my data is

580
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,080
kind of in peril.

581
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,720
So help me, wimpy one.

582
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,360
You're my only hope.

583
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,280
Is this something where you could actually

584
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,400
hack it on the command line?

585
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,080
You can SSH into your box and mess around with stuff,

586
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,580
and you're not going to break it.

587
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,320
Explain this setup to me and how it all kind of fits together.

588
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,840
OK.

589
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,080
So yes is the answer to that question.

590
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,680
What I have started with is just an install of Ubuntu server

591
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,400
1804.1.

592
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,360
So just straight up Ubuntu server.

593
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,240
So yes, you can SSH into it.

594
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,440
And you can do all of the management from that point

595
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,280
onwards just over SSH.

596
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,720
With no fancy file system set up beforehand or anything

597
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,280
like that?

598
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,920
Correct.

599
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,400
Yeah, so this is where SnapRaid is interesting.

600
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,520
So let's just start this by saying ZFS is all well and good,

601
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,520
and it has its place in the world.

602
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,760
But I've specifically chosen these tools of SnapRaid

603
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,720
and MergerFS because I am addressing specific issues

604
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,320
that home users would have, not enterprises with terabytes

605
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,960
and terabytes of storage.

606
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,360
So is an example of that like mismatched disks,

607
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,640
or what's an example of that?

608
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,120
Yeah, so examples of that would be with SnapRaid,

609
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,960
you can use mismatched sizes of disks.

610
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,440
You don't have to create the array upfront.

611
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,600
You can use your existing disks with your existing data on it

612
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,600
and add those into a SnapRaid configuration

613
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,200
without any formatting or anything like that.

614
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,960
So in terms of the home user for budgeting, it's very flexible.

615
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,240
And for my position, I lost some disks a year ago

616
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,360
in last year's summer due to heat.

617
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,200
So I'm very sensitive to disks running and spinning

618
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,080
and generating heat.

619
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,760
And the way that SnapRaid works is you, so for example,

620
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,280
I have four drives in one of my arrays.

621
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,320
I just formatted all of them with, well, one of them

622
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,600
I formatted with XFS, and the other three I

623
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,040
formatted with ext4.

624
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,920
So you can choose what file system

625
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,760
you want to put on the disks you're

626
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,400
going to use in your SnapRaid array.

627
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,440
The way that SnapRaid works is that you just copy files

628
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,880
onto a file system.

629
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,360
So nothing clever, nothing fancy.

630
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,840
But consequently, a file exists on one

631
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,360
of the disks in your array.

632
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,480
An array is like in air quotes now,

633
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,080
because it's not like a RAID array where the whole thing is

634
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,120
a logical volume.

635
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,520
Which means when this is actually in use,

636
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,440
only one disk is spinning.

637
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,400
And I have SmartMon power down the disks

638
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
after 10 minutes of activity.

639
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,520
So this keeps the disks cool.

640
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,520
It keeps the power down, and it keeps the noise down.

641
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,520
So these are all important factors for home users.

642
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,020
Right.

643
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,780
That makes sense.

644
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,240
Instead of focusing on a constantly available,

645
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,680
high performance NAS system, this

646
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,440
is more of like, here's my backup server,

647
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,600
and I just want to keep things safe.

648
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,880
It doesn't have to be ready to respond at all moments.

649
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,840
I mean, it's sitting there idle a large chunk of the day.

650
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,320
Indeed.

651
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,120
That's a good point.

652
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,600
So SnapRaid is designed for media servers

653
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,080
where the files on the media server

654
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,840
are changing infrequently.

655
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,400
So let's just talk about SnapRaid for a minute.

656
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,800
I had four drives.

657
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,680
I formatted one with XFS, the other three with ext4.

658
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,560
We'll get to why I did that in just a moment,

659
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,880
because I'm sure that will come as a surprise to you.

660
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,600
I would have thought of an XFS myself,

661
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,240
but a gentleman's file system.

662
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,200
We'll get to it.

663
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,480
You'll understand.

664
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,480
And the drive that I formatted XFS,

665
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,920
that I used as my parity drive.

666
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,440
So within the SnapRaid configuration,

667
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,960
I say this disk mounted in this location is used for parity.

668
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,520
The other three drives that I formatted,

669
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,000
I say these disks are data disks.

670
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,040
And they are each mounted in their own discrete location.

671
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:18,920
So one is called HDD1, another is HDD2, another is HDD3.

672
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,280
And that's basically the SnapRaid configuration.

673
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,560
That's all it cares about, where the disks are,

674
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,320
which one has got parity, which one's got data.

675
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,000
And then you also specify the path

676
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,760
to what are called content files.

677
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,680
And these are the files that store the hashes.

678
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,640
So the checksums and hashes for the files.

679
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,240
And this is where SnapRaid has a great property,

680
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,360
because it offers you the same kind of bit rot protection

681
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,680
that ZFS offers you.

682
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,760
With checksums?

683
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,560
With checksums, indeed.

684
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:56,920
And it can recover from files where the data has become

685
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,800
corrupt over time, and repair that data from the parity

686
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,080
and the hashes.

687
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,840
You probably have heard a lot of people say this sounds

688
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,640
similar to Unraid, since you talked about it

689
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,960
on the Ubuntu podcast.

690
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,560
It is similar to Unraid.

691
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:14,120
It's far more robust than Unraid in my experience.

692
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,200
Yes, indeed.

693
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,960
Yeah, and Unraid is more than just a disk manager now.

694
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,340
It does a whole lot more than that.

695
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,840
Is it a web UI to manage it?

696
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,760
What's the interface?

697
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,560
It's just a config file and a command line application

698
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,960
called SnapRaid.

699
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,240
So once I've created that configuration,

700
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,040
that configuration defines my array.

701
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,960
And now I can just copy some files onto those disks

702
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,600
willy-nilly.

703
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,200
So I copied some files onto hard disk 1,

704
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,160
I copied some onto hard disk 2, and some onto hard disk 3.

705
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,160
And then I ran the command SnapRaid sync,

706
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,060
and that then builds the parity file.

707
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:54,360
So it inspects every file in the array, builds the parity file,

708
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,440
and builds the tables of hashes for all of the files that

709
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
are in there.

710
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,960
And at that point, my data is now protected.

711
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,480
So I have a parity drive, which means one of my disks can fail

712
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,700
and I will be able to recover.

713
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,780
And I have hashes of all of my data.

714
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,320
So if there's any bit rot, I can also

715
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,600
recover any data that's become corrupt over time.

716
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,480
Now, explain to me, because I feel

717
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,220
like I'm missing one piece, is I understand that MergerFS

718
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,440
is also part of this.

719
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,640
And I know MergerFS is a union file system,

720
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,000
but I'm not clear how that's fitting in with your setup.

721
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,120
Right, OK.

722
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,880
Well, I'll get to that in just one moment,

723
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,600
because there's one other important feature of SnapRaid.

724
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,140
You have to run the sync command manually

725
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,960
to rebuild your parity, unlike, say, something like ZFS,

726
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,920
where that's happening on the fly.

727
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,440
And this is where SnapRaid now has backup kind of functions.

728
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,840
So in the intervening periods where I haven't run a sync,

729
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,480
if I delete files or overwrite files I didn't mean to,

730
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,480
I can now go onto my volume, and I can say SnapRaid fix,

731
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,200
and I can undelete the files and recover them

732
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,600
from the parity that I have.

733
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,520
So in the times between the syncs being run,

734
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:16,960
it operates as a backup tool, and you can pull files out

735
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,720
of the backup.

736
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,000
That could be nice in a small office environment, too.

737
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,960
Right, yeah, or at home, when if I do a sync every week,

738
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,280
I've got a week's grace that I may have deleted something

739
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,920
accidentally, and I can go and recover it

740
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,720
without having to go to actual backups.

741
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:37,680
So because now the files are spread across three disks,

742
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,520
that's a bit inconvenient, because now you

743
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,020
have to know that this disk has got these files in it,

744
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,720
and this disk has got these files in it,

745
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,480
and this disk has got these files in it.

746
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,280
So then I've installed some software called MergerFS,

747
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:59,040
and that uses Fuse, and it uses wildcards in your FS tab.

748
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,720
So you can say, go and mount all of my HDD star

749
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,200
under slash media slash MergerFS.

750
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,200
And now, under that directory, I have a union

751
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,680
of those three disks presented.

752
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:19,480
And MergerFS then has some strategies about how files,

753
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,800
if you say, copy a file to the union,

754
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,740
how it decides where to place those files.

755
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,880
So I've got it in a mode where it will say,

756
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,700
does the directory, the endpoint directory

757
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,200
that I'm being asked to put this file in already exist?

758
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,560
If it does, put it on the disk that already

759
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,840
has that directory on it.

760
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,520
Or you can say, just scatter them willy nilly.

761
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,080
There's a whole different bunch of right strategies

762
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,120
you can use there.

763
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,440
But because I want to have disks generally,

764
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,720
only one disk spinning at a time,

765
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,460
I have it say, where does this data already exist?

766
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,760
Let's write it there.

767
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,460
And then I've got a configuration option

768
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,560
that says, and if there is not enough space

769
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,040
on that actual disk, then fail over

770
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,840
to the disk that has the most available space

771
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,800
and start writing those files there.

772
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,560
And now, how does the system respond

773
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,920
if you were, say, to slot in a couple of new drives

774
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:16,180
or put in one that's maybe six terabytes and another that's

775
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,080
two terabytes?

776
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,960
Right.

777
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,200
So the only thing you have to do is make sure

778
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,560
that the drive you're using for parity

779
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,840
is at least as big as the largest drive

780
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,200
that you're using for data.

781
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,120
Is there a migration?

782
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,960
Can you move parity drives?

783
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,120
You can now spread across, spread the parity

784
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,280
across multiple drives.

785
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,080
So you could spread it out, and then you

786
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,280
could reclaim that parity drive as one of your storage drives.

787
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,200
Yes.

788
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,000
Exactly so.

789
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,040
Yes, yes.

790
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,280
And let's imagine I have this terrible situation where

791
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,720
two disks fail, and I've only got one parity drive.

792
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,840
So I can't recover the whole array.

793
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,940
But the two disks that I have left,

794
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,840
because they're just file systems,

795
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,720
I have that data on those disks.

796
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,640
There's no special file system or RAID mechanism behind that.

797
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,960
That data is just accessible to me.

798
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,000
I can just plug that into an external USB adapter

799
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,240
and just suck that data off.

800
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,960
So it's extended for or whatever.

801
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,120
Yeah, exactly so.

802
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,120
Yeah.

803
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,020
But yes, if you want to add another drive,

804
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,600
you just plug the disk in.

805
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,080
You add, you format it, you mount it somewhere,

806
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,320
and then you put in the Snap RAID configuration.

807
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,720
Hard disk 5 is in this location, and that's it.

808
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,240
It's very, very simple.

809
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,280
That does sound simple.

810
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,200
And it's surprisingly fast as well.

811
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,200
So again, because this is home stuff,

812
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,400
I have these arrays hooked up over USB 3 even.

813
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,160
Right, because you're not even looking

814
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,480
for super high performance.

815
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,640
You're looking for storage.

816
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,480
Yeah, but even over USB 3, I'm pushing 170 megabytes

817
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,400
a second across the array.

818
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,960
So not too shabby.

819
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,600
No, what kind of hardware is that?

820
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,400
It's their ICDock Black Vortex enclosures

821
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,640
connected over just regular USB 3 to a NUC.

822
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,840
Is it like an i7 machine, or is it a NUC?

823
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,120
It's a NUC with a mobile chip, a mobile i7.

824
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,720
So it's a quad core mobile i7.

825
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,920
That sounds like a perfect home server for what you're going for.

826
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,160
That's a great setup.

827
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,560
Well, that piques my interest.

828
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,760
Wimpy, thank you for sharing with the class.

829
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,640
And we'll have links to the projects

830
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,920
that Wimpy talked about with their documentation

831
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,160
in the show notes, linuxunplugged.com

832
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,560
slash 277.

833
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,320
And he also went into some detail in the Ubuntu podcast.

834
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,760
So go check that out.

835
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,200
And I am definitely looking at SnapRate.

836
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,920
I wanted to mention for anybody that's

837
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,600
listening the week that this comes out,

838
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,780
or if you're listening live right now,

839
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,360
I don't exactly know what happened.

840
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,040
But Linux Academy decided to extend the $2.99 per year

841
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,960
deal, which makes it $24 a month to get Linux Academy for five

842
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,840
more days as we record this.

843
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:56,280
I think on Cyber Monday, the sign-up page

844
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,040
went down or something because of everybody

845
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,160
trying to get the deal.

846
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,240
So they're like, all right, well.

847
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,720
And it was only like, I mean, they freaked out

848
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,520
because it was like 20 minutes, right?

849
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,000
It wasn't like a hoot.

850
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,800
But they're like, we're going to extend it for five more days.

851
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,640
I think that's what happened.

852
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,600
But it's a great deal.

853
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,040
And if you didn't jump on it, you're saving 33%.

854
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,840
And the reason I mentioned that is because they obviously

855
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,360
don't pay us.

856
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:14,980
Well, I mean, they pay us.

857
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:16,600
But they don't ask me to do these ads.

858
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,320
But I know what they have in the works.

859
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,360
So if you get it at $24 a month, that's

860
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,800
going to be worth it for a long time

861
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
because it stays at that price.

862
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,560
Lock it in.

863
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,840
You can lock it in.

864
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,760
Well, the big news this week really

865
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,240
is that the Fedora project is considering canceling,

866
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,240
or maybe you should say significantly delaying,

867
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,080
the release of Fedora 31.

868
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,360
So following the release of Fedora 30 in May,

869
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,920
the project is considering essentially hitting

870
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:50,540
the pause button for a year, skipping the traditional 31

871
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,920
release cycle, and working on themselves,

872
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,440
retooling and those kinds of things.

873
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,360
It's one of those that they've gone through in the past

874
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,920
when they began doing additions.

875
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,120
And it's one that comes at a kind of precarious time.

876
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,840
So we thought the best route to go

877
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,520
would be to get it from the horse's mouth, as they say,

878
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,080
and bring the project lead on the show

879
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,800
and chat with Matthew Miller.

880
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,280
Matthew, welcome back to the show.

881
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,560
And thanks for joining us on the Unplugged program.

882
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,440
Hi, Chris.

883
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,160
Glad to be here.

884
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,760
Well, we are glad to have you on a day

885
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,560
where we're trying to parse the news that it sounds like there

886
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,960
is a proposal in the works to essentially bump the 31

887
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,800
release, hang out on 30 for a while,

888
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,480
while the back end, I guess infrastructure really,

889
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,640
of the Fedora project is retooled.

890
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,480
Can you explain really what is being proposed?

891
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,440
That's my understanding.

892
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,760
But what's going on from your actual horse's mouth words?

893
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,400
Yeah, that's basically it.

894
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,720
And I don't know if you remember back to five years ago,

895
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,200
we actually did this one time before.

896
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,920
And they worked out OK.

897
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,200
A lot of the problem is we have a six-month release cycle.

898
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,160
And a lot of the people who work on our Fedora infrastructure

899
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,440
also are people who are engaged in the business of getting

900
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,200
that release out the door, the release

901
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,000
engineering, the infrastructure stuff that

902
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,520
makes the bits ship, QA and QA tooling and things like that.

903
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,480
And so as we're going on that rapid cycle,

904
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,680
a lot of technical debt accumulates.

905
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,480
We get a lot of Band-Aids put on things that are problems

906
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,400
and not enough time to fix it.

907
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,800
And then just because this is Fedora 30

908
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,640
we're talking about working on now,

909
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,240
there's been a lot of releases.

910
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,720
And a lot of our tools have grown organically

911
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,240
in the last 15 years.

912
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,320
And so some of the things are scripts

913
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,040
that have another script that they run.

914
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,720
And that script does some other things.

915
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,760
So there's a lot of redundancy.

916
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,120
And performance isn't so good.

917
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,640
So specifically one of the things that's a problem,

918
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,200
when we do a compose, that basically

919
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,280
takes all the software in Fedora.

920
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,000
The packages are already built. But they're put together

921
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,640
into one tree and then put into the different images

922
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,760
for you making Fedora server, for making for a workstation,

923
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,560
and then for making all of our various spins, KDE desktop,

924
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,880
the Python lab, the Docker image, all those things.

925
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,160
That's the compose.

926
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,960
And that's one big monolithic process.

927
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:24,200
And we were up to that taking something like 18 hours to run.

928
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,560
Although there's been some improvements in that.

929
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,720
But so now it's down to like 12.

930
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
But 12 is a very long time.

931
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,400
So that means from making a change

932
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,080
to getting it actually to a place

933
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,520
where our QA can test it takes a day.

934
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,360
And so as we're putting out a release,

935
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,800
that can get very frustrating.

936
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,080
Because let's say we want to sign off

937
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,880
on a release on Thursday.

938
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,920
Well, in order for QA to have time,

939
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,880
that release needs to be ready on Wednesday morning,

940
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,520
which means it needs to be kicked off on Tuesday, which

941
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,960
means we basically have, during that whole last week,

942
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,480
two chances, Monday and Tuesday, to get changes in,

943
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,120
which leads to 20 changes or 50 changes being put in all

944
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,760
at once, which is not very scientific.

945
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,000
And if something messes up, too bad,

946
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,160
we have to delay for a week.

947
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,720
So getting that compose time down,

948
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,360
I think the proposal aims for an hour,

949
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,840
which is nicely ambitious.

950
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,240
But even getting it down to four hours,

951
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,480
so during one normal workday, you could start off a compose.

952
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
And then if something goes wrong,

953
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,720
do another one would be a radical improvement.

954
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,200
So that's one of the things.

955
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,120
But there are a lot of things in our processes

956
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,360
that are like that, where it seems

957
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,080
like taking some time to look at it

958
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,720
and focus on actually improving the tooling and processes

959
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,600
would be worthwhile.

960
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,880
Now, I noted, too, in the pretty well-written problem statement

961
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
that's on the Wiki, that it says,

962
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,320
currently Fedora can't scale for more community ownership

963
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,560
of the things we release.

964
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,240
Only a few people can build and push our releases.

965
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,760
Is that also a team retooling problem there?

966
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,360
To me, when I read that, it sounds

967
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,360
like perhaps the Fedora project is seeking

968
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,000
to be able to independently release

969
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,640
bits of software they cannot currently independently

970
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,520
release.

971
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,040
Yeah, and some of it's a process thing.

972
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,280
Some of it's actually tooling, because the tooling

973
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,560
to do this literally has no permission structure.

974
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:28,000
So it's a, you can build everything

975
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,240
or you can build nothing.

976
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,800
And so having the tooling being a little bit smarter

977
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,520
about who can do what, not because we don't trust people,

978
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,600
but just so you don't accidentally rebuild KDE when

979
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,520
you went to rebuild XFCE and then it caused trouble.

980
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:46,040
It doesn't have that fine grain thing.

981
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,440
And again, because it's all one big compose,

982
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,040
basically it's just a, you could trigger the compose,

983
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,400
but you couldn't say build XFCE.

984
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,560
And that's one of the things we actually, like our XFCE spin,

985
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,200
didn't get built properly for the final release

986
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,720
for Fedora 29, which was bad, because we've

987
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,600
got a lot of people who love XFCE,

988
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,240
and we want that, even though that's not our main offering,

989
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,200
we want that to be successful for people.

990
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,280
I don't know what's the matter with them,

991
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,280
but they just stick to it.

992
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,200
They sure do.

993
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Yeah, you like your interface as it is.

994
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,800
It's very personal, so it's important for people to have it.

995
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,840
There's really only one XFCE user out there.

996
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,720
I'm giving a hard time, and he knows who he is.

997
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,760
Yeah, that's right.

998
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,000
Actually, some of the Fedora infrastructure team

999
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,720
actually have XFCE users, so it was close to home.

1000
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,440
I bet.

1001
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,280
I bet.

1002
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,200
Well, OK, so speaking of XFCE and other sort

1003
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,600
of user-facing things, what does all this internal

1004
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:45,760
infrastructure process work mean for user-facing features?

1005
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,120
Fedora's doing a lot of stuff.

1006
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,480
In particular, I'm thinking of things like Silverblue.

1007
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,780
Does that mean these are going to be delayed,

1008
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,320
or will that work continue side by side?

1009
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:57,240
Yeah, no, that's a hard thing with this.

1010
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,800
And yeah, I think we've done a really good job of getting

1011
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,120
onto our six-month cadence and making that fire successfully.

1012
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,040
So I actually have a little bit of skepticism

1013
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,600
about this plan of stopping things.

1014
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,440
So I want to make sure that if we do this,

1015
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,120
we have a good plan in place for making sure

1016
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,160
that we actually succeed at the things we want to fix,

1017
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,600
and then also that we don't break things

1018
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,440
for people who have become accustomed to

1019
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,480
and happy with having fast releases and good upgrades.

1020
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,000
I mean, that seems like a key point.

1021
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,360
If you're going to take this break,

1022
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,640
it's really got to be worth it.

1023
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,140
Because I look at the market right now,

1024
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,200
and I see there's going to be some uncertainty

1025
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,440
around the future of Fedora, misplaced or not.

1026
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,400
But also, really, on the desktop side,

1027
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,440
that could potentially mean skipping a GNOME release

1028
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,300
cycle, which is kind of like a hard time

1029
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,960
to miss a GNOME release cycle right now,

1030
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,360
because so many great fixes are landing in GNOME.

1031
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,560
Yeah.

1032
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,000
And we did do this with the Fedora 20 release.

1033
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:02,280
And I think we put GNOME as a copper to update to,

1034
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,560
mixed results there.

1035
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,440
We could do something like that again.

1036
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,160
Flat packs.

1037
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,200
Yeah, put all of GNOME in a flat pack.

1038
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,400
You watch, it's going to happen.

1039
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,520
One of the things we have now that we didn't

1040
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,200
is this modularity system, which lets

1041
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,160
us have two different versions of things.

1042
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,480
So one idea is to make a GNOME module

1043
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,720
so users could opt in to the newer version

1044
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,840
using modularity.

1045
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,240
That seems brilliant, actually.

1046
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,040
Yeah.

1047
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,120
And that's kind of what modularity was made for.

1048
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,080
So it's also a good test for, hey,

1049
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,280
can modularity do something major like this?

1050
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Let's make sure it can.

1051
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,920
And then for something like Silverblue,

1052
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,240
which is more on the experimental side,

1053
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,120
the Silverblue OS tree compose could just

1054
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,440
pick the newer module.

1055
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,760
So Silverblue could have the newer version of things.

1056
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,080
So we could have a more conservative and a more

1057
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,760
aggressive release.

1058
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,200
And then the idea would be to maintain the 30

1059
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,760
packages for that whole year.

1060
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,160
So I mean, in some ways, perhaps as a server user,

1061
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,040
Fedora 30 could be a great release

1062
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,880
because it's going to be, in some ways,

1063
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,600
an extra long supported version of Fedora.

1064
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,480
Is that true?

1065
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,440
Yeah, if this proposal goes through.

1066
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,920
And yeah, we actually see that in our stats

1067
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,440
for the Fedora 19 and 20 releases, which ended up

1068
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,160
having a longer cycle because of this.

1069
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,040
Those were very, very popular releases

1070
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,160
and still continue to, you know, there's

1071
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,000
a long tail of people who should upgrade but never have,

1072
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,720
who are still using those releases.

1073
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,760
And I think that extra year definitely helped with that.

1074
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,440
Interesting.

1075
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,040
So yeah, that's a side effect as well.

1076
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,480
Yeah, OK, that makes sense.

1077
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,800
One thing that stood out to me in some of the top level

1078
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,080
proposals here is defining a base platform.

1079
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,680
And maybe this is something Red Hat wants to see some focus on,

1080
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,120
but we were curious, what does that mean?

1081
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,800
Yeah, so I'll talk about it from a Red Hat hat on

1082
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,360
for a little bit here.

1083
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,800
Just slightly, if you looked at the rel8 beta at all,

1084
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,960
one of the things that Red Hat did

1085
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,800
is split into a base OS and an app stream

1086
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,920
where they can have different life cycles.

1087
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,640
And things are different in Fedora,

1088
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,560
but the basic concept kind of is helpful.

1089
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,120
One of the things in Fedora, I don't

1090
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,080
know if you followed all Fedora's history,

1091
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,400
but one of the important good moves

1092
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,040
was merging together Fedora Core, which

1093
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,440
came from Red Hat Linux, and Fedora Extras,

1094
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,080
which was kind of the community thing,

1095
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,120
into one big community project.

1096
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,560
That was great and really good for Fedora

1097
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,080
and helped Fedora grow and become something

1098
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,800
that was really a whole community distribution

1099
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,360
rather than something that was just a corporate thing

1100
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,000
that the community could build stuff on the fringes.

1101
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,440
So that was great.

1102
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,360
But one of the outcomes of that is

1103
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,520
that Fedora is one gigantic repository

1104
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:47,560
of undifferentiated packages, where some little toy thing

1105
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,320
that I am interested in playing with is important to me.

1106
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,800
But if it breaks, like five users will care,

1107
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,520
and I'm one of them.

1108
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,920
That is undifferentiated from something

1109
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,280
like glibc in the distribution, or gnome,

1110
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:06,240
or the things that if it breaks, a lot of people

1111
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,400
will have their systems not work.

1112
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,880
And I've been talking about this since before

1113
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,080
as Fedora project leader with the Fedora rings idea,

1114
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,360
basically making different policy levels for some

1115
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,200
of our pack.

1116
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,840
All of our packages are important,

1117
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,600
but some of them kind of need a focus in QA.

1118
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,000
And we've never had a defined set of,

1119
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,480
we've got some that are like critical path,

1120
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,240
but it's kind of a loose definition

1121
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,880
of getting up to boot.

1122
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,400
But some packages that we basically

1123
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,680
say this is a QA set of packages together

1124
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,040
that maybe if we're looking at doing a longer term maintenance

1125
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,760
kind of situation, these are the ones we'd focus on.

1126
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,360
If we want to make sure QA focuses on these things.

1127
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,760
So it's narrowing down from our whatever 15,000 package

1128
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,520
set to something like 1,000 packages

1129
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,640
that we can really focus on polish on,

1130
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,840
I think is a good idea.

1131
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,840
That strikes me, too, that it might provoke

1132
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:04,600
a few deeper conversations within the project about what's

1133
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,920
our focus and what does it mean to ship this set of packages

1134
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,760
and things like that.

1135
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,440
So that could be a really fascinating event to watch.

1136
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,320
Yeah.

1137
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:16,600
And I think one of the things, focus is definitely important.

1138
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,520
We want to make it so that the core resources of the project

1139
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:25,200
are focused on this enabling core package set

1140
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,200
and that people who do have those other cares can focus

1141
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:33,600
on their part of it, not have to worry about the base part

1142
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,760
falling apart on them, but they can also

1143
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,760
focus their energy on the thing they care about

1144
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,240
and develop solutions on top of that and give that to users.

1145
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,640
So we should keep in mind that at this stage,

1146
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,400
as we record this episode, this taking some time

1147
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,360
to refocus on the tools is in most part

1148
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,920
just a proposal at this stage.

1149
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,040
So what happens next?

1150
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,960
What process does this proposal go through to either become

1151
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,720
reality or get rejected?

1152
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,360
Yeah, so one of the key things here

1153
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,640
is there's not secret room cabals

1154
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,400
in Fedora deciding things.

1155
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,560
So a lot of these things, you're seeing the process in action.

1156
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,720
So when somebody proposes it, that means they had in.

1157
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:19,160
This is an idea that several people have worked on.

1158
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:21,440
One of the things we have in Fedora

1159
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,720
is the idea of an objective.

1160
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,200
And so an objective is something that the Fedora Council,

1161
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,000
our leadership body, has said, this

1162
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,040
is an area we think the project needs to focus on.

1163
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,840
So we have an objective around the Fedora lifecycle

1164
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:42,440
and the Fedora long-term maintenance possibilities.

1165
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:47,240
Fedora, if you go to fedoraproject.docs

1166
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,960
at fedoraproject.org and look under the project docs,

1167
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,280
I can provide an actual link for this.

1168
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,560
There's a section about our different objectives there.

1169
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,240
And you can find link to documentation.

1170
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:02,040
So this particular proposal came out of that objective

1171
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:05,640
because there are people looking at these problems.

1172
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,360
And so the general process is you

1173
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,960
have this community discussion.

1174
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,240
And then the Fedora Council will talk about it.

1175
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:13,920
And the Fedora Council will probably

1176
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:20,160
give a non-technical heads up, yes or no, we like this idea.

1177
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,240
And the Fedora Council consists of me, community action

1178
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,040
and impact coordinator Brian Exelbeer,

1179
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,120
some elected people from the community,

1180
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,520
and then also people selected by different committees

1181
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,400
to be on the council.

1182
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,640
And so it kind of gives an overview of the whole.

1183
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,760
We try to take the input from the whole project

1184
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,640
and reflect that into a definitive decision.

1185
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,200
And then also because this is an engineering decision,

1186
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,800
the engineering committee will probably also want

1187
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,880
to skip a yes or no to this.

1188
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,360
So that's basically the processes we'll go through.

1189
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,840
It'll be interesting to watch that unfold.

1190
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,520
And how do you feel about it personally?

1191
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,240
I know as somebody who sits atop of this project

1192
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,560
and has been watching it now for I think what is a record

1193
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,520
breaking run, what do you think?

1194
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,120
Is this a necessary delay?

1195
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,080
Is this something that's sort of like taking your medicine?

1196
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,080
Yeah, so like I said before, I've

1197
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,320
got mixed feelings about it.

1198
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,880
I feel really good that we've gotten ourselves

1199
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,080
onto a well-firing Mother's Day Halloween release cadence, which

1200
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:25,160
has always been our goal.

1201
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:27,400
But we've sometimes slipped off of that.

1202
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,360
Every now and then.

1203
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:28,880
You're right.

1204
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:34,720
So we hit our target schedule a couple times in a row now.

1205
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,000
That's awesome.

1206
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,600
So just when we've got that going,

1207
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,360
seems like maybe not the best time to mess it up.

1208
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:42,120
The joke almost makes itself at this point.

1209
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:42,840
I'm not making it.

1210
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,440
I'm just saying.

1211
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,640
Yeah, exactly.

1212
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,480
So I've got some skepticism about it.

1213
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,960
On the other hand, I think it did work for us

1214
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,640
when we did that Fedora 20 release.

1215
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,280
And I think the problems are real.

1216
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,040
The compose problem has been something

1217
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,000
that's been frustrating to me for a while.

1218
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,800
So spending some time to tackle it seems worthwhile.

1219
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,280
But I also do want to make sure that we keep the concerns.

1220
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,880
The upstream GNOME community is concerned.

1221
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,080
I'm proud of Fedora as a premier GNOME distribution.

1222
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:14,360
I want to keep that.

1223
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,480
Sure.

1224
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:19,080
And I want to make sure that people who are packagers who

1225
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,440
aren't involved in all of the day-to-day release stuff

1226
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,280
are able to keep getting their work to users

1227
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,200
and don't feel like they're blocked for a year

1228
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,000
from getting the things they're worked on out to people.

1229
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,240
So yeah, it's a balance.

1230
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,400
Yeah, it sounds like it.

1231
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,320
Well, maybe we can check in at some point.

1232
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,280
Yeah, I'd love to.

1233
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,880
I have been following the project

1234
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,000
with more and more interest.

1235
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,720
He is at Matt DM on Twitter.

1236
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,200
And we will have links to the problem documents

1237
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,880
they have in the wiki, as well as the mailing list and the docs

1238
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,840
that Matthew just mentioned there.

1239
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,160
Is there anywhere else you want to send folks before we run?

1240
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,160
Getfedora.org is always a great place

1241
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,520
to check out if you don't have Fedora already installed.

1242
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,040
Yeah, do it.

1243
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:01,720
Good answer.

1244
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,440
Good answer, man.

1245
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,480
Matthew, thank you for coming on the show.

1246
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,760
One of the things he touched on there that is a little more

1247
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,040
obvious if you follow the links in our show notes

1248
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:11,840
is this is the result of a larger objective they

1249
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,440
set a while ago as a project.

1250
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,080
And this is how they, as a project,

1251
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,720
think they can achieve the objective

1252
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,280
that they set for themselves.

1253
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,560
And it's kind of in a broader context.

1254
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,760
I know every project struggles with these tooling issues

1255
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,520
sometimes.

1256
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,980
But at the same time, you're like,

1257
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:31,040
this is such a precious time to take off because.

1258
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,320
Everyone else is moving fast.

1259
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,960
There's been lots of good releases.

1260
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,320
Yeah, and there's a lot of good fixes coming down the pipe

1261
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,200
to GNOME that people are going to want.

1262
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,520
So I think they're going to have to come up with a way

1263
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,520
to get fresh GNOME to Fedora users.

1264
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,320
At least I would think.

1265
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,280
Otherwise, people might get a wandering eye

1266
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,800
and go to a distribution that's maybe shipping patches

1267
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:51,400
with performance fixes or something.

1268
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,680
But we'll see.

1269
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,400
You know, we have been talking about a predictions episode.

1270
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,740
And we actually nailed down a date and time.

1271
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,680
Oh, and by the way, again, thank you

1272
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,680
to Matthew for coming on the show.

1273
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,000
No kidding.

1274
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,240
It's really nice to just get it from him.

1275
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,400
We don't have to speculate and just understand

1276
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,960
it's a proposal right now.

1277
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,800
But yeah, so moving on, we will be recording

1278
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,920
a special edition of the Unplugged.

1279
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,080
Our special edition of the Unplugged program.

1280
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:14,480
Do you remember?

1281
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:15,080
Oh, yeah.

1282
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,480
I do remember what the dates are.

1283
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,080
So we'll be doing a predictions episode.

1284
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:24,600
And I kind of feel like maybe we should do the predictions

1285
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,160
episode while it's still 2018.

1286
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:27,200
That seems appropriate.

1287
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,100
Yeah, I agree.

1288
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:31,200
So instead of doing, see, Linux Unplugged

1289
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,000
gets the holiday hammer.

1290
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,040
It is on Christmas Day and New Year's Day, the 25th

1291
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:36,820
and the 1st.

1292
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:38,960
So it's both our live days.

1293
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,460
So what we're going to do, and I know

1294
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,040
this is difficult for some of you,

1295
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,040
but I'm hoping maybe it'll open up for others,

1296
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,400
is we're just going to move the show one day.

1297
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,120
So it'll be on Wednesday for those weeks.

1298
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,920
So it'll be the day after Christmas

1299
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:53,040
and it'll be the day after New Year's, so the 26th

1300
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,800
and the 2nd.

1301
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,000
Same time, just move it one day.

1302
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,920
So on the 26th, we're going to do our predictions for 2019.

1303
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,960
And if you really have a great prediction

1304
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,000
and you have good audio, I invite

1305
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,960
you to record a clip and then tweet it to me.

1306
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,800
And I will try to include it in the show.

1307
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,640
If you can't make it.

1308
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,560
But otherwise, our Mumble Room will be open.

1309
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,720
You can be here as part of our great virtual council

1310
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,960
and make your predictions and pontifications for 2019.

1311
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,400
And then you will have world fame, if you nail it,

1312
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,280
because we will try to review them the following year

1313
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,640
to see how we all did.

1314
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,060
So that'll be on the 26th.

1315
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,600
And then on the 2nd, maybe if you're still in party mode,

1316
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,440
join us for the Mumble Room extravaganza,

1317
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,240
where we will do what we want to see.

1318
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,000
Wishes, reviews of what happened.

1319
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Yeah, you can get a little hopeful.

1320
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,760
You don't have to be realistic in this here more fun episode.

1321
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,160
That one's a little more low-key laid back.

1322
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,600
You're not going to get reviewed.

1323
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,880
And we're going to be also doing look back

1324
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:51,360
at some of our favorite stories and be doing the,

1325
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:56,120
if I had a magic wand and I could make project XYZ do ABC,

1326
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,080
I would do it.

1327
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,640
And then we consider and go, that's a great idea,

1328
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,520
because it would mean more users come on board.

1329
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,240
It's a fun thing to do.

1330
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,160
So those will be just moving one day from our regularly

1331
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,960
bat time on our, but obviously on the same bat channel,

1332
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:10,800
right?

1333
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,640
Is that the message I wanted to convey?

1334
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,240
Yeah, there's a lot of bats involved.

1335
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:14,740
So if you're scared of bats, watch out.

1336
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:15,800
But otherwise, just come.

1337
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,640
It's a great time.

1338
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,480
You're probably going to get sick of your family anyway,

1339
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,440
or maybe you're all by yourself

1340
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,800
and we'll be your family for a day.

1341
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,000
Our plan is to try to have something for you to listen to

1342
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,520
over the holidays, because it's nice when,

1343
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,640
not every, we get like the lowest downloads ever,

1344
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,360
but it's like for me, like if I'm ever in a situation

1345
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,580
where it's like all of a sudden I have like a bunch of time

1346
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,320
in the car because I'm traveling for the holiday

1347
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,360
or like sometimes I have like these weird gaps

1348
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,200
in my schedule where it's like been rush, rush, rush, rush,

1349
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,080
rush for the holiday.

1350
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,620
And then all of a sudden I find myself without kids,

1351
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,600
without my significant others,

1352
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:47,360
like I got half a day to burn.

1353
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,000
And then when nobody's releasing stuff,

1354
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:49,840
it's kind of a bummer.

1355
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,440
So we thought let's try to stick with it this year

1356
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,900
and we'll just bump the schedule a bit.

1357
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,440
So it'll be out a day later those weeks,

1358
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,640
but there will be a show.

1359
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,800
And if you go to linuxunplugged.com slash subscribe,

1360
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,720
you can just grab the episode automatically

1361
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:04,440
and don't have to worry about it.

1362
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,040
You can also go to Jupiterbroadcasting.com

1363
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,920
and check out the calendar if you forget

1364
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,120
just when that's happening.

1365
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,200
Well, really quickly, one last item on the agenda,

1366
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,800
it's that Dropbox quote unquote hack I've been using.

1367
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,320
I mean, ultimately, this is a temporary fix.

1368
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,800
In fact, big disclaimer here,

1369
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,400
I mean, this could potentially even lead to data loss.

1370
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,680
So don't do what Chris does, okay?

1371
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,520
Is that fair?

1372
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,480
Can we make that disclaimer?

1373
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:23,700
Don't do as Chris does.

1374
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:27,480
But I'm using the Dropbox file system fix project.

1375
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,760
And the thing I like about this is it lets you run Dropbox

1376
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,080
and any damn encryption or any damn file system you please.

1377
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:35,520
And I think that's what's important.

1378
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,320
It essentially fixes the file system detection

1379
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,240
in the Linux client to restore the sync capability.

1380
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,600
So bear in mind, it's doing some trickery here.

1381
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,040
And if they introduce something in the future

1382
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,560
to the Dropbox client, you could have some problems.

1383
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:52,080
Oh, yeah, as you might suspect, this is an LD preload trick.

1384
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,600
So you have to run make, you got to build yourself

1385
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,080
a little.so from the included C,

1386
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,080
and then it provides a separate Python script

1387
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,800
that will start Dropbox with the custom library.

1388
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,680
So it's making ext4 assumptions

1389
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,120
that aren't just what file system is this,

1390
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,080
there could be issues,

1391
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,760
but so far, it sounds like it's working for you.

1392
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,720
Yeah, it's been fine.

1393
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,000
And I did have to build it.

1394
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,160
And then I had to disable Dropbox from starting at startup.

1395
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,780
And then I essentially just created a new desktop launcher

1396
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,360
and added that to my startup items.

1397
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,960
So the Python script has kicked off that way.

1398
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,800
It's fine.

1399
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,620
It's been working good.

1400
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,640
It's been going for about half a week,

1401
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,720
survived a couple of reboots just fine.

1402
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,040
So I'll do this as I transition off.

1403
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,120
I might do what Wimpy did

1404
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,920
and might toss it on a headless box somewhere.

1405
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,400
And that'll be how I begin the transition to something else.

1406
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,120
A hacky solution to a problem we should never have had.

1407
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,360
Yeah, I've sent them my feedback.

1408
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:40,000
They know how I feel, Wes.

1409
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,440
So also a little plug here for the TechSnap show,

1410
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,280
the TechSnap.Systems, Wes Payne,

1411
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,360
and myself are doing a show over there

1412
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,920
that if you're in the IT field,

1413
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,000
if you are a sysadmin,

1414
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,340
if you work on servers or on the cloud

1415
00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:54,780
and want somebody to commiserate with,

1416
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:59,080
hear about particular topics like WireGuard, eBPF,

1417
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:00,240
what's some other things we've done recently?

1418
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,000
Boy, we did, we had a great breakdown of the whole

1419
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,600
Spectre meltdown stuff when that came out.

1420
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,400
The show is just famous for doing the deep dives.

1421
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,180
And we're gearing it up to do even more.

1422
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:09,760
We'll have more details about that soon.

1423
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,200
So check out TechSnap.Systems

1424
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,920
because there's a lot of good stuff going on over there

1425
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,200
and even more coming.

1426
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,880
And then go check out the Gentleman Show,

1427
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,360
Ubuntu podcast, my favorite show

1428
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,480
that's not a Jupiter broadcasting show

1429
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,720
that's not late night Linux.

1430
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:23,560
Because I love all the-

1431
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,400
Careful, man, careful, man.

1432
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,560
I know, I have to be really careful.

1433
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,560
It's a little awkward, but I try.

1434
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,720
All of our brothers in arms.

1435
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,800
Go check that out at UbuntuPodcast.org

1436
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,560
and go check out Late Night Linux too

1437
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,160
because they're doing some great work over there.

1438
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,260
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode.

1439
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,520
You are always welcome to join us live,

1440
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,400
hang out in that mumble room, chat with Wes and I.

1441
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,600
Oh, please do.

1442
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,600
We miss you already.

1443
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,160
You get a little pre-show and you get a little post-show

1444
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,680
in the released version, but there's probably 30 times more

1445
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,520
than what actually gets released.

1446
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,400
And to be honest, we say all the best things

1447
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,600
when we're not in the release.

1448
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,600
Especially when I'm cursing about YouTube.

1449
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,920
Oh, it gets me so fired up.

1450
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,520
Anyways, that's all for this week.

1451
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,480
Check out all our links at linuxunplugged.com slash 277.

1452
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,560
I'm at Chris Elias.

1453
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,400
He's at Westpaint.

1454
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:06,320
Thank you for joining us.

1455
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,160
See you next Tuesday!

1456
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:28,160
I'm Chris Elias, and I'll see you next week.

1457
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:43,640
Hey, Unplugged Show.

1458
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,800
Oh, man.

1459
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,640
277.

1460
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,000
Rapidly approaching the 300.

1461
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,280
Oh, diggity-do.

1462
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:52,840
Wimpy, before you leave tonight, I have a problem

1463
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,640
and I want to know if you've experienced this.

1464
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,040
I think it might be because I went with the GPU dock.

1465
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,700
A little bit of real-time GPU dock follow-up.

1466
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,400
I've got a vertical monitor and a horizontal monitor

1467
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,540
at 2K resolution hooked up over DisplayPort,

1468
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,400
and ever since I've done that, my window performance

1469
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,160
has gone in the tank.

1470
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,040
Like, on my main laptop, the quote-unquote prime display,

1471
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:13,520
it's fine.

1472
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,440
It's butter smooth.

1473
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:17,400
But on the external monitors, it's choppy, it's laggy.

1474
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,160
Like, resizing Windows is jittery.

1475
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,280
Even my typing is sometimes stuttery.

1476
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:23,800
It's way worse than I expected.

1477
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,880
Have you had this problem?

1478
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,920
Is this a?

1479
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,000
I have not experienced that, no.

1480
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,520
Oh, it's got to be something with that multiple GPU

1481
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:31,880
setup then.

1482
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,880
I would think it's all using the NVIDIA

1483
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,800
because I can manage the panels with the NVIDIA Control Panel.

1484
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,340
So it's all going through the NVIDIA,

1485
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:40,480
and it should be able to handle three displays.

1486
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,960
Yeah, it should.

1487
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,240
I've only ever run two until recently, though.

1488
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,760
And obviously, the third display that I now have

1489
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,080
is a panel on the laptop.

1490
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,560
But no, I've not experienced that.

1491
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:56,400
I've only experienced that when I've moved a game off

1492
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,740
of the prime display into an IGP-powered display,

1493
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:02,440
and that's expected.

1494
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:07,480
But you've got one, and I also run both of mine landscape.

1495
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:10,640
I haven't done that mix of portrait and landscape.

1496
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:12,960
Yeah, and I've noticed 3D performance

1497
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,040
on the Prime main laptop display still seems perfectly fine.

1498
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:17,880
I can play a game and have those other displays

1499
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,920
with displaying stuff.

1500
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:21,040
And it's good enough.

1501
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,560
If I put things that's fairly static,

1502
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,960
like chats and even a YouTube video is fine.

1503
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,400
But if I want to resize a window or start typing it,

1504
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,120
sometimes just can't keep up.

1505
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,000
And I just don't understand what's going on.

1506
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,000
I've wondered if it's a plasma problem, even.

1507
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
But I doubt it.

1508
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,560
But I've heard that there's issues with Plasma and NVIDIA

1509
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,160
doing multiple monitors.

1510
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,960
I'm not going to switch to GNOME over this,

1511
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,880
because like I said, it's butter smooth on the main display.

1512
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,320
And again, I can't speak to anything other than Mate,

1513
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,600
because that's the only desktop that I've used.

1514
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:49,760
I think we want to try it, though.

1515
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,800
Tell you what, it has made me think about doing a live disk

1516
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,560
and just seeing, does this?

1517
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,320
You probably should.

1518
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,040
I mean, that way is just fine.

1519
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,000
I'm not switching.

1520
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:56,680
And then what do I do?

1521
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,320
Get frustrated?

1522
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,880
We can tweak it from there.

1523
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,120
I mean, for science's sake.

1524
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:01,080
I got to know.

1525
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:30,800
All right, thanks, Wes.
