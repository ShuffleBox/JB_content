WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.420
Hey look there's a picture of Popey. Oh, oh, he looks so happy surprise. I bet he smells good there, too

00:12.080 --> 00:17.400
What the hell are you using the laptop is that your phone Popey that you have hooked up to a keyboard ten times the size

00:17.400 --> 00:22.980
Of your phone. What is that? That was that was for him because he wanted a photo of a phone doing convergency stuff

00:22.980 --> 00:27.940
Oh

00:27.940 --> 00:35.220
I see I see I like the image text where the desktop was the phone is now says I love stroking the rich mahogany

00:35.220 --> 00:38.420
He blew his ex we ask you. Yeah, really

00:42.060 --> 00:46.900
What kind of that is a heck of a keyboard is there a lot of battery in that thing what's going on with that

00:47.780 --> 00:49.220
Why is it so big?

00:49.220 --> 00:55.700
The Logitech one. It's so you could you could sit a tablet in it and but it's only got a double-a and it lasts forever

00:55.780 --> 01:00.860
Like you lost a year. Well, you got one. It's brilliant. Oh, I love I have a oh, so it's not that thick

01:00.860 --> 01:05.140
So I have a Logitech this because that looks really thick in the picture and the Logitech I have is quite thick

01:05.140 --> 01:06.700
Oh, it's quite scary

01:06.700 --> 01:12.740
It's it's quite I think about a centimeter and a half thick Chris, which is about no furlongs or something

01:12.740 --> 01:17.660
Oh, yeah, some students and it's gonna work. It's got something like that

01:18.780 --> 01:22.660
Well, there you go. Either way you can tell that's a man who smells good. That's all I know

01:22.660 --> 01:26.960
Look at that USB cable to there. Look at that. That's a nice flat USB cable. I like that poppy

01:27.340 --> 01:31.620
Is that an internet phone there on the table to get an iPhone 4 or something there? What is that?

01:32.020 --> 01:34.580
There's no iPhones there. That's a BQ phone. Oh

01:35.320 --> 01:39.700
Okay. Okay. Well, they all kind of look alike these days. There's a bunch of phones. Yeah

01:39.700 --> 01:43.940
Yeah, I moved all of the none of them two phones out of the way, yeah, right

01:47.860 --> 01:55.100
Smart man, this is Linux unplugged episode 139 for April 5th 2016

01:55.100 --> 02:01.100
Oh

02:06.700 --> 02:14.180
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's celebrating Wes's upcoming birthday with a little birthday beer that he brought himself

02:15.580 --> 02:19.380
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Happy early birthday. Well, thank you

02:19.820 --> 02:21.820
Thanks for bringing your birthday beer

02:21.820 --> 02:25.780
Every time well coming up on today's episode of the unplugged program

02:25.780 --> 02:30.780
We're gonna do some updates on our favorite open source projects like we always do and here are some of those

02:31.020 --> 02:35.580
Directly from the horse's mouth then in the in the second half of the show if you will

02:35.660 --> 02:40.940
We're gonna try out a brand new distribution that promises to be beautiful elegant up-to-date fast

02:41.380 --> 02:45.180
Ultra customized and arch-based and it's not a district. You've probably heard of before

02:45.820 --> 02:50.940
Yes, kids. We're gonna look at this guy and tell you if it truly is something you want to take out on a rig like

02:50.940 --> 02:57.820
Yours, maybe Wes has sacrificed his own rig for you to find out standby. We'll tell you about that in a little bit after that. I

02:58.740 --> 03:02.140
Gotta admit it. I've been bit a little bit by the hype bug. I

03:02.940 --> 03:08.340
Want to play with virtual reality Wes, but in Linux land, there's not much going on

03:09.100 --> 03:13.380
Or is there is there a virtual reality desktop environment?

03:13.380 --> 03:16.700
Are there projects available for Linux users right now if you have virtual reality hardware?

03:16.700 --> 03:20.540
We're gonna take a look at the state of virtual reality under Linux and some of the things you could play on

03:20.540 --> 03:26.500
Right now and some of the interesting things that Wes and I discovered we were digging around about the state of VR under Linux, too

03:26.500 --> 03:29.220
Which is just kind of an interesting tidbits that we're gonna share plus

03:29.220 --> 03:33.620
We got a whole bunch of other things in today's show, but to top it all off

03:33.620 --> 03:37.180
I did mention we were drinking birthday beers Wes brought in something fun

03:37.540 --> 03:40.620
And I think the moment was gonna give us a hard time about this one

03:40.620 --> 03:44.980
So maybe we'll bring them in first before we really read this one time appropriate greetings mumble room

03:44.980 --> 03:49.660
Okay, now you gotta forgive me

03:53.380 --> 04:00.340
Okay, so you gotta forgive me cuz I I'm just I'm just gonna read it the way I see it crikey IPA an American Indian pale ale

04:01.180 --> 04:02.420
crikey

04:02.420 --> 04:09.460
IPA there you go. It's got an 89 beer score 90 from the community. It's an American IPA with a 6.8 alcohol by volume

04:10.300 --> 04:12.300
from Ruben's brews

04:12.540 --> 04:13.660
in

04:13.660 --> 04:20.980
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do. Can you guess where West? Do you know where it's brewed? Yes, I do. Go ahead Seattle, Washington. That's right

04:20.980 --> 04:26.140
It's a local brew ladies and gentlemen, so that's what we're drinking on today's episode that are was sexy. Yeah

04:26.140 --> 04:29.660
Yeah, you're right. That is it reminds me of rain here a little bit. That's what they're going for there

04:29.660 --> 04:31.860
So we have much to talk about today

04:33.580 --> 04:37.900
And there's a topic that we haven't floated before or we actually talk about this on the show

04:38.060 --> 04:42.400
This never come up on the show or is it only something we've talked about behind the scenes. I'm not sure

04:42.400 --> 04:44.680
I don't know because it's a big deal. It's very scary

04:45.940 --> 04:50.580
developers I've warned us over and over again about uncorrectable issues and

04:51.780 --> 04:53.780
Freedom problems. Yes

04:54.380 --> 04:59.240
Freedom no, no, I'm talking freedom problems negative in the freedom

04:59.980 --> 05:06.780
Dimension x86 is just getting a bad rap these days and another developer a long developer involved in core boot

05:06.780 --> 05:13.220
Libre boot is trying to call attention to the uncorrectable freedom and security issues on the x86 platform in a newly

05:14.140 --> 05:15.540
freshened

05:15.540 --> 05:17.540
post and a newly freshener

05:18.140 --> 05:25.780
attempt to get everybody to realize that post 2009 Intel systems and post 2013 AMD systems have massive flaws this is

05:26.900 --> 05:34.560
Mainly he argues in the fact that you have these management platforms the Intel management engine and the AMD security processor

05:34.560 --> 05:39.420
which require these binary only blobs that have major vulnerabilities in them and

05:39.940 --> 05:44.580
He also has issues with you if you EFI secure boot and he wants the community

05:44.580 --> 05:50.760
He is calling upon the community to make a move to arm power MIPS or even risk v processors

05:51.060 --> 05:55.260
He does then provide a summary that is not very exciting about making them. Yeah

05:56.860 --> 06:00.480
But it is a good summary of the estate of the available now, this is a topic

06:00.480 --> 06:05.300
I think that is particularly tickled your interest for a little while. What is it about the whole concept?

06:05.300 --> 06:10.260
Because you've you've been tracking the story since a couple of other reports recently that have said, you know

06:10.260 --> 06:12.240
We have to abandon x86 immediately

06:12.240 --> 06:17.540
We must move to another platform if security is and it is at all important to you

06:17.620 --> 06:22.380
What is it about this x86 story that keeps grabbing your attention? I just think it's not brought up that much

06:22.380 --> 06:23.780
I mean it comes up occasionally

06:23.780 --> 06:27.440
That's why it piques my interest when it does and you just don't hear very much about it

06:27.440 --> 06:30.880
Some of these features are really useful a lot of you know, especially enterprise management

06:30.880 --> 06:34.440
But in particular like I haven't heard very much about the AMD, you know

06:34.440 --> 06:38.960
The piper true true that's not very much and obviously we're not gonna all drop x86

06:38.960 --> 06:43.880
but as we see arm coming up, which again has some problems in some implementations, but I

06:44.480 --> 06:45.720
Don't know

06:45.720 --> 06:49.640
So daredevil in in the mumble room. I know you have some thoughts on this one share it with us, sir

06:50.240 --> 06:55.440
So I'd start with first of all, it's interesting that now there is a competitor

06:55.440 --> 06:59.480
There is trying to get into that realm that there is more research about the actual security of this

07:00.240 --> 07:02.720
Who should be financing this sick of this research?

07:02.720 --> 07:04.640
I mean not saying that the research is biased

07:04.640 --> 07:07.100
I'm saying that there is financing towards researching the issue

07:07.440 --> 07:12.760
Nothing says that there isn't the similar issues on the other platforms or their architectures

07:12.800 --> 07:16.160
So we need you know, it took us years until we realize those things

07:16.960 --> 07:18.960
and having that said

07:18.960 --> 07:26.160
The secure boot scenario is all about you start by opting for devices that actually allow you to control the keys

07:26.160 --> 07:33.860
You have in the device moving towards, you know the ability to then replace the thing when we have a free software implementation of it

07:34.480 --> 07:36.480
Since there's interest in the public

07:37.200 --> 07:38.600
Developments are up

07:38.600 --> 07:41.120
Someone something about the idea seems

07:41.120 --> 07:48.400
Fantastical to me like that. We would all make a huge migration like like a migration West like we all get in our

07:48.680 --> 07:50.680
our low-powered

07:51.600 --> 07:53.240
under-resourced arm

07:53.240 --> 07:56.160
Machines and we just all double down on arm or something like that

07:56.160 --> 07:57.080
I'm not saying it'd be armed

07:57.080 --> 08:03.380
But the idea of one day all of us just sort of mass migrating away from x86 is right now seems ludicrous

08:03.560 --> 08:05.840
But it could start to happen

08:05.840 --> 08:11.720
I think it will start to happen at least for once and maybe it is already there arm beats out the chips from

08:11.920 --> 08:14.880
2009 and 2013 if you are concerned about security, right?

08:14.880 --> 08:18.080
There's people who buy the older laptop so you can still get core boot on them. Oh boy

08:18.080 --> 08:23.480
That's not a good solution at all at some point that will cross with where arm is going in terms of capabilities, huh?

08:23.480 --> 08:27.360
Huh? So that's that's a start, but obviously that won't be the mass market

08:28.000 --> 08:33.360
But to be fair your primary computing device almost certainly is an arm device right now my phone

08:33.360 --> 08:38.400
Yeah, I don't know if I classify it yet as my primary, but it's definitely

08:39.880 --> 08:41.880
Damn close you

08:42.560 --> 08:49.000
I think you as in the average person who is considering this a ludicrous proposal might

08:49.600 --> 08:54.520
Actually then pull out. You know, they're they're probably even reading the article or arm device

08:54.520 --> 09:02.640
You know, you're probably right. I have been I have been shocked at how many people I now know that their primary computing device is

09:04.040 --> 09:08.880
Is is a is a phone I was I already showed that I already shared the story on Kota radio

09:08.880 --> 09:12.880
So I'll just make it super brief, but the community I live in a lot of people there

09:13.400 --> 09:17.960
Are just using their phones as their primary computer and we have like community events

09:17.960 --> 09:23.440
You know, we're all like we had we had a Thanksgiving event. We had an Easter event and a Christmas of any is adorable and

09:23.440 --> 09:25.440
It when we get together

09:27.200 --> 09:29.200
It is interesting how

09:29.440 --> 09:34.880
Technically they are a very aware that they could like it's not like they don't have a computer because they are scared of them

09:34.880 --> 09:36.360
They have them at work

09:36.360 --> 09:39.960
But in their estimation they can do everything they need on their phone

09:40.080 --> 09:45.120
Including like they were doing the healthcare gov stuff like they're getting health care exchange coverage on their phone

09:46.320 --> 09:49.320
And and then when they need a computer they just do it at work

09:49.320 --> 09:50.560
And so I think you're right poppy

09:50.560 --> 09:54.320
I think for a lot of people and that's kind of where I was going where I could see this is

09:55.240 --> 10:01.080
What if a vendor like Dell or or Apple came out with a really successful arm based laptop?

10:01.640 --> 10:05.440
I'd also peel off a whole bunch of people. I don't know about for me though

10:06.640 --> 10:10.680
Let's stay focused on the issue though. The issue is non free firm or non free code

10:10.680 --> 10:16.560
You're right running at a higher privilege level and almost every arm device has that a proprietary blob that runs in the trust zone

10:16.560 --> 10:23.000
Yeah, you have to run their trust zone. Yeah, there's no way for you to know it's actually inside that yeah

10:23.000 --> 10:26.640
It's really no better than Intel's management engine. Yeah, that's your primary issue. You're right

10:26.640 --> 10:31.040
Go ahead with me and that trust zone has been riddled with security

10:31.800 --> 10:33.800
issues for a long long time

10:35.400 --> 10:37.400
Well

10:42.760 --> 10:45.280
You know what actually you know what I've heard people talking about

10:45.280 --> 10:46.640
Oh

10:46.640 --> 10:48.440
Not not risk

10:48.440 --> 10:53.880
But what is it? What was the what is the CPU design that was originally from such spark, right?

10:53.880 --> 10:59.400
Is this spark open source aren't spark chips like isn't like the entire spark design or completely open source?

10:59.880 --> 11:01.080
But ship is open source

11:01.080 --> 11:06.120
I think Fujitsu still produces some but all the new ones made by Oracle are completely locked up

11:06.120 --> 11:10.680
They don't release any of the specs for those. I think the old ones all the very lock is out there, isn't it?

11:10.680 --> 11:15.640
Okay, okay North Ranger. There is oh good. There is at least IBM's power

11:15.640 --> 11:17.720
So if you look at like the tell us your workstation

11:17.720 --> 11:22.880
Yeah, at least all of the code that's running on that is open. Even if the chip design is not sure, right sure

11:23.160 --> 11:25.720
North Ranger, did you get a chance to jump in with what you wanted to mention?

11:26.520 --> 11:33.240
Yeah, I think you know, it's it's already been alluded to a little bit, but you know, even if you swap out the platform

11:33.960 --> 11:37.640
You know with the CPU that can be booted in an open manner

11:37.640 --> 11:41.360
We're still going to be stuck with peripheral peripherals that have

11:42.160 --> 11:47.280
Binary blobs, even if they're not binary blobs that have to loaded by the OS, you know

11:47.280 --> 11:52.040
Your hard drive has basically an OS running on it to manage all the flash

11:52.040 --> 11:58.280
but none of that though as is as critical as your CPU like if the CPU is the core source of either

11:59.120 --> 12:03.460
If we're just care if we're just if we're just concerned about blobs or really security issues

12:03.460 --> 12:07.040
Then that's a fundamental problem. If a peripheral is that's not as egregious

12:07.040 --> 12:10.360
It's still egregious well in the case of a hard drive. It could be pretty egregious

12:10.360 --> 12:14.200
Yeah, I could control what data you're accessing and so it could put in whatever data it wants

12:14.960 --> 12:16.960
Okay, well seen examples of that. Oh

12:17.920 --> 12:22.960
Wimpy's got something for the show notes. I will add to yes open spark. Right? Exactly. Very good. Hmm

12:23.520 --> 12:28.280
Well, there you have it is doesn't sound like we even though we've had we've and it's interesting

12:28.280 --> 12:33.000
you've been following the story for a little while West it's interesting you've been following this push and yet we don't really have a

12:33.000 --> 12:40.080
super clear alternative that doesn't also have its set of downsides and to bring myself down and not to mention not to mention that we've

12:40.080 --> 12:41.480
now got decades of

12:41.480 --> 12:46.560
R&D and x86 and software built around and all of that speaking of decades speaking of decades

12:47.160 --> 12:52.840
That whole scope versus Linux. I don't believe what you've read. It's actually still around again

12:52.920 --> 12:58.240
Yeah, the scope versus IBM is alive 13 years later and continuing now

12:58.240 --> 13:03.780
If you know what you might not even have been alive if you're listening to this show when this lawsuit started

13:03.780 --> 13:09.720
So I had its core the sco group which was then named caldera systems filed a lawsuit against IBM in March of 20

13:09.720 --> 13:11.720
I'm sorry 2003

13:12.160 --> 13:14.160
for allegedly contributing to

13:14.320 --> 13:17.600
contributing sections of the commercial Unix code from the Unix system in it to

13:17.800 --> 13:25.280
Scos from sco to the Linux kernel code base sco group claimed that they alleged presence of its proprietary code in the open source

13:25.280 --> 13:29.560
Code named Linux devalued its proprietary codes value

13:29.560 --> 13:35.800
And so therefore they were suing IBM for that along the way sco filed for bankruptcy and the group claimed that anyone who used Linux

13:35.800 --> 13:42.520
owed them money all the while novell successfully claimed ownership of the allegedly infringing code and then said okay everybody's gonna be

13:43.080 --> 13:44.760
Indemnified from it if you run on Linux

13:44.760 --> 13:50.060
But all of that has not stopped the sco group from continuing its battle with IBM the group on Wednesday

13:50.060 --> 13:52.060
Which is last Wednesday did not actually

13:52.060 --> 13:59.140
Reveal the nature of their appeal only as a solely as a solely as a notice to the appeals court that they would be lodging an

13:59.140 --> 14:00.940
appeal soon

14:00.940 --> 14:04.100
So they're not it's not sco versus IBM

14:04.660 --> 14:09.340
Which is one of the oldest stories I've been following is still not done. It's still not done

14:09.340 --> 14:11.980
It's unbelievable one of the first stories tracked for a Linux action show

14:12.780 --> 14:14.780
really incredible

14:15.340 --> 14:19.900
All right, I don't want to go into all the April Fool's this week last this past week

14:19.900 --> 14:25.180
There was a lot of April Fool's shenanigans, but one I thought was particularly good because you know

14:25.180 --> 14:31.120
Like what ThinkGeek does is ThinkGeek has these products sometimes as April Fool's and then people want it so much that ThinkGeek actually ends up

14:31.120 --> 14:32.580
Making it. I

14:32.580 --> 14:36.000
Think that's what can happen to the KDE project the KDE project

14:36.000 --> 14:38.660
I think ended up with an April Fool's that they're gonna have to make

14:39.100 --> 14:45.240
They the on April 1st. They posted plasma 5.7 will let you log in through an online account

14:45.240 --> 14:51.560
KDE is going to provide an own cloud installation to let plasma and KDE PIM users sync their data

14:51.640 --> 14:53.940
You can already use own cloud with Car Dev and Cal Dev

14:54.600 --> 14:56.960
To get at your calendars and things like that synced

14:57.440 --> 15:03.240
And now and now you will be able to use own cloud to sync plasma

15:03.400 --> 15:06.400
Configurations and manage them work will be when your work is completed

15:06.400 --> 15:10.360
You'll be able to load a plasma session by specifying units username and password and own cloud provider

15:10.360 --> 15:17.760
that's right, and then you can log into your KD desktop and have your settings synced via own cloud in plasma 5.7 a

15:18.120 --> 15:24.360
Massive feature West a massive feature now. I kind of want it. I know right so did everybody else so ha ha April Fool's

15:24.360 --> 15:28.520
That was a super funny April Fool's everybody super funny April Fool's

15:30.680 --> 15:32.680
What was the Ubuntu one I don't remember that

15:33.360 --> 15:37.560
It wasn't Ubuntu one the thing of the cloud that you could also put your backups in there

15:37.560 --> 15:39.040
a

15:39.040 --> 15:42.840
Service that was discontinued at some point. Yes, your box like yes

15:42.840 --> 15:46.280
Yeah, now, but I got enough people's attention

15:46.280 --> 15:50.760
They say they're actually it happened that they were already be going to be meeting at the at their

15:51.400 --> 15:57.640
Vdg you know the developers group meeting that they have and so like people are really excited about this April Fool's

15:58.920 --> 16:01.240
And so they looked at it like God you know there might actually be ways

16:01.240 --> 16:04.000
We could actually accomplish some of this now not the login stuff

16:04.000 --> 16:08.160
But integrating more syncing stuff a better place to store stuff in own cloud

16:08.160 --> 16:11.640
It looks like they were actually looked at some of the ideas from the April Fool's and went

16:12.240 --> 16:17.600
Maybe we're trying to be negative. It just seems like a huge expense for very little benefit

16:17.600 --> 16:21.880
Well, not the login part not the login part, but some of the other files thinking stuff

16:22.800 --> 16:30.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Wendy you were you were mentioning Google's April Fool's that didn't go over so well I

16:30.000 --> 16:32.960
Heard some people got really upset about that

16:35.800 --> 16:39.720
Did you go where'd you go Wimpy? Where'd you go? Oh, hi. Hi

16:39.720 --> 16:43.760
I I think the people at Google need to remember they've been employed to be

16:44.280 --> 16:50.680
Kick-ass engineers and various other roles and none of them are employed employed to be full-time comedians

16:50.880 --> 16:55.000
Yeah, and they should just knock this on the head. It's very tiresome and

16:55.000 --> 17:00.680
You know, they're April Fool's this year a couple of them went bad and none of them were very good

17:01.480 --> 17:07.280
What happened to the halcyon days of the Google April Fool's like, you know, Google Glass and Nexus Q. I mean, those were cracking

17:08.120 --> 17:09.440
I agree

17:09.440 --> 17:11.120
and you know

17:11.120 --> 17:13.120
Those are hilarious. I

17:14.280 --> 17:19.200
Saw some people that were tweeting like they were writing like condolences emails to people who had

17:19.440 --> 17:22.840
To family members who had had somebody passed away and it inserted that mic drop thing

17:22.840 --> 17:27.480
And anyways people were upset so it might be some fun stuff coming out of plasma soon

17:27.880 --> 17:31.840
And also Katie has come up with a vision for the future that well

17:31.840 --> 17:36.480
I'll read it to you the Katie statement for their vision is a world in which everyone has control over their digital life and enjoys

17:36.600 --> 17:38.040
freedom and privacy

17:38.040 --> 17:42.120
They go more expanded it goes on but in greater detail their vision has no geographical barriers

17:42.120 --> 17:44.480
Katie should be able to be available to everyone

17:44.480 --> 17:49.560
Katie wants to put their users in the driver's seat and Katie wants people to control all aspects of their digital lives

17:49.560 --> 17:51.320
Okay

17:51.320 --> 17:55.720
Hard to object to that is the Katie E vision and you can find out more at dot Katie e.org

17:55.720 --> 18:00.280
And this is kind of an interesting thing. I wonder I wonder so the group that put this together

18:00.280 --> 18:05.680
I wonder how much connection this actually has to people that are actually writing code

18:05.680 --> 18:10.160
That's always something I kind of wonder when I when I watch the Katie project from afar

18:10.160 --> 18:13.520
I I get kind of confused about what is

18:13.520 --> 18:20.320
actually directly connected to the project and what is just sort of like people who are associated with the project that do in the project's name and

18:20.640 --> 18:24.520
I've been running the plasma 5 6 desktop since about

18:26.600 --> 18:32.120
Five days since before plasma 5 6 or maybe seven days before plasma 5 6 was released to final and now I've been right

18:32.120 --> 18:36.000
I've been running it since then so I guess I'm coming on like I must be on almost a month now and

18:36.000 --> 18:39.040
Just recently. I'm starting to have issues on this Intel skylake machine

18:39.040 --> 18:45.720
But I I have I have really I have really profoundly changed my position on the plasma desktop and it no longer

18:46.160 --> 18:48.480
With each release of the plasma desktop

18:48.480 --> 18:53.360
I have felt like there's just a couple of things that were really fundamentally broken didn't work for me for a while

18:53.360 --> 18:54.640
It was sound was really bad

18:54.640 --> 18:57.840
Didn't be able to go in there and understanding like when they at one point

18:57.840 --> 19:01.480
I think it was like in five four or five five when they updated the sound or the multimedia

19:02.160 --> 19:03.120
system

19:03.120 --> 19:09.040
Control panel where you could go and disable hardware devices. It was a process of elimination. I could make the right sound card work

19:09.040 --> 19:14.320
That was a huge game-changer for me and when the stability got so that way I didn't just when they when the session was idle

19:14.320 --> 19:18.000
I would sometimes just have the plasma shell crash when those things stopped happening

19:18.000 --> 19:23.360
You know, that was another game-changer for me. And so five six has been really a great great release

19:23.360 --> 19:26.560
But at the same time as much as I see improvement

19:26.560 --> 19:31.600
I see a lot a lot of room for continued improvement still and I think that's a big thing

19:31.600 --> 19:33.600
room for continued improvement still and

19:34.000 --> 19:38.800
last week we covered a mailing post that mr. Brown who is in our

19:39.400 --> 19:43.080
Mumble room right now who hails us from the Sousa project wrote up

19:43.680 --> 19:47.080
And I he sent it in to the KDE mailing list

19:47.080 --> 19:52.040
And and if you guys recall he talked about how there's multiple text editors and multiple start menus

19:52.040 --> 19:57.080
And there's there's so much going on in there that it might meet a little refinement and I don't want to actually make it too

19:57.080 --> 19:59.280
clumsy, so mr. Brown if you wanted to

19:59.280 --> 20:06.600
Maybe just really recap really briefly for our audience who didn't catch the episode last week kind of what your message was in this mailing

20:06.600 --> 20:07.600
list post

20:07.600 --> 20:09.560
Because I thought it nailed my thoughts

20:09.560 --> 20:12.680
I thought you were actually really able to verbalize some of the things that I've been thinking

20:12.960 --> 20:18.760
In a really clear cognizant way that wasn't hostile that came from a place of I love what you're doing

20:18.760 --> 20:20.960
I love everything we've accomplished, but we still have room to go

20:20.960 --> 20:25.560
And so would you mind summarizing your post really quick for the audience? Yeah, I don't mind at all

20:25.560 --> 20:29.960
I mean, yeah, it comes from a lot of the discussions. We're having with the KDE project at the moment about

20:30.840 --> 20:35.320
well their relationships with distributions, you know some pain points with our

20:35.960 --> 20:41.680
packages and stuff like that and the the conversation kind of ended up talking a little bit broader about sort of

20:42.840 --> 20:45.800
just distribution positioning and stuff generally and

20:46.320 --> 20:52.000
Yeah, the the key message that I wanted to kind of get across is yeah, there's parts of the KDE stack which are

20:52.000 --> 20:57.880
Absolutely phenomenal and of good quality and great. But if you look at kind of KD is a whole

20:58.720 --> 21:00.920
It's hard to get a handle on

21:01.640 --> 21:03.960
What the project is trying to do. It's it's

21:04.680 --> 21:09.720
And and if you ask like three different KDE developers you generally get three different answers on pretty much everything

21:09.720 --> 21:10.480
I mean

21:10.480 --> 21:16.880
You made a point that that clearly translates to what the what that happens is the KD project and the plasma desktop is not

21:16.880 --> 21:24.160
Messaging to the distros what's awesome about the plasma desktop so then they can't turn around and and and relay that to their users

21:24.160 --> 21:26.720
they don't they don't there's like a disconnect there and

21:27.240 --> 21:33.320
So that's sort of the big problem when you said the big with the end result is is KDE actually has to is KD doesn't

21:33.320 --> 21:36.460
Just market to end-user. It also has to market to distro makers themselves, too

21:36.960 --> 21:41.720
Yeah, and there's like little snippets and like little glimmers of what I think is a wonderful

21:41.720 --> 21:45.480
I don't use the word vision because they're using it now at mission goal, whatever

21:45.480 --> 21:47.000
of

21:47.000 --> 21:48.320
like

21:48.320 --> 21:52.680
from what some of their plasma maintainers of like just thinking of plasma as a

21:53.240 --> 21:57.720
Workspace and thinking of the applications of something different and if you think of it as something different, which is

21:58.320 --> 22:01.120
clearly a mindset that some of the KDE project have a

22:01.520 --> 22:08.800
Lot of these problems and pain points go away because all of these duplicate applications are certainly available to not be included

22:08.800 --> 22:11.240
You know if you stop thinking of KDE is a huge stack

22:11.240 --> 22:17.080
But as a pick-and-mix selection of technologies, you might want to put in your distribution

22:18.080 --> 22:24.600
Things get really exciting again. Sure. The whole project isn't angled in that direction yet. The messaging is not there

22:24.600 --> 22:30.040
Well, you know what you think of link as an end-user when you think of the plasma desktop, don't you aren't you?

22:30.800 --> 22:35.480
Isn't one of the things you think about is how well all the applications integrate and how they all play off each other and how it's a

22:35.480 --> 22:41.160
Whole suite. I mean when I think of the KDE desktop, I think of plasma 5-6. I think of

22:42.160 --> 22:45.760
All of the text editors. I even maybe consider k-office included in that

22:45.760 --> 22:48.480
I mean, I think of the entire suite when I think of the plasma desktop

22:48.960 --> 22:52.720
You think that way but the KDE project is no longer working in that way

22:52.720 --> 22:57.840
So it's is that a smart thing to have those expectations so far divorced from each other

22:59.160 --> 23:04.640
If you haven't got maintainers on the KDE side maintaining all of that stuff to the same level as the plasma guys and the K

23:04.640 --> 23:05.800
Wing guys

23:05.800 --> 23:07.800
Aren't you setting yourself up for?

23:08.040 --> 23:12.280
Disappointment and failure or something, right? Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. That's actually a great point

23:12.280 --> 23:15.680
So but how does a project like KDE which?

23:16.240 --> 23:18.400
Has been labeled in the past as a bit chaotic

23:18.400 --> 23:23.800
How does a project like that come together and say we're gonna we're gonna unite around a single editor

23:23.800 --> 23:30.540
We're gonna unite around a single this or that or is that the job of a distribution and and if that's a job of distribution

23:30.540 --> 23:32.540
Why has it never happened?

23:32.540 --> 23:38.300
Yeah, that's it. That's a tough answer. I mean the I think there was room in KDE for

23:39.500 --> 23:45.140
Some kind of leadership in that area of like just people stepping up and saying okay, we're gonna make some of these tough choices

23:46.220 --> 23:50.460
It won't make those people friends just like some of the changes no mate

23:50.460 --> 23:55.380
It didn't make necessarily make certain people friends, but in the long run it's proven to be a pretty good thing. I

23:56.220 --> 23:57.700
Think that might be part of it

23:57.700 --> 24:03.060
The other part of the distributions is the other stuff that we were talking about before we got on to this conversation of like these

24:03.060 --> 24:04.860
I was gonna say a hundred paper cuts

24:04.860 --> 24:11.260
But at the moment it feels a bit more like a thousand of like just living with the KDE stack packaging the KDE stack handling

24:11.940 --> 24:19.560
You know new new yeah new dependencies new changes and and we're having a bit of a hard time getting that communication from

24:20.100 --> 24:25.700
Them as the developers of like what are they expecting from us? What where what dependencies do they need?

24:25.700 --> 24:28.420
What versions of X Y & Z we just get these big old?

24:28.940 --> 24:33.620
Tables and it's expected to get it out there and they you know uses hands as fast as possible and

24:34.700 --> 24:36.700
That can be really tough sometimes

24:37.020 --> 24:40.020
Yeah, absolutely now you also

24:41.220 --> 24:48.500
Really effectively broke down the rather dominant position that GTK based desktops are in versus Qt based desktops

24:48.860 --> 24:50.860
And I find that to be

24:50.980 --> 24:54.020
Not not shocking and not a huge surprise

24:54.020 --> 24:56.700
but if you walk into a room of Linux nerds and

24:57.460 --> 24:59.460
You ask people to raise their hands on

25:00.520 --> 25:04.340
What they prefer Qt or GTK a lot of people are gonna raise their hands for Qt

25:04.660 --> 25:10.420
In terms of application development a lot of people say like Qt is superior or cute yet

25:14.980 --> 25:17.860
Right exactly yeah, yeah, and I'm kind of in the same

25:17.860 --> 25:22.540
I'm using plasma right now, but I I'm kind of in the same boat so what what's going on here?

25:22.540 --> 25:30.500
Why has Gnome or GTK desktops essentially dominated the the top positions on distro watch and the and the larger distros?

25:31.580 --> 25:36.380
When plasma desktops been around for a long time the Qt technology is pretty advanced

25:36.380 --> 25:41.000
You have folks like canonical who are investing a ton of resources into it. What are your thoughts there? I?

25:42.500 --> 25:44.340
think it's a case of

25:44.340 --> 25:46.740
just like hitting that sweet spot of the

25:47.260 --> 25:49.060
implementation like if you think of the

25:49.060 --> 25:55.180
many of like the core audiences of Linux these days we're talking about you know tablets and stuff earlier and mobile devices if you if

25:55.180 --> 25:58.300
You think about you know who is using a Linux desktop these days

25:59.420 --> 26:05.300
You typically have like you know developers techies sysadminis guys who?

26:06.180 --> 26:08.720
generally fall into one or two camps either sort of the

26:09.420 --> 26:15.860
Lightweight guys who just want the most simple window manager or whatever that can you know just does the thing that is meant to do

26:15.860 --> 26:20.060
And you know probably some old-school stuff that no one's seen for 10 years or seen an upgrade for for 10 years

26:20.060 --> 26:23.260
And then you have another lot who just want

26:24.180 --> 26:29.220
Something that keeps out of their way, and I think most of the GTK ones generally do that in a very elegant way

26:30.220 --> 26:36.800
The KDE appeals to you know these control freaks who want all these options and all these buttons and everything

26:38.060 --> 26:44.780
But does that necessarily overlap with like the most of the core than its users these days. I'm I'm not so sure

26:44.780 --> 26:46.780
and

26:47.340 --> 26:51.780
I actually want to give a chance for daredevil and jump here because daredevil and you say to maybe it's it's the money

26:52.220 --> 26:54.600
There's more money behind GTK. What do you mean there?

26:54.600 --> 27:01.420
I mean that there is just as much money being poured like cute has the support of the corporation DJ right and

27:02.500 --> 27:08.820
GTK has just supported red hat that's not a small feat. That's not a small amount of engineering in there and when you look at

27:09.620 --> 27:11.740
That money being poured into hey

27:11.740 --> 27:14.220
This if you're going to make an application

27:15.260 --> 27:21.180
That is going to work in in your company, and you're already using those red hats or this fedora

27:21.540 --> 27:25.820
You know it's just that they document in a way, and there's also the cycles

27:29.540 --> 27:36.700
Just remember that there's also still the very first reason why GTK was created is you know there was the doubts about the licensing now?

27:36.700 --> 27:38.860
There's no longer many doubts about licensing

27:38.860 --> 27:44.180
But there is an attempt to you know show a different path to a different license on you

27:44.180 --> 27:47.340
It's not necessarily the GTK camp. Yeah, that's good. That's a good point

27:47.860 --> 27:53.120
Richard also, it's not just red hat that you know have money behind and you know GTK

27:53.120 --> 27:56.460
You know Susan the next enterprise also standardized on them with the last release

27:56.460 --> 27:59.740
Well, that is a perfect segue to my next question question Richard

28:00.020 --> 28:03.580
so this is semi awkward here now all of a sudden because

28:03.580 --> 28:10.820
Everybody kind of thinks of open Sousa as primarily as focusing on the KDE plasma desktop

28:11.140 --> 28:14.500
But your enterprise distribution is focused on the known desktop

28:14.580 --> 28:21.260
You kind of talked about this a little bit is is this requiring Sousa open Sousa to pivot more towards user demand or?

28:21.900 --> 28:26.580
Do you play the role as a desktop advocate here and try to get more people to try the plasma desktop?

28:26.580 --> 28:32.020
What what decision does open Sousa make in light of the reality of GTK's?

28:32.020 --> 28:34.220
market predominance and

28:35.380 --> 28:37.380
apparent user preference in some cases

28:38.860 --> 28:39.860
Well first

28:39.860 --> 28:47.220
I guess it's clear to say like Sousa's business decision regarding the enterprise distribution is like totally separate from open Sousa like in the sense

28:47.220 --> 28:52.100
Of like Sousa made this decision about NOMA as a default quite a while ago. They did it for 11 as well

28:52.740 --> 28:57.300
And at the same time the open Sousa community had a discussion made their decision

28:57.740 --> 28:59.740
went and stuck with KDE and

28:59.740 --> 29:03.420
And you know where open Sousa is always free to go its own road

29:04.180 --> 29:08.380
Do you know make its own decisions and we have an absolutely awesome KDE team?

29:08.380 --> 29:11.220
I mean to be blunt the best KDE team out there

29:12.220 --> 29:16.300
Doing a wonderful job of packaging all of this stuff despite the stuff that I've been complaining about

29:17.500 --> 29:20.580
Yeah, and you know, it's if you want a KDE expense

29:20.580 --> 29:24.980
It's the best one that where that comes to like what does open Sousa do in the future?

29:24.980 --> 29:30.260
we I at times coming that we'll probably end up having a discussion about this soon and I

29:31.020 --> 29:35.940
Think there's some really interesting options to put on the table like in the case of tumbleweed

29:36.060 --> 29:40.500
because one of the things with the community with open Sousa is we're not the

29:40.940 --> 29:45.900
Perception that we are KDE first has always been wrong. We've always treated every desktop equally

29:46.780 --> 29:48.860
So do we put KDE on there?

29:48.900 --> 29:52.740
Do we put no desktop as a default in some example in the case of time?

29:52.740 --> 29:58.220
We might be able to get away with that. It might make sense since it reflects the community as we are

29:59.420 --> 30:01.420
but for the leap

30:01.780 --> 30:04.780
Probably not. Hmm. What makes the difference there?

30:05.900 --> 30:09.300
Just the target audience of leap of you know being an easier

30:10.020 --> 30:13.900
Not rolling less techie user friendly distribution

30:13.900 --> 30:14.660
I see

30:14.660 --> 30:15.100
I mean

30:15.100 --> 30:20.220
We could maybe put no default there that that's another thing that I kind of stumbled on when I was writing all this stuff to

30:20.220 --> 30:23.140
Kde like there's a lot of distros out there that don't have a default

30:23.140 --> 30:27.060
Um, you know, we thought we were crazy thinking about it. Maybe it's an idea to go for that

30:27.580 --> 30:31.740
Yeah, I guess so. I I think you know the idea of the default desktop

30:31.740 --> 30:37.660
I mean doesn't it feel like that idea comes from we are gonna put all of our focus on this

30:37.660 --> 30:42.380
We're gonna do our theming our customization all of our effort goes into this

30:42.700 --> 30:49.260
Which is really kind of a commercial company way of thinking because it's really a we only have 10 developers to do this

30:49.260 --> 30:54.460
So we must put all of our energy into this desktop in the reality though in open source

30:54.460 --> 30:59.280
You may have multiple contributors that want to work on multiple desktops. And so you can ship multiple desktops

30:59.280 --> 31:02.340
Is that true or is there an advantage of just focusing on one desktop?

31:02.340 --> 31:04.460
Which I think is where that kind of mentality comes from

31:04.460 --> 31:09.620
I think if you ask other projects you'll say focus is the way to go in the case of openSUSE

31:09.620 --> 31:12.800
We've been doing this now for 10 years of the the traditional

31:13.820 --> 31:16.340
Every developer, you know as long as we have contributors

31:16.340 --> 31:21.020
We will do it and we'll find a way to do it. And if we have two sets of contributors pulling in two different directions

31:21.940 --> 31:27.540
We find a way of doing it together and that's like one of the things that we're exceptionally good at doing these days

31:28.100 --> 31:30.100
so for us

31:30.140 --> 31:36.300
That's fine. But then you do have to think about the user experience of like, okay some guy puts in your DVD boots it up

31:36.900 --> 31:42.180
Do you really want to shove a desktop selection window right in front of them when they have no idea what all those options mean?

31:42.180 --> 31:46.380
so this sort of moving on from this I guess I

31:46.900 --> 31:51.620
Kind of wanted to ask you just as a follow-up to last week's I think it was 138. We talked about this

31:53.520 --> 32:00.080
What do you think would be the major breakthrough to make to make the floodgates open for people to move say from

32:00.500 --> 32:07.340
The Ubuntu desktop or the Fedora desktop or whatever and say, you know what this time this time I install this machine

32:07.340 --> 32:11.280
I'm doing openSUSE and I last week. I think I made it into the show

32:11.280 --> 32:12.620
I'm not sure if I made in the final version

32:12.620 --> 32:20.300
I proposed that the thing that might finally break those floodgates open is universal application installs across Linux because if all of a sudden

32:21.220 --> 32:23.300
software availability was sort of

32:24.060 --> 32:26.520
the same across all of the major distributions

32:26.780 --> 32:30.540
then you could start picking your distro on other things like technical merits and

32:30.860 --> 32:33.580
You might see a lot more people picking openSUSE

32:33.820 --> 32:37.460
it seems like right now one of the barriers is software availability despite all of the

32:37.460 --> 32:41.080
Nice tricks in and means you got a long way

32:41.080 --> 32:44.480
But despite that it seems like that might still be the thing that holds up a lot of people

32:44.760 --> 32:47.360
But I don't know Richard what your thoughts are

32:47.960 --> 32:52.080
As far as if there could be a big shift that would all of a sudden make it much easier

32:52.460 --> 32:54.840
Less friction for people to start jumping to SUSE

32:56.200 --> 33:01.840
Yeah, I think I think that's part of it. I mean we've been thinking about the software availability thing from sort of the other direction of

33:01.840 --> 33:08.800
Tidying up some of the rough edges around like software.openSUSE.org and the OBS and then bits and pieces like that

33:09.280 --> 33:14.040
The the universal application stuff is is interesting. I'm

33:15.120 --> 33:20.920
Parenthetically worried about the baggage it might bring you know libraries that need patching and maintaining and all the other stuff

33:22.320 --> 33:23.920
we

33:23.920 --> 33:27.680
We've got some expertise in that area because we've been playing around with like Docker

33:27.680 --> 33:32.880
We have zippers the only package manager that can patch inside a Docker container, for example. Wow

33:33.560 --> 33:39.780
Kind of fun. So, you know, maybe we end up, you know patching inside application containers too and having fun with that but

33:40.680 --> 33:42.880
So yeah, I think it's it's part of the story

33:42.880 --> 33:49.040
But I think in the case of openSUSE of the the main part has actually been sort of actually having it like a consistent story

33:49.040 --> 33:51.040
The same thing that I'm being criticized in KDE about

33:51.520 --> 33:52.120
You know

33:52.120 --> 33:56.900
I know that's been a weakness for openSUSE in the past and I think we're finding our feet without getting that message out

33:56.900 --> 33:59.720
It's just a case of taking time listening to feedback

34:00.380 --> 34:01.800
iterating tuning

34:01.800 --> 34:04.800
One last question and then I'm gonna I'll toss it air devil

34:04.800 --> 34:07.880
and I think we're I'm and then anything you want to bring up but my the

34:08.400 --> 34:14.040
last week the thing that really got my head spinning was Microsoft's announcement of bash on Windows and

34:14.360 --> 34:19.820
To mr. Popey's delight. They specifically said you can run Ubuntu apps on Windows

34:19.840 --> 34:22.200
In fact, I think when you run the user land now

34:22.200 --> 34:28.880
In the command prompt when you type bash up in the little window. It says Ubuntu as if the application

34:28.880 --> 34:36.040
You're running is Ubuntu and Ubuntu is now an application in your in your task taskbar Ubuntu with a little Ubuntu logo and

34:36.560 --> 34:41.720
On Windows and I'm wondering when you heard this announcement. Did you think to yourself?

34:42.800 --> 34:46.580
Shit, I wish they would have just said the Linux command line. Why did it have to be Ubuntu?

34:46.580 --> 34:54.020
Actually, I heard the announcement logged on to this mumbo-jumbo and asked Popey a few questions about the technical stuff because I reckon we can

34:54.020 --> 35:01.280
Possibly dump open Suza on top of that instead. Yeah, I would love to hear because they call the subsystem the Linux subsystem

35:01.280 --> 35:04.660
They don't call it the Ubuntu subsystem. The user land is Ubuntu, but

35:05.220 --> 35:07.220
Popey now last week in the show

35:07.780 --> 35:12.920
We were covering the rumors that there might be bash on Windows. Did you know at that time what was coming? I

35:12.920 --> 35:16.960
Didn't I knew like about an hour before?

35:17.760 --> 35:20.000
They went on stage and said it and that was it

35:20.000 --> 35:24.360
Uh-huh. See we got a we got to get a we got to get a line to Dustin and we got to get somebody

35:25.000 --> 35:29.360
Giving him beer to give us the inside scoop. I dare Devon before we move on from mr. Brown

35:29.360 --> 35:31.360
I know I wanted to get your your question

35:32.240 --> 35:35.420
So no, I was just saying the universal apps one

35:35.420 --> 35:42.280
Don't you guys think that it will change what what they mean or what it means when you now have to consider Windows platform?

35:42.280 --> 35:44.280
I mean, isn't that the appeal?

35:45.200 --> 35:48.720
You mean you mean that particular neck that compatibility layer now?

35:50.360 --> 35:55.600
Wow make an application for Ubuntu and now it just works on Solaris BSD

35:55.800 --> 35:58.800
Linux your regular distro and it will work on Windows

36:00.640 --> 36:05.720
Yes, when this comes yes from CLI apps they come from the graphical apps yet

36:06.800 --> 36:10.880
No, but you know, someone's gonna get X working on that thing, you know, somebody's gonna get it

36:10.880 --> 36:12.880
Well x-ming is already a thing. Oh

36:12.880 --> 36:14.840
Well, I know I hope so

36:14.840 --> 36:20.280
I wonder if somebody will takes like somehow if somebody will come will merge Sigwin with this somehow and make like just some sort

36:20.280 --> 36:24.520
Of Frankenstein said an unholy Linux box, right? You know exactly what I'm thinking about

36:25.000 --> 36:27.680
Richard was there anything else you wanted to touch on before we move along?

36:30.680 --> 36:36.000
All right, sir, well, thank you for joining us and I thought that was a great post well-written and it was it was really

36:36.000 --> 36:42.760
well stated too and I hope the KD project takes up some of your suggestions and we

36:43.280 --> 36:48.920
We will just have to wait and see I will mention DigitalOcean sponsor right here of the Linux unplugged program

36:48.920 --> 36:52.160
Hey, yo, Wes. Do you have any DigitalOcean droplets? Oh, you know I do

36:53.160 --> 36:57.240
Yeah, I do. You know, I have own cloud running up on DigitalOcean right now

36:57.240 --> 37:00.440
I got the I got the version 9 running, you know the version 9

37:00.440 --> 37:04.800
They got a one-click deployment now of own cloud night one click. That's fast. Boom. Boom

37:04.800 --> 37:07.200
I tell you what DigitalOcean is great

37:07.200 --> 37:10.280
It's a great way for you to get your own Linux rig up in the cloud

37:10.280 --> 37:13.040
They call it the cloud but really what they magical place

37:13.160 --> 37:17.200
Well, it could be magical but really what they you know what it is. It's DigitalOcean's magical servers

37:17.200 --> 37:21.160
They have they have data centers all over the world totally specked out

37:21.160 --> 37:26.000
They have them in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Germany. They have a new one in India

37:27.240 --> 37:31.440
40 gigabit e connections to the hypervisors what all SSDs

37:31.440 --> 37:35.400
super fast CPUs Linux on the entire

37:35.800 --> 37:41.320
infrastructure KVM for the virtualizer and then all sitting on top of it is this incredible web app and

37:41.840 --> 37:43.840
It is so well designed

37:43.920 --> 37:50.560
but yet extremely powerful and then to top it all off like sprinkles on top of a cupcake for Wes's birthday an

37:51.400 --> 37:58.320
API that is straightforward and easy to it is so easy with lots of great open source code already written taken advantage of dat

37:58.320 --> 38:03.320
API I love their interface and I love this if you use our promo code do unplugged

38:03.320 --> 38:08.800
You get a $10 credit $10 credit over at DigitalOcean to save yourself when you're trying it out

38:08.800 --> 38:12.120
I have DigitalOcean also running an EMR application

38:12.640 --> 38:16.480
Well, I think it's called open EMR actually they'd like the name is not all that creative

38:17.240 --> 38:20.720
but my lady runs a medical practice and

38:21.320 --> 38:24.080
Noah set up one for her a while back and she tried it out for a little while

38:24.080 --> 38:26.160
He did the same thing he spun up a DigitalOcean droplet

38:26.160 --> 38:29.540
But the first thing you do she wasn't really ready to try it then he was being a little pushy

38:29.540 --> 38:32.920
You know how Noah can be you know how I mean, I'm just saying I know it's a good guy

38:32.920 --> 38:35.080
But he can be intense. So she's

38:36.120 --> 38:39.960
Yeah, I hope so. I hope so. I said I'm not quite ready

38:39.960 --> 38:43.920
She thought you know, but now now she's ready to jump in. It just takes seconds

38:43.920 --> 38:48.920
I'm a busy guy with and the fact that I can manage my DigitalOcean droplets. It melts my freaking face

38:48.920 --> 38:52.280
It is so great and when you use a promo code do unplugged you can try it out

38:52.280 --> 38:56.200
Their pricing is very straightforward. You can just do hourly pricing. You can go get a big rig

38:57.560 --> 39:03.360
Here's a fun one. I would I would totally suggest you use DigitalOcean to set up a mumble server

39:03.360 --> 39:06.560
If you have not played with mumble for yourself, it is a great open source

39:07.200 --> 39:12.000
Voice chat program. It's what your friends just chat or your own virtual log

39:12.000 --> 39:17.440
it's what we do for our virtual log our virtual log uses mumble running on a DigitalOcean droplet and

39:17.440 --> 39:22.760
It works great people connect from all over the world to that DigitalOcean droplet and it runs all the time

39:23.200 --> 39:28.400
DigitalOcean.com use their HTML 5 console to manage your box or their API or their fantastic interface

39:28.880 --> 39:34.520
They got Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, CorOS, and even that free BSD

39:34.520 --> 39:39.680
They already have tutorials popping up on their site too for 1604. They're on top of it. DigitalOcean.com

39:40.480 --> 39:42.080
Just use that promo code

39:42.080 --> 39:48.280
Do unplugged one word a lowercase and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the unplugged program

39:48.560 --> 39:54.000
and many many of our friends out there in the open source world are also taking advantage of

39:54.200 --> 39:59.120
DigitalOcean either as like DigitalOcean sponsoring them by providing the server hosting

39:59.680 --> 40:06.800
Or they're just already choosing to run off them. In fact, I recall I think I think wimpy uses DigitalOcean for some Ubuntu Mate

40:07.320 --> 40:09.320
stuff and

40:09.320 --> 40:13.840
Speaking of Ubuntu Mate it is a new month

40:13.840 --> 40:19.760
And so we look back at the month of March and we see that the Ubuntu Mate project has had yet

40:20.360 --> 40:23.000
once again another good month and

40:23.560 --> 40:29.000
wimpy has outlined how he'll be spending the monies or how the monies were spent I guess better put and

40:29.560 --> 40:33.640
I wanted to just let him jump in. Is there anything from the update you wanted to share with the audience wimpy?

40:33.640 --> 40:39.240
Well, those people that are following the blog they can see all of that stuff in there see where the money's going

40:39.880 --> 40:41.880
we've put some aside because

40:42.680 --> 40:44.680
we've got the

40:44.680 --> 40:49.760
1604 a couple of weeks away and we'll be releasing the Raspberry Pi images for that

40:49.760 --> 40:53.920
We anticipate a spike in downloads and that gets expensive. So we're

40:54.480 --> 40:57.120
We put some money aside to cater for those downloads

40:57.840 --> 41:01.040
You know, I think I I've been thinking about what it is about these updates that

41:01.040 --> 41:05.240
I like, I mean, I like knowing but it's not just that what I like is

41:07.920 --> 41:09.520
I assume it's true

41:09.520 --> 41:16.000
But whether it's true or not you give the impression of a financially stable and financially sustainable distribution

41:16.320 --> 41:21.120
Exactly and as somebody who's been watching distributions come and go for a long time

41:21.120 --> 41:25.240
I makes me feel good about that distribution that you have a sustainable path here

41:25.240 --> 41:28.520
But I wanted to kind of I actually wanted to push you a little bit on that

41:28.520 --> 41:33.080
I wanted to kind of I actually wanted to push you a little bit on two of the line items you have here because I

41:33.080 --> 41:39.840
Don't know what these mean and they sound really interesting. So Luke got got some cash for working on a buntu Matei

41:40.040 --> 41:45.240
Welcome that's very generic wimpy because a buntu Matei welcome has been a project you've been working on for a long time

41:45.240 --> 41:49.840
What did you want to share any specifics because I was curious. I would like to know what did he do?

41:49.840 --> 41:57.240
Well, he's effectively the principal developer for a buntu Matei. Welcome and the software boutique now

41:57.920 --> 42:00.240
So it's it's really

42:00.880 --> 42:07.080
Luke falls into the category of people that really doesn't isn't interested in the money doesn't want the money

42:07.080 --> 42:13.240
And this is just a way of me saying thank you for the hours and hours of effort that he's put into

42:13.720 --> 42:17.920
The project, you know and also, you know, he's the forum

42:17.920 --> 42:23.720
Administrator in the community. So he's he's taken on a lot of responsibility and it's just nice to say

42:23.720 --> 42:27.200
Thank you for all the time and effort. Well, I would bested into the project

42:27.200 --> 42:32.560
I would say Luke you have helped create one of the best software centers or

42:33.240 --> 42:40.680
Deployment tools for Linux that I have ever used. Absolutely. I think it's fair to say that he hasn't helped. This is Luke's imagining

42:40.680 --> 42:42.680
so I

42:43.160 --> 42:45.360
Started the ball rolling in 1510

42:45.360 --> 42:48.440
and Luke's involvement is kind of interesting because

42:48.960 --> 42:55.480
Very very early on when welcome was really really fresh and new early in the 1510 cycle

42:55.800 --> 43:00.520
He posted a mock-up in the forum of the rolling in logo

43:00.840 --> 43:07.040
Animation that you see in the 1510 right buntu Matei welcome and I said, oh that would be so great

43:07.040 --> 43:12.520
If you implement that and the next day there was a pull request and he'd implemented it all and the rest of it

43:12.520 --> 43:19.080
and that kind of sparked his involvement and then I didn't hear much from him and then as the

43:19.640 --> 43:23.880
1604 cycle started I got this colossal pull request

43:24.640 --> 43:29.280
And he clearly spent weeks, you know working on it and it was just this

43:30.000 --> 43:31.000
BAM

43:31.000 --> 43:35.840
This is what I've been doing for the last I don't know how long and it was just like, okay

43:35.840 --> 43:40.120
And all of a sudden like wow, we've got something for 1604 here. That's great. Yeah

43:40.120 --> 43:46.320
Yeah, and so and and he was very clear, you know, he he he got what welcome was all about. He

43:47.080 --> 43:51.920
Totally understood why it was important and he really wanted to go for it

43:51.920 --> 43:56.760
So I kind of stepped back a little bit from active development

43:56.760 --> 44:00.120
I've had a hand in it, but he has really driven

44:00.640 --> 44:06.040
buntu Matei welcome and the software boutique in 1604 with the help of

44:06.040 --> 44:14.040
Robin Thompson as well who I approached to help us with the translation work that we've been working on the last six weeks or so

44:14.600 --> 44:21.480
So also I noticed that it looks like there's been some continued effort to porting Matei desktop to GTK 3

44:22.680 --> 44:27.720
Yep. Yep. So the upstream guys Wolfgang and Vlad

44:28.520 --> 44:32.920
And another guy called Luke who I don't have any active contacts with

44:32.920 --> 44:37.880
but Luke from DC, I think you go by on github. You really need to get in touch with me

44:37.880 --> 44:41.240
I need to reach out and say thank you to you for all of your hard work as well

44:42.120 --> 44:48.360
But yeah, the the three of them have been working tirelessly for months and months

44:48.920 --> 44:51.960
To really refine the GTK 3 implementation

44:52.600 --> 44:57.320
And I think the target at the moment more or less is that

44:57.320 --> 45:02.600
Matei desktop 1.14 will be released in about a week's time

45:03.400 --> 45:10.600
And it should be the first one that has a stable GTK 3 implementation for those people that want to build against GTK 3

45:11.640 --> 45:16.280
That is exciting impressive GTK 3.20 is the

45:17.320 --> 45:20.680
Version that they're targeted so they've worked really really hard on that

45:21.480 --> 45:23.480
So you want to chat a little bit about

45:23.480 --> 45:27.560
Some Raspberry Pi stuff. I know that you've been working on several different things in that regard

45:27.560 --> 45:30.360
I don't know how much you want to talk about what you want to share, but

45:31.000 --> 45:33.480
There's several things that are would be pretty interesting to the audience

45:34.760 --> 45:41.880
Yeah, yeah, that's my sort of favorite favorite pet project. I like tinkering with the Raspberry Pi. I have lots of

45:42.600 --> 45:46.200
Friends with Raspberry Pi. We like you tinkering with the Raspberry Pi

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Yeah, it's lots of fun. So

45:49.000 --> 45:54.120
Yeah, I alluded to the fact there'll be a Raspberry Pi release for

45:55.300 --> 45:57.300
1604 for Ubuntu Matei

45:58.120 --> 46:02.920
And I will also build the same versions that we've had before

46:03.880 --> 46:07.000
So I've made versions of the

46:08.040 --> 46:10.200
Ubuntu, you know traditional Ubuntu server

46:11.240 --> 46:14.540
And also Lubuntu and Xubuntu images

46:14.540 --> 46:20.060
for those people that want to play with those and I think a couple of months ago

46:20.060 --> 46:22.860
We were talking about this stuff and I alluded to the fact that you know

46:22.860 --> 46:30.460
There was some experimental work going on from the Raspberry Pi foundation with accelerated drivers for the video core

46:31.260 --> 46:32.220
for

46:32.220 --> 46:39.580
Chip and that you know, if that went well, then we could potentially start seeing some of the composited desktops running on the Raspberry Pi 3

46:39.580 --> 46:47.100
So I've spent a couple of evenings playing with that and having some fun with that. Yeah, and how has that gone would be?

46:48.060 --> 46:50.460
Well, I've got to the point where

46:51.580 --> 46:55.580
so at the moment I I can boot and

46:56.220 --> 46:58.220
run in air quotes

46:58.780 --> 47:01.660
Ubuntu Unity, Kubuntu and

47:02.300 --> 47:03.420
Ubuntu

47:03.420 --> 47:04.620
Gnome

47:04.620 --> 47:09.740
1604 on the Raspberry Pi 3. Wow, that's awesome

47:10.460 --> 47:14.780
Oh boy, the Raspberry Pi 3 is getting awfully appealing all of a sudden

47:18.300 --> 47:24.140
Now it's it's progress because in 1510 that just wasn't possible

47:24.780 --> 47:30.060
And the video core 4 drivers are still very experimental

47:30.060 --> 47:31.340
so

47:31.340 --> 47:37.980
None of those desktops are what you would call usable. Okay, they're kind of interesting

47:38.700 --> 47:43.580
You know little moose bush and and I'm sure it'll improve so over the course of the year

47:43.580 --> 47:48.700
Have you seen my plasma desktop? It literally is glitching out all over the place right now

47:50.220 --> 47:53.660
So actually the the k the kubuntu thing

47:53.660 --> 47:59.420
Uh, I don't I don't really i'm not really familiar with it the issue there and this isn't a kde

48:00.220 --> 48:06.140
Issue it's you know, it's the uh video core 4 drivers, you know that there are some rough edges there

48:06.140 --> 48:11.660
Right. So some of the rendering's not right. So right some of the icons and some of the fonts are a bit

48:12.220 --> 48:14.220
You can't make them out

48:14.380 --> 48:18.780
But when I can get it to do stuff the animations are

48:18.780 --> 48:23.900
Just silky smooth just perfect. Nice. You you can't complain. Um

48:24.700 --> 48:31.580
On ubuntu unity that generally works. Um, I although when I tried to take a screenshot of the desktop

48:32.220 --> 48:36.220
That locks something up. So that's why I had to take a photograph of

48:36.860 --> 48:38.860
Of that one running rather than a screenshot

48:39.820 --> 48:45.340
Um, but you know that broadly works, um kubuntu works, but I don't know if it's going to work

48:45.340 --> 48:51.420
But you know that broadly works, um kubuntu works, but I can't make it out where ubuntu

48:52.220 --> 48:55.500
Uh has better, you know, it doesn't have the rendering glitches

48:55.900 --> 49:00.940
Um, it has some other issues and then ubuntu gnome looks perfect

49:01.340 --> 49:04.860
It absolutely looks perfect. There is no rendering issues whatsoever

49:05.660 --> 49:10.380
But as soon as you launch any application the whole thing dies on its ass and it only works

49:10.380 --> 49:15.820
It only works in classic mode. Oh, okay. So, you know these these drivers are

49:16.360 --> 49:23.580
Evolving so they'll get there in in in due course, but it kind of whet my appetite. So i've i've now started

49:24.520 --> 49:26.640
Experimenting with some of the other acceleration

49:27.420 --> 49:30.140
Uh facilities that are available on the raspberry pi

49:30.940 --> 49:32.860
Two and well, in fact all the raspberry pies

49:32.860 --> 49:38.320
But obviously i'm targeting the the two and the three because of the ubuntu base supporting that architecture

49:38.320 --> 49:45.680
And uh, so i'm now working on uh video playback acceleration and that's a much happier story

49:46.720 --> 49:52.160
Now this could be huge because uh, a lot of people that i've heard in the audience that have tried the pie

49:52.960 --> 50:00.320
For a media center said it is great. It is great when you're watching sd content or 720p content, but

50:02.080 --> 50:05.600
You get up to around 1080p and it starts to be a different story

50:05.600 --> 50:09.280
And it has made the pie sort of unattractive to me as a cody box

50:09.680 --> 50:11.680
Uh, and you know to be honest with you

50:11.920 --> 50:15.280
Even as a production box because if I can't get 1080p playback

50:15.280 --> 50:19.520
Then I can't capture at 1080 and that's no good because that's what we capture at here locally

50:19.920 --> 50:25.680
Um, and so it's sort of eliminated as a possibility as even something I could have as an extra studio computer

50:27.520 --> 50:32.560
Yeah, and and the other issue is is that if you have a dedicated um media center

50:32.560 --> 50:40.260
Uh application such as um cody running on something like open elec it works very well

50:40.740 --> 50:42.100
um

50:42.100 --> 50:45.460
And I agree on the older models of the raspberry pi

50:46.340 --> 50:47.620
um

50:47.620 --> 50:54.180
You could comfortably do 720p and depending on the bit rate it would do 1080p. Yeah, i've never tried on the three though

50:55.300 --> 50:58.740
Yeah, yeah. So this is this is what i've been playing with just recently

50:59.540 --> 51:01.540
and uh

51:01.540 --> 51:03.540
It's looking really good. So

51:04.180 --> 51:08.260
There's a guy in the ubuntu mate community called

51:09.280 --> 51:10.740
arrowan

51:10.740 --> 51:16.040
Who posted a load of tips and tricks on how to compile various things with acceleration?

51:16.820 --> 51:20.820
For the raspberry pi 3 so i'm going through his stuff and sort of

51:21.300 --> 51:26.820
Piecing it together and filling in the blanks and what i've got going at the moment is I have um

51:26.820 --> 51:33.460
A vlc fully accelerated. Yes for the raspberry pi 2 and the raspberry pi 3. Yes

51:33.940 --> 51:39.460
And that's properly great. So that's using the open max api

51:39.940 --> 51:46.500
Which is the same api that things like cody on the raspberry pi use and the omx player use

51:46.900 --> 51:51.940
so although you've got the user interface for vlc you launch the

51:51.940 --> 51:57.380
Um, you know pick your media player and set it playing and it immediately goes full screen

51:57.940 --> 52:04.660
And you just use the keyboard bindings to then control the playback, but it is absolutely super slick and it is

52:05.140 --> 52:07.620
It's super smooth and it works perfectly man

52:07.620 --> 52:12.900
That's going to have big that could have a big impact for people that are using the raspberry pi in a battery situation

52:13.220 --> 52:15.860
Which uh, I I could I could see a lot of people doing

52:16.660 --> 52:18.660
Yeah, I mean i've got one of these um

52:18.660 --> 52:24.900
Atrix laptops and right running on that. Yes, it's like a portable media player now. It looks fantastic

52:24.980 --> 52:27.780
It's got an hdmi screen hdmi audio

52:28.580 --> 52:33.380
Can run it off a battery. It's got a built-in battery that can power the pie. It runs for about 10 hours

52:33.700 --> 52:34.900
It's just fantastic

52:34.900 --> 52:38.500
Producer q5 sis has one of those atrix docs and I borrowed it for like ever from him

52:38.580 --> 52:40.580
I think I think I gave it back to him now

52:40.580 --> 52:46.100
Uh, and it is ideal. It is ideal for the raspberry pi if you could have just a way to to attach it

52:46.100 --> 52:48.820
Um, and I could you know for me

52:49.860 --> 52:54.660
I something I could I could easily connect to like different tvs in the home or in the office

52:55.380 --> 52:56.900
That would then have fully

52:56.900 --> 53:02.740
Accelerated playback that is a that is a big deal now. Is it just in vlc wimpy or is it other applications as well?

53:03.460 --> 53:05.860
Yes, i've started to branch out into other stuff

53:06.020 --> 53:11.860
So the thing about vlc is that in the past we've only been able to offer omx player, which is a command line utility

53:11.860 --> 53:17.940
So there's a barrier to entry there. So now having vlc you can you know, right click on things launch in vlc

53:18.020 --> 53:21.140
And it will just start playing or you can do it through the vlc ui

53:21.940 --> 53:23.300
but um

53:23.300 --> 53:28.580
Uh this evening i've got um a build of ffmpeg

53:29.140 --> 53:33.060
Which is fully accelerated for the there we go. Yeah. Yeah. No

53:34.740 --> 53:38.180
No, this is neat and that uses a different

53:38.180 --> 53:44.980
Uh api this uses the uh ml which is the multimedia abstraction layer for the video core

53:45.540 --> 53:46.420
chip

53:46.420 --> 53:47.380
and

53:47.380 --> 53:53.140
So you can use ffplay for example to for a command line to launch your content and that's windowed

53:53.300 --> 53:58.200
So you can do it in full screen or you can have it in windowed and that all is fully accelerated

53:58.500 --> 54:04.820
And I will confirm i've even seen a screenshot that actually confirms it is actually real which is yeah. Yes. Yeah

54:04.820 --> 54:08.020
Yeah, yeah screen screenshot. Sorry. It didn't happen. Yeah, right

54:09.060 --> 54:13.940
So the next step is uh, I should be able to compile

54:14.640 --> 54:17.800
Mpv and link against that version of ffmpeg

54:17.940 --> 54:23.240
To give a fully accelerated mpv now, would you ship that in 1604?

54:23.780 --> 54:29.860
I don't know if i'll install these things by default ffmpeg will be included by default. Definitely vlc will

54:29.860 --> 54:36.520
Uh mpv will be so, uh, the way that the build works is that there's a ppa stacked on top

54:37.240 --> 54:39.240
So, uh, if you installed mpv

54:39.960 --> 54:46.840
On one of those ubuntu flavors built with the ubuntu pi flavor maker you would get the accelerated version of mpv

54:47.800 --> 54:49.000
and

54:49.000 --> 54:52.360
I'm I i'm fairly confident I can get mpv working

54:52.920 --> 54:58.040
And then the final step is to then build an accelerated version of kodi

54:58.040 --> 55:05.100
Um, oh nice. Yes, which of course loads of distributions have as you know, a a dedicated

55:05.400 --> 55:07.400
You know kodi box

55:07.480 --> 55:13.320
Uh, my idea is just to build kodi in the desktop, you know version so you can run it window

55:13.640 --> 55:18.040
Well, maybe window maybe full screen i'm not quite sure which which api to use yet

55:18.440 --> 55:22.060
But the idea is is to have kodi as an install option that's fully accelerated

55:23.240 --> 55:27.080
That would be splendid this because everyone wants that you are

55:27.080 --> 55:29.880
That's a tool tool. So i'll see you like that

55:30.040 --> 55:33.720
If you get this if you pull this off and I know you know, everything is subject to change

55:33.800 --> 55:35.800
But if you pull this off, uh

55:36.440 --> 55:39.160
You what you are going to do is you are going to apply

55:39.560 --> 55:46.040
Bacon grease to the already incredible momentum that ubuntu mate has for the raspberry platform raspberry pi platform

55:46.360 --> 55:50.120
Uh if this if these having if if I knew

55:50.680 --> 55:53.640
If if I knew that there was a distro out there that I just downloaded

55:53.640 --> 55:57.240
And ffmpeg was already patched to be hardware accelerated on the raspberry pi

55:57.800 --> 56:02.200
That would always be the distribution. I download that would that you seal the deal right there

56:02.280 --> 56:09.560
You already it becomes it becomes the premiere the ubuntu the mate desktop, which is obvious on a raspberry pi 3. That's obvious

56:10.440 --> 56:16.440
combined with hardware accelerated ffmpeg or maybe even vlc and and and

56:16.920 --> 56:18.920
Heaven's be perhaps kodi. Yeah

56:18.920 --> 56:23.960
Whoa, this would be an un this would be an an obvious

56:24.920 --> 56:30.040
Premier distribution for the raspberry pi and turns out there's a lot of raspberry pies out there

56:30.680 --> 56:36.360
Is this your goal or are you just I mean this seems like almost like evil mastermind level, uh, planning

56:37.160 --> 56:41.080
No, this is this is answering what the community has asked for

56:41.640 --> 56:42.520
so

56:42.520 --> 56:47.080
uh, the first goal was to make ubuntu mate, um

56:47.080 --> 56:48.840
as

56:48.840 --> 56:55.080
Useful to the makers as raspbian is so i've got lots of friends who make stuff with the raspberry pi

56:55.640 --> 56:57.320
And you know, they've got

56:57.320 --> 56:58.440
This is all alien to me

56:58.440 --> 57:05.560
They've got breadboards and they've got widgets and wires and things and they glue it all together and they make stuff work

57:05.960 --> 57:12.920
One of my friends albert made a mind mind controlled game with the raspberry pi imagine that so a headband

57:12.920 --> 57:19.720
You put on your head and you think like flappy birds you think up down and it responds to your thoughts to play the game

57:19.880 --> 57:25.000
So, you know epic epic levels of makers combine that with vr and you got my attention

57:25.320 --> 57:28.440
Yeah, so when when I ask albert, you know does this work?

57:29.320 --> 57:33.400
I've got to the point where albert is satisfied that all of the stuff he needs to do

57:33.640 --> 57:38.440
And and isaac as well. All of these guys are from the pi podcast. They're the presenters on the pi podcast

57:38.440 --> 57:45.800
They're like the unofficial official ubuntu mate test team. So when they tell me stuff works, i'm fairly confident it works

57:45.880 --> 57:48.620
So i've kind of got all of that gpio

57:49.560 --> 57:52.680
maker level stuff working really well now

57:53.240 --> 57:58.940
And the next thing that everyone is asking for is they want kodi they want vlc

57:59.800 --> 58:03.080
They want it accelerated. So that's what we're trying to do

58:03.080 --> 58:09.720
So definitely we've got vlc done that's in the bag. We've definitely got ffmpeg that's in the bag

58:10.440 --> 58:17.560
Um an ffmpeg is there because we use that with the youtube downloader, which is but got the gooey built in

58:18.280 --> 58:19.560
and and

58:19.560 --> 58:26.440
Next is to try and ace kodi and I make no promises about that because i've tried several times in the past and flat out failed

58:27.000 --> 58:31.960
We'll see how we go. Hey, at least you're trying I guess well that is that is quite the update

58:31.960 --> 58:35.160
Uh, that is that is really great. I boy i'm excited about that

58:35.880 --> 58:42.920
um, you know, I I am uh, so i've been for for weeks now i've been using uh plasma desktop on ubuntu, um

58:44.120 --> 58:46.120
And for the last two i've been using it on 1604

58:46.840 --> 58:51.560
And uh now i'm switching over to unity i'm going to be running on unity until until final comes out

58:52.440 --> 58:58.040
But I wouldn't be surprised if the one I end up on is the ubuntu mate 1604 on the apollo

58:58.040 --> 59:03.800
Well, that just makes sense. And then when I run it on my raspberry pi 3 same exact setup. I love it wimpy

59:03.880 --> 59:05.320
That's pretty cool

59:05.320 --> 59:06.280
Yeah

59:06.280 --> 59:13.160
Thank you. That's so yeah. Thank you to everyone who contributed to the project in the last month. It was really great. So we shifted

59:13.940 --> 59:18.040
55 terabytes of downloads of raspberry pi images in march

59:18.760 --> 59:21.560
What are you using to distribute 55? What did you say?

59:22.340 --> 59:24.340
55 terabytes. Yeah

59:24.520 --> 59:27.240
What are you using to do that just for the raspberry pi

59:27.240 --> 59:32.760
We've got um three servers and two of them are responsible for for shifting that data

59:32.840 --> 59:38.440
Holy smoke one in canada and one in france. You should maybe talk to alan because uh,

59:39.000 --> 59:42.040
You need to move. Yeah, maybe yeah, holy smokes

59:42.600 --> 59:46.680
Uh as somebody who moves many terabytes of data a month, too. Um

59:48.600 --> 59:53.720
There are not many independent shops that are able to move that much data I am extremely impressed

59:53.720 --> 59:57.160
I thought I was one of the only that got away with that. So that is

59:58.100 --> 01:00:03.720
Unbelievable, that's the easy bit because you know doing large scale server stuff. That's my day job

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:08.120
I can do that all day long accelerating video playback and

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:13.800
You know plugging things into gpio ports not not so hot at that that that takes a bit more time

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:20.840
Yeah, but you're doing it. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Well slowly baby steps. Yeah. Oh shoot. I was just trying to look uh,

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:24.200
It's no longer. Hmm. It doesn't seem that alan no longer

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:29.480
He doesn't put it in there anymore alan used to put the total terabyte of transfer in the invoice

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:31.560
But I don't see it

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.360
But uh, yeah, it's a it's a pretty significant amount of terabytes per month

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.480
And so that's that's impressive wimpy just for the raspberry pi too. That's

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.880
Yikes, all right. Well, uh, i'll tell you what i'm gonna take a minute and tell you about my mobile service provider tang

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.680
You know i'm going on a road trip west road trip road trip

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.720
Everybody go to linux.ting.com real quick once you i'm going on a road trip

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.720
So you know what i'm gonna do before I go on my road trip

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:57.480
You know what I do. This is legit. I log into my ting dashboard and I go turn on my mi-fi line

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:00.040
And then I have a mi-fi

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.480
Yeah, it's easy. Wow. And then when i'm when i'm back from the road trip, you know what I do

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:05.880
I log in with the ting dashboard. I turn off my mi-fi

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.760
That's that's your boop was better than my boop. Thank you. That was a really good. That's your is that your first boop?

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:16.680
I think so. That was solid linux.ting.com go there and save 25 off your first device now

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:20.120
Why ting? Well, that is easy. No contract

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:26.920
No early termination fee and ladies and gentlemen, you only pay for what you use six dollars for the line

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.160
So I got I when I activate

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.280
So do your boop boop. No. Oh, come on. That was boop when I activate the mi-fi

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:40.120
That's six dollars a month and then my usage on top of that and then when I deactivate the mi-fi boop

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:42.920
No, no. Wow, you peaked dude you boop

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:48.840
Uh when I did when I deactivate the mi-fi then I don't pay for it at all

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.520
This is really nice. So I generally have about three active devices

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.800
So i'm paying six dollars a month for each line and then my usage on top of that minutes messages and megabytes

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:04.760
Well, guess what? We've got wi-fi right here at the jupiter broadcasting studios and guess what? I've got wi-fi at home

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:11.160
And i've got wi-fi when I go to angela's house. I've got wi-fi when I go see my dentist even my dentist has wi-fi, dude

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:17.480
Dude my dentist. Um, there is a grocery store up in the city that I live in that has wi-fi

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.920
The leconner grocery store has wi-fi. Wow. Yeah

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.960
I tell you wi-fi everywhere. Well, no

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:30.040
No, I don't and that's why I have ting because when i'm not on wi-fi I can choose between gsm or cdma networks

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:30.840
They're like, yeah

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.480
I look at my cellular data sort of like my backup data when I need it and I primarily and that

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:41.000
I because of that and rikai. He's rikai. He's like that beard is like a ninja dude

01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:45.160
It like it like soaks up wi-fi signals. It's like a booster. So

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:51.560
Between them between us with three lines. We're doing like 37 bucks this month for our ting line. It's ridiculous

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:57.800
Uh, and then you combine with that dashboard ting is an unbelievable deal and great customer service

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:02.040
They got like these fanatical customer support reps that are going to talk to you. They're going to work with you

01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:06.760
They'll stay on the line. They'll talk to you until the tilts completely resolved my first road trip. I went on

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.840
I had like a little uh sim smid mix-up or whatever

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:14.360
I don't even remember anymore because it was a while ago, but when I was going over to noah's house for the uh,

01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:18.760
When he for the uh for the uh for the tour of his house with all the tech he had in there

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.400
I my my first day on the road or a couple days into it

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:26.440
I had to like troubleshoot some sort of sim issue. I don't remember what it was now and uh

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:32.360
Uh, there was legitimately a point 45 minutes into the call where I thought they were like gonna like well, mr

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.960
Fisher, thank you for you know, blah blah and I was like because there's nothing we can do

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.240
Yeah, I was like look you've done everything you can i've done everything I can

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.920
I understand at some point in time you got to move on and this is totally cool

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.640
And dude, I kid you not they stuck with me for another 25 minutes and uh, they went they went they went above and beyond

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:54.120
Uh, and they really the problem got resolved and I was back online good to go. I mean

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:59.160
It was like and when they had and like I think at one point like they had to call someone and they put me on

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:03.160
Hold and and then let me listen in on their call to them and I could hear them like telling them

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:08.760
What what was up and it was yeah, they were really cool. Uh, and then later on they sent me a postcard

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.080
A postcard a postcard. That was pretty cool. Uh, so and they do that

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.880
They I guess they do that from time to time go check them out go over there

01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.640
Look at all the great devices they have they also on their blog just recently put up a post

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:27.160
I love long reviews a long review is the best kind of not these reviews where they get them five days before the device is

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.600
out for the public

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:32.920
Uh, but these reviews my month with the moto x pure edition that just went up on the ting blog

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.460
Go check them out linux.ting.com and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.240
the unplugged program

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:45.800
Linux.ting.com. Thanks you guys for going there and supporting the show by checking them out. So mr. Wes I

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.520
I am surprised almost every week

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:53.240
It seems at least for the last few weeks we have found a reason for you to have to format your hard drive and try out

01:04:53.240 --> 01:05:01.080
Yet another off the wall linux distribution long serving hard drive. Yeah, and this week is no different. We're going to call it. I think um,

01:05:02.820 --> 01:05:05.880
Apricity apricity os apricity os

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.440
Uh, and it is arch based

01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:15.080
And a gnome based desktop or cinnamon. Thank you, and it uses the power. Oh jesus going so fast

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:22.700
I can't read the power line shell. Uh, it's a modern intuitive operating system with the cloud integration designed for the cloud generation

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:28.520
And by that they mean it it ships with a lot of interesting defaults. Uh, one of them being pushbullet

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:33.320
So your android notifications are synced between you and your device

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.960
That is that is kind of handy, uh, you know

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:40.760
There's other there's other actually kind of rather nice things like they ship it with play on linux included by default

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:44.040
In fact, it's it's rather stacked all together all things

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.920
uh, it ships with a tlp for uh,

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:51.800
Battery management installed by default sync thing is installed by default. I've got it

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:57.000
I'm already syncing with my really with my droplet. Yep. Google chrome is installed by default not chromium

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:00.840
um, it also has uh, uh, well

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:07.000
A rather design heavy desktop. I have it running here in a virtual machine west has it there running on a desktop

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.560
So if you're watching the video version i'm gonna pull it up here

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.480
So you guys can just kind of see here. Let me

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:16.520
Log in with my super secure. I have like a demo review password that I use. It's funny

01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.880
So i'll zoom out a little bit I apologize here, you know what I will remote in

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.840
And uh, I will i'll turn off the lower third just for a second

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:27.560
So you guys can see the whole uh, you can see the whole desktop there

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:32.840
So there you can see I have it running in boxes under my kde desktop here. I'll go full screen

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.440
Why not what could go wrong?

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:39.000
And it kind of reminds me almost immediately of elementary os because it has a dock along the bottom

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.480
It has the transparent top pretty clean. Yeah

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:47.400
Um, but what do you think west so as somebody who doesn't uh, your daily driver doesn't run arch

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:53.720
But you've probably ran arch on many occasions everything else in my life mostly does. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's nice

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:59.640
I'm i'm enjoying it. I've kind of already got everything replaced. I'm you know doing the show from and i've got irc back up

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:03.800
Uh, it was very easy to get installed and going and since it's arch

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:08.760
Uh, you know, you can just one tick enable the aur in their little add or remove software

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.040
Or I can have pacman on the command line like i'm always used to

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.040
now, um

01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.760
You and I both thought the installer was pretty nice pretty clean

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.640
Did you recognize that as an installer from anything else?

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.760
I didn't either. I didn't recognize it now

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:27.880
It felt so well done that it must have it felt like it must be a fork of

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:32.440
And the only reason i'm saying this is because it usually takes a couple of years for an installer to be pretty well

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:37.000
Flushed out to be one of those areas. Yeah. Yeah, and uh, this seemed like

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:42.920
a pretty spot-on good installer and it handled, uh my partitioning just fine it

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.680
The only thing it didn't do that, you know

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:50.120
I've come to expect from a modern day installer is it didn't appropriately detect my time zone. Oh, yeah

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.840
Yeah, it didn't didn't for me either. But yeah, but let me set it. I mean that would probably yeah, exactly

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:59.320
Super easy. It's not a big deal. But I mean that's just like one grub screen was really nice polished

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:02.360
It found my other and so did you know because i'm writing a vm

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.680
I might not I might not begin the same experience as you did

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:08.920
But if for mine my grub screen kind of in fact, I could reboot right now and just show the audience

01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:14.600
Uh, my grub screen kind of looks like the gnome 3 login screen like it's that same color and that tech that great textures

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:18.280
That would all right. Yeah, so right there so it kind of and then when it boots up

01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:22.440
That's the same color and the same general look you're going to get your login screen

01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:29.480
Now I don't get I just get a text boot here. Do you get any kind of graphical like a plinth type boot? And you know

01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:34.360
I'm not sure you haven't rebooted yet. Well, I did once but yeah nonsense then. Yeah. Okay, that's fine

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:40.280
Yeah, so it's um apricity I guess it's kind of a new distro

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:45.080
Based on arch. It does have its own repos. I haven't really dug into that too much

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:49.400
I probably should because that's always kind of an achilles heel of these kinds of things but

01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:53.420
These this is an interesting trend where you have these super design distributions

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.520
And I think that was kind of what I found to be interesting about this

01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:01.160
So you got solace right? You got elementary os those are kind of two of the jump to mine

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.160
But there's many others that are very design heavy

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:10.600
And x-metal says that it reminds him of in a mix between elementary and antigross which I could see that too because it's similar to

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:16.440
the arc theme which reminds me a bit of the bungee desktop and it's similar to antigross because it's

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:19.560
Arch base. Yes, and they're using yeah, it looks like they're using

01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:24.120
West do you remember the name of the shell that they have here? They have power line. Yeah, okay

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:31.080
So they have power line installed by default, which is interesting because that's kind of a a jazzed up bash shell there and it's um

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.600
It makes it is it yeah, I don't know if you're watching the video version

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:40.120
But it makes it look a little nicer than normal and um, so if I if I go into downloads here

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.560
Oh, look at that. That's cute. Uh, you see that

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:49.240
Oh, look at that. That's cute. Uh, you see how the uh, my path is in the yeah

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:53.960
Yeah, isn't that it's kind of neat. It's very clean. It's very easy to read

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.240
Um, and uh, yeah, that's just something there's a lot of little things like this that they've done by by default

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.680
They make it a very well, I mean i'm actually making a very attractive desktop

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:07.480
They have like telegram right in their own repo. There's a binary so we got that. Oh, really?

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:10.520
Yeah, I don't know what else they have already. No, I guess I can just get that from the aur though

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:15.000
Yeah, they also have a graphical package manager that is is

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:19.560
Actually kind of palatable. So search telegram there. You'll see I think you'll see them both. Oh, okay

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.880
Okay, telegram. Let's take a look. Oh telegram with an e now. Did you know they spell with an e now?

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.520
I don't see it in here

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:31.000
No, you're a big you're a liar. Oh, okay. Well, maybe you have to you might have to enable aur and

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:40.040
Let's check this out. Check this out. They're using this gtk3 front end to lib alpm, which

01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:46.920
Essentially gives you a graphical package manager for pacman and it even gives you the ability to install local alpm packages

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.960
Which is really kind of an interesting thing for an art user. Yeah

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:56.200
So this is a gtk3 interface to the package manager that they ship here. They've got caffeine just by default

01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:01.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I bet they have a you know, what if we launch gnome tweak, which they also have in the dock

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.080
Right. Yeah by default. I bet you we have quite a bit of extensions in here. Wow

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:12.600
Yeah, always zoom workspaces caffeine dash to dock flippery move clock media player indicator

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:16.280
Places status indicator. Yeah, there's a bunch in here wes

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:20.600
But you know what to be honest with you. These are actually all all of these

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
In fact, there's even a couple I would add

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.640
Um, these are all good. Um, these are actually all great

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:32.520
Uh, in fact, I know some of the people that make some of these and these and they're they're all really dedicated people

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:39.160
So these are all really high quality extensions. Um, so and then again, this is these are all these are really good defaults

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:45.320
Uh, it's kind of it's kind of interesting and one of the other things that they're doing that I find to be interesting

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.480
Is this is a patreon?

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:48.680
Yeah, they've got a patreon

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:53.160
this is a patreon fund and they've only got a few backers right now because it's early and I imagine this concept too is

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.560
kind of odd for a lot of people but uh,

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.520
I I don't know. I find it to be really neat

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:04.840
I I kind of i'm if I wasn't in the midst of my like 1604 mega, uh deep dive I would be

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.480
You know, I guess to put it another way when I go back on my arch binge

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:14.680
I might be tempted to go this route. The only thing i'm gonna have to spend time is I gotta look into uh,

01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:19.800
Uh, what what always maybe you could check for me if you don't mind. Yeah, sure. Um

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.420
How are those gnome extensions coming from their repository?

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:30.120
Uh, what what all is coming from the repository because when gnome, uh 3.22 comes out

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:37.560
That crap's gonna break and that is always what what sort of dooms those arch-based gnome desktops in the long term

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:41.160
Is when they pull too much from their own private repository, but like yeah

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.560
So they have they have that fancy bash terminal installed, which is really nice. They uh,

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:53.720
They also have pre-built several packages like telegram in their user repository play on is installed steam is pre-installed obviously then wine

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.800
Because you have play on is pre-installed

01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:57.560
um

01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:02.280
It's an interesting arch-based distribution. Has anyone in the mumble room played with this one? I doubt it

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:05.800
It's pretty new apricity. I think is how you say apricity os

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:09.560
They have a cinnamon edition available as well, which neither one of us gave a shot

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:17.000
Okay, I mean i'm not seeing too much here's a list of everything in apricity core i've got installed. Okay, give it to me

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:20.120
Um, they've got like a bunch of themes other icons

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:28.040
Uh some broadcom at 10k drivers bt sync cower gnome terminal google chrome google talk plugin

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:32.520
That kind of stuff, uh pack aur so just kind of their own

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:39.160
their own modifications, uh, but it's not very much and it's none of the gnome stuff bitten mentions in the chat room real-time follow-up that that

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:46.600
Gdk3 gooey for the package managers that I was loving there that uh that pacman front end is what mangero uses. Oh, yeah

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.760
Uh, okay. Well, I I don't i'm not sensing a huge interest in this

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:55.240
Um, even though I actually think this is kind of a fascinating distribution. I will just wrap with this

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:58.280
Um, they're focusing on web apps

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:03.400
In a way that i've actually recently become a little more uh hip to myself

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:11.480
I've been using google chrome's uh create create it like what does google chrome call it when you go in here you can say um,

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.720
You know there's a way to isn't there a way to yeah like a way to make this a

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:21.320
Save uh add or save page as or add to desktop or something like that add to desktop and it makes it a desktop application

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.240
Right. Okay add to desktop makes it yeah, so that's a way to make it a desktop application

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.320
Right. Okay add to desktop makes it yeah, so they are shipping something called ice

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:35.320
It lets you put your favorite web app on the desktop a simple ssb a site specific browser manager

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:40.680
These specialized browsers are minimize the number of steps between you and wanting to use your favorite web app. They say

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.080
Uh, it embodies our vision here at apricity

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:47.640
We want to help your make your workspace and your play space more productive and elegant

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.520
Now as someone who has fallen into using an online markdown editor a lot

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:56.440
Not always an online document program google docs

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.440
Um an online chat program, uh irc cloud from time to time or matter most or slack

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:07.640
It starts to make a lot of sense to have these be separate processes that show up as separate icons in my task manager

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.600
See what i'm what i'm seeing is this seems like a great

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:15.240
It's such an easy thing to slot into you got syncing right? So bam you're syncing with yourself

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.600
You've got your key pass. You've got whatever you need now. You're signed into chrome

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:22.520
You're signed into your accounts. You make web apps for slack for telegram

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.000
And you've got your full desktop experience in like 10 minutes on a fresh install

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:32.200
They also say a fresh install usually idles after everything's up and running around 500 megabytes of usage

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:37.080
Which really isn't too bad. They focus on battery usage with tlp installed by default

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:44.440
Push bullet for integration with your android device to get notification notifications texts and phone calls across all your devices

01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.120
Uh sync thing like west just managed also sp backup

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:54.680
Which is uh, kind of a nice backup program that allows you to do both compressed and uncompressed backups and split uncompressed backups

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:57.480
And like multiple parts if you want to do it across like thumb drives or something

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:00.520
uh, you can do scheduled backups and manual backups with it and

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:04.200
Also backups to remote destinations and they've built it in

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.480
Right there installed by default

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:09.880
and then like earlier mentioned the power line shell, which is the

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:13.240
pretty nice terminal prompt

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:18.360
Uh, it looks really it looks really classy. They've gone throughout and made sure that the things are

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:22.040
Well rendered under high dpi

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.000
And I like their defaults, you know

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.600
They're using gnome photos for your photos gnome music for your music gnome calendar for your calendar

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.800
They got steam installed by default. They got a library office installed by default

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:38.600
And like, you know other things like we mentioned so I it seems like a really cool project that's really thinking about this stuff

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:43.000
Uh, and you know arch base which kind of gets my attention down the road, I think so apricity

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
We'll have a link in the show notes apricity os.com

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:47.400
If you guys want to check it out

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:50.360
Derek delvin, you had to mention about chromium embedded framework. Go ahead

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:59.800
I don't hear you. I guess he did have a he did have a comment. Yeah, he did. It's fine. It's fine

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:05.480
Um, uh, I think these in web apps, uh inclusion into the desktop are natural

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:09.100
Evolution of the chromium embedded framework. I mean google did this

01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:16.380
Uh simplify you development. I mean if you think atom brackets those editors are using that principle

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:22.140
But I guess it's time that we before we start just jumping on board and this start making the question

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:28.220
Aren't our browsers already doing quite a lot and do we really want to be in this completely remote?

01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:34.220
So the application can run somewhere else and you just get that face. No, no, no, no, but in some cases, yes

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:39.740
Yes, yeah in some cases, especially for stuff. I don't care a lot about the south is not super important

01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:42.540
Yeah, I think so, right? Yeah

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:47.980
Um, but yeah, that's a good question patreon.com slash apricity. They have four patrons right now. They're making 30 bucks a month

01:17:48.540 --> 01:17:50.540
I doubt that's covering much

01:17:51.020 --> 01:17:56.220
Yeah, I doubt I doubt so but that's a it's an interesting try and so, uh, i'm glad you installed a west

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:58.300
Yeah, we'll see. I might just be using it next week as well

01:17:58.300 --> 01:18:04.460
I'm not seeing I mean I can mount my other one if I need it. I'm not seeing a lot of reason to go back

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:09.660
Do you uh like the performance on the physical hardware performance is okay on the spot there? Yeah, absolutely

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:15.020
I mean I it's I suspended it all the way here. Things are working great. Yeah. Yeah, you know wes

01:18:15.100 --> 01:18:19.020
I think we should take a moment and we should thank linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:22.540
Now all of us know that if you really want to get a great job

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:25.180
You're probably going to have to have a few certifications under your belt

01:18:25.180 --> 01:18:29.100
Also, it's kind of nice as personal challenges and it's also helps at review time

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:32.460
Linux academy has had a ton of success in the last few months

01:18:32.860 --> 01:18:34.860
Uh, I I mean they have had success for

01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:39.840
A lot longer than that, but they've been publishing it on their blogs in the last few months and really sort of demonstrating

01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:44.060
What a difference people can see when they go to linux academy

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:50.620
Especially when they're looking to learn something around linux or aws other learning sites. They don't quite get it right

01:18:50.620 --> 01:18:57.980
They don't quite have the passion and the drive to actually care enough to understand the difference between red hat enterprise linux and fedora

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:02.060
Or debian and ubuntu there are differences, you know

01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:06.380
There are but they can barely even understand what they are. That's not linux academy

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:12.620
Linux academy is a platform designed by people that are extremely passionate about linux and wanted to sort of promote it

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:15.340
In a way that would get wider adoption for linux

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:20.220
They came together with educators and professionals and developers and created the linux academy platform

01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:25.340
Linux academy.com slash unplugged go there support this show and give yourself a discount

01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:27.980
you know

01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:32.140
I think also one of the things you might take for granted about linux academy because it

01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:35.900
It's a website. You probably think it's only useful when you have an internet connection

01:19:36.220 --> 01:19:39.340
But if you're going to be offline like i'm about to be for several days

01:19:39.980 --> 01:19:44.540
Uh, they have downloadable comprehensive study guides. They have pdfs for reading wow

01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:49.340
They have audio and video stuff that you can get while you're offline as well

01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:51.340
Uh listener seth

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:53.500
Listens in the shower

01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:58.540
He's not bringing his laptop in there. He's got a plane through his speaker system while he's in the shower. That's awesome

01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:03.420
Yeah, I know it is kind of awesome. Uh, and that's a really nice functionality of linux. They also have of course

01:20:03.820 --> 01:20:04.300
Yeah, okay

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:09.340
So they so on the other end they also have live events and you can ask instructors questions and they have instructor mentoring and

01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:16.220
All of that and they have an active forums. It's packed full of jupiter broadcasting members. They have great courseware on red hat. I mean

01:20:16.220 --> 01:20:20.300
I mean noah is all about the red hat enterprise certified like

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:25.660
Administrator and engineer and he's always yeah. Well and the clients love it man

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:28.220
That's I mean, I don't know how much noah is into it

01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:32.780
I mean, I think he respects red hat as a company, but it's the clients that really want it

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:34.940
And it's the same when you're trying to get a job

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:37.020
Uh, and so that's why he pursues it and you know

01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:42.620
He's done a lot of different avenues and red hat is totally is a seriously respected certification

01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:47.820
And their courseware at linux academy is top notch also on the aws stuff on the front of aws

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:51.980
just when I started getting into like s3 and storing my uh,

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:58.140
Web assets and like the complicated system that they have for it and it's like, okay i've got this

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:01.980
I don't need any courseware on this right? I mastered this on my own

01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:06.700
Okay, so then I went further and a client needed a windows 2003 server

01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:13.820
And well, you know what i'm an aws expert now i'll go set this up for you. Yeah, I had um

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:16.620
I had like a couple of weeks of like, you know

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:20.940
Going back and forth with the client and citing how we were going to do what and what was going to run

01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:26.380
Where and all me all all in the meanwhile this brand new server I set up for them was running on aws

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.540
and uh

01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:34.620
I didn't I didn't quite grok the fact that that was like like costing me like this as the cpu runs

01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:36.620
it costs me money like

01:21:36.860 --> 01:21:43.280
Per cycle it costs money like unbelievable right unbelievable. They're charging me per cpu cycle unbelievable

01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:45.980
Who even tracks that is what I was thinking?

01:21:46.060 --> 01:21:51.260
So I got this bill and i'm like, uh, yeah, you know that server that we haven't even deployed to production yet

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:56.060
We're already paying for it. Sorry, and I was using that time to learn the system too

01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:58.700
Kind of you know at the same time

01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:01.900
That's a podcaster folks. Yeah

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:03.900
Yeah

01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:09.820
Linux academy.com slash unplugged when you go there and you're going through one of their courses or they have a scenario

01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:14.620
Or a live lab they'll spin up the aws instance for you and manage all of that

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.700
So you don't get stuck with that fine

01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:23.580
Uh, they also have android development courses php python ruby the whole dev ops category chef is their chef tutorials are very helpful

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:30.620
Dude, they're linux basics and all of that and they have like nuggets on ip tables and net tables and fire and tables

01:22:30.620 --> 01:22:36.380
whatever it's called now and filter all the things all the things ssh all the things really they have great nuggets, too

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:38.860
If you just have a little bit of time and you want to just do a deep dive

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:46.220
So go check them out linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and avoid that huge bill that uh that I got I got one day

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:52.060
Okay, so there was a thread over on our linux that kind of got me wondering, uh, it said is you know

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:54.380
What's the state of vr?

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:57.260
Uh for the for the linux desktop, uh, what do we have?

01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:01.980
I3 on multiple monitors those kind of things and there was a couple of different answers that came out of the thread

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.780
But one of them west was kind of intriguing

01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:10.560
It was a qt5 or qt5 based 3d wayland compositor

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.940
Oh snap. Yeah

01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:19.100
So what this now this is totally early days, but what they have designed is sort of a wolfenstein style

01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:23.020
layout of a of a map and in

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:29.280
In each room is a different virtual desktop. So when you go between rooms you're going between virtual desktops

01:23:29.820 --> 01:23:34.940
And you have like different windows and then you can you know, you would have perhaps like a bot in there west

01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:39.260
You know about bots wait and you heard about bots. Yeah. Well, you could have a bot in there and things like that

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:43.180
So that's that's one representation of it

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:47.020
But there's there hasn't there's not a lot of progress

01:23:47.740 --> 01:23:50.780
There's not a lot of progress for the linux desktop. Um,

01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:57.580
Uh hololens sdk hackaday.io has a great one that they posted back in 2015

01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:01.580
Where they had like a couple of different a couple of different examples

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:05.600
That were that looked pretty exciting you put the headset on and now you're doing window management

01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:12.460
And again another room concept i've seen a bunch of different concepts ibx is one that runs on windows and linux

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.100
but maybe i'm just

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:22.780
Maybe i'm just smoking the hype too much wimpy. Do you think there will never be a real use case for vr on linux?

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.700
I'm a skeptic

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:35.500
Um, yeah, but i'm not much of a gamer either but I I don't know wearing a great big heavy thing on your head

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:40.220
People weren't prepared to wear glasses to watch 3d films

01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:44.380
But what about what about just the fact that it would be the world's largest monitor?

01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:50.060
Okay, think about that think about you know, 27 inch monitor 30. No the entire room is your screen

01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:57.580
But strapped to your head and also until they're completely wireless, you know, you're just tethered. You're just you know, like a pony, you know

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:02.220
A pony

01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:10.060
Okay, okay, okay. All right, mr. Skeptic, but okay. Okay, you're probably right actually i'm fairly skeptical myself

01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:15.340
I really i'm only playing devil's advocate. But what about something like a mumble room ask poppy?

01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:21.260
He's got a cancer argument. I'm sure poppy. Do you think we could have a vr desktop on linux in the future?

01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:24.780
Uh, what come on poppy, maybe you could maybe you could slap

01:25:25.340 --> 01:25:30.540
Your ubuntu phone into a google cardboard headset and now you are in vr

01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:33.100
unity

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:38.220
And you know they built in support for mirror too they've built support in the mirror for vr in the future

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:42.380
Oh poppy doesn't answer now. I guess he doesn't have an opinion. Sorry

01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:42.940
Go ahead

01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:47.020
I just left the room to make a cup of tea for my wife and all I heard when I got back to the microphone

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:51.820
Was poppy isn't answering so poppy that is you are such a romantic. You are a gentleman

01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:57.180
Uh, the question was is you know wimpy is sort of an on the record vr

01:25:57.660 --> 01:25:59.660
Um skeptic you could say

01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:05.980
And i'm somewhere in the middle. I'm sort of a vr hopeful but 10 trending skeptic

01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:11.660
What do you think? Uh, we're just talking about sort of the lack of a vr desktop, but there are a couple different projects

01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:18.700
They're mostly school projects that create a virtual linux desktop in vr. What about poppy? I'm just going to throw this out in your face

01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:21.260
ubuntu touch

01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:23.340
in a google cardboard headset

01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:27.260
ubuntu vr unity desktop your thoughts

01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.580
Can we get our existing desktop working first

01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:35.180
Ha ha ha great answer. That's a good answer. Well, okay

01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:37.900
We're gonna go 10 20 years and no we're gonna go five years in the future

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:41.740
Do you think there could be a vr desktop? I really feel like linux is missing out on vr

01:26:41.740 --> 01:26:44.380
But maybe i'm just sort of getting excited by

01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:49.900
I don't know the tweets of some people that are working on vr. I mean i'm just getting hyped

01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:57.820
I don't know. I see this as being a bit like the the tesla. It's something, you know quite desirable and

01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:03.020
And it might be useful for a small set of people on the planet, but for the vast majority of people

01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:08.860
They will almost never see this and therefore it won't be useful for them. Therefore. We shouldn't devote

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.820
99 of our developers sure sure that's it

01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:12.220
Okay

01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:16.380
And it seems like it'll start where a lot of things start where like first entertainment and then in like particular

01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:22.060
Power applications like cad modeling or you know, whatever where they really take advantage very

01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:24.940
Very specific 3d use cases for it

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:28.940
But then like if i'm looking at a document I can't

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:32.780
You know call me an old fart or lack of imagination

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:38.220
But I can't see how a libre office document can be improved by the adding of an extra dimension

01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:43.340
I agree with you there. I've already got that a plane in a third dimension if I just look at my life

01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:47.500
But I but you I could I could agree with you there, but there could be use cases

01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:50.780
I mean, I think of it as just more screen real estate to be honest with you

01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:56.140
And you're right and yeah being able to look behind things and look around things is is novel

01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:59.580
And we've seen demos of this for years and years that guy who strapped a couple of

01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:03.580
Wee motes to his head and did a nice demo of you know

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:08.620
being able to move your head from side to side and look around things and get a real parallax kind of view of

01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:11.980
Of things on your desktop. It looked interesting, but that was years and years ago

01:28:11.980 --> 01:28:15.600
And nobody ever did anything with it partly because it's kind of impractical

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:20.560
Would be coolest thing. Oh, sorry. Go ahead dear devin

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:27.440
So I think the use case for documents is when we have the natural voice commands working

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:33.600
So you're not necessarily writing the document. So a libre office the application definitely is not an application to benefit from it

01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:37.920
But let's say you are searching your computer and you're seeing the results

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.920
In a graph window and then you're seeing the other graph available to you

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:48.240
And whatever else and maybe you are actually projecting this to what is your reality?

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:52.560
So it's a more of an augmented reality than just virtual reality

01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:57.280
And now at that point that you're talking with your computer and you're getting the results and they're coming to you

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:01.760
I guess now you can have different ways of manipulating these data

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:06.880
Rather than think of the normal conventional applications with that we are talking about

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:10.400
I think the benefits will be in there. Hmm. So

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:16.320
So, you know you're looking at stock or you're looking at the company or you're doing your search and suddenly you are

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.140
With the data that you wanted for stocks for example for that application

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.200
And then you can do the math next to it and you can get the result, right?

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:28.160
producer q5 sister says that he thinks that

01:29:28.640 --> 01:29:33.360
Perhaps there could be an interesting use case in terms of interface for managing vms

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.880
Running a vm on a virtual computer in your vr world. So it's like you're really sitting at that virtual machine. Yeah

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.080
Huh?

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:43.600
Uh, well, it's a cinema killer as well. Yeah, it could be I agree

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:47.280
Now when I tried it on the the most low-end implementation of vr

01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:52.160
I've tried is on the samsung galaxy vr and to me it just seemed like a glorified way to watch great movies

01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.400
Yeah, but it was a great way to watch movies

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:56.640
Janus vr jn

01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:00.800
Us vr is something that already works on linux today

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:07.040
Uh, and it's what they say it combines the power of the internet with the potential of virtual reality

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:10.420
Websites become immersive spaces linked by portals

01:30:10.900 --> 01:30:15.700
Where users can explore collaborate and create content on a platform that builds upon the open internet?

01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:18.900
Um, and it's so retro in so many ways

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:23.140
It's like how we actually would have visualized the internet to work in the 80s when we did movies

01:30:23.300 --> 01:30:30.340
Yeah, right, uh where you go through portals to go to different rooms and there's avatars and people have keys and it is

01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:35.700
It is so neat in its in its in its intricacy

01:30:35.700 --> 01:30:39.080
But it is so impractical in its actual usability

01:30:39.540 --> 01:30:44.440
That I find it to be a fascinating experiment and it's using browser technology

01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:49.860
Now the hardware thing was you and I noticed when we were looking around it's like

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:54.660
It looks like nobody is taking the plunge on the linux side and just like

01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:59.220
Trying to see what works under linux. Yeah. Now the vive is just starting to ship but

01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:03.300
Everybody online right now is asking does the hdc vive work?

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:07.620
That's this that's the that's the official steam backed steam vr headset

01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:12.660
Does it work with linux and everybody's asking the question, but nobody's really got an answer right now. Yep

01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:17.460
Uh, and you got google cardboard, but that doesn't really work with linux desktop and oculus, you know

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:19.460
They could go suck an egg for all I care

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:25.780
Oculus, yeah, go ahead and there is a big reason for why in linux there hasn't been much development

01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:31.460
We have usually huge issues with graphics drivers. So yeah, that's fixed

01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:36.260
You really can't do anything right, you know, all I want all I want is just the game

01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:38.020
I just want there to be a standard

01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:40.420
I just want to I want there to be a vr standard

01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:46.340
And games just need to support that standard and then if I have the hardware that that understands that standard plugged into my

01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:48.660
Into my machine that's all it needs to be

01:31:48.900 --> 01:31:53.700
I just want to get to that level and that's when it's going to be that's when it's really going to be something

01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:57.700
Um, yeah, yeah, you know, I have a little bitterness with the oculus

01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:59.300
It's true the way they draw, you know

01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:02.900
I backed it because they had linux support. Yeah, and then when they dropped it

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:06.900
You know and I uh

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:12.580
I the reason why i'm not a full-on skeptic like wimpy is and I I was until I got the oculus

01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:16.260
uh dk2 and when I got the dk2 and um

01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:18.820
I know i've shared this story

01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:23.060
But when I got the dk2 and I went on this little raft that's floating out on the ocean

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:26.980
And I just I just I sat there for I had a chair here in the studio

01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:30.100
So it was like I was sitting on the raft and I had the oculus here in the studio

01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:35.860
So and the studio is um is is sound insulated and I had headphones on

01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:42.260
So it was like there was no and it's dark in here. There's there's no outside influence. It was

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:44.980
It was it was very much

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.700
perceptually like I was um

01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:51.780
Like I was on this raft and because I was on a swiveling chair

01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:58.020
I could turn my whole body to to turn with with the vr environment and so it was like I was

01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:00.260
Turning around and looking at the ocean

01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:04.180
And I I kind of got like that feeling you get when you're just chilling on the beach

01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:10.100
And when I started to feel like I was chilling on the beach when i'm sitting in my studio in my chair

01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:14.900
I realized there's something here. I don't know exactly what it is

01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:18.580
But there that just gave me a totally new experience

01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:23.220
Yeah, and that was really something and so that's why i'm hopeful we figure it out

01:33:23.220 --> 01:33:26.180
But right now the hardware requirements are ridiculous. Yeah

01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:29.220
And the linux support is weak

01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:35.460
And the most economical implementation is going to be the cheap stuff built into the phones

01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:40.040
Which have the weakest graphics and the most disappointing applications?

01:33:41.460 --> 01:33:46.020
So yeah, uh wimpy asks, uh, you were asking how much the oculus is

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:50.900
Uh-huh. I think it was about 300 bucks, but I can't I can't it might be it might have been what was that?

01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:52.500
You know, it was one of those

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:58.760
Like second round fundings, so I don't recall how how many times have you been out on the raft virtually?

01:33:59.380 --> 01:34:04.900
Only a few because i've been i've lent it out. I've lent out the oculus since then when they dropped their linux support

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:12.340
And i'm just thinking you could probably have rented a boat and experienced, you know bobbing up and down on the ocean for real

01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:17.220
For about the same money fair enough and there you get smell. Yeah, that's true

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:25.220
Well, this reality needs to offer something other than a poor simulation of reality to be compelling. I think you're probably right

01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:26.740
You're probably right

01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:29.300
Um kitson you had a thought though. Go ahead

01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:37.860
Uh, yeah, uh one more serious thought on this is I just think the vm would is just overkill for most gaming

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:41.540
Applications and just computer applications, especially in general

01:34:41.540 --> 01:34:46.900
Uh, most of the best games that i've played had really simple graphics

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:50.420
And they were able to place me in a world where I was more

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:57.860
Convinced of things true than a lot of these games that try to force graphics and cinematics on you and it's just

01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:01.460
Yeah, yeah, that's true. You are talking to the guy that just got mario

01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:04.020
Working again on his uh television at home

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:08.900
A funny side effect of that is that because of the power required for vr

01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:12.900
The current vr games are less graphically intensive just like you described

01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:17.700
Yeah, that's why it feels like it's going to be a real catch-22 for them to ever actually take off

01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:19.940
I will say that eve valkyrie

01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:26.900
Demo did seem pretty neat. Well, what's that one the eval create? Is that an e3 in 2015? Oh, yeah

01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:29.300
Yeah, yeah, that's an older one, right? Yeah. Yeah

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:32.020
Yeah, that just always stuck with me

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:36.660
There's not a lot standing between linux and having broader vr support because a lot of the engines

01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:40.980
That that like like the unreal engine for example, you know, if you make a vr game

01:35:41.620 --> 01:35:45.300
Okay, here's what here's what it is. This is i'm just gonna i've just got to be

01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:47.780
This is going to be linux unplugged confession edition

01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:50.580
Uh, I want to walk around the starship enterprise

01:35:51.780 --> 01:35:52.580
and

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:56.820
and there is an oculus vr compatible starship enterprise project that is

01:35:57.440 --> 01:36:03.060
Unbelievably detailed and the man has recreated areas of the enterprise that you've never seen that in order to connect it all together

01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:08.180
So you can walk the entire thing. I included like areas of the shuttle bay that are absolutely stunning and compelling

01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:11.060
I mean it is wow, it is transcending

01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:15.460
and now you've just described something that actually makes it

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.480
compelling because

01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:21.220
You can't experience that in the real world

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:28.900
So he took the blueprints to the starship enterprise and made them into a virtual world

01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:31.780
Yeah, it is here. I'll show if you're watching the video version. I'll show you a little bit

01:36:31.780 --> 01:36:36.820
It's pre-alpha footage here. Um, and he's been working on it for a long time. He has a patreon for it. Uh, but uh,

01:36:37.460 --> 01:36:43.460
What he did is he took the blueprints to make the most accurate representations if he could from like it's about season six or seven

01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:45.380
From what I can tell by watching it

01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:49.140
And I am that much of a nerd that I can tell it's about season five six or seven

01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:54.500
But I would guess six and it is uh, it is remarkably accurate. It starts with a

01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:59.700
It starts with a tour of the shuttle bay in a way. It shows you how the uh, how um,

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:05.860
The cargo bays and the shuttle bays are connected in a way that is brilliant, but yet never demonstrated in the actual show

01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:10.900
Um, and he goes and he goes on to show you areas that you are very familiar with

01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:14.260
Oh, here's another he spends a lot of time on the shuttle because he's very proud of it

01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:16.660
The lot and this is all based on the unreal engine

01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:19.460
So it looks

01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:24.420
Really good and it's all oculus compatible. So this is a 10 forward lounge

01:37:24.900 --> 01:37:27.060
That he's showing here and i'll go forward because you know

01:37:27.060 --> 01:37:31.140
What we all want to see though is we what we really want to see is the meeting room here and things like that

01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:33.220
so this probably gets pulled down from youtube, but

01:37:33.780 --> 01:37:35.780
Of course, it does also have sounds

01:37:37.620 --> 01:37:39.300
Oh, man

01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:43.540
What's that? He's in the conference room and this is why I say it's like season four five six seven on it

01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:45.540
It's it's later on in tng

01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:50.740
And then he had to make up this hallway and he took the old conference room gold chips from the conference room and put them

01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:53.700
In the hallway connecting to the bridge, which is just brilliant because they

01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:58.420
Those were destroyed because they used the set in star trek 6 now he's on the bridge

01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:03.720
And it's it is immaculately done

01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:09.300
Now you would

01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:16.660
So I I would I would pretty much I would die to have this under linux right

01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:20.660
The detail

01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:22.820
Photon torpedoes armed

01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:28.660
And targeted and he walks around, you know the whole thing he's got he's got just about every even oh, he even did the bathroom

01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:33.540
Look, he even finally did the bathroom. Now. This is based on schematics. There's three shells, which is a

01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:36.180
Yeah, a nod to a stalone movie

01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:38.980
And uh, he's got three shells in the bathroom, which is just hilarious

01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:42.100
You can sit in the captain's chair

01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:43.700
protects fools

01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:46.020
little children and ships named enterprise

01:38:47.220 --> 01:38:49.220
I don't think i'm cut out to be captain

01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:52.100
First officer, maybe

01:38:53.380 --> 01:38:55.380
And go check out the ready room

01:38:58.340 --> 01:39:03.140
It really is remarkable it's so well done and so uh, there's also there's other air there are

01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:09.460
One of the things that the gear vr was really good at was photographic tours of paris

01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:11.620
Which I thought was i've never been to paris

01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:15.220
Uh, so I took a photo tour of paris and it's not like google street view

01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:20.020
It's way cooler than google street view. And of course you can do 360 degree

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:23.140
You can look around uh that tearing is not in the video by the way

01:39:23.140 --> 01:39:25.380
That's just on my i'm having some problems with kaywin today

01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:30.840
Um, but the tearing isn't there and the the engine is is is just you can see the graphics are

01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:36.840
So

01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:44.520
Yeah that I can't wait I don't know I don't know what vr solution is going to provide me this but uh,

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.200
I'll pay for it. That's for sure

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:59.800
Yeah, I love it I love it so that's what I I want that but I don't want to have to run windows

01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:03.240
You know, like that's a real conflict for me. I want that in my life

01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:05.560
But at the same time I don't want to have to run windows

01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.960
And so we got to get this figured out under linux

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:12.840
So if anybody out there has tried or it gets their hands on the htc vive. You've got to let us know

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:19.640
Uh, yeah. Yeah, he's uh, you gotta let us know how it goes x metal x metal just comments youtube is going to hate this

01:40:19.800 --> 01:40:21.000
Yeah

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.080
Yeah, i've already got one of my shows pulled down this week. So why not have another show pulled down?

01:40:25.240 --> 01:40:26.280
It's only tuesday

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:30.440
So might as well get two shows pulled down one a week one day one show a week. Why not everybody?

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:34.360
So yeah, I agree with you wimpy if you make it compelling enough I could get interested

01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:40.360
I think I also agree with the rest of you. I'm not looking to do a vr desktop anytime soon. I'd give it a go

01:40:41.480 --> 01:40:43.480
but

01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:45.720
Just for a desktop it'd be too much hassle. Yeah

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:51.320
Yeah, let's let's just get the main desktops working. Let's get wayland out there. Let's get mirror working

01:40:51.320 --> 01:40:56.680
Let's get unity finished up then we could worry about the virtual reality and you know and the whatnots, right? Don't you think?

01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:58.600
All right

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:02.120
Yeah, I might reconsider if I get to use the nintendo power glove

01:41:03.400 --> 01:41:06.440
Bring that all in bring it all together. Why not? Let's do it

01:41:07.480 --> 01:41:11.720
That seems like that actually seems like a pretty good idea. I think you should you should capitalize on that

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:16.840
You might have something there that will bring us to the end of this week's episode of the unplugged program

01:41:16.840 --> 01:41:19.880
Thank you to everybody who joined us in the mumba room. You guys were great

01:41:19.880 --> 01:41:21.880
I'm preparing to go out

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:27.080
On spring break first spring break trip with the kids what gonna take lady jupes out on the road

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:32.920
That's awesome. Yeah, i'm pretty excited about that. I've uh, I got our cody installation packed up with media

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.840
So we can watch tv offline to save bandwidth and whoever you yeah

01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:42.140
If you'd like to join us live we'd love to have you here go over to jupiter broadcasting.com

Slash calendar to find out when this show is live. You can catch it live at jblive.tv

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:52.240
The calendar page will convert to your local time zone and you can submit content by going to linuxactionshow.reddit.com

01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:58.780
Why don't you join us for 140 live next week? If you don't we got feeds. You can always download get automatically

01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:15.760
Thanks for joining us. See you right back here next tuesday

01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:30.940
So

01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:46.540
That was a lot of fun, thank you everybody for joining us

01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:51.900
We had we had a lot of all come together and I think it made for a nice medley of the unplugged program

01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:54.540
I think so. Thank you very much. What was that?

01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:57.980
do that the plasma kill shortcut that uh

01:42:57.980 --> 01:43:03.580
Oh, yeah, what was that plasma kill shortcut? I that might do it does that but that probably doesn't restart kwin. Does it?

01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:05.660
I don't know

01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:09.580
What was that plasma kill shortcut? It wasn't on this computer. So I don't have it in my recent history

01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:14.540
Oh, that was nice. Wow. Look at that. It's so bad. Look at my look at krunner. Oh, that's

01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:17.900
Unusable that is not even that is like yikes

01:43:18.620 --> 01:43:20.620
Holy smokes. Look at that

01:43:21.100 --> 01:43:23.580
That is getting in the seizure territory, right? Yeah

01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:29.100
Rekai records this for a bug report. I gotta tell you we saw that on open qa once it's flashing as fuck. Yeah

01:43:31.980 --> 01:43:37.500
I wasn't an x and mess and stuff. Are you running? Uh, I you know, I uh

01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:40.540
I have no idea be whatever the default I could go bring up

01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:45.100
You know one thing I do and I did play with is like the kwin rendering settings, but I don't even know it

01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:47.180
Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh

01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:48.700
Whoa

01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:53.100
Whoa. Oh my gosh. All my icons just did like this little blurry thing for a second

01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:57.980
A little like holy smokes. This is getting crazy. I wonder if it's gonna make it the show now

01:43:57.980 --> 01:43:59.980
we're gonna now it's gonna be like a race against the uh,

01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:05.740
So where do you go? Okay, so I can I still can never figure out kd settings. There's so many freaking

01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:14.140
So where do I guess i'm reloading this machine, uh, where do I go to find where you configure is it not

01:44:14.700 --> 01:44:16.700
God, there's so many options in here

01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:20.300
That's not the bonobo by the way. No, this is on the apollo

01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.300
Uh

01:44:25.500 --> 01:44:28.940
Where do you go to manage kwin now, where the hell is that at?

01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:34.060
Maybe if I just up there and search type in window manager, I know but

01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:36.780
That is such a cop out window

01:44:37.980 --> 01:44:39.980
Just start management

01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:45.100
None of that's coming up. I know how about just like what if I just type for kwin will that work kwin?

01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:48.460
Here we go. Wow. Oh there. Can you see my icons? Do you see that? Look at that?

01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:52.380
We'll look at the window management icon. Do you see what i'm talking about? Come on there. It's back now

01:44:52.940 --> 01:45:00.780
Yeah, it's listed under one of those categories, but it doesn't say kwin explicitly. All right. Okay, so let's see here. Uh,

01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:06.140
Kwin rules kwin scripts task switcher. Nope. No, none of this is what I want

01:45:06.460 --> 01:45:09.740
I'm looking for the thing where you change what your renderer is in kwin

01:45:10.380 --> 01:45:12.380
desktop behavior

01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:15.660
This is this is this is the problem really

01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:19.740
This is really the thing. Okay compositor. Here we go. Open gl is what I currently have

01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:23.740
I'm going to try 3 1 and see what happens. I mean what what could go worse than what's happening now?

01:45:24.300 --> 01:45:26.300
Nothing, it stopped

01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:28.300
It stopped

01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:31.260
You see that

01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:33.260
Let's see if I can aggravate it

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.260
It's not doing it with boxes

01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:38.540
It's not doing it with spotify

01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:42.940
I think switching kwin from wait a minute. Nope. It's doing it again. Damn it

01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:49.260
Oh, it's happening again. Although it's not look it's not happening on the second screen yet. That's interesting

01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:51.420
Oh now it is now it's happening on the second screen

01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:58.060
Well that lasted a good few seconds. That's too bad. Got your hopes up though. I did I did. What if I do x render?

01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:02.860
Okay, it stopped I did x render it stopped

01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:06.540
I don't know if I go aggravate it a little bit

01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:09.660
This is this is definitely a kwin issue though

01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:13.660
There's no way about that there's no this this is definitely so now i'm not using open gl as my render

01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:16.540
I'm using x render which I would imagine means it's cpu-based, right?

01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:19.820
Seems to be working really good though

01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:25.840
All right, now i'm not having a problem. Awesome. So i'll go with x render for the show. Yay

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:38.880
Perfect. Yeah, perfect. My definition of perfect exactly
