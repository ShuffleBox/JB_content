WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.880
Open source knows no bounds, Mr. Westpain.

00:02.880 --> 00:06.320
A team of astronomers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison

00:06.320 --> 00:08.960
has successfully developed software

00:08.960 --> 00:13.000
that can simulate the complex vibrations that stars produce.

00:15.760 --> 00:16.320
Listen to that.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.520
It's not remarkable.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.160
In a way, it is, though.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.360
Kind of lovely.

00:23.360 --> 00:25.200
It's really impressive.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.720
I don't really think I never would

00:27.720 --> 00:29.720
have seen the day when open source software was

00:29.720 --> 00:31.560
simulating the sounds of stars.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.280
How the heck did they pull this off?

00:33.280 --> 00:35.000
Actually, it's pretty neat.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.920
So as the stars undergoing fusion and outputting

00:37.920 --> 00:40.880
a bunch of energy, there's just fluctuations that happen.

00:40.880 --> 00:43.000
And those can tell scientists a lot

00:43.000 --> 00:45.800
about the structure and undergoing dynamic processes

00:45.800 --> 00:47.040
within the star.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.520
You can measure that stuff with telescopes.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.560
And then, so really, this is two different pieces of software

00:52.560 --> 00:53.280
combined together.

00:53.280 --> 00:55.900
Because on one set, you have the simulation software,

00:55.900 --> 00:57.320
which is used to build models that

00:57.320 --> 00:59.800
can be checked against measurements from our sun,

00:59.800 --> 01:00.760
for instance.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.400
And then the other side is the software

01:02.400 --> 01:04.360
that takes those oscillations in the star,

01:04.360 --> 01:06.400
and that can be in brightness or temperature

01:06.400 --> 01:09.520
or in the radius of the star itself,

01:09.520 --> 01:12.160
and then converts those to the sound waves we hear.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.700
Now, as you might have guessed, it

01:13.700 --> 01:17.100
does have to pitch shift it up by a thousand or a million

01:17.100 --> 01:18.440
times or so.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.480
Yeah, because these starquakes, as they're called,

01:21.480 --> 01:23.280
happen a little infrequently.

01:23.280 --> 01:25.960
So you have to speed it up a bit to really enjoy it.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.080
And if starquake isn't good enough,

01:28.080 --> 01:32.400
this whole field is astro-seismology.

01:32.400 --> 01:47.960
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 301 for May 14, 2019.

01:47.960 --> 01:50.720
Oh, hi there, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.640
My name is Chris.

01:51.640 --> 01:52.480
My name is Wes.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.760
Hello, Mr. Payne.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.640
We've made it over the 300 hump.

01:55.640 --> 01:56.600
Ooh, I'm proud of us.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.320
Lucky 301.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.760
I feel like it's a lucky episode.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.280
This is one of those special episodes

02:00.280 --> 02:03.280
where we can actually claim thousands of miles and dollars

02:03.280 --> 02:04.280
went into its making.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.160
We did our research.

02:05.160 --> 02:08.880
Yeah, we went to Red Hat Summit last week in Boston.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.760
And I don't know what I went in expecting,

02:10.760 --> 02:14.200
but I walked away with some stories, some impressions,

02:14.200 --> 02:16.640
and a completely different perspective on Red Hat

02:16.640 --> 02:18.640
and the upcoming IBM merger.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.720
I feel like you maybe have had the same impressions,

02:20.720 --> 02:21.720
same kind of takeaway.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.440
Oh, yeah, but we're not going to spoil it now.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.160
And we've got a lot more to talk about in this episode.

02:25.160 --> 02:25.660
That's right.

02:25.660 --> 02:26.760
We've got community news.

02:26.760 --> 02:29.760
Plus, we've got a chat with someone very special

02:29.760 --> 02:31.480
later on in the show who's going to help

02:31.480 --> 02:34.180
us identify if our Linux box has been compromised.

02:34.180 --> 02:35.100
It's really awesome.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.000
It's part of a study group we're doing later.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.760
But before we get to any of that,

02:38.760 --> 02:40.680
we've got to bring in that virtual lug,

02:40.680 --> 02:41.560
time appropriate.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.280
Greetings, Mumble Room.

02:43.280 --> 02:44.600
Hello, everybody.

02:44.600 --> 02:45.100
Hello.

02:45.100 --> 02:45.600
Hello.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.800
Hey, what's up, man?

02:46.800 --> 02:48.840
Wow, hello to cheese.

02:48.840 --> 02:49.920
Hello to Neil.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.040
Hello to Elle.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.280
Hello to Brent.

02:52.280 --> 02:53.720
Hello to Alex.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.680
Hello to Bruce.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.440
Hello to Cassidy from elementary OS.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.200
And we have, what is that, Demd in there.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.080
We also have, I'm going to say Mario.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.360
It's not Mario.

03:02.360 --> 03:04.160
But the first part of it's Mario.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.320
So I'm saying Mario.

03:05.320 --> 03:08.320
Neil Burner and Turth are all in the virtual lug today.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.040
Close enough.

03:09.040 --> 03:10.320
Yeah, thank you.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.120
Thanks for being generous on that one.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.160
You can participate, too.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.400
More information at irc.geekshed.net.

03:16.400 --> 03:20.360
Once you get in there, pound Mumble, irc.geekshed.net.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.880
And there's hashtag Jupiter Broadcasting for the chat room.

03:22.880 --> 03:23.440
All right.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.320
Well, let's get through some community news,

03:25.320 --> 03:28.600
because we do have so, so, so much to talk about today.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.440
Very excited to share some exclusive clips

03:30.440 --> 03:32.080
from Red Hat Summit.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.880
And I was really trying to wrap my head around how

03:35.880 --> 03:39.720
we were going to even put a trip like that into the show.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.880
I went to Boston.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.920
Wes went to Boston and cheese.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.040
And we went and got in as press.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.040
We were able to attend the press track.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.040
And we could have come on the show today

03:49.040 --> 03:51.560
with a bunch of canned interviews from spokespersons

03:51.560 --> 03:54.400
and just really railed you with spokesperson interviews.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.280
But not only would that sort of be high-level information,

03:57.280 --> 03:59.400
but it would kind of come across as a sales pitch.

03:59.400 --> 04:01.240
And that's not really what we wanted to do.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.360
And I thought, you know, Wes, not a lot of people

04:04.360 --> 04:07.400
get an opportunity to do something like this.

04:07.400 --> 04:11.360
And as somebody who's done trade events in the past

04:11.360 --> 04:13.840
for years and years and years, I went to Red Hat Summit.

04:13.840 --> 04:17.640
And I just came away with a completely different mindset

04:17.640 --> 04:18.680
about a lot of things.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.760
And I thought, maybe we can encapsulate some

04:20.760 --> 04:22.000
of that into the show.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.720
Like, what's the experience like?

04:23.720 --> 04:26.800
And what kind of insights do you get into Red Hat

04:26.800 --> 04:29.680
when you attend an event, when you get really close like this?

04:29.680 --> 04:31.520
It was definitely a new view for me.

04:31.520 --> 04:35.280
And I had a few assumptions going in that probably

04:35.280 --> 04:36.360
didn't bear out.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.120
I was right on a few things, too.

04:38.120 --> 04:40.640
But it was just a lot bigger and more complicated

04:40.640 --> 04:41.920
than I could have ever dreamed.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.120
Yeah, so I'm really excited with our take on it.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.040
And so stay tuned for that.

04:46.040 --> 04:47.680
Neil was at Red Hat Summit as well.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.680
And he's in the Mumble Room with us.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.520
Hey, but a big story out of GitHub today.

04:53.520 --> 04:56.040
And I thought maybe Wes could help us break it down.

04:56.040 --> 05:00.520
Apparently, GitHub now is offering a package registry

05:00.520 --> 05:05.040
that you can publish and consume packages within your own org,

05:05.040 --> 05:08.040
or you could publish to the whole world and make it public.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.120
What is this?

05:09.120 --> 05:11.880
OK, really, it's more efforts in their goal

05:11.880 --> 05:15.560
to create and enable you to create end-to-end DevOps

05:15.560 --> 05:19.840
workflows that include your code, CI, and deployment solutions,

05:19.840 --> 05:22.640
especially if you're integrating and leveraging GitHub's APIs,

05:22.640 --> 05:26.200
actions, webhooks, and all the permissions-based infrastructure

05:26.200 --> 05:27.560
that already exists.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.640
So that's a lot of what you just said there.

05:30.640 --> 05:31.480
It's pretty thick.

05:31.480 --> 05:33.520
But to cut through it, if I'm already

05:33.520 --> 05:35.360
pretty deep in the GitHub infrastructure,

05:35.360 --> 05:37.280
maybe I use it for some authentication stuff,

05:37.280 --> 05:39.280
this just makes it easier.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.640
Yeah, I mean, you already have your packages up there.

05:41.640 --> 05:44.680
So if you're going to go build a Ruby package today,

05:44.680 --> 05:47.600
maybe you keep your code, it's open source, it's on GitHub,

05:47.600 --> 05:49.720
well, you've got to go work with other providers, maybe

05:49.720 --> 05:51.520
like RubyGems, or you're managing

05:51.520 --> 05:54.640
your own private repository that, if you're lucky,

05:54.640 --> 05:56.360
integrates with GitHub.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.560
But you probably have to have separate authentication

05:58.560 --> 06:01.000
and manage actions, which, as you will recall,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
perhaps GitHub just recently has their own,

06:03.000 --> 06:07.040
they call them actions, but sort of CICD-type platform

06:07.040 --> 06:10.160
that can perform automated deployments or updates

06:10.160 --> 06:11.400
or distribute software.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.160
Yeah.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.620
You had to have separate things.

06:13.620 --> 06:17.480
And Nexus, or one of the other big competing artifact

06:17.480 --> 06:20.760
repositories, GitHub's saying it's just easier.

06:20.760 --> 06:21.640
We'll do it for you.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.800
We have first class CDN support.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.960
And during the beta, it's free.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.400
What is the consumption side like?

06:28.400 --> 06:32.640
As a user, how do I add these repositories to my system?

06:32.640 --> 06:35.720
Is it dependent on the language I'm using?

06:35.720 --> 06:37.600
What is the consumption side of it look like?

06:37.600 --> 06:38.360
Yeah, exactly.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.200
So they're not reinventing the wheel.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.400
Right now, they have support for Docker, Maven, NPM,

06:43.400 --> 06:46.440
NuGet, which is for the.NET platform, and RubyGems.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.760
And you notice.NET in there.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.560
For me, what was missing was Python support.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.080
So that kind of shows that there's maybe

06:53.080 --> 06:55.400
a little Microsoft influence going on there.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.780
Maybe not.

06:56.780 --> 06:58.920
Basically, all those clients have different ways

06:58.920 --> 07:01.520
that you can say, add this additional repository,

07:01.520 --> 07:04.040
or I would like to interact with this repository.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.700
And now GitHub is implementing all that stuff

07:06.700 --> 07:09.640
in their own back end, which it sounds like they hope.

07:09.640 --> 07:10.840
They did use the word hope.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.040
I don't know what that means.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.680
They hope to open source this summer.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.840
What?

07:17.840 --> 07:20.720
That does sort of trigger me a little bit when you get that.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.880
Oh, yeah, I totally hope to make, like, FaceTime.

07:22.880 --> 07:25.520
Apple hopes to make FaceTime open source one day.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.920
We're getting there.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.280
So they have some examples set up.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.400
In a limited beta, you can go request access

07:31.400 --> 07:33.600
if you'd like to give it a try.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.640
And really, you know what, there's a release tab

07:35.640 --> 07:37.520
right there when you go look to find stuff.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.360
Now there's just an additional sub-tab there

07:39.360 --> 07:41.140
that says packages, and it'll show you

07:41.140 --> 07:42.320
all the different packages.

07:42.320 --> 07:45.720
It uses all the metadata you might have in your readme

07:45.720 --> 07:48.280
to populate all the package information for you.

07:48.280 --> 07:51.120
And if you've already set up team access to controls, who

07:51.120 --> 07:52.920
can update and push to your repo,

07:52.920 --> 07:56.440
those will work with the packaging system as well.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.840
The teams aspect's nice.

07:58.840 --> 08:02.120
I could definitely see that's maybe the big push here.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.160
That's probably the main focus right there.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.280
Yeah, that is a Microsoft move.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.400
OK, well, I thank you for explaining that to me.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.860
I saw that story go by, and I knew you'd

08:09.860 --> 08:11.360
be able to break it down for me.

08:11.360 --> 08:15.080
Now I have a question for the class today.

08:15.080 --> 08:17.120
And maybe we can solve it, or maybe the audience

08:17.120 --> 08:21.040
can send me in some feedback at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.880
But my 10-year-old son, Dylan, he's

08:22.880 --> 08:29.200
had a Dell XPS Sputnik laptop for three years now, I think.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.120
That sounds like something we've talked about.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.440
One of the older generations?

08:31.440 --> 08:34.160
Yeah, I remember the version of elementary OS

08:34.160 --> 08:38.120
he first had was based on Ubuntu 14.04.

08:38.120 --> 08:40.280
And he's running whatever the most current version you

08:40.280 --> 08:41.960
can run on 32-bit hardware is.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.920
But that's where the problem lies,

08:43.920 --> 08:46.640
is it's an old XPS that's 32-bit only.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.240
And Linux really is moving on.

08:48.240 --> 08:49.760
And this is where it's hitting me,

08:49.760 --> 08:51.480
is Dylan is getting limited on some of the things

08:51.480 --> 08:52.360
he wants to do with his computer,

08:52.360 --> 08:53.800
and he feels like it's time for an upgrade.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.400
And of course, all this is incredible.

08:55.400 --> 08:56.920
It's like going back in time.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.800
All of his friends are telling him to get Windows 10.

08:59.800 --> 09:00.360
Wait, really?

09:00.360 --> 09:02.120
Yeah, yeah, because they want to play it.

09:02.120 --> 09:03.480
That Windows peer pressure, man.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.240
It's just the games.

09:04.240 --> 09:04.800
It's all games.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.000
For them, it's all games.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.040
It's all about the games.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.360
100% about the games.

09:08.360 --> 09:08.800
Nothing but the games.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.480
And you didn't just tell them about Proton.

09:10.480 --> 09:11.560
That wasn't your solution.

09:11.560 --> 09:13.180
I was going to go into the whole pitch.

09:13.180 --> 09:15.280
But I wasn't sure what to even do,

09:15.280 --> 09:16.480
because this isn't something I want to spend

09:16.480 --> 09:17.960
an incredible amount of money on.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.520
But he's taken really good care of it.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.000
It's still, three years later, nothing wrong with it.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.800
And it's clearly learning and using the system.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.800
Yeah, and he's maintained it, and he's added to it,

09:27.800 --> 09:28.720
and modified it.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.600
And he's gotten accessories hooked up,

09:30.600 --> 09:32.600
and external monitors, and all that kind of stuff.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.260
So I like to encourage it.

09:34.260 --> 09:36.920
So I thought I should get him another long-lasting laptop

09:36.920 --> 09:38.640
that would run Linux really well.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.320
And I really, really like my T480,

09:41.320 --> 09:43.640
with the one major exception, is it

09:43.640 --> 09:45.200
doesn't have dedicated graphics.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.200
And a big part of what he wants to do is play video games.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.400
So Intel integrated isn't going to cut it.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.600
And I can't do any GPU for him, because it's like,

09:51.600 --> 09:53.200
that's going to be fidgety, complicated.

09:53.200 --> 09:56.080
And he wants to take it to his friend's house to play games.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.440
So it's like its number one job.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.760
So it'd be nice to have it internal.

09:59.760 --> 10:04.520
Well, there may be a solution starting at the end of May.

10:04.520 --> 10:09.320
Lenovo is adding the AMD Ryzen Pro-powered line

10:09.320 --> 10:11.520
to its ThinkPad lineup.

10:11.520 --> 10:17.120
The new T495 and T495S, and also the X395 laptops,

10:17.120 --> 10:20.880
are all powered by AMD's Ryzen 7 Pro processors

10:20.880 --> 10:22.240
with integrated Vega graphics.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.760
So I have questions about that with the audience.

10:24.760 --> 10:27.360
But that seems like a promising hardware setup.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.400
Yeah, both of the T models are 14-inch laptops,

10:30.400 --> 10:33.560
and the X395 is 13 inches.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.840
And really, they look almost identical

10:35.840 --> 10:38.560
to the Intel-based laptops, because they are.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.660
Lenovo just took the same frames and stuck AMD APUs inside.

10:42.660 --> 10:44.960
Yeah, really, that's just the biggest differences.

10:44.960 --> 10:47.720
According to Lenovo, the second-gen AMD Ryzen 7 Pro

10:47.720 --> 10:51.640
processors, combined with the integrated Vega graphics,

10:51.640 --> 10:55.160
should provide an 18% improvement in performance

10:55.160 --> 10:58.060
over previous T4 models.

10:58.060 --> 11:01.040
If you go with the base T495, you're

11:01.040 --> 11:04.240
looking at something like $939.

11:04.240 --> 11:07.400
Anything else starts at around $1,089.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.820
Yeah, so I mean, I think that puts it in the running.

11:09.820 --> 11:12.160
I'm also going to look at the System76 lineup.

11:12.160 --> 11:15.920
I really don't want to spend probably more than $1,100.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.520
That's sort of like my max, I think, for this kind of thing.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.320
For the kid laptop.

11:19.320 --> 11:20.680
It's a high risk, you know?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.360
I think that does seem like a pretty decent idea.

11:23.360 --> 11:24.720
They are rugged.

11:24.720 --> 11:25.640
Yeah, yeah.

11:25.640 --> 11:29.800
And I would imagine those would run Linux great.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.240
I was going to recommend the Pinebook Pro,

11:32.240 --> 11:35.000
but it might not be so well for games.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.480
Yeah, yeah, that has crossed my mind a lot,

11:37.480 --> 11:39.160
or something equivalent.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.760
But it really does come down to he

11:40.760 --> 11:45.120
wants to run games that run on x86.

11:45.120 --> 11:47.720
And if it doesn't solve that problem,

11:47.720 --> 11:49.760
then he's going to continue to think about Windows

11:49.760 --> 11:50.480
every now and then.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.080
Because every now and then, he brings it up.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.680
So could my computer run Windows, Dad?

11:54.680 --> 11:56.680
Oh, you poor man.

11:56.680 --> 11:58.480
Well, Dylan, not really, no.

11:58.480 --> 12:01.160
Oh, no.

12:01.160 --> 12:04.360
So I got to make sure that I measure twice and cut once

12:04.360 --> 12:06.160
on this next move here.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.320
It's important.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.680
And maybe for ultimate gaming performance,

12:09.680 --> 12:11.760
we'll load them up with clear Linux this time.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.760
Now, I'm very excited to report that I

12:13.760 --> 12:15.280
think another one of my predictions

12:15.280 --> 12:18.440
is chiming right along, along with dark mode

12:18.440 --> 12:19.600
for the web and a few others.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.840
We now have some clear Linux hype,

12:21.840 --> 12:25.480
as well as a clear push for clear Linux on the desktop.

12:25.480 --> 12:26.960
And not only is it well known now

12:26.960 --> 12:29.240
for its performance on Intel systems,

12:29.240 --> 12:32.680
but they've made some big user desktop-friendly changes

12:32.680 --> 12:33.280
recently.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.600
Yeah, this week actually just saw some further improvements

12:36.600 --> 12:39.880
to their relatively new graphical installer.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.560
They actually only added this last year.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.520
Before then, it was just a text installer,

12:43.520 --> 12:45.920
which Michael Areable definitely prefers.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.280
I think I might as well, because honestly, their text

12:48.280 --> 12:50.160
installer is pretty solid.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.000
But now, they also have a graphical installer that,

12:53.000 --> 12:56.600
I mean, it looks pretty much up to par with Anaconda

12:56.600 --> 12:57.240
or Ubiquiti.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.480
Yeah, and I think that was the straw that

12:59.480 --> 13:02.040
broke Jason's back over at, you know,

13:02.040 --> 13:05.600
Jason Evangelo from Forbes and also from Choose Linux.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.040
He gave it a go now that they have

13:07.040 --> 13:08.080
the new graphical installer.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.800
And he wrote up his impressions over at Forbes.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.800
And I bet we'll be hearing more from him about it

13:11.800 --> 13:13.040
in some podcasts soon, too.

13:13.040 --> 13:14.080
But I'll link to that in the show notes

13:14.080 --> 13:15.760
if you want to read his impressions.

13:15.760 --> 13:19.040
And he talks about how it ships with Flatpak support out

13:19.040 --> 13:20.080
of the box.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.680
And they have 4,000 applications in bundles.

13:22.680 --> 13:24.120
So there is quite a bit of software,

13:24.120 --> 13:25.600
more than you might expect.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.400
It doesn't run so good in a VM, I've discovered.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.800
I've discovered that.

13:29.800 --> 13:32.760
Another interesting clear Linux news item

13:32.760 --> 13:37.600
is if you're in the Portland, Oregon area at the Intel Hawthorne

13:37.600 --> 13:40.200
campus, I think it's called, the Hawthorne Farm,

13:40.200 --> 13:43.560
in the HF3 auditorium, they will have their very first

13:43.560 --> 13:45.200
clear Linux meetup.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.740
I'm always hanging around there.

13:46.740 --> 13:48.440
I am actually really, really tempted to go.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.240
I'm kind of looking into it.

13:49.240 --> 13:49.960
It's next week.

13:49.960 --> 13:53.120
It's May 22, 2019, at 3 PM to 8.30 PM.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.500
There's going to be refreshments.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.360
It looks like there'll actually be a dinner break, too.

13:57.360 --> 14:01.400
But there'll be some demos, some architecture overviews,

14:01.400 --> 14:02.760
and some hands-on workshops.

14:02.760 --> 14:05.480
Does it say who might be there from the project?

14:05.480 --> 14:08.320
No, but they talk about a panel being there.

14:08.320 --> 14:11.200
So that seems like it's a pretty good chance of some people

14:11.200 --> 14:12.160
to know what they're talking about.

14:12.160 --> 14:15.520
And since it's an Intel project at an Intel campus,

14:15.520 --> 14:17.360
I'm really kind of, I mean, Portland's

14:17.360 --> 14:18.600
like a four-hour drive from here.

14:18.600 --> 14:19.960
I'm kind of thinking about it.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.920
It just would take up a huge chunk of the day.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.400
It's a whole day there, yeah.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.600
But that seems really neat.

14:24.600 --> 14:25.600
So I'll link to that in the show notes, too,

14:25.600 --> 14:27.120
if you're in the area and you might be able to go.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.420
It's interesting how they kind of started

14:28.420 --> 14:29.940
with technical foundations.

14:29.940 --> 14:32.360
I mean, you can see how Intel would have their own Linux just

14:32.360 --> 14:34.600
to, you know, they work with computers.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.640
OK, sure.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.160
And now they're kind of bootstrapping a desktop

14:38.160 --> 14:39.960
community around it.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.320
Interesting to watch.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.120
Yeah.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.800
Yeah, and totally called it.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.800
Sorry, I just got to get my, you know.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.480
Fair enough.

14:48.480 --> 14:51.040
And then I just, now I'm sort of following the ULauncher

14:51.040 --> 14:54.040
project, because God bless it if it doesn't make XFCE just

14:54.040 --> 14:54.720
perfect.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.520
Yeah, ULauncher on top of XFCE.

14:56.520 --> 14:59.200
You mean it fixes the flaws in your inferior desktop, Chris?

14:59.200 --> 14:59.760
Wow.

14:59.760 --> 15:00.260
Wow.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.200
No, I'm just kidding.

15:02.200 --> 15:02.920
Wow, dude.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.400
You're coming at me over here.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.380
You're coming at me with this.

15:05.380 --> 15:05.880
I know.

15:05.880 --> 15:06.960
That's totally unfair, man.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.920
Shots fired, guys.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.080
It does sort of lack in the launcher department, though.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.160
I mean, the toolbar icons are all good and stuff,

15:17.160 --> 15:19.160
but I don't want to take my hands off the keyboard.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.360
It's 2019.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.160
That's right.

15:21.160 --> 15:22.520
I want to party like it's 1980.

15:22.520 --> 15:26.160
So I install ULauncher, and then I just have a Control Space,

15:26.160 --> 15:28.560
and I type in the first three letters of any application,

15:28.560 --> 15:29.840
Enter, and they launch.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.080
And they're making a move.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.520
Obviously, they have to move from Python 2 to Python 3,

15:34.520 --> 15:37.520
but they're also extending their API.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.040
They're temporarily dropping support

15:39.040 --> 15:41.300
for OpenSUSE and CentOS, and they're

15:41.300 --> 15:43.640
seeking for contributors.

15:43.640 --> 15:47.520
If you need a great application launcher for your desktop,

15:47.520 --> 15:48.920
give you go.

15:48.920 --> 15:49.840
Give you go a go?

15:49.840 --> 15:51.920
Give you launcher a go.

15:51.920 --> 15:52.840
Try you go.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.560
It's ULauncher for humans.

15:54.560 --> 15:55.160
You go.

15:58.060 --> 16:01.600
All right, so I just thought we could ask the room,

16:01.600 --> 16:05.000
take the temperature of a phrase that's gotten kicked around

16:05.000 --> 16:05.880
a lot over the years.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.640
In fact, I don't think any of us have ever

16:07.640 --> 16:10.800
declared it in the 13-plus years of broadcasting

16:10.800 --> 16:11.480
on this network.

16:11.480 --> 16:15.600
But is 2019 the year of the Linux desktop?

16:15.600 --> 16:16.600
Isn't every year?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.040
No, no.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.560
Let's just do a little math here.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.280
Yeah, can there ever be one year?

16:22.280 --> 16:23.400
What are the rules?

16:23.400 --> 16:24.560
Here's the math of it.

16:24.560 --> 16:27.820
Number one, all Chromebooks in 2019 shipping

16:27.820 --> 16:29.680
will support running Linux applications

16:29.680 --> 16:30.920
and launch Linux environments.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.640
But bigger than that, obviously, that's a huge deal.

16:33.640 --> 16:36.160
Let's not just dismiss it, but bigger than that,

16:36.160 --> 16:38.360
the Windows subsystem for Linux version 2

16:38.360 --> 16:44.840
will be shipping a Linux kernel, a 4.19 LTS Linux kernel.

16:44.840 --> 16:47.980
Windows 10 will have an embedded Linux system in it

16:47.980 --> 16:52.640
if just, let's say, a small percentage

16:52.640 --> 16:54.800
of the nearly billion users they plan

16:54.800 --> 16:58.800
to have with Windows 10 fires up the Windows subsystem

16:58.800 --> 16:59.800
for Linux.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.280
We may, over the course of the rest of 2019,

17:03.280 --> 17:08.760
end up with more users than we've ever had on the desktop.

17:08.760 --> 17:10.480
It'll just be a Windows desktop, but they'll

17:10.480 --> 17:12.680
be using a Linux kernel in a Linux user land.

17:12.680 --> 17:14.960
I'm very, very conflicted about this,

17:14.960 --> 17:17.640
because the Chrome OS one is easier to state.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.840
It's like, OK, because of Wayland,

17:19.840 --> 17:22.120
they're able to pull this off reasonably well.

17:22.120 --> 17:25.880
But for Windows, it's like, well, yeah, they're

17:25.880 --> 17:27.400
running a Linux kernel, but they're

17:27.400 --> 17:29.800
gimping it so that running desktop applications is not

17:29.800 --> 17:31.320
going to be easy or usable.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.400
No, you just get better desktop applications.

17:33.400 --> 17:37.400
Right, and so it's my feeling about this

17:37.400 --> 17:40.880
is it'll actually incentivize people to pull away from Linux.

17:40.880 --> 17:43.360
Sure, because you can run your Linux games.

17:43.360 --> 17:44.880
You can run Adobe Photoshop.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.360
You can have Adobe Premiere.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.840
And you can run your Linux command line stuff.

17:48.840 --> 17:51.040
Right, and virtually all Linux games

17:51.040 --> 17:52.640
compiled to natively on Windows.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.600
So if you're already on Windows, why

17:54.600 --> 17:56.920
would you run the Linux version?

17:56.920 --> 17:59.880
And it's a pain in the butt to actually make

17:59.880 --> 18:03.480
the Linux version of a game actually run in WSL,

18:03.480 --> 18:06.000
as someone who has actually tried.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.480
It is annoying and difficult. So I'm very conflicted,

18:10.480 --> 18:13.640
because on one hand, it shows that Microsoft recognizes

18:13.640 --> 18:17.360
there's no substitutes or imitations for a Linux kernel.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.400
But on the other hand, it feels like a defeat wrapped

18:20.400 --> 18:24.800
in a victory, because it will make it easier for people

18:24.800 --> 18:27.920
to just completely ignore Linux and run Windows

18:27.920 --> 18:29.000
full time for everything.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.240
On the other hand, there are environments

18:31.240 --> 18:33.560
where you literally don't get a choice.

18:33.560 --> 18:35.160
And this opens that door.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.400
I mean, I used to work in an environment where

18:37.400 --> 18:40.480
I was forced to run Windows for work.

18:40.480 --> 18:42.480
And if I had had this as an option,

18:42.480 --> 18:43.920
I would have totally used it then.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.600
Yeah, so I think that's just it.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.960
So I want to make it clear.

18:46.960 --> 18:47.920
I'm playing devil's advocate.

18:47.920 --> 18:50.240
I don't necessarily think the applications are better.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.640
And I think the fundamental issue is it's still Windows.

18:53.640 --> 18:54.840
It's still Windows.

18:54.840 --> 18:57.280
But if you are forced to use it, if you

18:57.280 --> 18:59.040
are in a constrained environment,

18:59.040 --> 19:00.680
this is a great opportunity.

19:00.680 --> 19:03.840
And it absolutely is an admission from Microsoft

19:03.840 --> 19:07.760
that developers want true blue Linux.

19:07.760 --> 19:08.960
It's good today.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.560
It gets more people using Linux.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.440
It gets more people in the Linux user land.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.880
It actually, in a funny way, also

19:14.880 --> 19:19.480
makes it easier to transition from Windows to full desktop

19:19.480 --> 19:21.200
Linux, if you think about it.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.600
I think we should acknowledge, too,

19:22.600 --> 19:24.960
that many of the people who stay on desktop Linux

19:24.960 --> 19:27.160
are there because they want to for philosophical reasons

19:27.160 --> 19:28.200
or because they enjoy it.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.760
But acknowledge that there are trade-offs they make.

19:30.760 --> 19:34.280
So we, by and large, I think, collect people that know that

19:34.280 --> 19:36.040
and like the Linux desktop.

19:36.040 --> 19:40.320
So if they can discover it through Windows,

19:40.320 --> 19:43.480
that might mean a new influx of Linux users

19:43.480 --> 19:45.800
that would have never been brought over to our platform.

19:45.800 --> 19:48.000
I'm wondering, Alex, if you think

19:48.000 --> 19:51.560
this is going to be a good thing and see where I'm going,

19:51.560 --> 19:53.040
where people will try it out, they

19:53.040 --> 19:55.920
can get familiar with the Linux user land, and then move over.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.480
Or if you think it's more like Devil's Advocate, Chris,

19:58.480 --> 20:00.600
that says people are going to stick with Windows now

20:00.600 --> 20:03.800
and just use the utility command line.

20:03.800 --> 20:06.920
Do you think there's a clear winner or loser here?

20:06.920 --> 20:08.300
Is it that simple?

20:08.300 --> 20:12.960
I still flirt with Windows.

20:12.960 --> 20:16.920
I have a VM that runs with PCI pass-through for a graphics

20:16.920 --> 20:18.360
card.

20:18.360 --> 20:21.040
It took me the longest time to actually switch and make

20:21.040 --> 20:24.200
it stick on the Linux desktop.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.560
I think I agree with the previous caller

20:26.560 --> 20:28.940
that it's going to make it harder for some people

20:28.940 --> 20:32.320
to actually ditch Windows.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.920
It's going to be too comfy for a lot of people.

20:34.920 --> 20:38.960
And then putty is fine as it was.

20:38.960 --> 20:44.880
Yeah, I think largely the year of the Linux desktop is coming.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.400
Is it this year?

20:46.400 --> 20:47.600
It's every year, isn't it?

20:47.600 --> 20:48.100
It is.

20:48.100 --> 20:48.760
I know.

20:48.760 --> 20:49.440
It's so funny.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.480
It's just such a cliche thing to throw out there

20:51.480 --> 20:53.040
that this whole conversation feels

20:53.040 --> 20:56.360
like it's getting cliche, to be honest with you.

20:56.360 --> 21:00.560
And I think it's hard to really gauge long term

21:00.560 --> 21:02.080
where this is going.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.440
To the point I was trying to poke you with there,

21:04.440 --> 21:06.720
it's like, is this a good thing, is this a bad thing?

21:06.720 --> 21:08.960
To clear it up, it's a good thing today.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.760
It may be a bad thing tomorrow.

21:10.760 --> 21:13.260
It depends on how long Microsoft can

21:13.260 --> 21:18.560
continue to convert their brick and mortar on-premises clients

21:18.560 --> 21:20.160
to Azure clients.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.640
As long as that low-hanging fruit exists,

21:22.640 --> 21:23.720
then this is great.

21:23.720 --> 21:26.640
This is great because it makes Microsoft more money.

21:26.640 --> 21:28.880
Getting people into their software as a service, AKA

21:28.880 --> 21:30.800
Azure, is fantastic.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.680
So everybody wins.

21:32.680 --> 21:35.720
Once all of that low-hanging fruit has been plucked,

21:35.720 --> 21:38.320
and now they need to sort of tighten down

21:38.320 --> 21:42.380
the ratchets a little bit, they need to leverage the ecosystem

21:42.380 --> 21:46.080
a little bit, they need to maybe create a little more lock-in

21:46.080 --> 21:49.200
to get a little more revenue, then things could change.

21:49.200 --> 21:52.000
But that could be 5, 10 years down the road.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.680
So you just have to just accept it for what it is today.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.000
It does mean more people using open source.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.720
And there's so many areas of improvement.

21:58.720 --> 22:01.760
Cassie, I'd love to get your take on areas of improvement

22:01.760 --> 22:04.360
or just this overall story, and then I think we'll move on.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.040
Yeah, I think it's kind of twofold.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.120
One, it's Microsoft trying to just stop bleeding users

22:10.120 --> 22:15.320
to Linux, but also Mac OS with that Unix kernel.

22:15.320 --> 22:19.080
Developer tools tend to be aimed to Mac OS more than Windows.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.920
So I don't know that it's really going

22:20.920 --> 22:25.640
to shift people who would be using Linux anyway.

22:25.640 --> 22:29.760
It's really just people who might be leaving Windows

22:29.760 --> 22:31.960
to Mac OS or Linux.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.640
But then also, it just drives home

22:33.640 --> 22:35.760
why Linux-based desktops should focus

22:35.760 --> 22:38.220
on user experience and their own ecosystems

22:38.220 --> 22:42.320
instead of just happening to run a Linux kernel.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.040
That Linux kernel is awesome and amazing

22:44.040 --> 22:46.060
and has enabled so many incredible things,

22:46.060 --> 22:50.120
but it's not the end-all, be-all experience of every desktop.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.520
That's a good point.

22:51.520 --> 22:52.920
That's a good point, Cassidy.

22:52.920 --> 22:55.080
It's like you have thought about that before.

22:55.080 --> 22:58.560
That's the impression I'm getting there.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.840
I agree with Joe from LAN, where it's

23:01.840 --> 23:03.760
like where is Apple's developer story?

23:03.760 --> 23:07.080
Microsoft's is very, very clear for us all to see now.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.320
Well, I think you have to keep in mind

23:09.320 --> 23:12.580
that Microsoft's quote unquote story is about getting

23:12.580 --> 23:14.280
you to use Azure.

23:14.280 --> 23:15.280
All roads lead to Azure.

23:15.280 --> 23:16.120
That's right.

23:16.120 --> 23:16.800
Right.

23:16.800 --> 23:18.640
Yeah, that's as I always say.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.080
And so that's where this plays a big role in that.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.680
There's Windows Subsystem for Linux.

23:22.680 --> 23:24.400
Apple, they couldn't give two shits.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.560
They're not trying to sell a hosted service for you

23:26.560 --> 23:27.120
to develop on.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.180
It's not a platform.

23:28.180 --> 23:30.120
They want you to write apps for their phones.

23:30.120 --> 23:32.160
And so they don't need a big, strong Linux play.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.560
They don't need that, whereas Microsoft

23:34.560 --> 23:37.040
does need that to be part of their quote unquote developer

23:37.040 --> 23:39.000
story, as we like to say now.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.080
All right, hold it there.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.920
Hold it there, because we have to continue on.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.840
And I have to cover a couple of things

23:43.840 --> 23:48.240
that we just need to clear out before we get to the Red Hat

23:48.240 --> 23:50.440
Summit stuff, because once we get to the Red Hat Summit

23:50.440 --> 23:52.560
stuff, we're going full force.

23:52.560 --> 23:56.640
So a little housekeeping first before we continue.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.960
First and foremost, we've sort of sneaky

23:58.960 --> 24:01.240
launched a new show, just like out of nowhere.

24:01.240 --> 24:02.560
It was just something we started doing.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.880
And then we're like, OK, we should probably publish this.

24:04.880 --> 24:05.400
Whoops.

24:05.400 --> 24:08.280
It's the Friday stream, fridaystream.com.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.340
We just released A Fluffle of Fools.

24:10.340 --> 24:14.080
You can meet Drew and learn just what a Fluffle might be.

24:14.080 --> 24:18.960
Yeah, and also the best 39 seconds from the Red Hat

24:18.960 --> 24:19.560
Summit.

24:19.560 --> 24:20.800
Not in this show, no.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.040
Yeah, we decided to save it for the Friday stream.

24:23.040 --> 24:23.760
It's worth it.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.920
Plus, we were also caught up in the middle of an Uber Lyft

24:26.920 --> 24:27.860
protest.

24:27.860 --> 24:30.720
So we busted out the microphone and got a little audio of that

24:30.720 --> 24:32.040
for the Friday stream.

24:32.040 --> 24:33.420
But the Friday stream is really just a chance

24:33.420 --> 24:34.800
for you to come meet the crew.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.800
It's sort of just a chat show.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.860
We have a larger crew now that works full time on these shows.

24:39.860 --> 24:42.440
So we have a little more time to dedicate to stuff like this.

24:42.440 --> 24:45.680
And we wanted to have a moment to connect with our community.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.200
So we are doing it live.

24:47.200 --> 24:49.520
We don't do as many live shows anymore.

24:49.520 --> 24:51.080
So we'll have a chat room going.

24:51.080 --> 24:53.740
And we'll bring on different members of the crew each week.

24:53.740 --> 24:56.320
And tell stories, and give each other a hard time,

24:56.320 --> 24:58.440
and chat with the community.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.640
And talk about things that are going on in the community

25:00.640 --> 25:01.160
as well.

25:01.160 --> 25:03.240
So it's really a show about nothing.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.400
So fridaystream.com.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.400
Way to sell it, Chris.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.920
A show about nothing.

25:08.920 --> 25:10.200
Yay, that's a classic, isn't it?

25:10.200 --> 25:12.680
We all like Seinfeld, right?

25:12.680 --> 25:14.320
So check it out, fridaystream.com.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.840
And slash three is the latest one.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.960
Now, there's an event coming up that we

25:18.960 --> 25:21.360
haven't talked a lot about because so much is going on.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.880
But we're very excited about Texas Linux Fest.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.560
2019's Texas Linux Fest is just around the corner,

25:26.560 --> 25:29.160
May 31st and June 1st.

25:29.160 --> 25:33.360
And rumor has it, Elle is involved to some degree.

25:33.360 --> 25:34.520
Remind the audience, Elle.

25:34.520 --> 25:35.400
Of course, not me.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.800
Of course, I remember Elle.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.400
But you're somewhat involved at Texas Linux Fest this year.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.560
Yeah, this is my third year to be involved.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.760
And I'm going to be helping coordinate all the volunteers

25:46.760 --> 25:49.220
this year, making sure that things run smoothly.

25:49.220 --> 25:50.120
Look at you.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.880
You are humble about it, but she's

25:51.880 --> 25:54.320
like the glue holding the whole thing together.

25:54.320 --> 25:58.200
And so it's important to us and Elle that everybody goes.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.680
Maybe you weren't considering going to Texas this year.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.360
Well, here's an opportunity.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.600
Texas Linux Fest, we'll have a link in the show note.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.360
Registration is now open.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.480
What can we say about it, Elle?

26:08.480 --> 26:10.680
Where are things at right now?

26:10.680 --> 26:13.080
What stage in the event planning is it at?

26:13.080 --> 26:15.560
Give us a little behind the scenes information.

26:15.560 --> 26:17.460
Behind the scenes, I think things

26:17.460 --> 26:20.680
are kind of closing up on getting all of our speakers

26:20.680 --> 26:21.440
organized.

26:21.440 --> 26:24.200
I'm so excited because there's so many talks

26:24.200 --> 26:26.040
that I want to attend.

26:26.040 --> 26:28.120
So I can only imagine that other people are

26:28.120 --> 26:30.520
going to be really excited to see the lineup.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.520
And it's available on the website now.

26:32.520 --> 26:35.960
The actual conference center has been organized.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.800
And we know we're going to put everything.

26:37.800 --> 26:39.920
But we are short on volunteers.

26:39.920 --> 26:41.960
If anyone can donate a little bit of time,

26:41.960 --> 26:44.080
I'd be really thankful.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.200
OK.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.720
I'm going to be down there.

26:46.720 --> 26:47.880
She's going to be there.

26:47.880 --> 26:49.160
Elle's going to be there.

26:49.160 --> 26:51.700
And of course, Alex is going to be there.

26:51.700 --> 26:53.600
So come say hi to your friends from Linux

26:53.600 --> 26:59.200
Unplugged at Texas Linux Fest this year in just a little bit.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.760
Links to that stuff in the show notes, of course.

27:01.760 --> 27:03.840
I should also mention, come watch us live.

27:03.840 --> 27:04.680
Hang out with us.

27:04.680 --> 27:06.120
Join the Mumble Room, all that stuff.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.600
Get it converted in your local time

27:07.600 --> 27:10.320
at jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.320
jbliv.tv for that, yes.

27:12.320 --> 27:12.840
OK.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.760
So Red Hat Summit came and went.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.320
We've wanted to go for years.

27:18.320 --> 27:22.440
And to Red Hat's credit, they've invited and accepted.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.200
And it's just never freaking worked out.

27:25.200 --> 27:28.320
It's a really, really expensive thing to pull off.

27:28.320 --> 27:29.440
So it's in Boston.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.760
And Boston's not a cheap place to live.

27:31.760 --> 27:36.400
The hotel rooms per night, per person, were like $3.80 a night.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.880
So we immediately decided, that's way too much.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.480
Let's get an Airbnb.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.920
So we got a crew Airbnb, which was a ton of fun.

27:43.920 --> 27:47.000
And we got it in South Boston, just 2.6 miles

27:47.000 --> 27:48.200
from the convention center.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.560
So it was just a cheap Uber ride away, or Lyft ride,

27:51.560 --> 27:53.160
assuming they were working that day.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.660
And it was a pretty remarkable week.

27:54.660 --> 27:55.840
We got in really late.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.080
We got in around 11 PM.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.400
All of us arrived at the airport,

27:59.400 --> 28:01.400
which I'm just going to be frank here.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.640
The Boston airport's the worst airport I've ever been to.

28:03.640 --> 28:07.640
We got in at 11 and then spent an hour trying to find cheese.

28:07.640 --> 28:09.520
Cheese was just lost.

28:09.520 --> 28:12.600
Turns out, too, you can't go through certain areas

28:12.600 --> 28:15.080
of the airport without re-going through security.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.400
So when we were leaving, we got trapped in the airport

28:17.400 --> 28:18.900
straight up for four hours.

28:18.900 --> 28:21.080
Because Hadia, the problem child that she is,

28:21.080 --> 28:22.080
just got her name changed.

28:22.080 --> 28:24.320
Well, not just, but we were married not too long ago.

28:24.320 --> 28:26.120
You know, she changed her name to your name.

28:26.120 --> 28:27.680
You should come out and acknowledge that.

28:27.680 --> 28:29.600
Honestly, what's great, too, is her ID

28:29.600 --> 28:32.240
showed up the day we got back with her new name on it.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.120
No.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.980
But TSA doesn't like it when you have

28:34.980 --> 28:38.000
one name on your boarding pass and a different name on your ID.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.460
They make you do the extensive, extensive,

28:41.460 --> 28:43.040
we're going to touch all your parts security check.

28:43.040 --> 28:43.960
Oh, she got a pat down.

28:43.960 --> 28:44.880
Yeah, she sure did.

28:44.880 --> 28:46.880
So once we got through all of that,

28:46.880 --> 28:50.520
we woke up really early, Tuesday morning, as you can tell.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.000
And we got right inside the Red Hat Expo

28:53.000 --> 28:54.800
and started getting the feel for things.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.560
And I tuned in on something.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.120
We're inside the Red Hat Summit Expo Hall.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.040
There is a lot of people, and there's also a lot of Red Hats.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.600
I already have Red Hat envy.

29:03.600 --> 29:06.120
God, I'm the worst.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.440
I feel like the people walking around with the Red Hats

29:08.440 --> 29:10.920
are like the more dedicated.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.880
Oh, they're the cool kids of the event, obviously.

29:12.880 --> 29:13.680
Yeah, definitely.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.040
I have that same feeling.

29:15.040 --> 29:18.120
I feel like we're underdressed without a Red Hat.

29:18.120 --> 29:20.460
Turns out we were actually dead on.

29:20.460 --> 29:22.960
Later on, I tried to get myself a Red Hat.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.840
I went to their swag store, which was reasonably priced.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.720
And I asked them about the Red Hats.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.040
They're like, oh, no, no, no.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.920
We don't sell those hats.

29:30.920 --> 29:34.400
In fact, the hats are so coveted that Monday night,

29:34.400 --> 29:38.880
a gang of thugs came in and stole a bunch of fedora hats.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.520
You have to earn these hats, apparently.

29:41.520 --> 29:45.000
Or you have to be a vendor that spends so much money

29:45.000 --> 29:47.840
with Red Hat that they give you a hat.

29:47.840 --> 29:50.280
Third option, which we may have researched,

29:50.280 --> 29:53.080
they're about $23 online.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.040
Yeah, yeah.

29:54.040 --> 29:55.780
Could I clarify something?

29:55.780 --> 29:59.360
You get a woollen Red Hat fedora as part

29:59.360 --> 30:01.520
of New High orientation.

30:01.520 --> 30:03.760
I was lucky enough to go through two of those last year.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.520
So I had one in Europe and one in the US.

30:05.520 --> 30:06.840
So I actually have two hats.

30:06.840 --> 30:08.160
So ha ha.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.600
Oh, you bastard.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.160
Oh, oh, that's great.

30:11.160 --> 30:15.280
Yeah, no, it was funny because it wasn't just the hats.

30:15.280 --> 30:19.800
There's other things, like there's badges with flair.

30:19.800 --> 30:21.120
There's red shoes.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.120
There's red jackets.

30:22.120 --> 30:26.580
There's other things that sort of signal different status

30:26.580 --> 30:28.080
in the Red Hat community.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.480
Like, I started picking up on that stuff pretty quickly.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.400
And it was fascinating.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.240
But it didn't feel like aggressive or bad.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.040
No, you can just tell there's a lot of pride

30:35.040 --> 30:35.960
about people being there.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.680
Yeah, people that are prideful, like season

30:37.680 --> 30:39.920
pros have been there since the late 90s.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.560
And they just kind of went all out.

30:42.560 --> 30:44.240
It's kind of fun to see.

30:44.240 --> 30:45.280
It was pretty great.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.160
And of course, we always had Mr. Wes Payne,

30:47.160 --> 30:48.820
as I called him, the badge watcher.

30:48.820 --> 30:50.680
Wes Payne, badge watcher.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.200
So he's our dedicated badge observer,

30:53.200 --> 30:56.000
checking out the company names, the styles.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.960
What do you see in Wes?

30:57.960 --> 30:59.160
So far, a lot of big industry.

30:59.160 --> 31:02.060
We got Lockheed Martin and a lot of academics.

31:02.060 --> 31:04.880
I've seen probably six or seven university badges represented

31:04.880 --> 31:05.380
already.

31:05.380 --> 31:08.560
So clearly big deployments of Rel out there.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.340
Oh, yeah.

31:09.340 --> 31:10.840
All right, Bacon's got his new lens.

31:10.840 --> 31:13.120
Time to go inside the Expo Hall.

31:13.120 --> 31:15.760
Bacon's got his new lens.

31:15.760 --> 31:19.000
Now, let's fast forward to the keynote.

31:19.000 --> 31:19.680
This was great.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.280
So instead of being in the morning,

31:21.280 --> 31:23.360
God bless them, they did it in the afternoon

31:23.360 --> 31:25.440
after everybody was kind of done doing their thing.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.600
So you didn't have to get up super early.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.760
They transformed the second half of the Expo Hall

31:31.760 --> 31:34.560
into a magic show.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.240
They turned off the lights.

31:37.240 --> 31:41.440
They pumped it full of steam, of fog,

31:41.440 --> 31:43.800
from fog machines from a Hollywood set.

31:43.800 --> 31:45.720
They bought tons of them, because this

31:45.720 --> 31:48.040
is a ginormous Expo Hall.

31:48.040 --> 31:48.720
Huge space.

31:48.720 --> 31:53.440
You could fit probably a 747 in this Expo Hall.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.720
And then they set up, is it fair to call them lasers or light

31:56.720 --> 31:57.360
beams?

31:57.360 --> 31:58.880
Very strong lights in any case.

31:58.880 --> 32:05.400
Creating a triangular entrance tunnel into this glowing red

32:05.400 --> 32:09.640
room that had a multimillion dollar stage.

32:09.640 --> 32:10.680
Huge screen.

32:10.680 --> 32:14.880
Huge screens with their own light effects and steam effects,

32:14.880 --> 32:17.720
where Jim Whitehurst was up on stage giving the Jim talk

32:17.720 --> 32:20.880
show, where he had a disappearing set of chairs

32:20.880 --> 32:22.280
and tables that would be absorbed

32:22.280 --> 32:25.200
into the background of this multimillion dollar set,

32:25.200 --> 32:27.600
and then would slide back out right as he needed them.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.200
It was very cool.

32:29.200 --> 32:33.400
The impression was like, wow, they spent some money on this.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.240
Polished, polished, polished.

32:35.240 --> 32:35.920
Yeah.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.260
But you mentioned Lockheed Martin there in that last clip.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.680
And that was one of the more interesting guests.

32:40.680 --> 32:42.800
Red Hat really had a message here.

32:42.800 --> 32:43.880
We are big.

32:43.880 --> 32:45.000
We've got ExxonMobil.

32:45.000 --> 32:45.960
We've got BP.

32:45.960 --> 32:47.560
And we've got Lockheed Martin.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.880
And because we're working with secure US government systems,

32:50.880 --> 32:53.520
timelines are even longer.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.520
Our ability to continue to stay ahead of the threat

32:56.520 --> 33:00.540
is increasingly becoming an exercise in insanity.

33:00.540 --> 33:02.880
So over six years ago, we attempted

33:02.880 --> 33:05.040
to implement agile methods into this environment.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.480
This guy is really intense.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.280
I mean, he's military grade, Chris.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.800
He really is.

33:11.800 --> 33:13.360
Wow.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.160
They had a bunch of different speakers up there,

33:16.160 --> 33:19.360
like large financial institutions as well,

33:19.360 --> 33:20.560
like DBS Bank.

33:20.560 --> 33:24.240
Please welcome DBS Bank Group Chief Information Officer

33:24.240 --> 33:29.680
and Head of Group Technology and Operations, David Bledhill.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.800
DBS Bank.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.480
And then after each major presenter

33:33.480 --> 33:35.120
would come out on stage, Jim Whitehurst

33:35.120 --> 33:37.480
would come back out and make sure to really touch

33:37.480 --> 33:40.560
on a couple of key points.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.160
They wouldn't necessarily talk about Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

33:43.160 --> 33:45.680
In fact, I don't think it was ever mentioned, really.

33:45.680 --> 33:48.280
But they would talk about culture and open source.

33:48.280 --> 33:50.600
I think that is such an important lesson for everyone

33:50.600 --> 33:51.240
here.

33:51.240 --> 33:52.640
Technology is hard.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.000
But culture is really the critical aspect.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.720
David, thank you so much for being here

33:56.720 --> 33:59.120
and sharing your story and the success that you've had.

33:59.120 --> 33:59.840
It's fantastic.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.280
Thank you so much.

34:01.280 --> 34:03.680
These massive corporations would come up on stage

34:03.680 --> 34:06.400
and talk about how Red Hat worked with them

34:06.400 --> 34:09.680
to change their culture, change their culture.

34:09.680 --> 34:14.280
Literally every presenter from Volkswagen to ExxonMobil

34:14.280 --> 34:18.080
to Deutsche Bank to Delta said that.

34:18.080 --> 34:21.800
And you picked up on, there's an undertone there.

34:21.800 --> 34:24.480
There's a bigger message that Red Hat's trying to convey.

34:24.480 --> 34:27.760
Yeah, I mean, really, by culture, a lot of what they mean

34:27.760 --> 34:31.120
is, how do you do your business?

34:31.120 --> 34:33.760
Some of these companies are large and they are not

34:33.760 --> 34:35.040
IT organizations.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.040
They're making planes or they're running a bank.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.200
And IT is critical to their business.

34:39.200 --> 34:41.520
But they're not a tech company.

34:41.520 --> 34:43.280
Red Hat is and is basically saying,

34:43.280 --> 34:44.880
we can drag you into the future.

34:44.880 --> 34:46.480
We've got hybrid cloud offerings.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.960
We can support you in the cloud.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.440
We can support you on prem.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.400
We can help you make that journey wherever

34:51.400 --> 34:52.520
you need to get.

34:52.520 --> 34:55.280
And we'll be your partner, all powered by open source.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.400
We can help you speak open source.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.280
We can help you speak community.

34:59.280 --> 35:02.580
We can teach you how to do continuous integration

35:02.580 --> 35:03.440
and deployment.

35:03.440 --> 35:06.700
We can teach you how to do much faster paced development.

35:06.700 --> 35:09.080
We can bring you into the agile future.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.560
That's what some of the people said up on stage.

35:11.560 --> 35:13.520
There's a big message there.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.640
The entire night, though, there was

35:15.640 --> 35:18.280
moments that were hilarious, which

35:18.280 --> 35:19.880
we saved for the Friday stream.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.240
There were moments that were awkward,

35:22.240 --> 35:24.800
I mean, legitimately, when Ginny from IBM was up on stage.

35:24.800 --> 35:25.680
Yeah, just a bit.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.760
The moment that got the absolute most applause when

35:27.760 --> 35:29.960
she was up on stage was when she said Red Hat would

35:29.960 --> 35:31.280
remain independent.

35:31.280 --> 35:33.720
That got the absolute most applause.

35:33.720 --> 35:37.080
In fact, what really I think most people were excited

35:37.080 --> 35:40.160
to see, strangely enough, but was clearly

35:40.160 --> 35:43.360
measurable by the crowd's reaction,

35:43.360 --> 35:44.720
was Satya Nadella from Microsoft.

35:44.720 --> 35:45.960
Absolutely.

35:45.960 --> 35:47.600
I mean, you and I, too, right?

35:47.600 --> 35:48.840
That's who we were there to see.

35:48.840 --> 35:49.960
Boy, it was a weird thing.

35:49.960 --> 35:51.000
It was a weird thing.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.320
So the moment we had all waited for all night.

35:53.320 --> 35:55.800
Possible without open source.

35:55.800 --> 35:58.600
And so I'd like to welcome that on stage,

35:58.600 --> 36:03.800
a partner who's been embracing open source in a big way

36:03.800 --> 36:05.400
recently, and somebody you probably

36:05.400 --> 36:08.600
wouldn't expect to see on stage in Red Hat 7.

36:08.600 --> 36:12.520
Please welcome Microsoft team executive officer, Satya

36:12.520 --> 36:13.020
Nadella.

36:13.020 --> 36:16.000
Huge reaction.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.880
The man himself, Satya Nadella, coming out on stage.

36:18.880 --> 36:22.280
The chairs have just swung out from behind a hidden door,

36:22.280 --> 36:23.760
giving themselves a nice handshake.

36:23.760 --> 36:26.560
And Satya is sitting down now at the talk show seats.

36:32.840 --> 36:35.520
They're pointing up to the Microsoft and Red Hat logo

36:35.520 --> 36:37.840
that's huge and glowing just behind them.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.160
Within a couple of moments, it becomes clear

36:40.160 --> 36:43.520
Satya is not just there to represent Red Hat

36:43.520 --> 36:45.360
and how far they've come in the collaboration

36:45.360 --> 36:47.040
between the companies, but they're also

36:47.040 --> 36:50.560
there to announce a new product on Azure.

36:50.560 --> 36:53.000
We do have a more significant announcement

36:53.000 --> 36:54.800
we're making tonight in our work together

36:54.800 --> 36:57.120
with Microsoft Azure and Red Hat OpenShift.

36:57.120 --> 36:59.080
And you want to tell us a little bit about that?

36:59.080 --> 37:02.200
No, first of all, it's fantastic to be here with all of you

37:02.200 --> 37:03.560
at the Red Hat Summit.

37:03.560 --> 37:08.140
And as you said, we've been working for multiple years now.

37:08.140 --> 37:11.120
And today, in fact, is the general availability

37:11.120 --> 37:13.360
of the Azure OpenShift service.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.760
So it's fantastic to see that out.

37:15.760 --> 37:16.260
All right.

37:16.260 --> 37:16.760
Yeah.

37:16.760 --> 37:17.260
Yeah.

37:17.260 --> 37:22.440
OpenShift 4 was a big deal at Red Hat Summit

37:22.440 --> 37:25.200
as well, which, Alex, that's your area, isn't it?

37:25.200 --> 37:27.280
Yep, it is.

37:27.280 --> 37:31.360
The Azure story with OpenShift is a really interesting one.

37:31.360 --> 37:33.040
I don't know if you want to get into it or not, but.

37:33.040 --> 37:35.120
Can you give me the elevator version of it?

37:35.120 --> 37:35.960
I'd be curious.

37:35.960 --> 37:40.000
Well, if you look at Amazon and ECS,

37:40.000 --> 37:43.400
Google with Google Kubernetes engine,

37:43.400 --> 37:46.360
Red Hat is in a really unique position

37:46.360 --> 37:50.240
of being able to offer a managed Kubernetes platform, if you

37:50.240 --> 37:57.600
like, on premise, but also with Azure now in a structured way.

37:57.600 --> 38:00.520
So it's a very enterprising proposition

38:00.520 --> 38:02.720
and not really interesting for people interested

38:02.720 --> 38:04.020
in Linux desktops, perhaps.

38:04.020 --> 38:07.280
But in terms of the enterprise story,

38:07.280 --> 38:09.680
it's a really powerful one because now people

38:09.680 --> 38:12.920
can run Red Hat in their data centers,

38:12.920 --> 38:16.600
but also in Azure to get the power of Microsoft's cloud,

38:16.600 --> 38:17.720
et cetera.

38:17.720 --> 38:21.680
So there's a lot of synergies, corporate synergies there.

38:21.680 --> 38:22.280
Yeah.

38:22.280 --> 38:23.640
Yeah, and they love those.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.120
There's a lot of those.

38:25.120 --> 38:27.600
It was interesting, too, to see the amount of partnership,

38:27.600 --> 38:28.720
too, right?

38:28.720 --> 38:30.520
Microsoft gave them a lot of access

38:30.520 --> 38:32.880
so that they could actually set up and co-support

38:32.880 --> 38:34.280
this new partnership.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.080
That was a big thing, right?

38:36.080 --> 38:39.920
They wanted to push this phrase that we're not

38:39.920 --> 38:41.040
working with Red Hat.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.840
We are partnering with Red Hat.

38:42.840 --> 38:44.540
And I don't know what the difference is,

38:44.540 --> 38:46.960
but that's what they were telling us.

38:46.960 --> 38:48.520
That sounds good.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.280
So that was day one in a nutshell.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.960
There's a lot going on.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.480
This is a very, very well-run event,

38:54.480 --> 38:56.920
from the visual assets on the displays,

38:56.920 --> 38:59.320
on the ground, to the logos.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.800
The new logo was everywhere.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.360
You never saw the old logo.

39:02.360 --> 39:05.280
They must have spent millions on new swag.

39:05.280 --> 39:07.440
I keep dropping the term millions, but I mean it.

39:07.440 --> 39:10.200
I have been to some events, and these things cost money.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.640
I have an idea of what these swag items cost

39:12.640 --> 39:13.720
and all of that.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.840
Millions is not an exaggeration.

39:15.840 --> 39:18.280
And they have the new logo everywhere rolled out,

39:18.280 --> 39:20.800
top-level execution on the event.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.920
But an area that people attending might not normally

39:23.920 --> 39:27.080
get some insight into that I'd like to share with the audience

39:27.080 --> 39:29.800
is how they work with the press.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.700
And I had an opportunity to have a conversation

39:31.700 --> 39:33.360
with a few individuals to get insights

39:33.360 --> 39:35.200
on their opinions on this, too.

39:35.200 --> 39:38.120
And it's an interesting model, because it's

39:38.120 --> 39:39.480
very information-dense.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.040
They keep the press very, very busy.

39:41.040 --> 39:44.560
They dedicate rooms for the press to go into to work.

39:44.560 --> 39:45.480
They get connectivity.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.360
They give you some snacks and some beverages.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.840
And then they dedicate Q&A session rooms,

39:49.840 --> 39:52.800
where they distill the big, fancy, flashy announcements

39:52.800 --> 39:56.700
down into more information-dense, shorter

39:56.700 --> 39:57.700
sessions with the press.

39:57.700 --> 40:01.360
And there's maybe 80 press there in the room.

40:01.360 --> 40:03.160
They have several presenters.

40:03.160 --> 40:05.760
They'll usually have a high-level business person,

40:05.760 --> 40:08.120
like the project manager, and then somebody

40:08.120 --> 40:10.000
on the team who's intimately familiar with how

40:10.000 --> 40:11.120
the software actually functions.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.380
And each one of them gets about 10 minutes to speak.

40:13.380 --> 40:14.920
And then the press can ask questions.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.000
And it's very systematic.

40:16.000 --> 40:16.920
They all have slides.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.840
It's very well done.

40:18.840 --> 40:21.320
They provide power and chairs and all of that for the press,

40:21.320 --> 40:23.020
so that way you can actually take notes.

40:23.020 --> 40:25.680
And they really work to kind of efficiently convey information.

40:25.680 --> 40:27.960
They follow up very quickly with emails afterwards,

40:27.960 --> 40:30.160
including slides and information like that,

40:30.160 --> 40:31.960
and make people very available.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.440
So it's extremely well run.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.240
And it's, of course, in their best interest,

40:35.240 --> 40:37.120
because that gets the information out.

40:37.120 --> 40:38.800
I want to give you a little taste of that.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.000
They kept us really busy on day two.

40:41.000 --> 40:43.760
Well, the first press conference of the day just wrapped up.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.200
The one note that they kept hitting a couple of times,

40:46.200 --> 40:48.920
besides the announcement of OpenShift 4, which

40:48.920 --> 40:50.960
a big thing about that was Kubernetes,

40:50.960 --> 40:52.960
Kubernetes, Kubernetes, oh, by the way, serverless.

40:52.960 --> 40:55.560
But the thing that they kept touching on, aside from that,

40:55.560 --> 40:58.520
is at the core of all of this is Linux.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.400
We didn't hear that yesterday.

41:00.400 --> 41:03.080
Today it was, all of this innovation

41:03.080 --> 41:05.360
is made possible because it's riding on top of Linux.

41:05.360 --> 41:07.320
And as the industry is changing like crazy,

41:07.320 --> 41:09.960
Linux is the foundation that remains the same.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.360
So if you build for Linux, you're

41:11.360 --> 41:12.600
going to build for the future.

41:12.600 --> 41:14.200
That was a good message to hear from them,

41:14.200 --> 41:16.560
because they really, otherwise, it's all been about open source

41:16.560 --> 41:18.320
and not really talking about Linux.

41:18.320 --> 41:19.880
What jumped out at you, Mr. Payne?

41:19.880 --> 41:23.000
There really has been an emphasis on platforms

41:23.000 --> 41:24.100
and building platforms.

41:24.100 --> 41:25.680
And I think that's where Linux comes in,

41:25.680 --> 41:29.080
because yesterday was focused on business outcomes.

41:29.080 --> 41:32.800
But underlying all of that, you have to have stable technology.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.240
And there is, obviously, frustration

41:34.240 --> 41:36.640
in the industry of, well, I built it for this release,

41:36.640 --> 41:37.760
and does it still work?

41:37.760 --> 41:40.880
So we also saw a lot of emphasis on the RHEL model

41:40.880 --> 41:42.560
as a relationship, a subscription that

41:42.560 --> 41:43.720
is a relationship.

41:43.720 --> 41:45.280
You're not pressured to upgrade.

41:45.280 --> 41:45.960
You get support.

41:45.960 --> 41:49.400
So you have a stable base that you can rely on.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.960
And I think that's the theme with the hybrid cloud offerings,

41:51.960 --> 41:55.080
too, because there's sort of this tacit acknowledgment

41:55.080 --> 41:57.360
at the summit that everyone's using open source.

41:57.360 --> 41:58.520
Your developers are using it.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.720
You're just going to find your way into your products

42:00.720 --> 42:01.600
no matter what.

42:01.600 --> 42:04.140
But it can be difficult to use, because it doesn't always

42:04.140 --> 42:04.940
come with a manual.

42:04.940 --> 42:07.200
It doesn't always come with an operator's guide.

42:07.200 --> 42:09.080
That's what Red Hat's selling.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.360
Yeah, great point.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.460
And they talked about some of their features,

42:12.460 --> 42:14.840
like Insights, which are essentially metrics collections

42:14.840 --> 42:17.120
to help you do some predictive analysis.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.680
And they're backporting that to, I

42:18.680 --> 42:21.720
think they said as far as RHEL 6.7, which is still supported.

42:21.720 --> 42:23.720
So current supported versions of RHEL

42:23.720 --> 42:25.520
will get one of these new analytics features

42:25.520 --> 42:26.760
that they're talking about.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.400
Mr. Bacon, I know a couple of things jumped out at you,

42:28.400 --> 42:29.760
like the numbers they were tossing around

42:29.760 --> 42:32.560
around the world economy that passes through Red Hat servers.

42:32.560 --> 42:35.840
Yeah, they said 5% of the world's GDP

42:35.840 --> 42:38.480
passes through RHEL servers, which to me,

42:38.480 --> 42:41.920
when that statement, when Stephanie uttered that

42:41.920 --> 42:47.360
statement, literally made the hairs on my arms stand up.

42:47.360 --> 42:50.920
That's a huge number.

42:50.920 --> 42:54.840
And I think that it shows that Red Hat really

42:54.840 --> 42:57.960
is a big player in the world economy.

42:57.960 --> 43:03.440
And the enterprise of the world.

43:03.440 --> 43:06.600
Yeah, yeah, there's no escaping that conclusion

43:06.600 --> 43:08.120
from this press conference.

43:08.120 --> 43:09.840
And I had a lot of good stuff.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.760
And I love seeing the love for Linux up there

43:11.760 --> 43:13.080
on the slide a few times.

43:13.080 --> 43:13.960
Saw that up there a few times.

43:13.960 --> 43:14.720
I love seeing that.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.840
Good press conference, lots of good information.

43:16.840 --> 43:19.160
You know what else we saw up on the slide that surprised me

43:19.160 --> 43:22.000
was VS Code mentioned up there a couple of times.

43:22.000 --> 43:22.800
It's everywhere.

43:22.800 --> 43:25.360
Yeah, VS Code up on a Red Hat slide.

43:25.360 --> 43:28.200
OK, so I see Carl has joined the mumble room just

43:28.200 --> 43:29.320
at the perfect time.

43:29.320 --> 43:30.800
Hey, Carl, welcome to the show.

43:30.800 --> 43:31.640
How's it going, guys?

43:31.640 --> 43:32.120
Hey, good.

43:32.120 --> 43:34.440
So stand by one second here, because I'm just

43:34.440 --> 43:36.280
about to get to the expo hall.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.640
Holy crap, what an expo hall.

43:38.640 --> 43:39.640
Holy crap.

43:39.640 --> 43:41.840
I mean, I don't really know what else

43:41.840 --> 43:45.320
to do other than just play this clip of my raw impressions.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.120
The press briefings are done.

43:47.120 --> 43:49.120
Lunch has been had.

43:49.120 --> 43:52.960
And now the moment I have been waiting for since we got here

43:52.960 --> 43:55.360
and saw them unboxing everything,

43:55.360 --> 43:59.920
we are entering the expo hall of all expo halls,

43:59.920 --> 44:01.560
one of the most impressive floors

44:01.560 --> 44:06.720
I have ever seen in my 10-plus years of covering events.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.440
I can't wait to go around and see the floor,

44:08.440 --> 44:11.360
from the high-tech lights to the Azure Cloud

44:11.360 --> 44:15.840
booth, the IBM million-dollar booth, Intel's here, Dell's

44:15.840 --> 44:19.920
here, and there's a puppy area.

44:19.920 --> 44:20.920
I don't know about that.

44:20.920 --> 44:22.560
I'm going to figure out what that is, too.

44:22.560 --> 44:24.200
There's a lot to catch.

44:24.200 --> 44:28.100
Now, there was one just undescribable booth,

44:28.100 --> 44:29.240
but I'll give it my best.

44:29.240 --> 44:31.120
And Wes, feel free to chime in or cheese

44:31.120 --> 44:33.880
if there's anything you can add to help describe this.

44:33.880 --> 44:37.200
But as you're coming down a very high escalator that's

44:37.200 --> 44:40.040
like a story or two up, really, it's a very tall escalator,

44:40.040 --> 44:45.480
off to the right are these pods of what look like fan-made

44:45.480 --> 44:49.080
Star Trek warp cores with pulsing lights,

44:49.080 --> 44:52.920
their long, tall structures with things that look like plasma

44:52.920 --> 44:57.480
conduits running into them and cages around them

44:57.480 --> 44:59.280
to make them look like chambers.

44:59.280 --> 45:02.840
And then if you look closely, and we have some pictures up

45:02.840 --> 45:05.960
on our website, which we'll have linked in the show notes,

45:05.960 --> 45:08.880
if you look closely, you'll see phone handles.

45:08.880 --> 45:10.800
And these phone handles, when you pick them up,

45:10.800 --> 45:12.300
have something very special in them.

45:12.300 --> 45:16.320
It was a very, very interesting and intimate experience,

45:16.320 --> 45:20.120
and it was the first thing we had to make a beeline to.

45:20.120 --> 45:23.220
Innovators on the line, technology saving lives.

45:23.220 --> 45:24.720
So this has been something that's

45:24.720 --> 45:26.680
been capturing our attention the entire time.

45:29.080 --> 45:30.440
Oh, I see.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.080
So Wes, you go in here and you learn

45:32.080 --> 45:34.080
about different innovators.

45:34.080 --> 45:37.200
You go inside the booth, and then I think you put it up.

45:37.200 --> 45:39.640
So here's a chief data scientist,

45:39.640 --> 45:48.080
vice president of digital transformation at BP.

45:48.080 --> 45:50.760
It's hard to hear, because it's such a loud floor,

45:50.760 --> 45:53.200
but you get essentially a phone call

45:53.200 --> 45:55.100
with a CEO at one of these companies

45:55.100 --> 45:57.760
or somebody who's designed something who's famous

45:57.760 --> 46:00.920
that they worked in conjunction with Red Hat

46:00.920 --> 46:02.800
to go out and collect the audio.

46:02.800 --> 46:04.880
And I was sitting there just sort of marveled by it,

46:04.880 --> 46:06.800
and out of the corner of my eye, I

46:06.800 --> 46:08.920
noticed a lady walking up to me that she

46:08.920 --> 46:10.880
had a look of pride, because I was saying things like,

46:10.880 --> 46:11.500
oh, this is great.

46:11.500 --> 46:12.600
This is really an intimate experience.

46:12.600 --> 46:14.920
We were clearly super interested in her project.

46:14.920 --> 46:18.480
She walks up, and I just went right into interview mode.

46:18.480 --> 46:21.880
So I have a sense that you may know a little bit about this.

46:21.880 --> 46:22.640
What's your name?

46:22.640 --> 46:23.200
Emily.

46:23.200 --> 46:23.720
Hi, Emily.

46:23.720 --> 46:24.440
I'm Chris.

46:24.440 --> 46:26.840
So what is this called, and what's the idea behind it?

46:26.840 --> 46:29.520
Yeah, so this is Innovators on the Line.

46:29.520 --> 46:32.660
We are from an agency in Portland called Second Story.

46:32.660 --> 46:35.360
We partnered with the Red Hat content team

46:35.360 --> 46:37.920
and tried to come up with an interesting way

46:37.920 --> 46:39.760
to highlight the Innovation Award winners

46:39.760 --> 46:44.280
by having this intimate experience like you suggested.

46:44.280 --> 46:47.920
The idea is that it does feel a little bit exhibit-like.

46:47.920 --> 46:51.880
It's really special and kind of elevating all of the speakers

46:51.880 --> 46:52.880
and what they're saying.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.260
And then the content was selected

46:54.260 --> 46:57.040
based on different themes, so the central theme being

46:57.040 --> 46:59.880
innovation, and then each of the satellite pods,

46:59.880 --> 47:02.000
like this one is the future that we're standing in.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.920
It was really impressive, and Emily was great to chat with.

47:05.920 --> 47:08.320
They even took apart one of the booths for us.

47:08.320 --> 47:10.520
If you go to linuxunplugged.com or click on the blog,

47:10.520 --> 47:12.080
Cheezy wrote up a great article.

47:12.080 --> 47:17.560
Yeah, the guy there, Matt, from Second Story, super nice guy,

47:17.560 --> 47:19.160
really talented guy.

47:19.160 --> 47:20.360
And I got to talking.

47:20.360 --> 47:21.440
Well, actually, it was with Emily.

47:21.440 --> 47:23.800
And I was like, so what kind of microcontroller

47:23.800 --> 47:24.600
is inside of there?

47:24.600 --> 47:29.480
Is that a ESP32 and 8266?

47:29.480 --> 47:31.640
At that point, she signaled for Matt to come over,

47:31.640 --> 47:33.000
and he comes over, and he's like, dude.

47:33.000 --> 47:33.520
What's that?

47:33.520 --> 47:34.040
What's that?

47:34.040 --> 47:35.000
He's like, what are you asking him about?

47:35.000 --> 47:36.360
And I started asking him, he's like, well,

47:36.360 --> 47:37.800
do you just want to see inside one?

47:37.800 --> 47:40.160
And I was like, you're going to take this thing apart

47:40.160 --> 47:40.720
on the floor?

47:40.720 --> 47:42.160
He's like, sure, man.

47:42.160 --> 47:45.120
So he just pulled it apart, and it was like, at that moment,

47:45.120 --> 47:49.760
I realized that we were all just a bunch of nerds in a room.

47:49.760 --> 47:53.520
Like, wherever we aligned in the Linux community,

47:53.520 --> 47:57.560
it was like tech toy, and he was showing it off.

47:57.560 --> 47:59.400
I was glad to check it out.

47:59.400 --> 48:01.160
It was really a great experience,

48:01.160 --> 48:04.360
and I appreciate both Matt and Emily from Second Story.

48:04.360 --> 48:05.320
They did a lot of work.

48:05.320 --> 48:08.280
They actually collaborated with Red Hat to build that.

48:08.280 --> 48:11.560
So it got Red Hat's blessing, but it definitely

48:11.560 --> 48:14.240
looked like the warp core or something from the Enterprise.

48:14.240 --> 48:18.000
I think it was 16-foot tall, something like that.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.040
And Carl, you worked on the floor of the Expo Hall.

48:22.040 --> 48:23.520
What was your impressions of it?

48:23.520 --> 48:24.720
Massive scale.

48:24.720 --> 48:29.080
Oh, yeah, Red Hat, they don't half-ass it, man.

48:29.080 --> 48:29.880
No kidding.

48:29.880 --> 48:32.040
No, the numbers I was originally kicking around in some

48:32.040 --> 48:33.840
of our clips are 8,000, but then the number

48:33.840 --> 48:36.720
I've actually heard after the fact is more like 9,000.

48:36.720 --> 48:38.120
Yeah, I heard the same.

48:38.120 --> 48:40.400
Yeah, so what area of the Expo Hall were you working?

48:40.400 --> 48:42.320
So I wasn't working the Expo Hall.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.680
I was doing one of the labs.

48:44.680 --> 48:45.920
A lab, that's right.

48:45.920 --> 48:46.800
That's right.

48:46.800 --> 48:49.000
In fact, before we go there, I think

48:49.000 --> 48:50.580
the story we really should tell, although I

48:50.580 --> 48:52.200
do want to hear about the, and now I remember,

48:52.200 --> 48:53.400
because you actually had great attendance.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.400
Now I think about it.

48:54.400 --> 48:57.600
The story I want to tell, though, is those wings.

48:57.600 --> 48:59.320
The most incredible wings, I think,

48:59.320 --> 49:00.640
maybe the top two in my life.

49:00.640 --> 49:02.800
I don't know, I'm leaving room for the possibility

49:02.800 --> 49:05.280
I've had better wings, but I don't know for sure.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.200
Immediately impressive.

49:06.200 --> 49:08.080
Best pro tip ever.

49:08.080 --> 49:10.600
Yeah, so Carl, can you describe the killer feature

49:10.600 --> 49:11.240
about these wings?

49:11.240 --> 49:12.120
Because you know what it is.

49:12.120 --> 49:14.400
There's something a little different about these wings.

49:14.400 --> 49:17.320
So these are the tin spice wings at City Taphouse,

49:17.320 --> 49:20.060
a short walk away from the conference.

49:20.060 --> 49:21.680
I don't really know how to describe them.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.040
They're dry rub wings.

49:23.040 --> 49:25.920
They're real juicy, though, but they're not dripping in sauce.

49:25.920 --> 49:26.800
They're just different.

49:26.800 --> 49:27.800
The dry rub's the key.

49:27.800 --> 49:30.080
The dry rub is the key, so they're so good.

49:30.080 --> 49:30.960
They're so good.

49:30.960 --> 49:33.120
Like a little cinnamon as you bring them up to your face,

49:33.120 --> 49:34.440
you get a good smell of it.

49:34.440 --> 49:35.520
That was a great tip.

49:35.520 --> 49:37.000
So the experience of running a lab,

49:37.000 --> 49:38.080
Carl's a community member.

49:38.080 --> 49:39.360
I'm kind of just curious of your impressions

49:39.360 --> 49:42.880
of that, just kind of like a short summary of it.

49:42.880 --> 49:43.800
Oh, it was a blast.

49:43.800 --> 49:45.880
One of my friends, Adam Miller, that works at Red Hat

49:45.880 --> 49:47.000
reached out to me.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.360
He was doing a lab about building RPM packages, which

49:49.360 --> 49:50.800
is my entire day job.

49:50.800 --> 49:55.640
And he got permission to have a few extra co-presenters,

49:55.640 --> 49:58.840
got me a ticket to Summit, and then it worked really well.

49:58.840 --> 50:00.600
He got to do all the presentation stuff,

50:00.600 --> 50:03.960
and me and two other people ran around and answered

50:03.960 --> 50:06.440
everyone's questions and kept the lab on track.

50:06.440 --> 50:07.320
Well done.

50:07.320 --> 50:07.800
Well done.

50:07.800 --> 50:10.120
I know that can be a lot of work and a lot of energy,

50:10.120 --> 50:11.920
but it looks like it was well received.

50:11.920 --> 50:13.320
So good job.

50:13.320 --> 50:18.600
You know, it should be said, too, that there was a Red Hat,

50:18.600 --> 50:20.000
the old logo there.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.880
And that was on Rob's arm from Linux Academy.

50:23.880 --> 50:25.640
Yeah, that's true.

50:25.640 --> 50:28.440
Yeah, we bumped into Rob and Gabby from Linux Academy

50:28.440 --> 50:29.800
and hung out with them for a bit.

50:29.800 --> 50:32.280
Yeah, Rob's got an old school.

50:32.280 --> 50:33.680
Also, he's got a pine head tattoo.

50:33.680 --> 50:35.520
So Rob's decked out.

50:35.520 --> 50:38.080
I think he's the first and only to have the pine head tattoo,

50:38.080 --> 50:39.200
actually.

50:39.200 --> 50:40.680
Well, you better step up, cheese.

50:40.680 --> 50:41.200
I'm on it.

50:41.200 --> 50:44.040
He did mention that your CEO was talking

50:44.040 --> 50:45.880
about getting the pine head tattoo,

50:45.880 --> 50:47.080
and then Rob beat him to it.

50:47.080 --> 50:49.760
Yeah, that's great, isn't it?

50:49.760 --> 50:50.400
OK.

50:50.400 --> 50:52.680
Well, I got more to say about Red Hat Summit.

50:52.680 --> 50:56.760
Just two more clips, because the second day towards the end,

50:56.760 --> 50:59.160
as we're walking around this massive scale high production

50:59.160 --> 51:02.520
expo hall, it just kind of starts hitting us.

51:02.520 --> 51:06.560
There's several things about this event that are, I mean,

51:06.560 --> 51:09.600
not to put it over the top, but honestly,

51:09.600 --> 51:12.080
a once in a lifetime opportunity.

51:12.080 --> 51:14.000
There's something that keeps crossing our mind

51:14.000 --> 51:15.760
as we're walking around the expo,

51:15.760 --> 51:17.440
as we're walking around the whole summit,

51:17.440 --> 51:19.200
as we attend the keynote.

51:19.200 --> 51:22.800
What we are witnessing right now is peak Red Hat,

51:22.800 --> 51:25.520
peak independent Red Hat.

51:25.520 --> 51:27.600
They brought all these companies here themselves,

51:27.600 --> 51:33.440
not as an arm of IBM, but as a scrappy 1995 Linux company.

51:33.440 --> 51:38.840
They started up, they brought Lockheed Martin, and VW,

51:38.840 --> 51:42.200
and BP, and all of the other companies that

51:42.200 --> 51:43.480
have been up on stage, right?

51:43.480 --> 51:48.680
And they have created an 8,000 attendee event

51:48.680 --> 51:52.680
that is one of the best orchestrated, best executed

51:52.680 --> 51:54.300
events I've ever been to.

51:54.300 --> 51:56.040
And they brought all this here on their own.

51:56.040 --> 51:58.320
This is peak Red Hat.

51:58.320 --> 52:01.240
So in a real way, it's kind of an historic summit.

52:01.240 --> 52:04.000
There will never be another Red Hat summit like this one.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.160
Next year, they'll be IBM owned.

52:06.160 --> 52:08.320
The deal's been approved.

52:08.320 --> 52:12.160
So it's sort of kind of amazing that we made it here.

52:12.160 --> 52:15.180
Yeah, I think for them to, like you mentioned earlier,

52:15.180 --> 52:17.960
to be a scrappy company from 1995,

52:17.960 --> 52:20.600
I don't think they could ever picture themselves here

52:20.600 --> 52:25.120
in a convention hall this size with nearly 8,000 attendees

52:25.120 --> 52:28.360
and industry from all over the world.

52:28.360 --> 52:31.440
Huge first class industry.

52:31.440 --> 52:34.060
They pulled this all together.

52:34.060 --> 52:38.120
Maybe it, I don't want to say it's a good sendoff to Red Hat

52:38.120 --> 52:40.360
because I don't think it's a sendoff.

52:40.360 --> 52:42.920
This is not the last of Red Hat, but I

52:42.920 --> 52:46.440
think this is definitely one of those events

52:46.440 --> 52:49.280
that is going to be the last of its kind for Red Hat

52:49.280 --> 52:50.600
as we know it.

52:50.600 --> 52:54.520
It's not just that it's the last summit

52:54.520 --> 52:57.040
as an independent company where they brought

52:57.040 --> 52:59.360
all of these massive organizations

52:59.360 --> 53:02.600
and they built this massive ecosystem from the ground up.

53:02.600 --> 53:05.280
But it's also a bit historic in the sense

53:05.280 --> 53:09.800
that not every summit has a massive RHEL release.

53:09.800 --> 53:11.680
We're continuing our walk around the Expo Hall.

53:11.680 --> 53:13.880
We're somewhere right now between the customer success

53:13.880 --> 53:16.080
zone and the feedback zone.

53:16.080 --> 53:17.880
And it really hits us going back to that point

53:17.880 --> 53:19.320
about it being historic.

53:19.320 --> 53:22.180
This is also going to be one of the few Red Hat summits

53:22.180 --> 53:24.680
where a new version of RHEL is released.

53:24.680 --> 53:26.680
RHEL 8 came out yesterday.

53:26.680 --> 53:30.720
And then today, we saw OpenShift 4.

53:30.720 --> 53:35.080
They're really pitching both of these as platforms to build on.

53:35.080 --> 53:39.840
This is the first major RHEL after everyone

53:39.840 --> 53:41.800
has adopted container technology.

53:41.800 --> 53:43.960
And you see it in the things they're excited about,

53:43.960 --> 53:45.560
not only the universal base image,

53:45.560 --> 53:48.360
but all the container-based tool chains that come just

53:48.360 --> 53:50.480
as part of standard RHEL.

53:50.480 --> 53:52.240
Yeah, that's another kind of noteworthy thing there.

53:52.240 --> 53:54.400
You just tossed in there, the universal base image

53:54.400 --> 53:57.200
is their base container platform now.

53:57.200 --> 53:58.360
It's like a base container.

53:58.360 --> 53:59.800
I mean, everything's got the word platform.

53:59.800 --> 54:01.880
But it's a standard container file system

54:01.880 --> 54:05.180
that will work on any kind of container host that is RHEL.

54:05.180 --> 54:09.000
And if you run it on RHEL, on OpenStack, or whatever,

54:09.000 --> 54:12.200
whatever their combo is, it's fully supported.

54:12.200 --> 54:15.800
But you could technically run it on Ubuntu too.

54:15.800 --> 54:16.560
That's key.

54:16.560 --> 54:18.400
It's freely redistributable.

54:18.400 --> 54:21.280
So you can take this image, you don't have to get a license,

54:21.280 --> 54:22.680
you don't have to worry about that.

54:22.680 --> 54:24.960
You can ship it and run it wherever you want.

54:24.960 --> 54:29.080
If you run it on whatever operating system you like,

54:29.080 --> 54:30.280
that's up to you to support.

54:30.280 --> 54:34.080
But if you run it on a licensed version of OpenShift or Red Hat

54:34.080 --> 54:35.840
Enterprise Linux, because they've

54:35.840 --> 54:38.720
tested this universal base image against all the Red Hat

54:38.720 --> 54:42.360
software, they'll provide you regular support just like RHEL.

54:42.360 --> 54:44.160
Yeah, and I confirmed it's not sent to us.

54:44.160 --> 54:47.800
It is genuine RHEL that will be tracking RHEL packages

54:47.800 --> 54:49.360
like Python and whatnot.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.840
And going back to OpenShift just really quick,

54:51.840 --> 54:53.800
the other big thing they're doing with OpenShift

54:53.800 --> 54:57.680
besides Kubernetes, all the things, is serverless.

54:57.680 --> 54:59.120
Oh, and a little bit of serverless.

54:59.120 --> 55:00.840
It does feel like Red Hat Enterprise 8,

55:00.840 --> 55:04.240
sort of their big catch up, making Linux the base platform

55:04.240 --> 55:06.520
and then you can build your infrastructure or your cloud

55:06.520 --> 55:07.840
however you want.

55:07.840 --> 55:09.240
And you don't get a lot of those.

55:09.240 --> 55:10.880
Like you can go to Red Hat Summit for a few years

55:10.880 --> 55:11.720
and there's no big release.

55:11.720 --> 55:13.640
There's no big release of OpenShift and RHEL.

55:13.640 --> 55:15.640
Plus you've got the new rebranding rolling out.

55:15.640 --> 55:17.960
It's the last one before they join IBM.

55:17.960 --> 55:20.200
The more we talk about it, the more we think about it,

55:20.200 --> 55:23.280
historic really feels like an accurate description.

55:23.280 --> 55:25.160
One of the things about the time of the last

55:25.160 --> 55:27.320
Red Hat Enterprise Linux released,

55:27.320 --> 55:29.240
I don't think Red Hat would have called themselves

55:29.240 --> 55:30.800
a hybrid cloud company.

55:30.800 --> 55:33.120
But that's what they call themselves now.

55:33.120 --> 55:36.440
So it's a new era in many ways for Red Hat.

55:36.440 --> 55:38.640
And this is the culmination of a lot of that work.

55:38.640 --> 55:41.840
Also, don't forget they're a culture leader too.

55:41.840 --> 55:42.680
Oh yeah, that's right.

55:42.680 --> 55:43.520
You got to get that in there.

55:43.520 --> 55:44.400
Cloud and culture.

55:44.400 --> 55:45.240
That's right.

55:45.240 --> 55:46.080
Wow.

55:46.080 --> 55:49.120
I mean, those clips really just kind of sum it up.

55:49.120 --> 55:52.120
And it really was a remarkable summit to go to.

55:52.120 --> 55:54.800
And I don't know if I could say necessarily go

55:54.800 --> 55:56.600
if you weren't in the industry.

55:56.600 --> 55:59.880
Cheese, you're probably the most removed from the industry.

55:59.880 --> 56:01.080
Would you recommend it necessarily

56:01.080 --> 56:02.920
for a casual listener of the show?

56:02.920 --> 56:06.040
You know, I don't know that I would.

56:06.040 --> 56:08.120
If you're just say a casual listener,

56:08.120 --> 56:11.240
if you're just a hobbyist, it might not be the thing.

56:11.240 --> 56:13.080
There might not be the conference for you.

56:13.080 --> 56:17.920
But if you are an IT professional that uses RHEL,

56:17.920 --> 56:21.920
works with RHEL, I think it's important that you go.

56:21.920 --> 56:22.520
Yeah.

56:22.520 --> 56:24.960
You get a lot more context around stuff for one thing.

56:24.960 --> 56:25.600
Absolutely.

56:25.600 --> 56:29.880
And I think the workshops like what Carl and Rob and everyone

56:29.880 --> 56:32.880
was doing there, I think those are of great benefit

56:32.880 --> 56:34.760
to the attendees.

56:34.760 --> 56:37.200
So I think that's a great way to get them up

56:37.200 --> 56:39.840
to speed really quickly with the new technology.

56:39.840 --> 56:42.640
So it's a great place if you're going there for that.

56:42.640 --> 56:45.520
If not, I would say go somewhere like LinuxFest Northwest

56:45.520 --> 56:49.560
or come down to Texas LinuxFest, a little smaller, tighter

56:49.560 --> 56:52.200
community, a smaller group of people.

56:52.200 --> 56:56.200
You get more opportunity to hang out and chit-chat.

56:56.200 --> 56:58.200
And the hallway conversation is always

56:58.200 --> 56:59.600
great at those little conferences.

56:59.600 --> 57:02.320
So that's where I would say go.

57:02.320 --> 57:03.920
I, for one, am glad you went because you

57:03.920 --> 57:05.560
got some great, great photos.

57:05.560 --> 57:07.360
And it was a ton of fun to have you there.

57:07.360 --> 57:08.560
So you got to check that out.

57:08.560 --> 57:10.600
Now, I know, Neil, it must have been

57:10.600 --> 57:13.120
worth your time in every sense of the word to go.

57:13.120 --> 57:16.240
Well, yeah, I mean, so I've been going to Red Hat Summits

57:16.240 --> 57:18.480
for the past five years now.

57:18.480 --> 57:20.720
So for me, this feels like this event

57:20.720 --> 57:25.200
was a celebration of the over 25 years

57:25.200 --> 57:29.600
that Red Hat has been going from just a distro integrator

57:29.600 --> 57:35.240
to a developer to a leader in free and open source software.

57:35.240 --> 57:37.600
And I think this event this year, I

57:37.600 --> 57:39.320
think it was a big celebration of that

57:39.320 --> 57:42.960
with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, Red Hat OpenShift Container

57:42.960 --> 57:48.120
Platform 4, with the community booths, with all the stuff

57:48.120 --> 57:50.520
that they were doing.

57:50.520 --> 57:57.400
So my day job really doesn't involve too much Red Hat stuff.

57:57.400 --> 58:01.320
I go to Red Hat Summit for two main reasons.

58:01.320 --> 58:04.640
One is I get to geek out with all the people.

58:04.640 --> 58:10.480
And as you mentioned earlier, we're all nerds here

58:10.480 --> 58:11.160
at the end of it.

58:11.160 --> 58:15.160
And it's a lot of fun to meet all these people.

58:15.160 --> 58:19.120
And the other thing is if you really look at it

58:19.120 --> 58:23.320
and if you really take stock of what Red Hat Summit is about,

58:23.320 --> 58:28.440
and if you really know about how the event works,

58:28.440 --> 58:33.920
if you're a community member of any of Red Hat's over 500

58:33.920 --> 58:37.960
communities that they officially sponsor,

58:37.960 --> 58:40.720
you can get a ton of value out of it,

58:40.720 --> 58:42.800
even if you are not a Red Hat customer.

58:42.800 --> 58:45.000
Well, I hope you feel better soon.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.600
That's the thing, Neil, is I can tell

58:46.600 --> 58:48.400
you've got a little bit of the con crud right now.

58:48.400 --> 58:49.760
You can hear it in your voice.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.600
So I hope you feel better soon.

58:51.600 --> 58:53.600
Stick around, because we're going to keep going.

58:53.600 --> 58:54.120
We could talk more.

58:54.120 --> 58:55.480
We could talk more Red Hat Summit.

58:55.480 --> 58:56.520
Just don't go anywhere, Neil.

58:56.520 --> 58:57.720
We'll keep talking about it.

58:57.720 --> 59:01.040
But I want to get a chance to play this interview with Tony

59:01.040 --> 59:01.840
Lambert.

59:01.840 --> 59:04.240
So after the show today, we're doing a study group

59:04.240 --> 59:05.040
with Tony Lambert.

59:05.040 --> 59:07.040
It's called Command Line Threat Hunting.

59:07.040 --> 59:09.720
If you're a part of our meetup, you already know about this.

59:09.720 --> 59:12.160
And it's a great walkthrough on how

59:12.160 --> 59:14.600
to just use tools built into Linux

59:14.600 --> 59:16.920
to determine if your system has been owned

59:16.920 --> 59:20.000
or if it has something on there that might be malicious.

59:20.000 --> 59:22.160
And Tony is an interesting guy, and I had a chance

59:22.160 --> 59:24.280
to chat with him before the study group, which

59:24.280 --> 59:26.960
is coming up later today, which we should, I would imagine,

59:26.960 --> 59:28.880
by the time this episode comes out,

59:28.880 --> 59:31.120
have a link to go watch it after the fact,

59:31.120 --> 59:33.680
because we are going to post this one after the fact.

59:33.680 --> 59:34.640
We have to now.

59:34.640 --> 59:36.160
Yeah.

59:36.160 --> 59:38.280
So here's an interview with Tony Lambert.

59:38.280 --> 59:42.280
He is the host of this study group, him and El Marquez.

59:42.280 --> 59:44.920
And check the show notes for a link to the entire talk

59:44.920 --> 59:46.920
where he gives way more information than what

59:46.920 --> 59:49.440
we touch on in just this chat.

59:49.440 --> 59:51.200
So Tony Lambert is joining us right now.

59:51.200 --> 59:54.120
He's a detection engineer at Red Canary.

59:54.120 --> 59:55.840
Tony, welcome to Linux Unplugged.

59:55.840 --> 59:56.320
Thanks.

59:56.320 --> 59:57.400
It's awesome to be here.

59:57.400 --> 59:59.020
So we were thinking, since we're going

59:59.020 --> 01:00:01.400
to focus on security in our study group,

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:04.200
maybe we could give people a quick top three things

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.280
to check on their Linux box if they

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.360
think their machine has been compromised, maybe

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.040
has something even persistent.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:12.200
Absolutely.

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.120
So the thing to keep in mind when adversaries

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.800
are trying to compromise Linux machines is that they don't

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.920
always know what your Linux setup is going to look like.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.280
Everybody's setup is a little bit different.

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.040
Everybody has a different distribution.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:30.320
Maybe your folders are set up differently than somebody else's.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:33.280
They tend to focus on certain things that are

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.760
consistent across distributions.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.200
You always have certain temporary folders

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:40.000
that are consistent across distributions.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.860
You have cron jobs.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.840
You have scheduled scripts that are

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:47.120
consistent across distributions.

01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.560
And it's also possible across distributions nowadays

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.640
that you're going to have systemd services,

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.160
systemd timers that are existing on systems.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:59.600
So the things that I tend to tell people to check most

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.200
are files that may have been left in temporary locations,

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.720
cron jobs or scripts that are existing on your system,

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.560
and systemd services, systemd timers

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.080
may have been left by malicious packages.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.240
All of these things are going to be

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.560
left in various types of attacks.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:21.040
Sometimes they're drive-by attacks by adversaries.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.200
Sometimes they may be orphaned software packages.

01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:26.640
Do you have any tips for, you know, even just looking

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.560
at like a systemctl status?

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.520
There are a lot of services, many of them

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.600
that I did not install but are provided by the distro.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.320
Do you have any tips for sort of sorting through that mess

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.000
to identify something that might be malicious?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.120
That is really hard, and the only big advice I can offer

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.920
is to do it like a lot of enterprises do it.

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:44.520
Create a baseline.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.160
After you first install your Linux system,

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.920
take a look at the cron jobs that you have.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.320
Take a look at the systemd services that you have.

01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.480
What are your init scripts that may exist

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.880
if you're using an older distribution

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.000
or something that doesn't honor systemd, at the least?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.800
And, you know, keep a little text file that says,

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.320
here's what known good was, and then kind of, you know,

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.320
as you go on, if you think something's weird,

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.960
go back, look at what known good was

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.840
and see if anything's changed.

01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:14.560
Yeah, coming from the server side and the sysadmin side,

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.600
I know that there are a lot of baselines that we get used to.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.600
You know, a web server acts this way.

01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.840
You know, my SQL server acts this way.

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.480
If you're a desktop user, what are some of the red flags

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:25.440
that you should be looking for to think,

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:28.000
hey, maybe I have been compromised?

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.360
So for a desktop user, some of the red flags

01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.440
I would tend to look for are more of,

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.680
you have certain services turned on that shouldn't be.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:39.400
You know, if you're a desktop user,

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:44.240
you're probably not using SSH to get back into your machine

01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:46.840
as much as, you know, you're getting into a server.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.720
If it's something that you interactively log on with,

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.800
you may not need that.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:54.960
If you have, you know, VNC, remote desktop type services

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.200
or, you know, SSH, something like a lot of SSH,

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.760
failed logons in a log,

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.280
those are the things I would typically look for

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:04.600
on the desktop side.

01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.800
The cool thing about doing security with Linux

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:09.680
is that you do have some proprietary products

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.280
and some of these proprietary products are expensive,

01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:16.200
but the grand fundamentals of doing security in Linux,

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.960
you can base those around shell utilities

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.600
and things that are automatically built into your packages

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:22.560
that you have installed

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.960
when you first set up your distribution.

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.520
So if you want to determine

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:29.360
if you have malicious cron jobs

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.040
or malicious scripts executing on your system,

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.400
you can do that using CAD, LS, GREP,

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.040
all the tools that are built into your Linux distribution.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.320
If you want to determine whether or not, you know,

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.200
you're participating in a malicious botnet

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.240
that is bringing down other sites,

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:47.880
you can do this using tools

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.400
that are actually built into your system already.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.000
Companies know about this now.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.240
There are several companies

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.440
that actually base their threat hunting services

01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:00.720
around using built-in shell utilities in Linux

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.480
and combining those with SSH to do hunting

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.880
at scale across an enterprise.

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.280
Tony, you're being humble now,

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.920
but I understand that Red Canary

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.040
actually contributes a bit in this area in open source.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.560
So where we contribute a lot in open source

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.280
is security control and validation,

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.520
security control, validation, and testing,

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:24.040
because we run into customers in the community

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.680
that don't really know how to test their own services.

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:29.760
They don't know how to test

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.360
whether or not their controls are working.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.280
They decide to go to VirusTotal and download a virus

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:37.640
and see whether or not it actually serves up a detection

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:40.280
from something that's a behavioral control.

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.200
Not all antiviruses are equal.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.600
Not all behavioral controls are equal.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:49.320
So we put together a project called Atomic Red Team,

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.840
which lets you kind of browse around and see what commands,

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:58.120
what scripts that adversaries use in the real world.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:01.240
And you can see, how does it work?

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:02.600
What does an adversary need

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.160
to actually execute this in my environment?

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.320
And you can replicate that before an adversary does

01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.280
so that you can find out

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.520
whether or not you have coverage for it.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.480
If you don't have coverage to detect it,

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:15.280
if you don't know how to look for it,

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:16.480
you can learn how to look for it

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.040
before a bad guy comes to you.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:20.360
Thank you to Tony.

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:21.680
And if you're on the live stream today,

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.320
stick around because he will be joining us

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.600
in just a little bit via the magic of the internet

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.400
and going through all of that live

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:32.080
with much, much more detail and examples and all of that.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.640
And then we should have it posted pretty soon.

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.000
Mr. Payne, I think that's everything we had

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:35.840
for the main show.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.920
You know what we should do is take those pics

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.240
we had for this week and let's save them for next week.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.480
We'll just do extra pics next week.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:41.440
Good idea.

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.280
I think, yeah.

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:44.280
Get it out of here.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.120
Double pics.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.240
Yeah, hype for the pics.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.920
So make sure to tune in to the next Linux Unplugged.

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.240
Get them brats to the front of the line.

01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.120
Brats to the front of the line.

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:55.920
That's right, that's right, I love that one.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.320
I just love that one.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:06:00.120
All right, well, links for everything at linuxunplugged.com

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.440
are probably in your podcast player, I would imagine.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.920
Go check out the new Friday stream.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.200
It'll be live 2 p.m. Pacific in your local time

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.440
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.880
And then we post it Monday for download.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.520
Fridaystream.com.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.640
Friday on a Monday if you want to get the download

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.640
where we've cleaned it up a little bit.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:19.480
Not much, though.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.920
Let's be honest, it's a sloppy show.

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.920
Just the way we like it.

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.800
Boy, I'm getting really good at these teases, aren't I?

01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.320
All right, thanks so much for tuning this week's episode

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:28.720
of the Unplugged program.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.880
I would love to see you here live next week.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.160
I'd love any of your feedback at linuxunplugged.com slash

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.000
contact.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.800
I am at Chris Elias and I work at Jupiter Signal.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.800
See you next Tuesday.

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:41.800
Have a great week.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:13.480
Elle, are you still on the line?

01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:15.840
Because I know you just got back from DockerCon.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.880
Apparently DockerCon cut crowd free, though.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.520
So congratulations to you.

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.440
How did it go?

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.400
It was a lot of fun.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:23.720
It was good to see a lot of my friends

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.360
who I only get to see every six months, I guess.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.640
Now every year that's going to be a little sad.

01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:33.160
But I love how hands on the conference was this time

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:35.880
as opposed to just kind of sitting and watching

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:36.760
presentations.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.680
They actually had just kind of like little robots

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.960
that were running Docker, running around the conference,

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:43.640
bringing swag to you.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.440
Did you say like swag delivery?

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:48.160
Yeah, and could you explain that a little bit?

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:50.840
So they have these little bots that

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.760
are used in San Francisco to make food deliveries

01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:56.560
or groceries deliveries within a small area.

01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.280
But they would fill them up with swag.

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.880
And it would just kind of run around.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.560
And if it noticed you in front of you,

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:08.200
it would stop, make little eyes that look like a heart,

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.800
open up, and there was swag inside that you could take.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.120
I want one.

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.880
What's really funny, though, is I couldn't figure out

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:15.920
how to make it stop.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.060
So I kind of just walked in front of it.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:19.960
And it did veer around me.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.360
But then my friend walked in front of it.

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.480
And it just ran right into him.

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.280
And it gives two X eyes.

01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:30.720
And it looked like it was looking meanly at him.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:31.880
Target identified.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.240
Must destroy.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:34.280
Swag theft.

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.560
Swag theft.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:37.840
So that was a lot of fun.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.720
I did tell you that I got to play rock, paper, scissors

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.080
with Rosie the robot.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:42.560
Who won?

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:43.120
I don't know.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:44.160
Yeah, from the Jetsons.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:45.480
So Rosie won.

01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:47.680
And she trash talked the entire time.

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:48.920
No.

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:53.400
She was telling me that her ratio was so much higher.

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:56.160
And then I thought that I had won.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:59.080
But she cheated because she was like, you have scissors.

01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.280
And I was like, I have paper.

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.440
What are you talking about?

01:09:01.440 --> 01:09:03.400
So it's like a series of cameras they've

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:06.360
stuck in this thing to watch you so you can't trick it.

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:11.480
There's one main camera in its belly that it's watching.

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.200
And then it's analyzing all of your movement.

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.960
It's running over 40 Docker containers

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.760
to run its brain, basically.

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:19.720
Whoa.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:25.240
So they've done 40 containers on Rosie the robot?

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.760
I did think that it was very interesting that we

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.000
could have our own Rosie the robot if we wanted.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.160
Because all of the blueprints for how to print this robot

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.120
are available open sourced online

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:37.760
and can be done with an at-home 3D printer.

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:38.920
All right, audience.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.840
There you go.

01:09:39.840 --> 01:10:07.880
The challenge has been thrown down.
