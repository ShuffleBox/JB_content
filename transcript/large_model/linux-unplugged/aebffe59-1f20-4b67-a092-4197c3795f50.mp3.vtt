WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:04.860
Hey Eric, I was it you that submitted the imp to the to the subreddit you guys

00:05.400 --> 00:10.240
Did you see this we have we have another crowdsourced Linux computer. I'm a sucker for these

00:10.240 --> 00:13.140
I love like you get the promo video

00:13.140 --> 00:17.380
It's like you get the you get the will it make its funding like it's not gambling

00:17.380 --> 00:19.040
But there's a there's an element of it

00:19.040 --> 00:22.800
It's it's so it's a lot of fun and it's interesting to sell these independent hardware guys, too

00:23.200 --> 00:25.000
they've been doing a lot of

00:25.000 --> 00:27.520
social outreach shall we say if you follow the

00:27.520 --> 00:31.960
The Twitter feed just go and have a look at the tweets and mentions of their marketing person

00:31.960 --> 00:37.160
It's pinging basically everyone in the free software community asking them. Hey, what do you think of our thing?

00:37.160 --> 00:40.680
Can you reshare it please? So I said to them? Well, it's not open source

00:40.680 --> 00:44.600
It says open source, but it isn't because there's binary blobs in there and they were like, yeah

00:44.600 --> 00:46.960
Yeah, that's binary, but everything else is open source

00:46.960 --> 00:52.600
I said, yeah, but at the top it says fully open source and it isn't so let's so we should talk about that

00:52.600 --> 00:58.700
Cuz if everything works out the the Librem 15 creator the laptop that I crowdfunded

00:59.200 --> 01:02.320
A couple of weeks ago in the last news segment is gonna join us today

01:02.320 --> 01:04.320
And I I think this is a question we need to ask

01:04.360 --> 01:10.900
How do you promote yourself as like do no evil all open but yet still manage to ship something that is competitive, right?

01:10.900 --> 01:17.340
Which event which is my nice way of saying, you know an actual GPU that has a binary blob driver and closed source drivers

01:17.600 --> 01:21.500
So I think that's a really good question. I want to play this video wimpy

01:21.500 --> 01:26.440
I'm gonna toss the link to that guide in the show notes for people that are listening after the fact

01:26.440 --> 01:28.440
But let's let's play this a little bit

01:28.520 --> 01:32.240
And then we'll talk about it because I love I love the fact that all these come with videos

01:32.240 --> 01:34.720
That's like the best part for me. Oh, we got some music

01:36.400 --> 01:38.400
Technology has virtually exploded

01:39.120 --> 01:43.000
Surprisingly only one thing has stayed the same the desktop

01:43.600 --> 01:45.600
Imp is here to change that

01:45.600 --> 01:52.760
Imp resolves your entire home computing needs in one ready-to-use unit that fits in the palm of your hand

01:53.360 --> 01:55.700
Just plug it in and see what it can do for you

01:56.400 --> 02:03.420
Imp is a full-blown desktop computer that suits all of your everyday home use needs whether it's browsing the web

02:03.880 --> 02:10.100
Checking your email being social or even if it had this holographic interface that would be a slam dunk

02:10.100 --> 02:16.140
So it's looking I'm trying to figure out what the desktop environment is do you guys know

02:25.260 --> 02:27.540
Yeah, so it's a cinnamon theme perhaps

02:29.140 --> 02:35.100
Because I don't recognize look of it, but I've seen or heard about this somewhere so touch my head work

02:35.100 --> 02:41.940
I think it's interesting. There's talking about media streaming capabilities, too. It can even back up all your phone's media

02:46.380 --> 02:53.340
So it streams to yours it streams to your television and it backs up your phones and it uses the cinnamon desktop and

02:54.020 --> 02:56.940
It's called imp MP. So oh

02:57.500 --> 03:00.060
This is this is that we got more video

03:00.060 --> 03:04.620
But what do you guys think was it implying that there was some sort of NFC when you set your phone next to it?

03:04.620 --> 03:09.700
It's gonna start sinking. No, yeah, they showed in the video. They showed him hooking up a USB cable. I got you

03:09.700 --> 03:11.980
Yeah, so it's got it's raised

03:12.380 --> 03:19.660
33,000 USD it's trying to get to 100,000 33% funded 35 hours left only 35 hours at 33%

03:20.660 --> 03:24.620
That's stretch goal. Yeah, that's that's tight. I

03:25.660 --> 03:27.380
guess

03:27.380 --> 03:33.440
See what you have to be buying here is their custom software solution that sits on top of this because otherwise you'd probably just buy

03:33.440 --> 03:39.580
A knock although the prices are cheaper than a knock. Yeah, but it's it's it's way lower spec than a knock. It's an odroid

03:39.580 --> 03:42.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah exactly and that's one thing

03:42.740 --> 03:44.420
q5 sis pointing out

03:44.420 --> 03:49.620
Odroids are not legal in the u.s. Because the FCC will not recognize them. What?

03:50.780 --> 03:54.620
Yeah, no, I think there's devices here that have a droid processors, isn't it?

03:55.020 --> 04:01.780
Well, it took q5 sis forever to get his odroid machines into the like a licensing issue. It'd be like it'd be like oh

04:01.780 --> 04:06.420
Well, that's because they are FCC certified. I'll tell you I had a problem

04:06.420 --> 04:09.900
I've ordered seven or eight odroid products and I've never had a problem with any of them

04:10.420 --> 04:15.240
So yeah, hmm. I wonder if it depends on the model. So this is using the odroid youth three

04:16.180 --> 04:21.420
It looks like I'm not they're not gonna hit their target. So no, I don't think so. Probably not

04:23.020 --> 04:26.180
Is this the wrong approach though, I mean maybe the better

04:26.180 --> 04:30.820
I mean is it is it possible to do is it is the crowdfunding required because you have to reach scale?

04:30.820 --> 04:34.060
Because if I could just buy one of these, I mean, maybe they just sell them one-off

04:34.060 --> 04:39.340
I don't I guess I guess that never really works. I suppose. Well, the problem is that the

04:40.740 --> 04:44.140
Crowdfunding is a way to go from zero to hero in a very short period of time

04:44.300 --> 04:49.500
What they don't want to do is they don't want to put in the work that every other company that exists right now has gone

04:49.500 --> 04:52.900
Through which is sell a small number of one item

04:52.900 --> 04:58.780
Then so the slightly larger number of your next revision of that item then the next and then the next go through iterations

04:58.780 --> 05:03.700
They want to go from nothing to big bang and sell one device

05:03.700 --> 05:07.980
However, here's the here's the devil's advocate to that. So in their specs, right?

05:07.980 --> 05:09.780
They're going up against the Chrome box

05:09.780 --> 05:16.400
Now the Chrome box is a pretty hard competitor because the hardware is literally being subsidized by Google and Intel, right?

05:16.660 --> 05:18.780
On the x86 versions of Chrome boxes

05:18.780 --> 05:24.420
so if you're an independent manufacturer and you're going up against these industry Titans that have can they can

05:24.420 --> 05:30.380
Substitize the hardware cost there by lowering the cost of the Chromebook or the Chrome box then maybe your only way to be competitive

05:30.380 --> 05:34.700
Is to have some scale so that way you can buy in at lower prices and charge lower rates, right?

05:34.700 --> 05:39.220
And they'll make it scale crowdfunding when you're not their only way of having a USB

05:39.220 --> 05:45.020
They've got other USP's that the Chrome box doesn't have like all this home syncing stuff that that I haven't seen on

05:45.140 --> 05:48.180
Any computer out of the box? So that's a USB

05:49.380 --> 05:53.420
So you're saying that that that service value add would justify a higher price

05:53.420 --> 06:00.260
I think not justify a higher price, but justify it existing in a normal retail channel and not having to go the yeah

06:00.780 --> 06:02.780
crowdfunding

06:03.700 --> 06:09.020
Built-in apps and services. They've got the Microsoft Office suite listed in one drive

06:09.020 --> 06:14.040
So I assume that they're they're linking to office 365. Yeah, I think so

06:14.040 --> 06:20.960
This particular doesn't this this is on the go-go and it doesn't matter if they reach it or not. They're keeping them from hunting regardless

06:21.640 --> 06:28.520
That's right. Yeah, they get they get a larger cut taken from IndieCo go there. Right, right, right. No, it's a fixed funding

06:29.120 --> 06:31.120
Funding that you get it all isn't it?

06:34.840 --> 06:40.520
Funding campaign. Yeah, it is if you have if you hover it it says that if you hover the question mark next to it

06:40.520 --> 06:42.520
It says they're still gonna keep it

06:42.520 --> 06:49.360
Oh, yeah fixed this campaign will receive all funds raised even if it does not reach its goal. So they're already gonna make 33,000

06:49.840 --> 06:54.980
Maybe they use that as investment seating to go out and make a product that does go to retail. I don't know

07:00.280 --> 07:07.100
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that has a totally legitimate reason for wearing pajamas all day

07:07.140 --> 07:09.540
My name is Chris and my name is Matt

07:09.540 --> 07:12.100
And you wouldn't believe the day I've had today

07:13.660 --> 07:17.060
So, I mean we got a great show I mean not to overshadow episode 69

07:17.060 --> 07:21.740
It's gonna be great Todd from purism is joining us to talk about the ultimate free Linux laptop

07:21.740 --> 07:28.820
And then there is a major Docker competitor that has been announced by the core OS project and I'm super excited about it

07:28.820 --> 07:32.720
It's really geeky, but I'm really excited. We're gonna talk about that. Plus we got feedback but Matt

07:33.420 --> 07:35.260
Matt

07:35.260 --> 07:41.020
This is Matt. This is the thing Matt. All right. I woke up this morning to the sound of somebody

07:42.020 --> 07:47.580
Pouring water a glass of water maybe like a jar of water on the floor upstairs

07:47.580 --> 07:52.440
Oh, no, and it hears how it goes my wife reaches over sick. Hey, wake up. Hey, wake up

07:53.300 --> 07:59.980
Do you hear that and my wife's first conclusion is somebody is broken into the house and the whole purpose of breaking into our house

07:59.980 --> 08:06.380
There's a poor glass of water on the floor, right and I immediately discredit that theory. I'm like, no, that's not so I go out there

08:07.180 --> 08:10.660
My three-year-old daughter didn't quite make it to the bathroom. Oh, no

08:10.660 --> 08:14.780
Yeah, so that that was my morning is I had to clean a little bit of a mess right there good

08:14.780 --> 08:17.220
Well, actually, I just I you know what I did. I'm gonna be honest

08:17.220 --> 08:19.900
I just put a towel on but you know, somebody had to clean up head mess

08:19.900 --> 08:22.820
I don't know who and I get then and then I leave Matt

08:22.820 --> 08:27.500
I drive to the studio in you know, it's arctic 21 degrees Fahrenheit out here

08:27.500 --> 08:33.980
Oh, yeah, and I get out of the truck in in a very and the jb1 studios is a fairly public street

08:33.980 --> 08:36.060
It's not there's not much privacy to be had there, right?

08:36.060 --> 08:41.380
I step out of the truck and my favorite pair of jeans Matt not like a pair of jeans

08:41.380 --> 08:47.020
I like to wear but my a pair of jeans that I've worn for years. Love it. Take care of them

08:47.020 --> 08:50.620
I barely wash them, you know all of the things you do with your favorite pair of jeans

08:50.620 --> 08:56.660
I step out of the truck and it's they're old. So it snags the like the step on my truck

08:56.660 --> 09:02.140
Oh, no, okay rips the jeans all the way up to my butt cheek all the way up to my butt cheek Matt

09:02.140 --> 09:03.820
It rips them all the way up

09:03.820 --> 09:07.860
I'm standing out there with half of my ass hanging out in the road in

09:08.420 --> 09:14.260
21 degree weather and I'm thinking to myself. I haven't even made it into the studio yet. What could possibly go wrong?

09:14.460 --> 09:18.460
However, this is this is where you cue Swedish volleyball team driving by the bus

09:19.060 --> 09:21.100
As they go by you know, I'll have to you know

09:21.100 --> 09:23.400
I kind of a story along those lines off to share another show one day

09:23.400 --> 09:29.040
I got I'll have to have a few drinks before I share that story because it's it's it's scarring but so I

09:29.780 --> 09:36.000
Realized though. This was an opportunity to make some lemonade and you know, I'm always looking for life's lemonade opportunities

09:36.000 --> 09:40.300
Oh, yeah, because I had as every good podcaster does let's be frank

09:40.300 --> 09:43.260
I had a backup pair of pants in the studio a pajama

09:44.100 --> 09:46.220
You know, I had pajama pants in the studio

09:46.340 --> 09:52.100
So I've legitimately had a had a solid excuse to wear pajama pants all day long today

09:52.100 --> 09:55.780
And at first I was kind of upset about it because my favorite pair of jeans then I realized

09:56.660 --> 10:01.420
Pajama pants no guilt that is almost worth it. Plus. I think the wife might be able to fix the pants

10:01.420 --> 10:03.940
So all in all that's cool. Yeah, it's not so bad

10:04.540 --> 10:10.180
Well, we do have a lot to get to I probably shouldn't mess around too much because tons of stuff to cover

10:10.180 --> 10:15.100
So I'll bring in our mumble room and they can help us comment away on things as they come up

10:15.100 --> 10:24.700
But time-appropriate greetings mumble room great to have you here. Hello. Happy Tuesday. Oh, yeah, you're right about that

10:24.700 --> 10:28.480
And welcome back colonel Linux on the cheap rig. Good to have you here, sir

10:29.020 --> 10:34.300
How's the cheap rig sounding today? I I think it sounds pretty good. Wow. I think it sounds better than I do

10:35.820 --> 10:42.340
All right, it's official we're doing a segment on on colonel Linux is cheap podcasting Linux rig setup

10:42.340 --> 10:45.260
We've got to do it before the end of the year colonel Linux. So you got to figure it out

10:45.340 --> 10:48.220
Maybe I'll game people can make it their end-of-year purchase

10:48.220 --> 10:52.420
All right, so we got to get into some follow-up as per tradition on the Linux unplugged show

10:52.420 --> 10:54.180
We like to keep the continuity

10:54.180 --> 11:00.540
so those of you who listen to every episode you get rewarded by some continuity for every show and those of you who don't get

11:00.540 --> 11:03.180
A chance to listen you kind of hear some fragments of stuff

11:03.180 --> 11:07.520
We've covered so you get an idea of maybe it's worth jumping back into the back catalog. So Chris not me

11:07.520 --> 11:14.400
Writes in with our first emailing says hey Chris Matt and the mumble room I just finished listening to Linux action show and unplugged episodes

11:14.400 --> 11:21.960
Around Linux in the Penn Manor schools and I got to say wow. I am and I I am in IT for a district school system in

11:23.040 --> 11:25.680
WV and that's I think if I'm right

11:25.680 --> 11:32.360
That's the Volkswagen bug and I have been trying to introduce links for 15 years in my district. It's been very hard

11:32.360 --> 11:38.240
We have 22 sites 11,000 students 4,000 staff and only seven in the IT staff

11:38.240 --> 11:41.360
I was envious of Penn Manor with their nine. Anyways

11:42.040 --> 11:45.400
Last year we introduced some Chromebooks and I thought maybe Linux is finally gonna be a possibility

11:45.720 --> 11:54.160
Until this school year the State Department made a deal with Microsoft every employee and student in our state gets unlimited storage on one drive

11:54.160 --> 11:56.440
Yes unlimited it started at one terabyte

11:56.440 --> 12:02.840
But it's now actually become unlimited for them every employee and student also gets five installs of office 2013

12:02.840 --> 12:07.560
Oh, there's a winner that they can download and manage from office 365 and our state has

12:08.200 --> 12:09.000
unlimited

12:09.000 --> 12:11.760
licenses on Windows 7 and 8 installs

12:12.220 --> 12:14.880
The price of office and Windows is now gone

12:14.960 --> 12:20.840
We only pay for server licenses and cows client access licenses. So Microsoft is fighting back

12:20.840 --> 12:25.400
I know this cannot be I know this cannot be free and the state has to be paying something to Microsoft

12:25.400 --> 12:31.240
But districts never see that money and it doesn't even cut into the district budget this

12:31.240 --> 12:36.160
I think cut into our plans for more Chromebooks this year, but I have now seen Microsoft's I've now

12:36.160 --> 12:39.160
I have now seen more Microsoft services come through the shop

12:39.480 --> 12:43.960
Just thought you might want to know that Microsoft is fighting back and doesn't want to die

12:44.840 --> 12:49.840
Boy, it sounds like they're not just fighting back, but it sounds like they it sounds like they're going long

12:49.840 --> 12:51.840
I think they realize that you know

12:51.840 --> 12:58.000
There's no sense in trying to drill down on the school districts go along get people brainwashed into using the product and you'll get them

12:58.000 --> 13:00.800
Later, you know, they're gonna buy this and it sounds they are trying to go hardware

13:00.800 --> 13:06.080
It sounds like a little bit like maybe get the state to bear the cost. Yeah, and you know, I got a wonder though

13:06.960 --> 13:08.280
Is

13:08.280 --> 13:10.720
This a sign that Windows 10 is gonna be free. Oh

13:11.360 --> 13:16.840
It will be I I would be sure it'd be stupid at this point if they don't it's the only thing it's cuz it works

13:16.840 --> 13:21.760
Right. It's hard to argue with free if it's crap. Yeah, and you can see here. They're responding to Chromebooks

13:21.760 --> 13:23.760
And devices like it

13:23.960 --> 13:25.240
by

13:25.240 --> 13:29.960
Selectively making Windows free as they can, you know not making a big deal about it not making it public

13:30.240 --> 13:34.300
But when it comes down to it, they're making it free and you got to think they're doing that

13:34.960 --> 13:41.160
Specifically because they know that the cost of the operating system is like look Apple gives it away now, right?

13:41.160 --> 13:46.940
You know, it's a commercial OS. They're giving it away. Linux is free Chrome OS is quote-unquote free Android is free

13:47.080 --> 13:49.840
So what's Microsoft gonna do? They're gonna have to do this

13:49.840 --> 13:55.000
That's right, and it's honestly I I'm kind of surprised it took him this long

13:55.760 --> 13:57.760
Well, believe it or not there have been

13:58.200 --> 14:00.200
Miscellaneous leaks from multiple

14:00.280 --> 14:06.080
Executives at Microsoft that have said that Windows 10 will be free. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm not surprised

14:06.360 --> 14:09.480
I've read a lot of articles that basically there was a

14:10.600 --> 14:16.400
Somebody like what the executives in Indonesia did say it would be free free as in cost we should point out. Yes

14:16.400 --> 14:25.200
Free as in cost. Yeah. Yeah, but surely that will be some special version of Windows that's free. Oh no, they're talking free upgrades from 8 and 7

14:25.560 --> 14:29.360
Yeah, I don't think in their cash cow is enterprise, isn't it?

14:29.360 --> 14:35.000
With all of the extra enterprise services and surely they can continue to charge for that. To Wimpy's point, it's gonna got no business

14:35.000 --> 14:38.480
Yeah, it's gonna be like a not necessary probably not as limited as a starter edition

14:38.480 --> 14:42.600
But I there must I mean there must be some restrictions in order to get enterprise to pay. I

14:42.600 --> 14:46.120
I don't know. Were you gonna say something rotten?

14:47.440 --> 14:50.240
I was gonna say that Windows 10 home sounds like it'd be free

14:50.240 --> 14:52.640
But they're like the like the pro version would be the expense

14:52.640 --> 14:56.840
Yeah, I could totally see that and Windows and probably for most consumers. It'd be fine. I

14:57.840 --> 14:59.200
Don't like it

14:59.200 --> 15:00.920
They rip us off and then they make it free

15:00.920 --> 15:05.840
They rip off the ideas of comp is and and and desktop management and and all this crap

15:05.840 --> 15:10.960
And then they also rip off the whole pricing structure. It's damn it. I just don't like it at all

15:10.960 --> 15:12.960
Oh, but are there Windows wobbly?

15:15.400 --> 15:17.940
You can probably edit the registry to make it happen man

15:20.920 --> 15:24.300
Right exactly good old start menu say stop

15:26.920 --> 15:29.240
Hey, why don't we do one more bit of follow-up

15:29.880 --> 15:36.320
So a big thank you to Gabriel 3 in the subreddit who's been a very active poster in there recently with some really great content

15:36.320 --> 15:38.320
Especially for those of you trying out open SUSE

15:38.320 --> 15:45.840
So Gabriel mentions that we covered the sync thing GTK front-end on the Linux action show this Sunday and since then there's actually been

15:45.840 --> 15:51.480
some updates and he points us to the web update article web updates really been doing a great job of following the sink thing project and

15:52.080 --> 15:57.520
They do a great job of breaking some of this out for those of you who maybe aren't familiar with this sink thing and you

15:57.520 --> 15:59.280
might have heard of pulse there

15:59.280 --> 16:06.200
Now two different sink solutions that are similar to Dropbox or bit torrent sink or a sparkle share. It's totally open

16:06.200 --> 16:09.400
It has a really interesting trust model, which works really well if you're just thinking

16:10.160 --> 16:14.240
From you know in between some of your machines and now there's a GTK front-end

16:14.800 --> 16:17.440
It's under heavy development, and there's in a couple of weeks

16:17.440 --> 16:21.400
There's been a several updates and now has an auto updater for the by for the binary of the daemon

16:21.400 --> 16:22.320
Which is really cool?

16:22.320 --> 16:24.160
It's not enabled by default on Linux

16:24.160 --> 16:28.280
But web update will tell you how to turn it on a link to that in the show notes and now as a first time

16:28.280 --> 16:29.920
Run wizard to help get you all set up

16:29.920 --> 16:35.440
And what directories you want to point at speed throttling options are now exposed through the notification icon menu

16:35.440 --> 16:37.440
And I thought this was kind of neat

16:37.920 --> 16:40.740
It's doing it's doing and I talked about this on the next action show

16:40.740 --> 16:46.360
but it's actually using the file system io notify to know when files have been changed and then

16:46.960 --> 16:50.180
Making sure they get synced up which is just nice and slick and integrated

16:50.400 --> 16:55.960
So I'm the reason why I'm talking more about sink thing these days is I think people are getting more and more upset with bit

16:55.960 --> 17:01.080
Torrent sink, and I just want to make sure people are aware of a free alternative in every sense of that term free

17:01.080 --> 17:05.120
That's out there, and now it's nice to see it getting a GTK front-end and web update is

17:06.080 --> 17:10.240
Linking you right here to the PPA if you're on an Ubuntu install, and it's also available in a you are

17:11.160 --> 17:17.000
Looking good. I don't know if I'm gonna switch yet, but it's looking good. I'm I'm I don't know why I'm so gun-shy about it

17:17.000 --> 17:22.840
I'm becoming an old man young Chris young Chris would just jump whole hog and you know part of it is

17:22.840 --> 17:24.840
I don't know if you guys saw this but

17:24.840 --> 17:30.400
a spider oak had a one terabyte deal for cyber Monday and

17:30.720 --> 17:34.920
And I grabbed that because it was a great one terabyte storage deal for spider oak

17:35.320 --> 17:39.480
Some kind of I don't know probably have a spider oak is the clients not it's not my favorite

17:40.320 --> 17:43.960
yes, true sink thing is called sink thing GTK and

17:45.040 --> 17:50.980
You just need Python and GTK on your system, and you can start playing with it if you haven't switched anything yet

17:51.600 --> 17:54.040
Check out sink thing. I think it's the one to get behind for a little while

17:54.040 --> 17:59.560
At least for most of us Linux users unless you need to distribute publicly then you might want to look at bit torrent sink

17:59.560 --> 18:02.040
Hey, I'll tell you about something else. You might want to look at for a little bit

18:02.040 --> 18:05.020
That's our first sponsor this week, and that's Linux Academy

18:05.020 --> 18:11.520
It's Linux courses created by people that truly understand you and Linux because they're Linux users themselves

18:11.520 --> 18:15.780
And I think we all know the difference that can make I'm I'm gonna recommend you do something

18:16.520 --> 18:20.820
Just take a minute and go over to Linux Academy right now in fact if you go to Linux Academy

18:20.820 --> 18:25.620
Check out their tour. They have a tour of all of their great features, but go to linuxacademy.com

18:26.260 --> 18:34.260
Slash unplug start there linuxacademy.com slash unplugged it's gonna get you a 33% discount take a look at some of their training courses

18:34.260 --> 18:39.460
They've got everything and I've been hearing from some of you who've been signing up and trying out different things stuff

18:39.460 --> 18:43.100
I never even think to mention they have I think a good one and

18:43.900 --> 18:50.180
If I ever if I ever get around to actually hosting all of my config files on my own git lab server

18:50.180 --> 18:56.460
This course that they have on git basics and all of the introduction to git installing and configuring git

18:56.660 --> 18:58.660
Working with github or git lab

18:58.780 --> 19:03.100
Working with Atlassian or bitbucket just so I have I like this just so I have an idea of

19:03.420 --> 19:06.900
What the alternatives would be like like that is super valuable for me?

19:06.900 --> 19:10.340
And it's so nice to know that Linux Academy's just got this content available

19:10.340 --> 19:12.260
It's part of my subscription and I get access to it

19:12.260 --> 19:15.420
So when I get around to finally getting like my home director whatever

19:15.420 --> 19:21.260
A great sync solution I get or maybe it's our publishing system for Jupiter broadcasting. They stick up on a git lab server

19:21.620 --> 19:27.780
I'm gonna want to make sure I take this course and it's like that for everything Linux Academy has seven plus Linux distributions

19:27.780 --> 19:33.460
You get to pick from and then they automatically adjust the courseware. So that way it reflects the distribution you've chosen

19:34.060 --> 19:38.460
They have on-demand training you go in there and say I need a learning plan for this amount of

19:38.980 --> 19:42.340
Availability and it will custom build that training for you

19:42.340 --> 19:46.540
It'll give you the timeline the estimates if you're at work and you know down the road boy

19:46.980 --> 19:52.020
2015 is finally the year we're gonna get off our butt and get puppet implemented. We're gonna finally do this, right?

19:52.260 --> 19:58.180
Well, why not use that this time now to go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and take their puppet training

19:58.480 --> 20:05.460
It's a great opportunity to sort of get in there do their scenario based training use their automatically generated VMs that go along with

20:05.460 --> 20:09.040
The courseware you get public access to those. It's so neat

20:09.040 --> 20:13.780
You get to keep track of your progress as you go along to give you a good visualization and display

20:13.780 --> 20:15.700
So you get a really good sense of where you're at

20:15.700 --> 20:21.500
You can get exactly how much time it's gonna take if you need to expand out to AWS for some scaling or something

20:21.500 --> 20:24.620
You might want to load on there. You can go take all of the courseware available on AWS

20:24.660 --> 20:30.780
They have a bunch of courseware on OpenStack if you find yourself in that gray area of DevOps that I like to tease people about

20:30.780 --> 20:32.300
But it's a real thing, you know

20:32.300 --> 20:37.980
It's something you find you kind of sometimes you go into a job this DevOps and sometimes you realize your job is DevOps

20:37.980 --> 20:43.980
It can go both ways and Linux Academy has you covered. It's so great. They also have team accounts for groups

20:43.980 --> 20:48.900
So if you're part of a team or a small business or even a large business and you want to all work together

20:48.900 --> 20:54.620
They've got that they have a community support infrastructure to give you that motivation you need and they're always adding new labs two to

20:54.620 --> 20:56.660
Three a week at this rate. It's really awesome

20:56.660 --> 21:02.540
And I think the scenario based training is not only unique to Linux Academy because you'll work with all of these technologies. Let's

21:03.240 --> 21:05.160
Take anything for example

21:05.160 --> 21:09.580
You know, maybe it's an implementation of nginx. Maybe it's an AWS implementation

21:09.580 --> 21:11.780
But the great thing is with these scenario based trainings

21:11.780 --> 21:15.580
You'll actually use the technology you're going to be supporting the technology

21:15.580 --> 21:21.620
You're going to be responsible for the technology. You're going to be on the line for what Linux Academy. You'll actually do it

21:21.620 --> 21:23.100
You'll implement it

21:23.100 --> 21:28.500
That's the kind of confidence that you can't just go out and get you have to use somebody who you have to go with

21:28.560 --> 21:30.020
With a training platform

21:30.020 --> 21:36.300
You have to work with with a group that really knows this stuff that knows the scenario you should be building out and that it

21:36.300 --> 21:39.540
Actually is one that you would face in the real world that difference

21:39.580 --> 21:44.800
That's Linux Academy and you can take advantage of by going to linux academy.com slash unplugged

21:44.800 --> 21:47.460
It supports this show and it also helps you get ahead

21:47.460 --> 21:55.460
It's a great way to bump up that resume fill some time or even just challenge yourself Linux academy.com slash unplugged

21:55.460 --> 22:01.300
They've got courses on pretty much everything if you're just if you're if you're not really sure where to start

22:02.200 --> 22:04.580
Why not go in there and scratch an inch?

22:05.060 --> 22:10.140
Maybe this is the time to finally make that backup solution for your photos holidays are coming up

22:10.140 --> 22:11.900
You're gonna be snapping a lot of pictures

22:11.900 --> 22:16.940
Wouldn't be great going to know in going into that to know that you could create your own backup solution for that

22:16.940 --> 22:18.940
They've got coursewares on that. It's really

22:19.340 --> 22:21.820
It's so much opportunity and they're always adding new stuff

22:21.820 --> 22:27.940
Linux academy.com slash unplugged and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring Linux unplugged programs you guys

22:28.860 --> 22:33.340
Rockstars over there. I can't believe how hard they work and make me look like a slacker. I don't even like

22:34.220 --> 22:37.540
Okay, just we'll get a cup before we bring Todd on from purism

22:37.540 --> 22:39.540
I just want to get to a couple of more emails

22:39.940 --> 22:44.020
Just so we can get through these because I feel bad when we don't get to all the emails

22:44.020 --> 22:49.540
And this next one is a perspective that it's hard for us to sometimes take on the show and yes

22:49.540 --> 22:55.580
I know we talked about system D a lot, but I think we should make a little more space up for it considering that on Sundays

22:55.580 --> 23:01.580
Linux action show it's gonna be a lot of positive stuff because we interviewed Lenart Pottering about among a many many things

23:01.900 --> 23:09.320
System D and we're gonna hear a lot of his side of the story. So mr. P writes in from the slackware side of the camp

23:09.320 --> 23:14.140
He says hey Chris and the rest of the crew. Thanks for all the hard work on the shows. I'm a slack wear user

23:14.660 --> 23:16.260
since

23:16.260 --> 23:22.580
1995 both private and in my daily work. He says I'm a programmer for an embedded Linux and I do some system administration

23:22.700 --> 23:28.100
I've listened about all of the talk regarding system D and I'd like you to address part of this discussion. That's missing

23:28.460 --> 23:30.740
We don't use system D in slackware

23:30.740 --> 23:38.200
The big problem for us in slackware is that many packages nowadays are requiring system D to be able to build or to run

23:39.220 --> 23:42.980
The tone in the slack or community is respectful towards system D

23:42.980 --> 23:48.020
But it's hard for us to see the impact on all 30 on all third-party applications

23:48.020 --> 23:51.320
And I think by that he means it's hard for us to see this when we don't use system D

23:51.320 --> 23:54.060
But yet these requirements are coming up when I listen to you on air

23:54.060 --> 24:01.020
It seems like you're surrounded by only pro system D people regards Pierre or para. I'm not I'm not sure so I

24:02.140 --> 24:07.060
Wanted to give I wanted to open the floor to anybody in the mumba room that has some concerns about system D

24:07.060 --> 24:09.700
Maybe we could just have an open discussion about them. I don't know if we have anybody

24:09.700 --> 24:14.060
I think Fred was our biggest of vocal anti system D user last week

24:14.620 --> 24:18.140
Is anybody in the mumba room have concerns about system? Do they want a voice?

24:18.900 --> 24:20.900
It's an open. It's not lower

24:21.180 --> 24:26.260
Not really. I think this might be an opportunity for us to try and get one of the one guys

24:27.140 --> 24:34.060
Yeah, he mr. P recommended somebody from slackware that we could bring on and I'm gonna forward that in contact input of the production staff

24:34.060 --> 24:35.060
so

24:35.060 --> 24:38.300
Here's what I'm trying to get to here's why I asked you guys because we have it

24:38.300 --> 24:40.300
we don't we have a good sized room here and

24:42.100 --> 24:48.580
You know, I I suspect that the reason why there's not a lot of anti system D commentary on this show is

24:49.940 --> 24:52.700
I think it's reflective of the overall opinion

24:52.700 --> 24:57.960
I think a lot of us maybe have concerns, but we also see that it's sort of a competitiveness necessity for Linux

24:59.060 --> 25:02.120
Wimpy you say you you might have some concerns. What would those be?

25:02.120 --> 25:10.320
Well, yeah, I mean in general I'm very supportive of system D and I think it's a good thing, but my one concern about system

25:10.320 --> 25:11.920
D is

25:11.920 --> 25:13.240
scope creep

25:13.240 --> 25:18.280
it doesn't seem to have a well-defined road map of where it's heading and

25:18.840 --> 25:22.080
New facilities and features seem to be blossoming

25:22.640 --> 25:25.240
into the system did yeah and

25:26.120 --> 25:31.280
Isn't clear where where the edges of that project are right? Well, I think you know

25:31.280 --> 25:34.560
It's not to speak for Lenart, but I think he would define it as

25:35.400 --> 25:38.480
Anything that kind of sits between user land and kernel could be fair game

25:39.360 --> 25:43.040
And and it's quite a big stretch of land. Yes, it is, isn't it?

25:44.760 --> 25:47.200
Yeah, it is it is a very big stretch of land and

25:47.960 --> 25:52.640
I'm trying to think of like how other operating systems do it and I'm you know

25:52.640 --> 25:54.880
When I think of the commercial OS is like when I think of Windows

25:55.840 --> 25:59.360
Windows has what comes to my mind and maybe this isn't a fair parallel

25:59.360 --> 26:03.700
But Windows has a SVC host right SVS host am I getting that right?

26:04.320 --> 26:07.800
Which is this huge parent process that controls?

26:08.600 --> 26:14.400
Ungodly amounts of things and I it is totally opaque to me. I have no idea what it does now

26:14.400 --> 26:18.000
Here's the thing about now. Here's my response to what you're saying wimpy is

26:19.100 --> 26:26.980
The way system D is going about and replacing these individual bits of functionality like take NTP for example, right?

26:26.980 --> 26:32.940
It's doing it with individual programs. It's not like it's all

26:33.620 --> 26:39.700
There's not a system D binary right that it has all this code in it

26:39.820 --> 26:44.220
It is individual programs that are part of the system D project

26:44.220 --> 26:48.940
But they are they are broken out in in small bits of functionality

26:48.940 --> 26:54.720
Which I think a makes it easier to kind of it gives you insight because you can see the tool

26:54.720 --> 27:01.560
B it makes it easier to replace just that component if you replace it with something else, right?

27:01.560 --> 27:05.960
Because it's just this NTP piece. I have to replace or just this DG DHCP client piece

27:05.960 --> 27:09.760
I have to repeat replace. It's not the whole system D binary. So I

27:10.440 --> 27:12.440
Agree that that is a problem

27:12.440 --> 27:17.400
But I think the balance of system D strikes by replacing it with individual small tools

27:18.240 --> 27:20.800
That just happen to all communicate really well to each other

27:20.800 --> 27:26.920
Is a pretty reasonable approach to that and I think too like you have to look at some of the things that have been replaced

27:26.920 --> 27:30.560
And be honest and say, you know, some of these things were kind of neglected, right?

27:30.560 --> 27:34.280
And not in all cases, but in some cases, they were just kind of a hot mess that were neglected

27:35.360 --> 27:36.720
Yeah, I

27:36.720 --> 27:43.080
Appreciate how system D is put together and that everything isn't lumped in together in one binary and there is a set of tools

27:43.080 --> 27:50.680
And I don't thinking about it. I don't think there's anything that's been added to system day that I haven't found useful or

27:51.240 --> 27:53.240
Can see a rationale for?

27:53.280 --> 27:55.440
My concern is more looking into the future

27:55.840 --> 28:03.120
Where will it continue to grow and what will the scope of the project become because that isn't that isn't clear?

28:03.920 --> 28:10.240
Nobody knows right dare Devlin. Do you believe that system D taking over these more and more functionalities?

28:10.240 --> 28:14.040
Actually will make for a more nimble Linux system

28:15.100 --> 28:16.980
Yeah, I

28:16.980 --> 28:22.740
Think it's the closeness is actually something that I feel that we're missing other departments as well. Actually

28:23.500 --> 28:30.060
What do you mean as things that actually go and talk to each other but are being developed in this?

28:30.860 --> 28:32.860
widespread

28:34.460 --> 28:37.220
Multiple repos pretty much it's all over and I

28:37.220 --> 28:44.260
Think the closeness that the system deep project made for the multiple programs is essential to actually

28:44.860 --> 28:48.340
Keep the projects in check and actually in pair with each other

28:49.020 --> 28:53.480
Mm-hmm, although I do kind of also agree with what peacemaker is saying in that

28:54.180 --> 29:01.060
It doesn't leave a lot of rooms for distros like slackware or gentoo or or any of the others dev one that

29:02.060 --> 29:05.360
Don't want anything to do a system deal. Like there's not a lot of air left in the room

29:05.360 --> 29:10.860
So that is a difficult thing because I think we I think most of us would agree monoculture is bad

29:11.740 --> 29:15.100
even if the monoculture is made up of a lot of little bits, so I

29:16.460 --> 29:21.600
I think these can so one of the things that I maybe well then we'll move on because I we've touched on enough but

29:22.700 --> 29:25.260
one of the things that I think we forget is

29:26.300 --> 29:28.060
That the future is changeable

29:28.060 --> 29:32.580
And if we get to a point in the future where there is a big downside to going with system D

29:32.580 --> 29:35.720
The open source community will write itself

29:35.720 --> 29:42.400
It will it will write that ship and it will make a course correction and it's the future is not set in stone

29:42.400 --> 29:46.160
So if a lot of input a lot of things today are written for system D

29:46.160 --> 29:49.480
That does not mean that in five years. Everything is going to depend on system D

29:49.480 --> 29:52.660
It it might mean that we go through a period of time

29:53.120 --> 29:54.780
Where a lot of things but you know what?

29:54.780 --> 29:59.760
We went through a period of time where a lot of things were written for ulcer and now a lot of things are written for

29:59.760 --> 30:06.160
Pulse, right? It just changes things happen and technology is fundamentally changeable and

30:07.040 --> 30:08.080
especially

30:08.080 --> 30:15.960
especially open source software like like I I totally legit get the concern if this was Windows or Mac OS X and it was

30:15.960 --> 30:20.820
Happening happening behind closed doors and we as a community could do nothing about it

30:21.000 --> 30:26.800
But anyone can write code anyone can write a patch and it just takes one person to start a change

30:26.800 --> 30:31.760
We are not under the same constraints. We would be in a totally proprietary commercial system

30:31.760 --> 30:36.800
But yet I feel like our reaction here is like the future is set in stone if we make this decision

30:37.100 --> 30:42.440
Everything is ruined. We can never write the ship it but that's that's that's totally opposite of how open source works

30:43.160 --> 30:46.460
So for me, it's like I I totally respect like god

30:46.460 --> 30:49.960
It does suck that the slack where project is getting the air sucked out of the room then again

30:49.960 --> 30:51.860
It doesn't mean there will always be no air in the room

30:51.860 --> 30:55.000
There could be air that comes back in the future and it's not it

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
It's just we should move forward

30:57.760 --> 31:01.560
And I'll just leave it at that and it with the interview with Lenart goes into some detail about this

31:01.560 --> 31:03.700
I think it's a good pre setup for that

31:03.700 --> 31:06.120
so if this topic interests you at all or any of the

31:06.400 --> 31:11.100
community trolling topics or future of software distribution on Linux and how that might be

31:11.200 --> 31:15.420
Accomplished all of those were covered in the interview with Lenart and that'll be in Sunday's Linux action show

31:15.960 --> 31:18.400
So far, that's what we have. That's when we have a scheduled to air

31:18.600 --> 31:24.280
so hopefully we can just sort of air that and and I totally I'm still willing to take input and and

31:24.280 --> 31:28.840
Talk about the topic, but also I have to respect if the audience is done with done with it

31:28.840 --> 31:30.160
I don't want to dwell on it

31:30.160 --> 31:32.320
but I find it to be a fascinating change and

31:32.760 --> 31:38.080
there was an article that I talked about the Linux action show about how net BSD community reacted to the same kind of thing 14

31:38.080 --> 31:42.160
Years ago and it does really feel a lot like history kind of repeating itself

31:42.160 --> 31:45.760
Just you know, a lot of us don't remember there was a huge debate over X, right?

31:45.760 --> 31:49.800
There's a lot of things that have happened in the community that have kind of gone by the wayside now

31:49.800 --> 31:55.680
There was a huge debate over not as big as system D but over a gel a GILX or XGL

31:55.880 --> 32:00.740
For composited desktops and we don't even use either of those anymore and there was a big debate about it

32:00.800 --> 32:07.200
So the future is not fixed that that would be that would be my my ending piece for our system to discussion

32:07.200 --> 32:09.700
All right, so we're gonna talk to Todd here in just a second

32:10.080 --> 32:16.900
Why don't I do one more sponsor break and then we'll bring Todd in and it's kind of a special a special sponsor break

32:16.900 --> 32:21.840
So everybody knows ting we love ting go to linux.ting.com. You're gonna get a $25 discount off

32:21.840 --> 32:27.140
Your first device ting is mobile that makes sense and Matt and I have been using ting for cheese man almost two years now

32:27.600 --> 32:29.120
Wow already good grief

32:29.120 --> 32:31.600
It is nuts and I got some I got some stats

32:32.120 --> 32:37.360
Right here from ting about the Jupiter broadcasting audience that I thought I'd share as we as we approach our second year

32:37.480 --> 32:43.800
So the average bill for Linux action show audience members and the Linux unplugged and any JB audience member

32:43.800 --> 32:46.480
That has one device the average monthly bill

32:48.120 --> 32:51.380
$26 whoa now

32:52.200 --> 33:00.060
Let that sit for a second. This is a full-featured smartphone. You only pay for what you use. There's no contract nor the termination fee

33:01.360 --> 33:06.360
$26 is the average Jupiter broadcasting audience members monthly bill now

33:06.360 --> 33:10.040
What are you paying today for your cell phone bill? Is it more than $26?

33:10.040 --> 33:14.240
Do you have a contract on top of that go to linux.ting.com, but?

33:14.960 --> 33:19.640
Now right now is truly the best time to ever switch to ting if you've been thinking about it

33:19.640 --> 33:23.240
So you you've probably heard me mention that ting has an early termination relief program

33:23.240 --> 33:27.600
And they're gonna give you 25% of the ETF which is you know about $75

33:27.600 --> 33:32.240
So if you figure the average bill is $26, and you're gonna get a $75 credit

33:32.360 --> 33:37.920
That's almost three months of free ting service. That's a really good deal. Yeah, that would be I would I would take that deal

33:37.920 --> 33:43.760
But ting is upping the game for a little while until January 5th

33:43.860 --> 33:47.240
They're gonna take that ETF relief program, and they're gonna make it 50%

33:47.720 --> 33:52.940
They're gonna give you a hundred and fifty dollars in maximum credit when you switch to ting if you have a contract right now

33:53.240 --> 33:55.040
So noodle this over

33:55.040 --> 33:59.720
You go to linux.ting.com you're gonna get a $25 service credit if you bring a device

34:00.240 --> 34:04.280
Or you get $25 off your first device if you don't have one you bring a device

34:04.280 --> 34:09.280
You're gonna get $25 of credit if you have a contract to terminate you're gonna get another

34:09.800 --> 34:12.920
$150 in credit that means you get a max of

34:14.120 --> 34:20.080
$175 in ting credits just by going to linux.ting.com and by taking advantage of the early termination relief program

34:21.360 --> 34:23.900
$175 in service credits for no contract

34:24.480 --> 34:29.560
Only paying for what you use just your minutes your messages and your megabytes plus the flat $6 for the phone

34:30.080 --> 34:33.320
No hold customer service their incredible dashboard

34:33.320 --> 34:35.320
full access to your phone

34:36.080 --> 34:42.800
Great community if you want to run one of the alternative operating systems like Ubuntu touch sailfish OS or Firefox OS they have an active

34:43.440 --> 34:45.440
enthusiastic community around that

34:46.280 --> 34:48.160
And you could turn it on right now

34:48.160 --> 34:52.920
You don't have to call anybody if you don't want you can use their web interface you can get up to $175 in credit now

34:53.200 --> 34:57.680
If you go to linux.ting.com you don't have a contract you're still gonna get our $25 service credit

34:57.680 --> 34:59.680
Which will still get you probably more than your first month

34:59.680 --> 35:01.680
this is such a great time and

35:01.680 --> 35:04.960
If I were you and by the way if you want to read more about it for yourself

35:04.960 --> 35:05.960
You can go to their blog

35:05.960 --> 35:09.320
They've got all the details up on their blog like they always do ting is super great about that

35:09.320 --> 35:13.680
It's really easy to track what this company's up to because they they're really transparent

35:13.680 --> 35:14.640
They put it all up there

35:14.640 --> 35:18.240
And you can read it through it and you can it's such a great way to get your mind around what this company's about

35:18.360 --> 35:21.980
But check this out. I think one of the best smartphones ever made

35:22.640 --> 35:28.200
The HTC one the m7 with those awesome front-facing speakers, which are amazing for podcast listening

35:28.200 --> 35:33.040
You can own it outright three hundred and forty dollars from ting right now. No contract

35:34.600 --> 35:38.960
$340 and you only pay for what you use that is the with this phone

35:39.000 --> 35:44.520
So I don't I don't have like Bluetooth in my truck. I don't have like an aux in Jack in my truck

35:44.520 --> 35:46.360
I don't but I don't listen to the radio

35:46.360 --> 35:52.440
I only listen to podcasts when I drive and I use this phone I did with these front-facing speakers

35:52.440 --> 35:55.880
I didn't need a soundbar now that I have my Nexus 5 I'm back on a Bluetooth soundbar

35:55.880 --> 36:00.280
This I this is the phone like this is the one that got away. I gave it to Rekai. I

36:00.840 --> 36:06.880
Gave it to Rekai's got my HTC one and I I I covet it and you can get it now for three hundred and forty dollars

36:06.880 --> 36:12.600
Go to linux.ting.com. They'll give you a $25 discount on that device if you have a contract you need to terminate

36:12.600 --> 36:17.280
They're gonna pay more than they've ever paid until January this only good till January 5th, so why not do it now

36:17.280 --> 36:19.280
I get it in this year, right

36:19.560 --> 36:21.360
$75 used to be the old deal

36:21.360 --> 36:27.120
Now now there's no $150 if you got if you have a contract you got to go and then your contract free you can turn

36:27.120 --> 36:30.860
On hotspot tethering when you need it. It's so slick linux.ting.com

36:31.500 --> 36:38.400
Seriously do Chris us all go get yourself treat yourself. It's the holiday season the HTC one. It's the Cadillac

36:38.400 --> 36:42.920
I mean the M8s they have the M8 too. I think it's more probably I who needs it

36:42.920 --> 36:46.380
This is such an amazing phone the HTC one m7 three hundred forty dollars

36:46.380 --> 36:53.100
Linux dot ting comm and a huge thank you to ting for sponsoring Linux unplugged you guys are crushing it for the holiday season

36:53.460 --> 36:58.300
Just a great opportunity to if you wanted to give somebody a phone and then not have to stick them to a contract

36:58.660 --> 37:00.300
Ting's a great way to go

37:00.300 --> 37:02.580
You avoid that nastiness well

37:03.180 --> 37:05.620
Matt let's well. Let's welcome Todd on the show

37:06.220 --> 37:11.100
Todd is from purism, and they are currently crowdfunding the Librem 15 a

37:11.100 --> 37:18.140
Free Libre software laptop that respects your essential freedoms, and I've crowdfunded it. It's currently

37:18.700 --> 37:21.620
29 days left on the crowdfunding effort. They've raised

37:22.580 --> 37:24.580
$41,000 with a goal of

37:25.740 --> 37:29.780
$250,000 and Todd welcome to Linux unplugged why don't you start by telling us?

37:29.780 --> 37:33.320
Why are you doing a crowdfunding campaign for a Linux laptop? What's the goal here?

37:34.180 --> 37:36.180
Yeah, well, thanks for having me on and

37:36.180 --> 37:43.460
So what we're doing is we are clearly crowdfunding to reach a minimum order quantity to manufacture a motherboard that has

37:44.020 --> 37:46.020
the best

37:46.380 --> 37:48.380
free software support

37:48.620 --> 37:50.100
on any laptop

37:50.100 --> 37:57.980
So this quantity of two of two hundred fifty thousand dollars is essentially to meet the obligations of a custom motherboard

37:57.980 --> 38:06.220
That's correct. Yeah, and actually the way that that typically works when you manufacture motherboard is you're talking about minimum order quantities of 5,000

38:06.980 --> 38:13.460
What we've done is worked with the manufacturer of the motherboard to pay to prepay the NRE fees

38:13.740 --> 38:16.380
So that we can get a small enough order quantity in

38:18.100 --> 38:21.340
So that way we can do a smaller a smaller run of units

38:21.340 --> 38:26.900
So that's why we can actually do it for just a quarter of a million dollars as opposed to what's typically a five million dollar

38:26.900 --> 38:28.620
a

38:28.620 --> 38:37.380
Minimum order quantity so Todd you you you pitched the Librem 15 as the first high-end laptop that ships without any mystery software and

38:38.140 --> 38:44.500
That obviously resonated pretty well with me. I like the look of it. It's it's a metal housing. Is it aluminum or is it plastic?

38:44.500 --> 38:48.540
What is it? It's aluminum housing. Well, it looks really sharp and it's got a

38:49.420 --> 38:51.100
decent range of specs

38:51.100 --> 38:57.460
And it ships currently with Triskel is the distribution of choice, right? So if it doesn't

38:57.780 --> 38:58.580
Okay

38:58.580 --> 39:03.060
So I the first thing that jumped out of me and we can get into this maybe because I think this is probably the biggest

39:03.060 --> 39:04.660
questions on people's minds is

39:04.660 --> 39:08.540
It sort of struck me a little bit as Google's don't be evil

39:10.660 --> 39:15.500
Slogan where as soon as you say it, right then everybody's looking for every little evil thing you do

39:15.500 --> 39:19.980
So in this one, you know, you sort of pitched it as the totally free Libre laptop

39:19.980 --> 39:25.620
But there's an asterisk in this sense that it does ship with a BIOS that does require a binary blob

39:25.620 --> 39:27.620
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

39:27.740 --> 39:31.580
Yeah, correct. So it's something that we try to be very clear about actually

39:31.580 --> 39:34.220
so we put it right on the front page of and also the

39:34.460 --> 39:42.620
Certification and pretty much everything we put out there is that we we have everything from the software on meaning bootloader the kernel

39:42.620 --> 39:49.620
The entire operating system as well as all software as of course by running Triskel all software. We even install is

39:50.940 --> 39:53.820
Free and we also promote free software by by doing so

39:54.700 --> 40:00.180
The area that we want to free but is not currently freed is the BIOS

40:00.340 --> 40:04.540
there's actually a binary the Intel FSP, which also includes the

40:05.020 --> 40:07.020
Intel memory engine me

40:07.020 --> 40:13.180
That is a binary provided from Intel and actually it's technically provided through a subcontractor of Intel

40:13.780 --> 40:15.780
And what we want to do is have that freed

40:15.940 --> 40:19.540
That is our goal and then we have a and that actually once we reach that goal

40:19.540 --> 40:23.980
We would actually be able to get free software foundation respects your freedom

40:25.180 --> 40:26.300
certification

40:26.300 --> 40:32.900
But we want to go beyond that and actually certify and free firmware that actually goes into

40:32.900 --> 40:38.060
The microcontrollers at the hardware level. So really what it comes down to for us is

40:39.140 --> 40:46.540
We are as free as humanly possible right now, but we want to push upstream into the manufacturing which no one has done

40:47.140 --> 40:49.380
to be able to free the

40:50.380 --> 40:56.420
Microcontrollers as well as that bias. So that seems like a pretty ambitious goal. How how

40:57.020 --> 41:01.220
realistic is a goal of that level of ambition for a

41:01.220 --> 41:04.100
A company that's not the size of like an Apple or a Dell

41:04.100 --> 41:09.620
I mean to be honest that seems almost like a fight that would be hard for an HP or Dell to win

41:09.620 --> 41:17.020
So how does purism plan to win that battle to convince them to open these and free these? Yeah, so that's a that's a great question

41:17.020 --> 41:21.380
So initially it's really it's about business negotiations

41:21.380 --> 41:25.740
So initially those large companies like let's say Apple and Dell Apple and Dell have no incentive

41:26.020 --> 41:29.900
Nor no belief system that will ever care to actually free anything upstream

41:29.900 --> 41:31.540
so

41:31.540 --> 41:36.620
When when we sit down at the table and negotiate with purchasing a hard drive or purchasing memory

41:37.140 --> 41:44.920
Then we can the number one thing we're discussing is are you a company who's going to back providing us with your source?

41:45.620 --> 41:47.620
under NDA or

41:47.860 --> 41:49.860
where we can scrub it and release it or

41:50.780 --> 41:58.340
providing that source under an acceptable license and then we will purchase from you or in some cases actually work with them to

41:58.340 --> 42:04.780
Provide the documentation to the Linux kernel developers to

42:05.660 --> 42:07.660
to free the

42:07.820 --> 42:10.340
hardware, so it's really mostly about

42:11.340 --> 42:16.460
That our number one topic when we're negotiating is is freeing the source code

42:16.660 --> 42:24.460
So do you is it your observation now perhaps that perhaps other OEMs are not really concerned about this matter and not really pressuring

42:24.460 --> 42:26.460
the manufacturers to do this

42:26.460 --> 42:33.420
There's well Google clearly has and and they've actually made some decent progress on freeing the the BIOS

42:34.180 --> 42:38.140
Working with core boot and a number of engineers who work for core boot. So that's

42:38.740 --> 42:42.300
That's so Google is an exception to the rule clearly

42:42.300 --> 42:45.500
They have other concerns for privacy and freedom

42:45.500 --> 42:52.880
But as far as pushing upstream Google has actually made attempts to do so and and in some cases been

42:52.880 --> 42:56.840
Has done quite well. The the main thing is that

42:58.760 --> 43:04.640
There the push upstream has has really not gone all the way to the manufacturer who actually

43:04.880 --> 43:12.680
Manufactures the actual microcontroller. It'll be to whomever's reselling it and then it'll kind of fall on deaf ears and not actually make it upstream

43:12.680 --> 43:17.880
Enough. I see that makes sense. So the next thing that I think would probably jump out at the

43:18.520 --> 43:20.520
sharp-eyed viewer is

43:20.520 --> 43:24.080
It ships with an NVIDIA card now we are aware of the new driver

43:24.080 --> 43:29.600
but tell me a little bit about the choice because if this is a custom motherboard that must have been an explicit choice on your

43:29.600 --> 43:33.880
Part to include not just an Intel graphics, but also a separate NVIDIA chip

43:33.880 --> 43:37.320
So why why include that when the Intel is there?

43:37.920 --> 43:41.360
Yeah, it's funny. We had we had actually had an ongoing debate about this and

43:42.120 --> 43:45.480
We could save about 75 bucks if we just throw out the NVIDIA chip

43:45.480 --> 43:50.320
So it was a conscious decision to include it

43:50.600 --> 43:57.860
which actually the debate was if we're going to include the hardware that can run with a

43:59.600 --> 44:05.800
Free kernel level driver, but I also want to make it clear that if you even use the free kernel level driver

44:05.800 --> 44:07.800
you're still loading a

44:08.160 --> 44:10.320
binary from NVIDIA into the BIOS

44:10.320 --> 44:15.420
So you actually be able to use it and you can look at the source of the nouveau driver to see that it makes a

44:15.420 --> 44:17.180
lot of firmware calls

44:17.180 --> 44:20.740
BIOS level calls, but so the important thing is that

44:21.900 --> 44:24.220
by including both we can

44:25.460 --> 44:27.100
honor our

44:27.100 --> 44:29.100
purest beliefs that we

44:29.780 --> 44:36.880
That you can run completely free software and just discard the NVIDIA, but those people who really want to include the NVIDIA

44:36.880 --> 44:42.240
Have that option. So it's really more from a customization standpoint

44:43.400 --> 44:45.400
But it was a debate that we went round and round

44:46.000 --> 44:51.920
And one of the issues actually comes from the free software foundation, which is if you include hardware that

44:53.480 --> 44:56.840
Requires or only operates it at full capacity

44:57.560 --> 45:04.780
with a proprietary binary then it's not certifiable. So that was something we actually toyed around heavily with

45:04.780 --> 45:07.700
the certification for free software foundation and

45:08.740 --> 45:12.880
The end result was sort of it's not if so for somebody like me, you know

45:12.880 --> 45:17.320
I think I I might not have been inclined to fund it if it didn't have the NVIDIA chip

45:17.620 --> 45:21.060
So for me, it was I might not use the proprietary driver

45:21.060 --> 45:23.820
But I'd like to know that in the future of my workload needs that I have it

45:23.820 --> 45:29.300
How will that work for say this meets its goal and we get the funding? How will that work for me as an end user?

45:29.300 --> 45:31.300
How do I switch between Intel and NVIDIA?

45:31.300 --> 45:36.420
Well, it's actually called a hybrid so what I actually it's a NVIDIA 3d graphics controller

45:36.420 --> 45:42.900
So what happens is when you're it boots and runs off of the Intel, but whenever it needs to access

45:43.900 --> 45:48.260
3d acceleration then it uses the NVIDIA graphics so you can run full

45:48.820 --> 45:50.820
The entire system off the Intel

45:51.700 --> 45:54.780
And then use NVIDIA when needed you can't do it the other way around

45:54.780 --> 45:59.500
You wouldn't be able to just use at least my understanding and our testing is that you would not be able to do that

45:59.500 --> 46:02.100
And our testing is that you would not be able to just use NVIDIA

46:03.260 --> 46:06.020
NVIDIA is added for the 3d control and you can see from

46:06.700 --> 46:13.840
LSPCI output that you can actually tell that the 3d controllers on a separate PCI bus compared to the VGA. Okay, okay

46:13.840 --> 46:19.340
Wow, so it it's it it does the driver stack handles live switching

46:19.340 --> 46:25.140
So it sends what it sends open GL calls off to the NVIDIA chip and standard 2d calls off to the Intel chip

46:25.140 --> 46:30.700
That's my understanding but that's actually outside of my range. I have to bring in a developer to explain more about them

46:31.460 --> 46:36.020
Interesting though. So how are you feeling right now looking at the funding you guys have?

46:36.460 --> 46:42.020
Let's see. I just said it but 29 days left. It is the holiday season. It's kind of probably a tough time to raise money

46:42.620 --> 46:46.900
Do you how you feel about right right now 29 days in 16% funded?

46:47.060 --> 46:51.220
Yeah, so, you know clearly what the the trending for most crowdfunding is

46:51.220 --> 46:57.220
that you initially have a pretty good push and then it kind of plateaus for a while until the end because there's a lot of

46:57.220 --> 47:01.780
People who will sign up for the mailing list or notify me when it's ending. So we're getting an awful lot of

47:02.540 --> 47:04.060
interest

47:04.060 --> 47:08.820
specifically with you know notify me as the as the days start to

47:09.460 --> 47:14.740
Dwindle, but you're right in the fact that launching during this time was actually a tough decision for us

47:14.740 --> 47:18.100
We we actually considered running it through the middle of January

47:18.100 --> 47:20.100
Because

47:20.820 --> 47:25.100
Getting after the holidays and people clearly aren't buying for themselves and this is going to ship in

47:25.940 --> 47:27.940
You know end of March

47:28.620 --> 47:33.320
April timeframe anyway, so we decided to go ahead with it now

47:34.380 --> 47:35.380
because

47:35.380 --> 47:42.580
Just the mostly trying to bring it to market the timing is right for our negotiations and trying to get some leverage with the manufacturers

47:42.580 --> 47:45.460
So we decided to take that leap, but I feel really good right there right now

47:46.180 --> 47:47.620
so

47:47.620 --> 47:51.060
I guess kind of what I'm grokking from what you're telling me is

47:52.260 --> 47:58.780
There's not really a straightforward way to do a custom-built for Linux laptop in a one two

47:59.140 --> 48:06.480
Three four level quantity maybe one sale two sales three sales every day in order to have leverage with the manufacturer

48:06.620 --> 48:09.100
You've got to be able to cut them a big fat check

48:09.100 --> 48:15.380
And so that kind of does that is that dictating the crowd supply funding approach instead of just taking an order here and there as people

48:15.380 --> 48:16.420
Want them?

48:16.420 --> 48:21.220
That's exactly right so I mean clearly we can we can buy you know something off of the shelf

48:21.220 --> 48:27.500
And then install Linux on it and ship it and then that's really what I consider the the old days of Linux

48:27.500 --> 48:34.780
I actually want to change that in the sense that I want to push the GNU Linux system upstream where we're actually shipping it by default

48:35.780 --> 48:37.780
Manufacturing it specifically for that

48:37.940 --> 48:41.820
So to be able to do that. We can't just buy onesie-twosie

48:41.820 --> 48:48.820
and if we did we could just launch it on our site and sell them you know one-offs the the point here is to see if

48:48.820 --> 48:50.820
there's enough interest in

48:51.660 --> 48:53.580
producing

48:53.580 --> 49:01.180
Manufacturing and basically backing a company that wants to push the free software movement up into the manufacturing chain

49:01.500 --> 49:06.300
so that we can design and manufacture and ship products that's

49:06.300 --> 49:13.700
Specifically targeted towards this audience. Yeah, I mean that seems like a total catch-22 because to make this experience better

49:14.500 --> 49:21.300
For future Linux laptops you have to have that initial leverage at the negotiation table to make it worth their time to go to the

49:21.300 --> 49:26.180
trouble of freeing these binaries in this documentation and the source code up so

49:27.060 --> 49:31.660
It seems to be a unique situation so why crowd supply versus something like Kickstarter?

49:31.660 --> 49:35.140
I'm just curious because I see a lot of hardware open source hardware funded these days

49:35.140 --> 49:40.260
And I'm seeing different sites use so what crowd supply offer that maybe a Kickstarter didn't well. There's a couple things

49:40.760 --> 49:48.660
The first is actually I got to meet the founder of crowd supply and I was quite impressed with their capabilities

49:48.900 --> 49:50.540
They also

49:50.540 --> 49:55.700
Did back bunny bunnies novena project which I think is a great

49:56.340 --> 50:01.820
Project clearly from a maker standpoint right where he actually manufactured the motherboard himself

50:01.820 --> 50:05.620
That's fantastic. And so they had you know experience with

50:07.460 --> 50:14.980
Supporting the free and open source world and they also actually have worked with the free software foundation through my introduction actually to

50:15.700 --> 50:21.880
Make sure that people can buy with without JavaScript enabled. So they're going to become the first free

50:22.540 --> 50:24.540
software and foundation endorsed

50:25.500 --> 50:28.380
Crowdfunding website. So that's great. That's also great in my mind

50:28.380 --> 50:31.980
So those are those are a couple decisions why we went with crowd supply over anything else. So

50:32.660 --> 50:37.660
Todd give us a little bit of your background. Have you been involved in free and open source software for a while?

50:38.580 --> 50:40.580
Yeah, I've been

50:40.580 --> 50:42.580
ever since

50:42.780 --> 50:44.620
Debian

50:44.620 --> 50:46.420
0.2 days so about

50:46.420 --> 50:48.900
1994 been a Debian developer

50:48.900 --> 50:54.620
I was actually a Debian developer before it took arm and a leg to become a Debian developer and then

50:54.900 --> 50:56.900
since fell out of that and

50:56.900 --> 50:59.340
I've been installing Debian forever

50:59.980 --> 51:05.740
Over a hundred thousand units installed when I saw when I was system architects at a couple different companies

51:05.740 --> 51:08.500
I'd use fully automated installation to

51:09.100 --> 51:11.100
build deploy

51:11.340 --> 51:14.140
Debian based multimedia services or

51:15.140 --> 51:21.880
Audio based services. So if you go into most retailers, you'll go into and you'll hear their audio over the

51:22.540 --> 51:25.060
in the store and that'll run a system that's

51:25.060 --> 51:30.900
60% of them are going to be a system that I was a system architect on which are all going to be a Debian based

51:31.700 --> 51:33.100
multimedia system

51:33.100 --> 51:39.480
Very cool. That's a pretty big runs Linux and I I suppose then have you is is this in some way?

51:39.480 --> 51:45.460
I'm imagining you're probably a bit like me where you finally been like none of these laptops have satisfied me and I've

51:46.140 --> 51:50.060
Found myself to be pretty happy with a certain subset of laptops

51:50.060 --> 51:54.920
I'm mostly one of our sponsor system 76 makes some great laptops that run Linux really well

51:55.020 --> 51:59.820
But when I go out in the market and I look out I look for laptops that are custom-built for Linux

51:59.820 --> 52:01.380
There's there's not a lot out there

52:01.380 --> 52:08.140
There's plenty of room left in the market and something that's metal and really tightly will belt will well built

52:08.140 --> 52:13.460
I often will look over the Macbooks and go man. If those could flawlessly run Linux I would consider it

52:13.460 --> 52:14.980
But until that day it's not for me

52:14.980 --> 52:21.340
So I always felt like I've kind of been in this zone of searching and never really found the perfect solution for me personally

52:21.340 --> 52:23.980
So is that what sort of motivated you to start this project?

52:24.700 --> 52:28.180
That actually it's interesting. I mean I might as well have recorded that and played it back

52:28.180 --> 52:33.540
That's that is one of the driving forces of why I formed purism is for four decades

52:33.940 --> 52:36.140
Well, maybe not decades, but over a decade

52:36.140 --> 52:43.700
I have been hunting for you know every year right or every year and a half or so getting a nude laptop

52:43.700 --> 52:47.980
Where I bought from I think penguin I bought from the system 76

52:48.580 --> 52:49.700
and

52:49.700 --> 52:56.300
You know I've always liked the fact that what they believe in and what they promote has been great the laptops themselves arrive

52:56.300 --> 52:57.900
And you know they are

52:57.900 --> 52:59.900
off the shelf

53:00.060 --> 53:04.940
products that can be purchased in ones or order quantities of ten usually and then

53:07.060 --> 53:11.340
Stripped installed Linux and delivered it so I've never really been

53:11.340 --> 53:18.260
Perfect you know really satisfied, and I think to your point is you know I have for one consulting gig

53:18.260 --> 53:20.760
They ship me a Macbook Pro

53:21.340 --> 53:23.900
And I really like the hardware

53:25.020 --> 53:29.340
I you know I thought it was it was well-built it clearly would last and so for me

53:29.340 --> 53:34.820
I wanted to get something that was custom built for specifically for GNU Linux where all the chips would work

53:35.260 --> 53:38.260
without any binaries and and then just decided to

53:38.260 --> 53:43.580
If no one else had done it that I might as well be the one yeah, I could I could understand that well

53:44.340 --> 53:47.460
So in my room if you guys have any questions go ahead and speak up

53:47.460 --> 53:52.380
But Todd I I would I'll have a link in the show notes, and I would encourage people to go check it out

53:52.940 --> 53:58.700
So it one last question say yeah, this makes its funding. Can I put more than eight gigabytes of RAM?

53:58.700 --> 54:00.740
What's the limitation because I see right now in the drop-down?

54:00.740 --> 54:02.360
It's eight gigs is that a physical limitation

54:02.360 --> 54:07.340
Or is that just the specs you've offered like can I put up to 32 gigs or give me an idea of like the expandability in

54:07.340 --> 54:10.120
This thing that's that is our number one question, so

54:10.820 --> 54:15.860
So right now we actually are going back to our reference design to actually increase that to 32

54:15.860 --> 54:22.860
It is a physical limitation right now in our design. However, that is something we can change the issue actually it comes down to

54:23.820 --> 54:25.260
The space within it

54:25.260 --> 54:33.180
So what we're doing is we might end up having to do something where you can go with a secondary solid-state drive in the in the

54:33.180 --> 54:38.940
CD-rom DVD-rom drive bay and then be able to expand your memory

54:38.940 --> 54:45.060
So we're basically looking within you know trying not to because I can't change the case right so I'm looking at

54:45.720 --> 54:47.720
ways in which we can fit

54:47.900 --> 54:53.780
More memory within the same footprint sure and you know what as somebody who I've bought a few CD-ROMs recently

54:53.940 --> 54:58.700
Are my more recent purchases and haven't used them like once I used them like the for the first time this last weekend

54:58.700 --> 55:00.220
So I would totally take that offer that off

55:00.220 --> 55:06.780
Yes, we end up when we have that offer now you can swap the CD DVD for a second bay of solid-state driver

55:07.060 --> 55:11.460
Or hard drive if you want, but the so the issue ends up being clearly a drive is

55:12.380 --> 55:15.860
Smaller in footprint so we can end up it would be almost it would be a requirement

55:16.760 --> 55:20.980
Potentially a requirement to drop the DVD and go with an extra RAM

55:21.180 --> 55:25.340
but we're still toying with that and we'll update the the

55:25.340 --> 55:32.660
Project page once we get the confirmation to be able to go up as much but a lot of people like on the cubes OS

55:33.980 --> 55:39.940
Are they really want to have more than 8 gig because for running VM software? It's you know you need to have a lot more

55:39.940 --> 55:41.300
RAM

55:41.300 --> 55:46.580
Alright, that was all of my questions wimpy. I know you had one that'll probably be of interest to the audience go ahead

55:47.860 --> 55:51.820
Yeah, so you already spoke about the FSS certification

55:51.820 --> 55:57.260
And I wondered if you might try and find out if they're going to be flexible on that if you can run the laptop in

55:57.260 --> 56:03.300
Say an Intel GPU only mode and therefore you're unlocking the full potential of what that

56:03.880 --> 56:09.240
Configuration is capable of if they may endorse or certify the the laptop

56:09.820 --> 56:17.820
Yeah, actually the that is that would happen the the hang-up with the free software foundation certification is actually the BIOS binary

56:18.140 --> 56:20.520
the Intel FSP or Intel me

56:20.520 --> 56:24.960
That binary is the one that is the we have to free that

56:25.440 --> 56:30.760
Which we're working towards we have a couple of avenues to produce a free

56:32.280 --> 56:39.280
Completely free BIOS so we use core boot, but we'd have to still use this Intel FSP binary inside of core boot to

56:39.560 --> 56:41.560
Actually boot the machine

56:41.560 --> 56:46.040
It's and it's a long-sorted story of what as as you know

56:46.040 --> 56:49.360
It's moved out of the kernel and more and more into the BIOS level for these controls

56:49.360 --> 56:53.640
So to answer your question directly the free software foundation

56:55.480 --> 56:58.680
The main blocker for us getting the respects your freedom

56:59.960 --> 57:04.580
Certification is the Intel BIOS to free the BIOS. It is not

57:05.440 --> 57:07.960
Having a secondary video card that is

57:08.920 --> 57:11.400
Available to use as a binary. We're with a binary

57:12.080 --> 57:16.200
That makes sense. So I think the other this is a common question

57:16.200 --> 57:18.400
I see it right now in the chat room and I've seen it when I covered it before

57:18.400 --> 57:20.000
I don't actually hold this opinion

57:20.000 --> 57:21.840
but I think a lot of people think it's

57:21.840 --> 57:27.040
Expensive for the specs and I'm thinking that might be due to the quantities or the scale of the build

57:27.040 --> 57:31.240
Do you want to touch on the pricing and out and why it is the price that it is?

57:32.200 --> 57:35.080
Yeah, it's I mean clearly I'd love to sell it for 200 bucks

57:35.080 --> 57:41.880
I could but the the issue is exactly to describe when when we're talking about manufacturing a motherboard

57:41.880 --> 57:44.880
we have a minimum order quantity to be able to

57:45.560 --> 57:46.720
to

57:46.720 --> 57:51.640
Place that order to actually have the motherboard manufactured. It's all about the tooling

57:51.640 --> 57:57.360
So we paid an NRE fee to get it down from a 5,000 unit order to really in the few hundreds

57:57.520 --> 58:01.360
So what of course that means is that our per unit cost has to go up

58:02.320 --> 58:04.320
And so we're taking us

58:04.800 --> 58:07.520
We have the belief that people will back

58:08.040 --> 58:14.460
The business because of the belief system and what we're trying to do and understand that it's a short-term

58:14.460 --> 58:15.820
a

58:15.820 --> 58:20.060
Larger price tag to be able to get to a completely free manufactured

58:20.500 --> 58:24.300
Device later with the lower price tag when we can actually order it in larger volumes

58:24.340 --> 58:30.180
So if we were to be able to place an order for 5,000 units, then we could actually have that price probably cut at least

58:31.300 --> 58:36.260
At least it would be it'd be close to a half the price Wow. Well that makes sense, too

58:36.260 --> 58:38.900
I mean, it's that's sort of just the dynamics of the market

58:38.900 --> 58:42.880
So Todd, I really do wish you the best luck and you guys can go to crowd supply.com

58:42.880 --> 58:46.640
And look for the Librem 15 from purism and we'll have a link in the show notes

58:46.640 --> 58:47.600
You can go directly to it

58:47.600 --> 58:52.000
And if you all go back at then I'll probably get mine and then I'll give you a review on the Linux action show

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
But Todd you are welcome to stick around

58:54.240 --> 58:59.240
well, we're gonna continue on with the show and I wish you the best of luck and I

58:59.800 --> 59:05.120
Hope I get mine in around March or April timeframe. That'd be really cool. Hey, thanks so much for having me

59:05.640 --> 59:07.640
So we're gonna I want to talk about

59:07.720 --> 59:11.840
Something the core OS project is doing and I want to break it down because I think it's huge

59:11.840 --> 59:17.480
And I think it's super necessary and it's already been piled on by the free software press

59:17.480 --> 59:22.280
That's not that's not even a thing by the people who pretend to be press of the free software movement

59:26.520 --> 59:28.960
They've already called it the container war

59:30.520 --> 59:32.380
Battle I'm gonna tell you what's really going on

59:32.380 --> 59:35.960
We're gonna break it down for you guys and it's actually a really really good thing

59:35.960 --> 59:38.160
But first I got to tell you about a really great thing

59:38.160 --> 59:43.400
That's digital ocean head over to digital ocean comm right now and go get yourself your own simple cloud server

59:44.000 --> 59:47.520
Digital ocean is dedicated to offering the most intuitive an easy way for you to spin up your own

59:47.920 --> 59:53.880
Server and you can probably do so in less than 55 seconds pricing plan start at only five dollars

59:54.280 --> 59:59.040
That'll get you 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer

59:59.920 --> 01:00:05.440
It's awesome because digital ocean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam and London

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.800
I got an email from my listener Patrick today, and he's like Chris

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:14.640
You've taught you've talked a lot about things you use your digital ocean droplet for but have you ever considered the fact that five

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:20.900
Dollars a month is cheaper than most any really good minecraft hosting solution out there and with digital ocean

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:23.760
Not only do you get the ability to host your own minecraft server?

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.480
But you get the snapshots and the backup and the templates right and it's of course minecrafts one example

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.560
It could be wordpress gitlab doesn't matter bit torrent sync sync thing

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:37.720
Why not roll your own sync thing solution and the digital ocean droplet could be the off-site cloud storage?

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:39.720
You know you don't need anything else

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:42.960
But it's really about the interface. This is kind of why I think digital ocean

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:49.200
They sort of broke through the barrier when it came to making this something that's accessible to anybody like you know you can be

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:56.320
A 15 year server admin you could be a 10 minute server admin, and you're going to find the digital ocean dashboard is amazing

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.720
It's intuitive and power user can replicate it on a larger scale with a straightforward api and for

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:08.960
Me I can't use that api I couldn't I couldn't use an api to save my life like I could look at him

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:12.080
Oh, so that's how you do that, but to actually use it no now

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.280
I know for a lot of you out there your roll in your eyes and like oh Chris

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.680
You're such an old man, and that's great because it's then you can take advantage of it today

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.160
But for me I take advantage of all the awesome community resources built around that api

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:27.800
There's applets for your linux desktop. There's ways to snap it in with your existing management infrastructure command lines

01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:31.960
It's so cool, and one of the things that we love about digital ocean you can go over there

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.280
And you can apply our discount to your balance

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.080
This is a great way if you forgot to use it when you signed up now

01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:41.400
We're doing the transition between months right now, so we have two promo codes right now

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.360
I know that unplug November works for you

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.880
So you can go over there and use the promo code unplug November and get a ten dollar credit

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:53.120
Then you can try out the five dollar rig for two months for absolutely for nothing for free, but it turns out

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.280
It's December so unplug December is probably going to start working later this afternoon

01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.760
And you can go over there and use that as well and get the ten dollar credit go check it out

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:04.560
Really if you're even a casual linux user

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.240
This is such a fun experience and since you get it for free

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:13.520
Why not just try it for a little month for a couple of months and just play with it. It's so neat

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:19.320
I have right now. I have my Quasals core up there and one of the things that turns turns out didn't know this about Quasal

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:23.200
But when you're in all these chat rooms logging all the time that database

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.160
Gets big like eight gigabytes big

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.080
And if I didn't have that sucker sitting on an SSD drive

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.200
I I would be in a world of hurt every time I go to open up my IRC client

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:40.760
But because digital ocean has incredible bandwidth speeds has those SSD drives when I open up my IRC clients boom it all gets pushed down

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:45.160
To me it's amazing the amount of transfer. I get and it's all I get to a terabyte for free

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:48.640
And then digital ocean has easy step plans to upgrade to the pricing in fact

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:53.400
They have it all listed out on their site. You just click that pricing tab, and it's really straightforward and the other thing that's cool

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.720
Hourly pricing you know like your favorite hotel

01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.480
They have hourly pricing over digital oceans if you need to scale for a little while you're doing a big deployment something like that

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:06.720
You can spin up a server and then shut it down when you're done and digital oceans up in the game on the tutorials for

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:11.200
The community in fact Patrick who sent in the email about his minecraft server

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:18.820
used a digital ocean community tutorial to set up that minecraft server and this what's neat is they realize this is a

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:25.260
Massive advantage that they have over their competition so instead of just sitting there and just kind of sitting back and be like oh yeah

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.840
Everybody write it in no

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:31.800
They're actually gonna pay you and they're gonna have editing staff that's gonna work with you you can earn up to

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.000
$200 to write a tutorial for digital ocean now if you are a Linux geek

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:42.760
And you know how to set something up like a frickin minecraft server why not go make $200 seriously now somebody already took that one

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.680
But there's hundreds of other topics you could write and work with their staff

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:52.960
digital ocean comm unplug November to get that ten dollar dollar credit try out that five dollar dollar rig for two months for

01:03:53.400 --> 01:04:01.460
Absolutely free so freaking cool. It is the coolest thing ever seriously as somebody who's worked in IT for 15 years

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:07.620
When I see this, I'm sorry. I cannot help but geek out today after all of this time

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:11.380
I've been using digital ocean for months and months and months. I still sit down. I think

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:19.300
The holy smokes this is crazy cool the fact that they saw the potential behind SSD when nobody would touch SSD because of the cost

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.820
The fact that they saw that KVM was an awesome

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:26.860
Virtualization platform before anybody else saw it and then they build it all on top of Linux and they integrate with core OS

01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:30.860
They're all about that Docker one-click deployments. It's so slick

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:37.220
It's such a good system and on top of all of that you get the satisfaction of supporting your favorite podcast network

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:40.340
Digital ocean comm use the promo code unplug November

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:46.140
Seriously go see what I've been talking about and a huge. Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplugged

01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:49.460
Alright, Matt. I don't know if you saw the big hoopla

01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:57.460
But you know dockers all the rage these days everybody's talking about Docker right well core OS wants to talk about rocket

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:01.580
Mm-hmm wimpy did you see the announcement about rocket I?

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:07.860
Have not no all right all right good. I'm gonna teach you something today wimpy so buckle up here we go

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:14.260
I am super excited about rocket so you put your pants on the outside of your trousers now my pajamas

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:19.660
The fact he's wearing pants at all is just like it. No. I'm just keep in mind his pajamas. Let's not get crazy

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:24.980
All right, so you if you listen depending on who you read like the register

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:30.300
I apparently a new Linux container war has begun. That's crap right. That's that's total crap first of all

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.300
I want to set something up right up front

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:37.180
Core OS is not moving away from Docker Docker will continue to ship in core OS and be well supported

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:43.220
And I want to give you the recap because the core OS guys which who we've interviewed on Linux action show I

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:46.300
Tried to talk to Mark Shuttleworth about it last week

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.800
And he very quickly changed the topic which to me was

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:54.220
Maybe an indicator that he's a he's aware of the heat that core OS is bringing. There's already major clients

01:05:54.220 --> 01:06:00.500
Enterprise great clients that use core OS the whole idea behind core OS right is you you isolate out a lot of the

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:05.340
Applications and the server services into containers, and then you just roll that base, baby

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:11.020
You get that open SSL patch you get that shell shock that you patch patch patch mother because you know what all the maps are

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:17.260
In containers, and it's safe well. That's the idea, but the problem is and this is something that's been bothering me for a while

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:22.920
Docker has gotten big, and I don't mean like big code wise I mean big like

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.680
publicity wise big company wise big

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:34.400
Contracts wise and docker is expanding out way way beyond the original vision right it's a whole platform docker is not a

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:41.720
Container anymore docker is a platform of services in which container ization is one of those things

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:44.120
So that's where core OS picks up

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.120
They say when docker was first introduced in

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:53.160
Early 2013 the idea of a standard container was striking and immediately attractive a simple component a composable unit

01:06:53.160 --> 01:07:00.080
That could be used on a variety of systems the docker repository included a manifesto of what a standard container should be

01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:06.280
This was a rally cry to the industry and we quickly followed Brandon Phillips the co-founder and CTO of core

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.000
West became a top contributor to the docker project

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.240
He now serves on the docker board the governance board

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:16.840
We thought docker would become a simple unit that we could all agree on

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:24.520
Unfortunately a simple reusable component is not how things played out docker is now building tools for launching cloud services

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:33.440
Systems for clustering and a wide range of functions from functions from building images to running images uploading downloading and eventually even overlaying networking

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:40.560
All compiled into one monolithic binary running as root on your server the standard container manifesto was removed

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:45.800
We should really stop talking about docker containers and start talking about the docker platform

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:51.200
It's not becoming a simple composable building block. We had envisioned so they're introducing rocket

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:55.200
We still believe in the original premise of containers that docker introduced

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.940
So we're going to do something about it while we're at it

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:02.680
We're cleaning up and fixing a few things we'd like to see in a production ready container

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:08.880
And the things that they lay out here are things that have fundamentally bothered me about docker. I am a huge supporter of docker

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:12.400
I think it's great. I think it continues to be great, but a few things have bothered me

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:19.400
Isolation should be pluggable and the crypto primitives first trust should be strong image auditing and application identity

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.920
Need to exist from day one ie

01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:26.400
Signed containers signed applications so that way when you get them distributed to you

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:31.340
You know they are legitimate from the original source that you expect them image distribution now

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:35.120
The docker hub is neat because you can check in something like smoke ping

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.920
Check it up to the docker hub and anybody can check it out boy

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:43.300
That's great, but the problem is it's centralized right? It's an open source thing. That's centralized well

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:45.300
We know what happens when you centralized things

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:50.680
Core OS thinks that discovery of container images should be simple and they should have a

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.720
facilitated by a federated

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.840
Namespace

01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:00.100
So you can do distributed retrieval this opens up the possibility for alternative protocols to distribute these images

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.800
potentially like bit torrent and

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:08.880
Deployments inside private environments without the need of an external registry like the docker hub

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:11.400
That's a huge one for me also

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:19.360
They believe the format and runtime should be well specified and developed by an open community with implementations and tools that can run

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:24.720
The same container consistently across different platforms rocket is what they're introducing

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:31.520
It's a command-line tool for running app containers an app container is a specification of an image format container runtime and discovery mechanism

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.760
So it's an app container tells you what it is

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:39.460
What the runtime stuff is you need and how you get this container?

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:45.900
That's what an app container is rocket is the first implementation of an app container and they expect there'll be other ones

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:51.840
And all of this information is linked up in the show notes, but they they have a fact that I think I want to cover

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:53.840
They say here. Why are you doing this now?

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:58.000
They say at Core OS we have a large serious

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.280
users in enterprise environments

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:07.380
And we cannot in good faith continue to support docker's broken security model without addressing these issues

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:11.600
This is something we've talked about on tech snap on several episodes of tech snap

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:14.340
There is fundamentally some issues with the docker security model

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:20.920
And rocket plans to address those they go on to say will core OS continue to ship docker. Yes period

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.840
We will continue to make sure core OS is the best place to run docker. So this is

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.440
Not exactly a war so much as a fundamental

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.240
Divergence of how container technology on linux should work

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:36.440
Now the docker project very quickly posted a follow-up

01:10:36.920 --> 01:10:40.760
There's a lot in this, but I highlighted a few important areas

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:43.320
They say while docker continues to define a single container format

01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:49.400
It's clear that our users and the vast majority of contributors and vendors want docker to enable the distributed applications

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:55.000
Consisting of multiple discrete containers running across multiple hosts and I in other words some of the things we're doing is

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.720
Because people want us to do them

01:10:56.720 --> 01:11:03.280
We think it should it we think it would be a shame if the clean open interfaces and anywhere portability and robust set of

01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:10.120
Ecosystem tools that exist for a single docker container applications were lost if we went to a world of multiple containers and distributed

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:14.920
Applications they say we'll provide more detail at dockercon conference this week in amsterdam

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:21.080
they go on to say we are committed to an ecosystem of users vendors and contributors whether people add value in the form of

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:28.360
contributions to docker as independent projects that build on the docker container format or as plug-ins to the docker orchestration api's

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:32.440
Or otherwise we hope that the open layered approach

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:37.160
Provides the best options for all so docker says we are an open layered approach. Yes

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.800
We have some bits and components here that we keep secret sauce

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.520
But we have open governance

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:47.640
But we have open governance. They say in some cases of course there are technical or Phil's

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:55.160
Philosophical differences that appears to be the case with the recent announcement of rocket we hope to address some of these technical arguments

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:59.120
posed by the rocket project in a subsequent post so more to come

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:04.360
Now I thought it was interesting. I this is some of you might not care at all

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.680
But what I found to be interesting is two things

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:10.280
Containers obviously a huge deal not new to linux

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:14.520
Not new to operating systems in general, but there's a lot of heat around them right now

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:19.960
I think that's undeniable you can look at the billions in funding that docker has gotten or I think it's a billion now

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:23.960
you can look at the massive pickup that a

01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:28.240
Freshman project like core os has seen because it's based around containers

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:35.360
Red Hat Enterprise 7 kind of I think some could argue rushed to implement docker support because it was such a talked about feature

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:42.080
The largest enterprise linux distribution in the world the top granddad of enterprise linux issues that everybody recognized. Oh, it's right

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:43.040
Oh, it's right. That's right

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:49.240
They rushed to ship docker support because they felt the pressure to be hip and modern and have docker in there right so to have

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.260
To have core os one of the biggest contributors to docker

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:55.240
Come along and announce something else

01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.360
People have reacted kind of strongly to this and matt you can probably guess some people have thrown their arms up in the air

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.360
And said oh, this is the problem with linux

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:07.600
Everything's always forking it yeah, it's like fork this fork that fork everyone

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.960
You know and I think that's kind of the attitude that comes to what kind of dwelled out of this whole thing

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:18.080
But I think I think they're actually I think rocket is actually going to address some serious competitive

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:21.920
I think it's going to bring some serious competitiveness to docker

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.220
I think it's like it's addressing issues that I've watched docker

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:31.280
Go from this is a really great way to make sure this application runs the same exact way on any distribution to

01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.840
The docker platform, which is this is huge thing. It's almost too big now. I think so

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.120
I think you know of course

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:44.280
There's the old marketing law first, but as we saw with Google they can you can obviously trump that but I think the real key

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:49.800
Is what they're pushing forward is their big claim to fame is security that'll resonate with enterprise folks

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:56.280
So that may actually work out in their favor, and they may get the traction they need yeah, and I like this federated discovery system

01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:01.160
They're talking about where the protocol to distribute the container is pluggable like it could be bit torrent

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:06.920
There's obviously some advantages to that especially for like smaller projects that don't have huge bandwidth capabilities

01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.220
That's kind of a neat way to distribute things. I like to that. I maybe could have a private

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:15.720
Quote-unquote hub of these things maybe we could have like a you know an internal JB server

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:19.060
We check things in and out doesn't need to be up on the centralized docker hub

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:26.100
So I think they're actually doing and oh and also they're doing a some actual real good like serious crypto signing

01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:30.100
They had a Google hangout today where they talked about some of the technology

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:34.840
They're using and why they chose it and it I think some of the hostile

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:41.520
attitude that people are taking away in the press is they're kind of calling docker out for not totally being enterprise ready and

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:46.180
Not everybody really wants to hear that, but it's the truth. I think you nailed it

01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:52.280
I also think the fact it seems like they did wait long enough for docker to kind of absorb major funds and say okay now

01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:56.240
What are you gonna? Do about the security issues and and then it was just dead air and so now

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.640
I think they're kind of like okay. You know what fine. We'll do it. Yeah

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:04.280
Yeah, and I think you know core OS obviously has a lot of skin in the game because they're sure and they're this isn't core

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.800
This is not going to be core OS specific code. This is gonna be open code

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.120
That's available to anybody use just like they did with etc D

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:16.760
And I'm I'm I'm thinking for us Linux users. This is a really good thing and

01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:20.920
You know every time we talk about this of course the free BSD guys always say oh

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.320
We've had jails forever and the slayers guys always had zones

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:28.640
And you know somebody's like oh, but I've been using LXC, but the thing is is this whole?

01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:35.480
Plug-in software and pull it down thing is is unique and special and it's I think it was sort of the tipping point that made

01:15:35.480 --> 01:15:37.880
This sort of more of a common popular concept

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:42.580
I'm kind of excited about what the core OS guys are working on and so producer q5 sis is

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:46.180
Working to line up a chat with folks from core OS to talk to us about it

01:15:46.180 --> 01:15:51.660
So that way we can pick their brain and kind of maybe get directly from them where they feel like docker was maybe slightly

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:54.940
Deficient and it needed to be replaced and what some of those serious issues

01:15:54.940 --> 01:16:00.640
They think they have that don't make it ready for enterprise. I'd like to get their answer on that too. Yeah, it's interesting times

01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:07.740
It just like came out of nowhere. I wasn't really of course. I don't follow core OS super closely, but I wasn't expecting this

01:16:08.780 --> 01:16:15.100
Mumble room any thoughts before we run on this topic last chance or forever hold your peace going once going twice and

01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:23.660
No, and sold so q5 sis in the production chat tells me right now that we might have Brandon on Sunday to do an interview

01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:26.700
I don't know if we'll air it in Sunday show since we have like an hour-long chat with an art

01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:31.620
but if you tune in for the live show, you'll catch the live taping of it, and I don't know when we'll air that but

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:39.180
We'll work that out. But yeah, so we should have Brandon on from core OS Brandon is one of the top contributors to Docker

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:42.580
He sits on the governance board of Docker. He works on the core OS project

01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:47.620
He's one of the people behind rocket and he'll be joining us on the Sunday live stream to answer those questions

01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:50.500
If all if all the scheduling works out, so I should be tough

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.240
Okay. Well, we just have a couple of things to cover before we run

01:16:54.240 --> 01:16:57.200
I'm still looking for the best of so if you go to the show notes

01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:01.220
You'll find a link for a form to fill out for the best of moments of Jupiter broadcasting

01:17:01.220 --> 01:17:04.620
We're gonna try to take the holiday week off and give people a recap of some of the best stuff

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.180
You can find a link to that in the show notes

01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:10.260
We need your help and your suggestions of moments that you liked doesn't have to be a lot

01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:14.180
But you'll see the form we got all the stuff in there and don't forget

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.620
We'd love to have you contact us go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:22.040
Choose Linux unplugged from the drop-down and send us in your feedback

01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:26.880
We love doing the feedback at the top of the show and you can always go to Linux action show dot reddit comm

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:29.900
We'll have threads for this specific episode, but you can start your own thread

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:35.340
Just comment on existing threads vote things up or down helps make a better show got lots of stuff, too

01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:37.080
I mean more and more coming up

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:42.980
It's funny because I thought we'd have a big slowdown with the holiday season, but our producers are there a crack team

01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:48.220
They're working on keeping content flowing and with all the news and thanks to folks like Todd for coming on

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:51.900
We've got lots of good stuff to talk about. So I think it's gonna be a couple of good weeks of shows

01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.700
So don't go anywhere

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:58.780
Even if you get the time off don't forget your Linux action show Linux unplugged shows will be here and you can join us live

01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:04.540
We do this show Tuesday 2 p.m. Pacific go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar to get that converted to your local time

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:09.540
All right, Matt. Well, I'll see you on Sunday with the chinat with our chat with Lenart Pottering. All right, sounds good

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:15.180
See that okay everybody. Thanks so much for tuning in this week's episode of Linux action show. Nope of Linux unplug

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:45.140
I'll see you right back here next Tuesday

01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:58.540
Well, what show am I doing what day is it Linux action show I got too many what am I doing? Yeah

01:19:02.220 --> 01:19:08.860
No, it's pajamas there's pajamas I tell you all right, so go to JB titles calm go pick a title everybody go vote

01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:10.860
I got kind of

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:16.060
To run together. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know what turns out pajama bottoms are way more

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:20.860
Like they keep the heat in a lot more than jeans do so it is hot. It's hot

01:19:21.420 --> 01:19:23.420
Yeah, I've been wearing myself

01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:28.060
What I'm I'm I'm sat here in my pants Chris because it's so humid

01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:30.980
Yeah, remind me where you're at again

01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:35.460
Whimpy's on the road. I mean, I'm in Kuala Lumpur Kuala Lumpur

01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:38.940
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:40.140
Really?

01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:42.140
Well, that's a really good question

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:46.660
I'd love to tell you all if you if you promise not to put it out in the in the show

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:50.380
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna have to tell me later. Thanks. I'm still recording. Yeah, I don't want to get you in trouble

01:19:51.820 --> 01:19:55.920
Doesn't mind if it goes out on the live stream just don't put it in the in the edit

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:56.260
All right

01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:56.420
Yeah

01:19:56.420 --> 01:20:00.300
For you before you tell me I want to give a plug to something that I meant to mention in the show and then I'll turn

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.580
Off the recording and you can tell it just to the live stream

01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:10.180
Um, so before we go, I want to give a plug and then we'll wrap up there is a QMU advent calendar

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:13.300
And this is the best thing I've seen all year

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:19.100
so every day they're doing a QMU virtual image pick and

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:21.940
Today is day two

01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:24.700
So we're just at the beginning of it and it's modern dos

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:30.320
The free dos disk image contains the latest and greatest from the land of the disk operating system besides checking out dos

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.320
with a TCP IP stack

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:40.260
He says you can relive id software's early shareware hit commander Keen as a bonus the free software edition of jetpack is also included

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:46.480
For your crazy jet-powered platformer action. So QMU dash advent calendar org

01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:51.440
I'll have a link in the show notes day one was slackers time travel so you can go back and get the old ones

01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:55.280
This is what when you dig up the earliest slack or image to be had and you can go play around with it

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:59.240
It ships with colonel zero dot nine nine dot twelve. Yeah, I said zero

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.200
Dot nine nine dot twelve

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:07.520
So it's not a great idea a QMU advent calendar. That's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, so all the Lincoln thing I've seen a week

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.520
I just had a great experience

01:21:09.880 --> 01:21:14.840
Just a few minutes ago for the first time I needed to actually print from like my my desk workstation

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.120
I have printing set up on the machines here in the studio like for notes

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:21.560
But today I was up in my office and I realized I had cups installed

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:26.480
but I didn't have like the PPD file for my brother laser printer and

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:31.400
I bought it because I had read that it was a fairly well Linux supported laser printer

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:38.360
And so I just did a packer search for for the model number of my brother printer

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:44.840
And then the one result I got back was the PPD file for my exact brother printer

01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:49.360
I packer dash s that that file name that package name and within 30 seconds

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:54.560
I had all of the cups printing set up for my my brother laser printer and I printed out the notes for today

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:58.560
It was a pretty it was it felt a little it fell a little 2014 is all I'm saying

01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:01.400
It just felt like the future a little bit. Like that was the easiest printer setup I've ever had

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:04.880
Yeah, there's lots of brother support in the AUR

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:10.280
I think I maintain two of the brother printers there because I've got one at home and yeah what I've done

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:18.680
AUR actually has the exact same printer drivers that you get from Ubuntu in terms of the extras

01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:26.680
Yeah, yeah, they're usually deb files that are then extracted and sprayed around them at the appropriate places

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:31.280
And what I've done recently at home to avoid that whole printer driver

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:37.960
Sort of arrangement is there's somebody's implemented the Google Cloud Print

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.720
API and services that integrates with cups

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:48.520
So I've got a Debbie and Weezy box that has got cups in so actually running open media vault

01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:52.120
And then put the cloud print API

01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:58.760
Into that and in order to get it to work, you actually have to put the printer drivers on the cup server

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.240
so now that printer

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:08.440
Advertises itself through the cloud print API for your Android phones and your Chromebooks. Not that I've got a Chromebook and the Chrome browser

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:15.120
Oh, yeah. Yes, but it also makes publish it over multicast DNS on the LAN

01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:22.920
So you just get a Wi-Fi connection and that printer appears and you do to it without having to install anything on your machine

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:25.760
So it works from like live ISOs and stuff like that

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:31.280
That's really so you just you just set it up once on that dedicated box and you set it up once on that box

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:37.160
And then it's available forever and always on everything. Hmm. Yeah, that Google Print thing is actually pretty handy

01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:40.720
I got to admit it is kind of nice. Yeah, it's a bit janky to set up

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.720
But it works really well once you go through the steps

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:46.080
Mm-hmm. I've been thinking about doing the exact same thing using my server

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:49.700
Only thing is it's running open Sousa and it has been for several months now

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:55.520
The problem with open Sousa is it's running an old version of cups that's incompatible with that framework the Google Print

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:57.520
So I don't know. We're really which for you to open Sousa

01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:06.040
13.1. Okay, but it's like running 1.5 and they haven't updated it even in 13.2. Yeah, okay, huh?

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:12.200
I so my experience was sort of it was just it was so hassle-free that I thought to myself

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:18.600
I I'm pretty confident if you have the right conditions met and I think that's always a big if but I think if you have the

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:22.800
Right conditions met setting up printers is a lot easier under Linux

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.120
It isn't than it is under Windows

01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:27.240
Like if you guys I don't know when the last time you guys have set up a Windows printer

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:32.440
but like you still have to go through this arcane wizard and it it still asks if you want to search a disk and

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:37.000
Like all of this stuff that like you you would never expect a regular user to go through

01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:43.700
Every time even for eight HP printers, it's worse because you have to go and get a 600 megabyte

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.280
executable and install

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.720
boatloads of shit last time I bought a printer I

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:51.240
Plot I unpacked it all

01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:57.720
Took the little strip off the printhead and plugged it into my laptop and sat it down put some paper in and then I went

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:01.800
And sat at my desk and there was a little pop-up that said your printer is installed and ready to print

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:05.040
And on Linux and this was like four years ago

01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:11.120
And I went to Amazon to review it because that's where I bought it from and I reviewed it and left a shining

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:18.640
Review and every single other review was really terrible panning it not because of the printer but because of the Windows Drive. Yeah

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.880
Yeah, I'm

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:28.480
Because my my brother had like constantly kept asking me like you fixed this printer stuff

01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:32.440
And there's a ton of issues with his Windows thing and I shut up my laptop

01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:36.240
I plugged it in added it to my thing. It took like 20 seconds

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:41.160
I showed him his already connected. He's like, okay, give me that. Yeah, and now he's been using it for a couple months

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.400
Yeah, that's the thing about cups. This is just amazing. Yeah

01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:45.040
Yeah

01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:51.480
When I when I when I started using cups that to have all of your printers manageable through a web interface was groundbreaking from a tech

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:55.760
Support standpoint just totally groundbreaking not having to remote desktop into a Windows box

01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:01.280
And then and go into the print queue and by the way if the Windows box and this is still the same today if the Windows

01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.280
Box is struggling with a print job for some reason

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:08.680
Sometimes like the the spooler is just totally non-responsive like you can't go in there and delete documents

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.560
It is so out of the 80s

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.940
It's it's almost like you go into a time machine when you manage print jobs in Windows and like, you know

01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:20.800
I became proficient at net stop quote print spooler at close quote enter net start

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:23.880
You know to restart the spooler service because it constantly crashes under

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:26.400
Windows and I'm talking in high load right for home printing

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:28.200
it's probably not so bad but I just

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:34.200
When cups came along and I could I could actually manage a failing print job and I could view all of the printers in one

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:37.180
Window in one screen. Oh, it was so powerful

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.400
So and then you know here I am

01:26:39.400 --> 01:26:45.320
You know thinking this is gonna be way overkill for just a home printer setup because honestly my experience with cups is multi hundred

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.760
Printers, it's not one printer. So I'm thinking to myself

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.360
No, here I go. I gotta go. This is this is the problem with arch

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:56.160
I gotta go install cups and I'm gonna spend 15 minutes configuring it

01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.400
And then I got to figure out to get my printer to work and I'm just going through this whole list and then it

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:03.760
Ended up being like a 30-second process and I just that back good cups is amazing

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:09.160
It starts it works for one printer all the way up to hundreds of printers and it's got awesome things about it in the whole

01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:24.160
Range, it's a really powerful printing system
