1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,900
Wes, I think I found the creepiest run Linux

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:03,940
I've ever seen.

3
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,580
Oh, you mean this weird robot cat?

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,380
Yeah, Python, robot, and cat that runs Linux.

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,740
It's the Mars cat.

6
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,700
Just like a real cat, Mars cat is fully autonomous,

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:20,700
stretching, tapping, and even burying litter.

8
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,060
It may express different emotions

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,060
by different meows or gestures.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,460
Mars cat can play with you or your toys.

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,220
Or your children.

12
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,060
Here.

13
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,900
Mars, go sleep.

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,740
And see.

15
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,500
It can interact with objects or people nearby.

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,940
Even play with real cats.

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,220
It sounds so great, but if you watch the video,

18
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,420
which we'll have linked in the show notes,

19
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,500
the thing doesn't move like a cat.

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,500
No, cats are graceful animals,

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,100
and this is an awkward robot.

22
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,940
It's very awkward, it's very stiff,

23
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,900
it's very scary looking,

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,460
and they want you to treat it like a real cat.

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,980
It heals with purr sounds.

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,900
Every Mars cat is unique.

27
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,260
From its eyes, body, to personality,

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,320
you can pet it and shape its characters in your own way.

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,880
Dress it up, make it more adorable.

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,500
Mars cat is open sourced and programmable.

31
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,460
With powerful quad core Raspberry Pi,

32
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,380
you can create your own applications.

33
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,020
Mars cat is also an ideal choice for education,

34
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,260
research, and commercial purpose.

35
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,720
Or other things.

36
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,700
This thing is, like they said,

37
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,100
powered by Raspberry Pi, uses Python,

38
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,940
it has a series of APIs available to control the camera,

39
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,760
the microphone, it has touch sensors,

40
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,940
16 servos, which it needs about 30 more,

41
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,980
and it's a platform for a bionic cat

42
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,220
for the first home robot.

43
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,780
The weird thing is, and this is in the video,

44
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,140
when they take this thing apart to see the insides,

45
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,900
it's as creepy as if they were taking apart a real cat.

46
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,620
Yeah, I mean, I like a lot of these ideas,

47
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,700
I love that it's open sourced,

48
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,620
but you have to be able to actually be around the thing.

49
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,780
And I also wonder, it is powered by USB-C,

50
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,380
but where do you plug it in?

51
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,380
Hello friends, and welcome in to the Unplugged program.

52
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,500
My name is Chris.

53
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,340
My name is Wes.

54
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,620
Hello Wes, you've got that very special edition look going,

55
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,100
you've dressed up all nice.

56
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,940
Oh yes, to the nines.

57
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,580
I don't know why you have to dress up like that,

58
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,580
but I appreciate it,

59
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,100
and it makes me feel like it's a very special episode.

60
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:34,960
It's all for you.

61
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,260
Today, we're going to bridge the gap

62
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,180
between shareware and free software.

63
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,240
Those of us who have been around for a piece

64
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,780
remember a time when you bought software in bags on walls,

65
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,820
and it was the full version of the program,

66
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,020
but it often came with certain limitations.

67
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,300
How did we get from that to open source

68
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,440
and free software really in the world?

69
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,200
We're gonna talk about that today,

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,620
as well as some news, some discussions,

71
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,380
and of course, we've got Alex and Jeezy here.

72
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,300
Hello gentlemen.

73
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,700
Hello. Hello, hello.

74
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,140
And as always, we have our virtual lug,

75
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,380
a fantastic showing, hello Mumble Room,

76
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,340
time appropriate greetings.

77
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,340
Hello, hello.

78
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,260
Happy Linux Tuesday. Hello, hello.

79
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,100
Hola.

80
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,260
Happy, happy Linux Tuesday.

81
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,660
Thank you all for making it here.

82
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,000
We have a lot,

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,460
I think we're gonna have a really fun discussion,

84
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,000
a lot to get into today.

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,300
So let's start with some good news, not robot cat news,

86
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,020
but good news for Kubuntu users

87
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,720
who might be interested in a laptop

88
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,820
that comes pre-bundled

89
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,680
with what they're calling Kubuntu Focus.

90
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,300
Michael Liarbull over at Feronix

91
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,780
had a chance to give it a look,

92
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:43,740
and he says, I've been testing out for several weeks.

93
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,820
So he got it like under a embargo.

94
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,740
Oh, look at him go.

95
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,780
An old NDA skis, as they say in the biz.

96
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,660
This is the first generation of the Kubuntu Focus laptop.

97
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,940
You ready for the hardware specs, Wes?

98
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:55,300
Oh please. You got any guesses?

99
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,700
Well, I'm guessing I'll probably be a little disappointed.

100
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,920
I thought it was,

101
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,300
I mean, when I first heard the initial rumors,

102
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,220
I thought it was gonna be an ARM box, right?

103
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,380
Yeah, something small and minimal.

104
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,020
This sucker has a Intel Core i7-9750 processor,

105
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,700
an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060.

106
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,540
Wait, what?

107
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,800
It's got a 16.1 inch, 1080p screen

108
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,580
that runs at 144 Hertz.

109
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,180
It's IPS too.

110
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,180
It's got a terabyte Samsung Evo drive in it.

111
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,520
And then all of the other kind of niceties

112
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,780
that a Clevo laptop of this size has,

113
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,340
which have been getting pretty competitive.

114
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,760
Do I also see it's got 32 gigs of RAM?

115
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,600
That's right.

116
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,300
Wow, okay, I'm interested.

117
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,100
Yeah, I mean, as far as a laptop of this nature,

118
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,500
a high-end laptop, if you're a plasma user,

119
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,940
Liarbull seems to be pretty impressed.

120
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,020
He says the software side's looking choice.

121
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,220
Yeah, that's right, Kubuntu 18.04.3 is shipped on the device

122
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,100
with some alterations around the default desktop environment

123
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,540
and themes, so you get a little bit of customization there,

124
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,740
including the dark theme by default.

125
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:56,900
Chris, you'll like that.

126
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,140
Well, now I'm sold.

127
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,740
You know, you have that NVIDIA GPU too,

128
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,340
so Google Chrome is included and already tweaked

129
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,660
with all of the GPU options for maximum acceleration.

130
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,580
Also of note, it ships with disk encryption

131
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,340
turned on by default.

132
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,580
So if you're listening to this and you're wondering,

133
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,220
what's Kubuntu focus?

134
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,820
We'll have a link to it in the show notes.

135
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,680
You can also just go to kfocus.org.

136
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,140
It's the result of the collaboration

137
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,140
between the Kubuntu Cancel and Tuxedo

138
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,860
working to create something that they felt

139
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,140
was pretty well focused on the user.

140
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,100
We maintain the platform so our customers

141
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,060
can focus on work and play.

142
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,620
Yeah, I mean, you could really see it.

143
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,940
There's not a very wide selection of pre-built hardware

144
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,020
shipping with plasma.

145
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,980
I mean, I'm really struggling to think of anything that,

146
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,260
I mean, almost all of them that you could buy that's

147
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,860
System76 or Dell or somebody else

148
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,340
would be generally GnomeShell.

149
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,300
Right, right.

150
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,980
Not all of them, I guess, not 100%, but a lot of them.

151
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,140
Some of them, you know, you got like the Mint hardware

152
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,940
stuff like that that's probably Cinnamon.

153
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,100
And there's a couple others, but.

154
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,740
But yeah, you're right.

155
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,500
Plasma's been somewhat underrepresented,

156
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,820
and it's nice to see what seems like a great offering now.

157
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,580
OK, can I admit what feels like an insecurity to you guys?

158
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:10,540
And I think it might be.

159
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,740
You know, that's what we have this virtual users group for,

160
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:12,980
Chris.

161
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,860
You can be honest, share your feelings.

162
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,420
All right.

163
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,460
Hi, my name is Chris, and I'm afraid

164
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,660
that the Windows Terminal is getting extremely competitive.

165
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,340
And the worst thing about it is Microsoft

166
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,620
is incorporating legit nice features that

167
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,380
have been contributed by outside community members

168
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,860
into their core product.

169
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,420
It's like they freaking get it, too.

170
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,380
And that's really the most frustrating.

171
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,380
They're using open source to compete against it.

172
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,060
Oh, they got it.

173
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,100
They figured it out.

174
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,260
Maybe that's why they love it so much.

175
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,420
That was our secret.

176
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,820
I am talking about, of course, they have now

177
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,940
added those cool CRT retro effects

178
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,100
that you get from like cool retro term

179
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,740
into the Windows Terminal itself, which was a contributing.

180
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,620
The community member was called, I love his handle, Irony Man.

181
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,660
Not Iron Man, but Irony Man contributed the CRT retro

182
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,740
effects to this.

183
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:06,020
And now it's shipping as an experimental feature.

184
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,660
There's other really kind of cool things in here, too.

185
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,820
Some things you might like.

186
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,300
Yeah, they've got some nice updates to usability,

187
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,180
things like you can now modify your profiles.json

188
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:16,540
to have your own default profile settings.

189
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,180
And once you set that property, you

190
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,140
can have it applied to like all your profiles.

191
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,660
Yeah, so if you always want a certain font or a certain size,

192
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,700
you can set some defaults across all profiles.

193
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,220
That sounds really nice, and it sounds

194
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,580
like the direct kind of feature you

195
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,220
add when you've been listening to the users of that terminal.

196
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,980
Yeah, stuff, too, like some improvements

197
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,340
to how tab sizing works.

198
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,180
It's getting pretty slick.

199
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:42,300
The reason why I wanted to pull this story in because there's

200
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,540
an interesting connection here from a company that was really

201
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,660
ignoring its terminal for many, many releases.

202
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,540
We spent years ragging on old command.exe.

203
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Yeah, and then they really focused in on it,

204
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,100
and it really has exploded.

205
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,460
I think your insecurities are somewhat right, though, too.

206
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,820
I mean, it helps them that they've got this open source.

207
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,220
But even already on the Mac desktop,

208
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,460
they've got competitors, too.

209
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,940
I think we need to step up our game.

210
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:10,900
Yeah, so that, as you read in my mind, is what I was thinking.

211
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,380
Imagine if one of the distros really got it in its head,

212
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,780
like, you know what I'm going to do

213
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,260
is I'm really going to invest in the terminal.

214
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,340
I'm going to make the terminal really great.

215
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,820
I know most people are listening and probably thinking

216
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,200
to themselves, oh, the terminal's fine.

217
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,700
There's nothing really wrong with it.

218
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,260
But I don't know, man.

219
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,580
I think with the WSL2 stuff and terminal and all of that,

220
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,660
I think it's very likely that more and more power users are

221
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,740
getting at least a little bit what they want.

222
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,980
At least they can stay on the Windows platform.

223
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,500
And I guess good enough for them.

224
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,380
Maybe I shouldn't be, maybe it's fine.

225
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,300
Maybe it's fine.

226
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,580
It is hard to say, and I don't like thinking,

227
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,780
that a beautiful, well-functioning open source

228
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,500
terminal somehow makes the world worse.

229
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,540
You know one thing that really I always

230
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,000
struggle with on a Windows terminal,

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,420
whether it's PuTTY or whether it's the built-in one,

232
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,780
is copy and paste.

233
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,020
It's just really difficult for some reason.

234
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,700
Yeah.

235
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,220
You know, my favorite, favorite thing

236
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,460
about using the terminal on Linux

237
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,740
is that X clipboard when you just highlight something

238
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,340
and then you just middle click to paste it.

239
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,060
Yeah.

240
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,340
Soon as I'm on any other terminal system

241
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,760
and I go to highlight, and I'm like, oh, yeah, right.

242
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,340
It just changes.

243
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,300
Like you think you already have it.

244
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,260
You've copied it.

245
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,140
So quick, so fast, so fast.

246
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,260
Now, Wes, I want to go to our reporter on the ground

247
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,340
in Enlightenment Island.

248
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,820
Minimek, do you have an E17 perspective

249
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,260
on this particular situation?

250
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,760
Over.

251
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,460
And tell us what you're learning now.

252
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,940
Oh, ha.

253
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,180
So Enlightenment, we started with terminology,

254
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,700
which is a future terminal, which is really cool

255
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,380
because you can watch a video while doing

256
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,380
some commands on your command line and everything

257
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:46,340
and all that in your terminal.

258
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,460
So it's quite an interesting terminal.

259
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,140
And it is available in the Ubuntu, I think.

260
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,940
OK.

261
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:54,080
And of course, a cool retro term.

262
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,260
I like what Node Runner said in the chat room, though.

263
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,140
The future is the GUI.

264
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,060
But have you tried the terminal?

265
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,900
That's exactly it.

266
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,420
Nailed it.

267
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,220
That is so exactly it.

268
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,780
The future is a great GUI where I run a really nice terminal.

269
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,400
All right, so last week, we've talked

270
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,740
about some community transitions that were happening

271
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,720
around container Linux.

272
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,240
And there was also a recent story

273
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,220
about a pretty big upset within the Rust community

274
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,220
around the ActixX project.

275
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,540
I wanted to say ActiveX, but the ActixX project.

276
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,620
And that developer, who is actually a Microsoft employee,

277
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,020
experienced significant burnout and quit the project,

278
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,760
pulled the repos off.

279
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,760
Now, this is actually a pretty significant project

280
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,740
for the Rust community.

281
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,260
So it made headlines pretty quickly.

282
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,340
How would you describe its relevancy?

283
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,380
It's probably one of the few that,

284
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,540
or it's the largest that does what it does in the community.

285
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:52,740
Right.

286
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,080
So it's sort of a whole framework

287
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,500
for web services, interactive, HTTP sorts of servers.

288
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,780
It's kind of the biggest one.

289
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,820
At least one of the earlier and most well-known

290
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,420
in the community.

291
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,740
And the number of projects that had used it,

292
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,100
the sort of community that had developed around it,

293
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,420
led you to think it was, maybe there was a team behind it,

294
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,300
it was well-maintained or endorsed by the community.

295
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,500
Turns out, mostly just one hardworking maintainer.

296
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,300
Yeah, we covered this story.

297
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,460
The whole cycle happened during the week of Linux Headlines.

298
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,420
And I'm happy to say there is a resolution, which

299
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,020
is also covered in Linux Headlines at linuxheadlines.show.

300
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:32,700
But the really quick summary is, he got overwhelmed

301
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,900
and felt probably a little taken advantage of,

302
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,460
and was sick and tired of justifying well-thought-out

303
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,620
design decisions over and over again,

304
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,140
like the same stuff would get noticed and thrown at him.

305
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,980
And he just reached a point of, I'm done with open source,

306
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,540
and I'm pulling the repo.

307
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,180
And then people panicked because of the value of this project.

308
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,460
Well, and I think there was another side of that, too,

309
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,180
is that it started as a personal project,

310
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,340
and it grew.

311
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,940
And so you could say, you know, there were design decisions.

312
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,280
And I think a lot of the community

313
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,780
had some rising standards, or at least standards

314
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,500
that they wanted to implement.

315
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,380
And that takes a lot more work, or maybe just

316
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,100
a different style of management than a single maintainer

317
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,940
can provide.

318
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,940
Though, after some time, the developer had a think,

319
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,940
and came back and said, here's what I'm going to do,

320
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,860
is I'm going to hand the reins over to another community

321
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,980
member.

322
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,460
And said, oh, the repositories are back online.

323
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,160
And a transition is taking place, and it's all amicable.

324
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,500
And it's really nice to see that.

325
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,820
But it's a reminder of a constant problem.

326
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,500
And I really feel for these developers,

327
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,760
because they start something in some cases

328
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,220
that they don't plan to monetize,

329
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:42,100
or they don't plan to turn it into a business

330
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,060
or a foundation.

331
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,540
It's really scratching their own edge.

332
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,580
Scratching their own ends, trying to learn,

333
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,780
or just help the community.

334
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,140
And in this case, this individual just

335
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,620
nailed the timing, because interest in Rust was growing,

336
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,820
and there was interest in having these types of services.

337
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,980
And so it just took off like wildfire,

338
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,500
and he ended up running a fairly large project.

339
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,700
Pretty common story.

340
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,540
And it's something that we have a hard time

341
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,060
fully appreciating, because we don't do the work.

342
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:13,380
I have definitely, as I've gotten to be an old fat fart,

343
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:13,660
is-

344
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,700
Wisened, wisened.

345
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Oh, thank you.

346
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,860
I really didn't understand how much work went into all

347
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,900
these different career trajectories.

348
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,580
And when you think you know what a plumber's job is,

349
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,980
or an electrician's job, or a media person's job,

350
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,900
or a software developer's job, you just

351
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,260
can kind of only really appreciate what

352
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,680
you were able to observe from afar.

353
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:34,900
Right.

354
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,980
You get the surface level, and none of the hard work

355
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,060
that goes on underneath.

356
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,620
And there was a blog post by Drew DeVault that it

357
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,260
was like, I wrote this.

358
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,700
Only it could be all about content creation,

359
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,000
and he's talking about software.

360
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,140
And so I think this is a universal human problem.

361
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,740
And he posted this last week as this episode goes out.

362
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,700
And I think this is so worth a read.

363
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,620
So I want to encourage you to go to Drew's entire blog

364
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,980
to read the entire thing.

365
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,020
But he just recently crossed a major milestone.

366
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,860
February will mark one year that I've

367
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,540
been working on self-directed free software projects

368
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,740
full time.

369
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,540
I was planning on writing an optimistic retrospective

370
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,740
article around this time, but given

371
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,420
the current mood of the ecosystem,

372
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,220
I think it would be better to be realistic.

373
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,580
In this stage of my career, I now

374
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,460
feel at once happier, busier, more fulfilled, more engaged,

375
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,260
more stressed, and more depressed

376
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,100
than I have at any other point in my life.

377
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,660
Yeah.

378
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,180
Isn't that a weird mix?

379
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,420
And it's point can I really?

380
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,100
It's the hobby turned profession.

381
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,700
There's a lot of emotions there.

382
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,340
I mean, he speaks to that more.

383
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,060
I also have mixed feelings about how busy I am.

384
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,580
Every day I wake up to 100 new emails, delete half of them,

385
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,740
and spend three to four hours working on the rest.

386
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,060
Patches, questions, support inquiries, monitoring,

387
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,980
and reports.

388
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,500
It's endless.

389
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,220
On top of that, I have dozens of things

390
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,380
I already need to work on.

391
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,900
The CI work distribution algorithm

392
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,620
needs to be completely redone.

393
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,300
I need to provision new hardware.

394
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,940
Oh, yeah, and the hardware that I need

395
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,260
ran into shipping issues again.

396
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,460
I need to improve monitoring.

397
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,140
I need to plan for FOSDEM.

398
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,860
I need to finish the Wayland book.

399
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,380
I need to figure out the memory issues in Himitsu,

400
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,620
not to mention write the rest of the software.

401
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,060
I need to file taxes, which is twice as much work

402
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,380
when you own a business.

403
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,460
I need to implement data export and account deletion.

404
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,100
I need to finish the web-driven patch review UI.

405
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,780
I need to finish writing docs for Alpine.

406
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,860
I have to work more on the Pine phone.

407
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,020
I have a legacy server which needs to be overhauled

408
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,020
and is now on the clock because of Acme V1.

409
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,140
That's a lot of stuff.

410
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,940
Yeah, and that's not even all of it.

411
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,220
He's like, that's what's off the top of my head.

412
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,580
He says, not to mention the tasks which

413
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,860
have been on hold for longer than they've been planned

414
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,460
for in the first place.

415
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,620
Alpine is still going to have hundreds of Python 2 packages

416
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,580
by the end of life.

417
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,140
RISC-V work has been stalled because the work is currently

418
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,700
blocked by a large problem that I simply can't automate.

419
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,260
There's another project he's committed

420
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,500
to called Fospay, which is having issues pulling data

421
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,580
figures from Patreon.

422
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,980
And he has to restart a process manually every so often

423
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,780
to get it to work.

424
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,380
And there's dozens of other loose ends.

425
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:14,660
And he says, that's not even considering any personal goals.

426
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,940
And I think anybody that's kind of been in this situation

427
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,660
has been here, it's like you just get so focused on work.

428
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,940
He says, which I have vanishing little time for.

429
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,660
I get zero exercise.

430
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,380
And though my diet is mostly reasonable,

431
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:31,820
the majority of it is delivery, unless I get the odd two hours

432
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,020
to visit the grocery store.

433
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,780
That is, unless I want to spend those two hours with my friends,

434
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,620
or in my case, family and wife, which

435
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,060
means it's back to delivery.

436
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,700
My dating life is almost non-existent.

437
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,860
I want to spend more time studying Japanese,

438
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,540
but it's either that or keeping up with my leisure reading.

439
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,580
Lofty goals of also studying Chinese or Arabic

440
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,500
are but dust in the wind.

441
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,740
And to make matters worse, I'm addicted to caffeine again.

442
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,860
There have been healthy ways and unhealthy ways

443
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,280
of dealing with the occasional feelings of being overwhelmed

444
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,660
by all of this.

445
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:07,060
The healthier ways have included taking walks, reading my books,

446
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,940
and spending a few minutes with my cat, doing chores,

447
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,780
and calling my family to catch up.

448
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,380
Less healthy ways have included walking to the corner store

449
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,100
to buy unhealthy comfort foods.

450
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,900
Oh, yeah.

451
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,420
Consuming alcohol or marijuana too much or too often,

452
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,740
getting in stupid internet arguments,

453
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,460
being mean to my friends and colleagues,

454
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:28,060
and googling myself to read negative comments.

455
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:28,620
Yeah.

456
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,860
He says, I've been trying to do that my entire life,

457
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,060
trying to get all of this balanced.

458
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,380
Writing code for someone else has always been a huge drain

459
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,020
on my emotional well-being.

460
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,660
That's why I worked on my side projects in the first place,

461
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,460
to have an outlet through which I could work

462
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,300
on self-directed projects without making compromise

463
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,180
for some arbitrary deadline.

464
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,380
I recently had that realization that I

465
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,620
should do a personal side podcast just

466
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:59,100
so I have a pure creative outlet so I can stick to what

467
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,740
works here, like the topics.

468
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,460
And if I want to talk about RVs or whatever it might be,

469
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,060
I need to have an outlet for that.

470
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,740
But I don't need to put it into a Linux show.

471
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,740
Or shoehorn it in.

472
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:11,780
So and the idea of taking as long

473
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,540
as I want to make content, because I've been doing

474
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,700
weekly content for so long.

475
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,900
I could really kind of connect with this.

476
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,100
He says, when I'm in the zone writing lots of code

477
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,820
for a project I'm interested in, knowing

478
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,020
it's going to have a meaningful impact on my users,

479
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,340
knowing that it's being written under my terms

480
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,820
is the most rewarding work I've ever done.

481
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,380
This isn't a retrospective I wanted to write,

482
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,820
but it's nice to drop the veneer for a few minutes

483
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,180
and share an honest take on what it's like.

484
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:40,500
This year has been nothing like what I expected it to be.

485
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,140
It's both terrible and wonderful and very busy.

486
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,060
I have a bit of advice for Drew via podcast here.

487
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,180
Just for a moment, the rest of you can skip ahead.

488
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:53,060
But my advice directly to Drew is, and to be clear,

489
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,140
this isn't our Drew.

490
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,820
This is software developer Drew.

491
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,700
Our Drew, Drew DeVore, is not.

492
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,900
This is Drew DeVault, which now realizing sounds

493
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,620
a lot like Drew.

494
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,260
Drew's also very busy, so I'm sure he sympathizes with this.

495
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,420
Yeah, this is not our Drew.

496
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,860
This is software developer Drew, full-time software developer

497
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,260
Drew.

498
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,220
Sway maintainer, and many other cool projects.

499
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,380
Yes, we've talked about him before on the show,

500
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,940
so I kind of went in with a little bit of assumption.

501
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,660
But my advice to him, and really anybody

502
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,740
who finds themselves in these positions actually,

503
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,700
is try not to get in the, oh my god, I'm so busy mentality.

504
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,620
Because it's a way of thinking, and it's

505
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,660
a way to immediately say, no, I can't do that, I'm too busy.

506
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,580
I can't do that, I'm too busy.

507
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,740
Nah, what's the point of running out for 15 minutes?

508
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,220
I'm too busy.

509
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:38,620
And it's a cycle you can get in that amplifies your feelings

510
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,780
about not being appreciated for the software you're creating,

511
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,980
or people not understanding your rationale.

512
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,500
Those all get amplified by this, I'm too busy

513
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,380
to deal with this crap mentality.

514
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:52,300
And you've got to break it, and you've got to just say,

515
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,880
right now is quite busy, but there will be time.

516
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,760
And you have to just shift your mentality,

517
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,220
and try to say yes to a few things.

518
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,660
I know that sounds hard when you're really busy,

519
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,060
but it is a tricky mindset you can get locked into,

520
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,140
and it's very counterproductive.

521
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,700
So and I think it leads to burnout.

522
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,300
That's always hard to prioritize long term over short term,

523
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,820
but you have to make time.

524
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,820
Yeah, I mean, it's like I'm some expert at it.

525
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,780
I was feeling quite overwhelmed when I lived in England

526
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,540
and working in London.

527
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,340
Living in a big city like that, I actually

528
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,180
found it quite oppressive.

529
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,740
And I was going to an office every day,

530
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,780
so I had an excuse to get out the house.

531
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,780
And so one of the big things, obviously,

532
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,360
as some of these listeners will know,

533
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,020
is that I obviously emigrated last year to the US.

534
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:42,660
And one of the primary drivers for that was quality of life.

535
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,780
And it was me being honest with myself, and sort of saying,

536
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,820
and looking at my life as it was,

537
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,140
and saying, am I happy with how this is going?

538
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,340
And would I be willing to try and change some things

539
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,340
to try and improve it?

540
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,340
And then I got this job with Red Hat,

541
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,100
where I'm working from home the whole time.

542
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,340
As in, if I want to never leave the house,

543
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,540
I could literally never leave my front door ever again.

544
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,460
So I've kind of swapped one set of problems

545
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,020
for another set of problems, which is kind of great,

546
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,860
because I don't miss a commute, I'll be perfectly honest.

547
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:20,220
I miss the kind of disconnection between the office and home,

548
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:23,180
that 20, 30 minutes, or sometimes two hours.

549
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,960
Clear separation of where you're doing work.

550
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,900
Yeah, I don't miss a commute.

551
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,980
Genuinely, I don't.

552
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,740
But there are some days where you think,

553
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,740
it would be nice to take 20 or 30 minutes.

554
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,580
And a great example of this is, before we recorded

555
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,340
the last self-hosted episode, I went and said to Chris,

556
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,260
look, I just need to take a 20, 30 minute walk

557
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,340
to clear my head and just get some air,

558
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,500
because I actually hadn't left the house that day.

559
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,820
And it was like, what, 4.30 PM at that point?

560
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:50,420
So there's a bunch of stuff you've got to be cognizant of.

561
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,540
I did that recently, and I should do it more often,

562
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,900
because I have found I have a huge resistance to doing it.

563
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,340
But if I go and then come back, not only

564
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,380
do I feel good for actually having gotten it done,

565
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,340
and that gives me a bit of a boost,

566
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,180
but I tend to have a bit of a temperament or mind

567
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,500
shift on a topic.

568
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,060
And when I got back, I really cranked out a lot of work,

569
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,260
which felt really awesome, too.

570
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,760
So then it was like a double whammy.

571
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,060
And so it felt like it was worth the time,

572
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,660
and it was nice to get a break in the rain.

573
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,580
Brent, you said you were just struggling with this stuff

574
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,660
earlier this morning.

575
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,860
Yeah, I mean, I've been working as a solo photographer now,

576
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:31,060
I guess, solo photographer slash podcaster for basically ever.

577
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,380
And Alex, you sort of expressed this as well,

578
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:37,140
but being in your own little office in your house,

579
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,820
or a lot of people feel this at work, too,

580
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,640
you feel kind of isolated somehow.

581
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,260
And so I find myself just really empathizing with everything

582
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,020
you read there, because most of those thoughts

583
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,660
that he expressed, I was thinking just this morning,

584
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:56,260
like, oh, jeez, I can't do the 20 minutes of yoga

585
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,740
that my body is craving that I know helps me

586
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,460
throughout the day, because I feel

587
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,820
like I have too many things that I need to get done,

588
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,740
and those 20 minutes feel really precious.

589
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,660
But I think sometimes I remind myself

590
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,340
that, like you were saying, Chris, it's a bit of a trap,

591
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,780
because by taking those 20 minutes to go for a walk

592
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:19,500
or to eat a healthy meal or something like that,

593
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,780
your future minutes are actually spent far better.

594
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,140
And when you're just overloaded with work,

595
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,380
I think it's easy to forget that kind of stuff.

596
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,180
Think about it like painting a wall print.

597
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,860
Like, the prep's the worst part, but once you actually

598
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,940
get there and you do it properly,

599
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,380
take the extra time to prepare for the day properly.

600
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,540
It's a really good point, and I think something we need

601
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,940
to remember every single day.

602
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,580
But I even hit with the topic of social life,

603
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:52,940
because it feels like often we feel as though we have

604
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,060
some quasi-social interaction through our computers

605
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,660
via the internet and stuff like that.

606
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,740
But it's just not the same, and it doesn't give us the same.

607
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,660
Slow bandwidth.

608
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,220
Yeah, there's not the same human connection

609
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,980
that is life-giving.

610
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,540
Our factual evolved brain's like, oh, this is good.

611
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,620
I'm chatting with people.

612
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,380
I'm very social.

613
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,420
But there's this lower level part of you.

614
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,020
I think we also need to remember, too,

615
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,100
to accept that when working in open source,

616
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,300
there are others in day-to-day life that let other people make

617
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,100
time for their own health and well-being

618
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,980
if you're going to keep interacting with them.

619
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,660
I think there's room for developers

620
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:28,500
to have a better set of expectations for their users

621
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,780
to be able to set expectations.

622
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:32,980
And I think there's room for users, a lot of room,

623
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,180
for users to adjust their expectations of open source

624
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:36,740
projects.

625
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,020
And a lot of people blame GitHub and the GitHub model for this,

626
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,660
but I actually think you could use that same argument,

627
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:45,260
say people could be spending the time to look into who's

628
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,460
contributing to this project.

629
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,460
Do the freaking math and realize it's one developer

630
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,780
and set their expectations accordingly.

631
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,740
Once you start using it, say like, this is important to me.

632
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,240
How do I make sure that this project

633
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,380
is healthy and maintainable?

634
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:54,980
Yeah.

635
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,020
Yeah, really.

636
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,980
The other thing I feel is important is collaboration.

637
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,780
It feels like when two people are working on a project,

638
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,460
it's far better than two isolated people working

639
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,340
on a project.

640
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,660
The throughput is more than twice the times, right?

641
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,660
And someone can cover the other person

642
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,260
while they're taking some downtime and that kind of thing.

643
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,380
And really, healthy collaboration

644
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,180
is often not given the right kind of praise.

645
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,420
Well, remind me, let's pick this back up in the post-show

646
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,540
because I think we all probably have more thoughts on this.

647
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,020
And this is probably, we could expand this conversation a bit.

648
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,980
But I think we should get back on the main track

649
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,860
here because we have a lot to get to.

650
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,860
But I think this is a very important conversation

651
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,620
and then we can pick it back up here in a little bit.

652
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,260
And it's one that keeps cropping up every few months.

653
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,980
Yeah, I don't think this will be the last episode we talk about.

654
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,980
We could go through and make so many examples.

655
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,460
But it's good to see in the case of Rust

656
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,580
that a resolution is there.

657
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,700
Things are moving forward.

658
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,780
People are talking.

659
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,420
I think was some learning happened.

660
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,420
So in this case, and I think I really

661
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:05,180
want to commend Drew Duvall for posting that very honest.

662
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:07,420
I mean, he took the time out of all those other tasks

663
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,140
to write this retrospective blog post

664
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,620
and share some of his private personal feelings on this.

665
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,820
Yeah, that takes a lot.

666
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,100
And I think that's the exact kind of thing that

667
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,540
can help us have a better connection with these developers,

668
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:21,260
help us empathize a little bit more with their position.

669
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,700
So I think that actually him being vulnerable like that,

670
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,500
I think really kind of, see, look at that.

671
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,820
It's an episode of vulnerability.

672
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,140
Vulnerability helps everybody.

673
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,700
Every now and then a little vulnerability is good.

674
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,620
Oh, is it that time?

675
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,620
That's right.

676
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,060
It's time for housekeeping.

677
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,220
Few things to mention today.

678
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,460
I want to plug the outrageously awesome Telegram group

679
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,780
that we have raging now at jupiterbroadcasting.com

680
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:46,700
slash Telegram, having a really fun conversation in there

681
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,980
this morning about Project Off Grid,

682
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:52,420
which is something I'm working on, and a few other things.

683
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,060
Sometimes we make a few jokes.

684
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,260
People like to give me a hard time every now and then.

685
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:56,760
You never.

686
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,860
Pokey pops in there, teases me, that kind of stuff.

687
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,220
So that's at jupiterbroadcasting.com

688
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,260
slash Telegram.

689
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,620
A lot of the crew hangs in there.

690
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,300
So we're hanging.

691
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,460
Yeah, come chat with us.

692
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,000
It's like the JB water cooler, only instead of a water cooler,

693
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,340
it's a town water tower, because it's really

694
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,500
kind of the population of like a small town, like a small.

695
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,460
All crammed in there.

696
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:16,740
Yeah.

697
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,940
And they've got a lot to say.

698
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,860
And then we just got.

699
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,620
Yeah.

700
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,940
Sprinkle a little Linux on top.

701
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:22,440
Yeah.

702
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,740
Few bots to keep the order.

703
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,580
And it's all good.

704
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,660
So that's at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

705
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,540
Do we have anything else for the housekeeping?

706
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,860
Go check out Self Hosted, selfhosted.show,

707
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,140
where I give a major Project Off Grid update probably

708
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,260
in the next episode by the time this is coming out.

709
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,140
I don't know.

710
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,180
Time math is hard, because we're recording ahead.

711
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,900
So I don't know how it works.

712
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,420
Time is just a construct, man.

713
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,700
Yeah.

714
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,820
Not going to get held down by it.

715
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,060
New media.

716
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,700
Right?

717
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:56,420
All right, so how did we get to free software from shareware?

718
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,860
Those of us that remember the term shareware,

719
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:03,440
remember an era of software that you would download and maybe

720
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,020
use it for a certain amount of time,

721
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,580
and then you get a pop-up, or maybe you could do certain kinds

722
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:08,100
of functions.

723
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,980
There's a lot of different types of shareware.

724
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,540
Eggware, crippleware, trialware, donationware, negware.

725
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,700
You know what's funny is this is a topic that is literally

726
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,220
about as old as I am.

727
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,860
And it goes back to an early era of the industry

728
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,660
that was still figuring out how to even distribute software

729
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,940
pre-internet, pre-CD-ROM, so you didn't have a lot of capacity.

730
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:35,420
Everything was on floppies.

731
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,340
And then BBSs came along, and then stores

732
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,740
started to come along.

733
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,460
So we thought it'd be great to go back in time.

734
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:53,140
I think it was somewhere back in 1988-ish.

735
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,820
That's right.

736
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,940
We go to the authorities, the Computer Chronicles,

737
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,300
in which they have an episode dedicated to shareware,

738
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,380
and their struggle to figure exactly what it was.

739
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:04,980
Oh, it's great.

740
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,300
Why are you giving this away?

741
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,300
How does it work?

742
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,140
How is this even possible?

743
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,740
Do those people take advantage?

744
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,100
Is there a trade of money?

745
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,420
Today, we're going to take a look

746
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,380
at some of the best examples of shareware,

747
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,820
both for the IBM PC and the Macintosh,

748
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,220
and we'll meet the man who helped create the concept, Jim

749
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:20,900
Button.

750
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,060
Jim Button gets a lot of credit for coining the term shareware,

751
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:24,860
doesn't he?

752
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:26,980
Yeah, and it's a little bit complicated,

753
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,060
because he was an IBM employee back in the 80s,

754
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,940
and he wrote a program to help his local church congregation.

755
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,300
And as we were just talking about,

756
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,940
demand for his program consumed too much of his time,

757
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,300
so he left IBM and created his company, Buttonware,

758
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,380
released his first program, PC File,

759
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,900
which was like a flat file database.

760
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,980
I don't know, old technology, right?

761
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,020
In 1982, he called that user-supported software.

762
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,820
And it really was one of the first examples.

763
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,940
There were a couple other terms thrown around, freeware,

764
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,940
but that was copyright.

765
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:57,860
So eventually, it landed on shareware.

766
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,540
Johnny Ginson, the city of now, the man

767
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,540
they sometimes call the father of shareware,

768
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,500
Jim Button, CEO of Buttonware.

769
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,340
And next to Jim is Russell DeMaria, author of the book

770
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,660
Public Domain Software.

771
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,380
Gary?

772
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,060
Jim, what's the background behind shareware?

773
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,220
Where'd it come from?

774
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,020
Shareware started really in 1982.

775
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,940
And I think Andrew Flugelman probably

776
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:19,200
was first with the idea out of San Francisco,

777
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,300
and he produced a product called PC Talk.

778
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,700
It was the first shareware product on the market.

779
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:27,140
There was no free software.

780
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,420
There was no open source.

781
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,820
There was really not even an agreed-upon way

782
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,220
to distribute the software.

783
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,580
No, and most of the software you're

784
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,200
going to get at this time, well, it all

785
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,020
came from big commercial software houses

786
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,060
with expensive price tags because it was business users.

787
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:44,260
This was at the dawn of personal computing.

788
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,060
And the software originally with shareware was very generous.

789
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,580
Some of it was run for as long as you want.

790
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,020
There's a few examples of that still.

791
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:55,500
WinRAR comes from that era.

792
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,740
But people, just like some now, struggle

793
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,340
to understand free software.

794
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,300
Back then, struggled to understand

795
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,740
the concept of shareware.

796
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,940
And Button says, well, think of it really

797
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,180
as just a marketing term.

798
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,500
Shareware is a distribution method

799
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,460
and is primarily a way of distributing full function

800
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,420
demo disks.

801
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,140
Users are invited to share the full function

802
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,380
disks with all of their friends and to use them

803
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,940
in the comforts of their home.

804
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,700
Money changes hands when the user decides that he really

805
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:30,100
likes the program, wants to put it into productive use,

806
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,460
and develop a relationship with the author, which

807
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,740
would include technical support, printed manual,

808
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,660
and things like that.

809
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,620
And what are the typical prices for a package?

810
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,900
Shareware prices go all the way from $15 to $20

811
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,340
up to there's one product on the market that's $100.

812
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,940
Doesn't that sound familiar?

813
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,020
Hey, use it if you want.

814
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,540
If you like it, help out.

815
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,420
Yeah.

816
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:53,580
And you never really saw shareware as a concept really

817
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,620
take off on the Linux desktop crossover?

818
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,420
I guess you could technically say, does it?

819
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,380
They let you try it for 30 days or something like that?

820
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,940
And there's a few helpful but proprietary applications

821
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,780
or source not available that are floating out.

822
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,280
But they're definitely the exception.

823
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,020
Yeah.

824
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,220
When shareware was really getting going,

825
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,760
there was all these different schemes,

826
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,220
like we mentioned here at the top, all these different ways

827
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,700
of doing things.

828
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,140
And the more successful the app was,

829
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,620
the more riskier shareware model they could take.

830
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,100
But what about, you were telling us

831
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,100
about the decompression and the compression software,

832
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,700
about how depending on what you're going to do with it,

833
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,660
you have a different price?

834
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,940
Yeah, Stuffit in particular, Ray Lau, who wrote the program,

835
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,540
has a very nice scheme.

836
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,740
If you're just using it to decompress files

837
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,600
that you're getting from some online service or elsewhere,

838
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,420
it's free.

839
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,440
And there is no donation requested.

840
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,940
If you're using it to archive files to upload,

841
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:45,360
then he requests $18.

842
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,420
This doesn't actually even seem that far

843
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,820
from the free core model.

844
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,340
No, right?

845
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,580
It's a natural analog.

846
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,920
Hey, here's some basic features.

847
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,300
If you want more, well, we want you to help us maintain

848
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,460
and make this sustainable.

849
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:00,580
But yeah, I kind of became aware of the shareware industry

850
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:05,300
when it was sort of in the CD-ROM era, when it went big time.

851
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,580
The CD-ROM revolution meant that you

852
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,380
could pack and ship hundreds of shareware applications

853
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,020
on a single CD-ROM.

854
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,920
And the way it could be sold was the entire applications

855
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,420
on this disk, look at all these great applications, everything

856
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:23,260
you would ever need is on the CD-ROM.

857
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,500
And the companies that nailed that,

858
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,900
and you would have the really, really sweet shareware

859
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:33,660
companies, would have books that you would order, like magazines.

860
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,540
And you could go through that, and the magazine

861
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,980
might come with a CD-ROM.

862
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,180
And I'm not talking like a thin magazine.

863
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,700
I'm talking like a Sears catalog.

864
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,420
Put on some music, kick back.

865
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,700
Look at all the options.

866
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,420
Yeah, it was.

867
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,000
And of course, there was BBSs that were dedicated to this.

868
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,380
And of course, there was Warez sites

869
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,760
that were dedicated to trading a lot of the keys to unlock

870
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,820
or crack the shareware.

871
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,100
Right.

872
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,500
Just still kind of a thing in the Windows world.

873
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,300
And so when I came along, it was kind of during this part

874
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,740
where the internet hadn't really become a thing yet.

875
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,020
But that really changed the game, too, especially dial-up.

876
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:09,980
My dad and I used to have like a collection of shareware apps

877
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,860
that we loved that whenever we could,

878
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,320
we'd buy like the family edition,

879
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,620
and we'd share that because that became a thing for a while,

880
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,500
too, to get a family license for this.

881
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:22,380
But the thing that I witnessed was the biznification,

882
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:25,500
where a business could come in and make a sweet offer

883
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,500
to a developer and say, we want to buy

884
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,020
a year's worth of your software where you develop it,

885
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,780
but we rebrand it, different icon, different name,

886
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,140
and we bundle it with other shareware.

887
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,820
And then we'll even put it in a box,

888
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,500
and we'll put it on the shelf, and you'll

889
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,300
get a cut of the sales.

890
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,660
So the shareware developer would maintain a public shareware

891
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,620
edition of their software.

892
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,460
And then there would be like a sneaky rebranded version

893
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:57,380
that would be sold in a box, and these big shareware middlemen

894
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,180
would come in.

895
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,460
They were huge operations.

896
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,620
They would come in and organize all of it,

897
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:05,420
the deals with the shipping companies, the magazines,

898
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,580
the deal with CompUSA or whoever it

899
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,380
was that was going to put it on the shelf.

900
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,180
They would manage all of that.

901
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:14,420
And one of the bigger ones, you might remember

902
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:20,060
if you're from my era, was a company called PC SIG.

903
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,180
If you've ever bought shareware, chances are fairly good

904
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,940
that you got it from here.

905
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:28,620
This is PC SIG, the world's largest shareware distributor

906
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:32,660
with a library of over 25,000 programs and sales

907
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,380
of some 1,000 disks each day.

908
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,900
Well, shareware is the alternative to the high price

909
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,420
commercial spread.

910
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,500
The shareware programs that are now available

911
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,540
are equal, if not better, than a lot of the commercial programs

912
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,460
on the market, and hundreds of dollars

913
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,500
less when it comes to registration.

914
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,940
PC SIG is the conduit between shareware authors and users,

915
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,940
handling the marketing and advertising for the authors

916
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,740
and guaranteeing quality for the customers.

917
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,700
When we get a program in here that's submitted,

918
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,940
it goes through our librarian.

919
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,700
He looks it over.

920
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:09,140
If it meets what we consider to be good shareware standards,

921
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,860
he then sends it out to an independent reviewer.

922
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,900
Then it's reviewed again before it's placed in the catalog.

923
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:19,860
Everything sold here is also supported by full-time staffers.

924
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,300
Technical support.

925
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,700
PC SIG's success has allowed it to branch out

926
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,140
into some new areas.

927
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,220
It now publishes a bi-monthly magazine.

928
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:33,740
You can buy all 25,000 programs at once on this CD-ROM disk.

929
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:37,900
And you can buy some of the titles now in retail stores.

930
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,580
And the company has also branched out

931
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,980
into the business of selling hard-to-find videos.

932
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,140
In other words, shareware has been very good to PC SIG.

933
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,620
It's come a long way from the founder's garage

934
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,620
to a company now making several million dollars a year.

935
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,420
In Sunnyvale, California, for the Computer Chronicles,

936
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,820
I'm Wendy Woods.

937
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,420
Oh, the short reign that they had.

938
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,660
I love that sound at the end there.

939
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:06,060
That was floppy disk moving on an assembly line.

940
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,700
Yeah, right?

941
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,200
Yeah.

942
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,340
I mean, I tell you, the method of shipping software

943
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,860
has changed, and so it has really changed

944
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,380
the entire software industry.

945
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,540
And the growth of open source and Linux

946
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,380
kind of rocked all of this.

947
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,500
There was a period of time where commercial software

948
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,300
was the default. Closed source software was the default.

949
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,940
And even in the Unix era, it was keeping your own innovations.

950
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,660
That was really the default. It wasn't

951
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,180
until really a bit of a revolution

952
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,780
came along and changed everything.

953
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,580
We do have one sector that is taking off today.

954
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,900
It is the Linux-related sector.

955
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,780
And I thought this might be a good opportunity

956
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,540
to say, what is Linux?

957
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,260
And I'll answer this question for you.

958
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,640
Many of you probably already know,

959
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,300
but there are 12 million users out there, a computer operating

960
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,420
system developed by hundreds of programmers collaborating

961
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,300
on the internet, a challenge to Microsoft Windows NT,

962
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,420
very popular for its speed.

963
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,720
And so this is what the craze is about.

964
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,060
The internet combined with the free software movement

965
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:12,620
and Linux and then the explosion of the web in the late 90s

966
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,580
was all perfectly timed to fundamentally shift

967
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,580
value of software and the entire software industry.

968
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,100
And during this transition, shareware

969
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,140
as a normal concept of software distribution

970
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,780
sort of became an ancient idea that very few things.

971
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,280
Right.

972
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,900
It's interesting when you think, too, how you interact with it.

973
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,140
Shareware, the focus is on delivery of the application

974
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,200
as its runtime, a running executable,

975
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,980
because it's filling some business need.

976
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,980
But as computers came more and more into our lives,

977
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,140
the need to have that freedom and to be able to modify

978
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,020
and control things, that becomes a lot more important.

979
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,860
Yeah.

980
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,660
And the shift, again, to hosted services versus selling

981
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,140
directly to consumers, there's more value now

982
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,660
in building something that runs on a back end

983
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,180
than, in most cases, than building something

984
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,220
that consumers use directly in terms of software.

985
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:07,620
Not in all cases, but it's been a big shift.

986
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,620
And if it wasn't for it, imagine.

987
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,700
I mean, just the world's so much better off for it.

988
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,420
I encourage everyone to watch Revolution OS

989
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,740
if you haven't watched it or you haven't watched it recently.

990
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,380
Boy, is it a time capsule.

991
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,780
But it perfectly covers, and I wish

992
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,740
we could play a lot of clips from it,

993
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,140
but they'd slam us for copyright.

994
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,140
But it perfectly covers this transition period

995
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,780
we're talking about, this period of time.

996
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,340
It really captured it, captured the mentality.

997
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:39,940
And it really kind of reminds us of the wars

998
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,420
we were fighting back then with Solaris

999
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,500
and the different Unixs.

1000
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,900
And it's just really something.

1001
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,020
We've come a long way.

1002
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,740
I mean, we could have been in a world where Windows NT just

1003
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,940
consumed everything.

1004
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,540
It was kind of close for a while.

1005
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,100
Yeah, did you notice in that clip,

1006
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:58,140
they're talking about NT and hundreds of developers?

1007
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,740
It's so quaint.

1008
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,780
It really is something special.

1009
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,940
So shareware eventually faded away,

1010
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,100
and it's not completely gone.

1011
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,220
But I think the big default became the transition

1012
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,860
to open source software for not just server-side development,

1013
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,420
but really for anything that you wanted

1014
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,700
to get a large market adoption.

1015
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,140
It kind of just became the default.

1016
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,780
Right, and I think having easier modes of communication,

1017
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,300
that helps.

1018
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,420
Because before, let's say you had your source there.

1019
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,460
That might be nice, but probably 80% of the people

1020
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,860
you shipped your shareware to, they

1021
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,900
weren't going to have the tooling or knowledge

1022
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,820
to be able to modify that.

1023
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,580
But now anyone who's interested has easy ways

1024
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,700
to participate in a code base that's open.

1025
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,460
So much has shifted because of the way

1026
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,620
we can distribute software over the internet

1027
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,420
and then interact directly with the people that are distributing

1028
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,420
that software, and then build wikis and forums around that

1029
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,580
to help people get it set up.

1030
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,580
And it's just such a huge shift from when

1031
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,660
you were getting it in a disk in a bag in a little shop

1032
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,900
somewhere, or buying it from a developer

1033
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,460
and downloading it over your modem using

1034
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,220
GitRite, which was also shareware.

1035
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,500
Best downloader I had back in the day was GitRite.

1036
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,780
And classic shareware games like Doom,

1037
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,300
that was how Doom monetized.

1038
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,220
You could get the first few levels.

1039
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,140
It was like in-app purchases now.

1040
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,420
Oh my god, what's old is new.

1041
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,180
Holy crap.

1042
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:13,780
I don't know if you remember this.

1043
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,220
You can actually, we'll have a link in the show notes.

1044
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,260
There's a version on archive.org in DOSBox.

1045
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,860
It's the shareware version of Doom.

1046
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,260
And so the first bit of Doom, the first level,

1047
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,180
or 10 levels, I can't remember, was free.

1048
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,820
And then if you wanted to play all of the other levels,

1049
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:31,740
you had to pay for the shareware.

1050
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,660
It's kind of not unusual when you think of it

1051
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,140
in the terms of apps on mobile devices.

1052
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:36,940
No, not at all.

1053
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,580
That's how the new Mario run and Mario games work on the phone.

1054
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,340
It's like you get the first couple levels.

1055
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,340
And if you want to play all of them,

1056
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,660
you've got to pay the in-app purchase.

1057
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,980
I guess there's just some core models that work.

1058
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,220
And it comes back to talking about marketing.

1059
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,980
It's a way to get your stuff out there, to try before you buy,

1060
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,500
but then still have a way back to actually support

1061
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,900
continued development.

1062
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,500
Oh, Wes.

1063
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,180
I love running those old clips.

1064
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,860
It's very nostalgic.

1065
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,500
Computer Chronicles was great.

1066
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,780
But I think, do we have a link to that full video?

1067
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,300
We should.

1068
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:08,620
Yeah.

1069
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,380
We should put a full link in the show notes to that.

1070
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:11,860
All right.

1071
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,180
Well, why don't we get to our picks

1072
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,300
before we get out of here in this special edition?

1073
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,220
Yeah, because it turns out, you know what?

1074
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,140
We do live in the current day.

1075
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,700
We have access to tons of great open source software.

1076
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,100
And this is the part of the show where we tell you about it.

1077
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,460
Picks, guys.

1078
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,220
Pick over.

1079
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,780
Well, that's why it's picks and not pick.

1080
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,300
This is, oh, OK.

1081
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,860
All right.

1082
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,460
OK.

1083
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,900
Well, this first one's pretty great, especially for those

1084
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,500
of us who think the terminal's the future.

1085
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,940
Hashtag terminal future.

1086
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,300
That sounds bad.

1087
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,780
That doesn't sound good.

1088
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,900
That doesn't sound good.

1089
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,740
So this first one's called BROOT, B-R-O-O-T.

1090
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,740
I was going to try to make Wes say it, but he didn't speak up.

1091
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:46,100
So then I had to say it.

1092
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,500
And it gives you an overview of a directory, even a big one,

1093
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,620
in a really nice, concise, readable way.

1094
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:51,820
Right.

1095
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,740
Think of it as a combination of maybe something

1096
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,060
like if you used ncdo to manage and clean up files, which

1097
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,460
shows you an interactive, Curses-based application

1098
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,420
to drill down and get to sizes.

1099
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:02,740
I do.

1100
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,500
Do you ncdo?

1101
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,260
Oh, yeah, of course.

1102
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,820
And if you've maybe used the tree command,

1103
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,380
it prints you a little tree of the directory structure.

1104
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,020
BROOT's something of a combination of those,

1105
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,020
but it's a very interactive environment.

1106
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,300
So you can drill down.

1107
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,060
It stores past locations.

1108
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:19,580
It's like the tree file viewer manager for your terminal.

1109
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,580
You never knew you wanted.

1110
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,100
I'm sorry.

1111
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,420
I'm just distracted by your special edition outfit

1112
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,220
that you wore today.

1113
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:25,740
It's just.

1114
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,500
Isn't it nice?

1115
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,020
Yeah.

1116
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,620
I mean, it's nice, except for the sequences

1117
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,260
are a little bit much, because we have the lights on.

1118
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,940
So that's a bit much, but.

1119
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,660
Yeah, but I didn't.

1120
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,740
I mean, did you even know they made this color?

1121
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,380
No, I did not.

1122
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,940
I don't even know how you found that.

1123
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,780
All right, well, we have another pic here.

1124
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:45,100
This one is, again, hashtag terminal future.

1125
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,740
Oh, that's not good.

1126
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:49,900
And I don't know how we say this one.

1127
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,380
How come I'm always the dumb ass that has to read the names?

1128
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,940
I think it's Tizonia.

1129
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,380
I was going to say that, or Tizona.

1130
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,380
Tizona?

1131
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,740
Tizonia?

1132
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:00,700
Yeah.

1133
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,860
It's a cloud music streamer for your terminal.

1134
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,540
So if you got your spotifiers, or your Google Play

1135
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,700
musics, or your sound clouds, or your YouTubes,

1136
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,340
maybe you got a Plex, maybe you want

1137
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,700
to Chromecast this business.

1138
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,660
I do, I do.

1139
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,300
Well, who wants to do it in a GUI

1140
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,660
when you can do it in the terminal, right cheese?

1141
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,180
Boom.

1142
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,060
Cheesify it.

1143
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,020
Absolutely.

1144
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,060
That's what we're going to call when you put stuff

1145
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,460
in the terminal, we're just cheesifying it.

1146
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,420
Cheesifying it?

1147
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:22,940
I like it.

1148
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,020
I'll go with that term.

1149
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,620
When you can take something and do it in the terminal,

1150
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,340
that's putting a slice of cheese on it.

1151
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,020
That's what we're doing.

1152
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,940
Putting a slice of cheese on your music app.

1153
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:33,900
Oh, looks like they've got Docker, Snap packages,

1154
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,300
Ubuntu packages, even one for Raspbian.

1155
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,180
Well, it says right here on the website, too,

1156
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,300
that it's the most powerful cloud music player.

1157
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,780
So power's good, right?

1158
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,100
I mean, you're welcome, everybody.

1159
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,300
What else do you need to know?

1160
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,420
It's the most powerful.

1161
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,820
And apparently, it's the first implementation of OpenMAX

1162
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,980
Hill 1.2, which I don't know what that is.

1163
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,660
But it's the first implementation of it.

1164
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:57,740
So it's a standard for integration

1165
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,700
of multimedia components into media frameworks

1166
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,540
to simplify development of audio, video encoders,

1167
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,140
and decoders.

1168
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:02,820
Duh, cheese.

1169
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,540
Yeah, from the Khronos Group, everybody knows that.

1170
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,860
Everybody knows the mobile market

1171
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:10,180
is constantly evolving and demanding ever-increasing

1172
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:13,100
multimedia functionality and performance cheese.

1173
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,900
Duh, why am I even here?

1174
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,900
Slug out.

1175
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,700
Do your homework.

1176
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,700
Anyways, we'll put a link to Blot, right?

1177
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,700
Was that the first one?

1178
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,180
Brut.

1179
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,060
Oh, yeah, whatever.

1180
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,900
Brut.

1181
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,140
I'm going to make you use it now.

1182
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,700
You're just being so mean to the poor thing.

1183
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,500
Well, I've already got NCDU, and I got DF.

1184
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,660
I don't need this crap.

1185
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,300
But it's fine.

1186
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,100
It's fine.

1187
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,740
You want to put it in my show, it's fine.

1188
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,140
We've been streaming for too long.

1189
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:41,380
And then Tizona, which just sounds like a delicious calzone.

1190
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:41,900
Oh, wait.

1191
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,260
Brut's written in Rust, so there you go.

1192
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,260
You'll change your mind now.

1193
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:44,740
Oh, I love it.

1194
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:45,260
Oh, OK.

1195
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,140
Pfft.

1196
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:48,020
All right, why didn't you say so earlier?

1197
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,420
That's great.

1198
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,340
Have you guys heard of Brut?

1199
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,900
It's a really nice way to view the director's even,

1200
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:52,820
even big ones.

1201
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,620
Check it out.

1202
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,340
We'll have a link in the show notes at linuxunplug.com

1203
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,540
slash 328.

1204
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,900
Over there at linuxunplug.com slash subscribe is where you

1205
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,420
can get it.

1206
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,020
338.

1207
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,220
You know what?

1208
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,620
No, we're changing this.

1209
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:07,620
Never mind.

1210
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,900
We're starting over.

1211
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,540
All right.

1212
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,060
All right.

1213
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,980
So it's 328.

1214
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,820
338.

1215
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:14,340
338.

1216
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,420
338.

1217
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,300
Where am I?

1218
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:19,500
All right, there you go.

1219
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,060
linuxunplug.com slash 338.

1220
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,020
I would redo it so that way Joe could clean it up,

1221
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,460
but I think we'll just keep it in there like that.

1222
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,860
Because we podcast hard for you, and this is the result.

1223
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:28,820
We get a little loopy.

1224
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,020
That's what happens.

1225
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,220
You'd think the caffeine would keep you

1226
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,180
on the straight and narrow.

1227
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,820
No, it just slowly destroys you.

1228
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,380
And Wes was like, we should be drinking today.

1229
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,340
And I was like, no, we've got to stay on the straight and narrow.

1230
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,020
Yeah, that's how it went.

1231
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:45,460
Anyways, linuxunplug.com slash 338 for links to everything,

1232
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,660
as well as the contact pages over there.

1233
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:50,060
We'll be back live at our regular Tuesday noon

1234
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:50,700
Pacific time.

1235
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,940
You can get that converted to jupiterbroadcasting.com

1236
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,220
slash calendar.

1237
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,420
A massive shout out to our virtual log.

1238
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,420
A fantastic showing.

1239
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,540
Really appreciate everybody making it.

1240
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:03,740
And each one of you now go to linuxheadlines.show

1241
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,820
and subscribe.

1242
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,500
It's a good little show.

1243
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,620
I feel like I'm proud of it or something.

1244
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:09,620
It's a good show.

1245
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:14,740
Like when you're a parent of a kid or a pet

1246
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,460
and you watch them learn something,

1247
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,700
you get proud of them, the first time you taught your dog

1248
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:21,460
to piss outside and you're like, I'm so proud of that dog.

1249
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,420
That's how I feel about headlines.

1250
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:25,500
It's also just super handy, because sometimes you

1251
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,340
don't have time to keep up on the news.

1252
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:30,340
Yeah, and who wants your podcast to piss in the house?

1253
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:31,940
Wow.

1254
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,700
Wow.

1255
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,700
This has been Linux Unplugged, the podcast that

1256
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:35,940
won't piss in your house.

1257
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:36,940
And headlines only there.

1258
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:37,860
It's really well trained.

1259
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,260
It's been domesticated.

1260
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,100
And I really like it.

1261
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:42,660
So check it out at linuxheadlines.show.

1262
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,060
Go get more Alex and I at selfhosted.show.

1263
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,500
And I got one more for you.

1264
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,340
A little bit different, though.

1265
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,860
Different TLD, so brace yourself.

1266
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,340
Techsnap.systems.

1267
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,100
What?

1268
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,100
Yeah, I didn't even know that systems was a thing.

1269
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,020
Turns out it is.

1270
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,500
There's so many great things.

1271
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,220
Turns out.horse is a thing.

1272
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,380
.audio is a thing.

1273
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,460
Who knew?

1274
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,540
Oh, I guess I did.

1275
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,100
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

1276
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,800
for the times in the local zone, because we would

1277
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,300
like you to join us next week.

1278
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,540
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1279
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:09,820
Woo!

1280
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:48,820
The Unplugged Program. Love that song. You know, I'm a big fan now of the longer outros

1281
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:53,780
but the tighter intros. Bring them in nice and short. Over the years, you can chart the

1282
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:58,340
length of the unplugged intro. It's just gotten shorter and shorter and shorter.

1283
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:01,180
Well, you want the intro because you're excited about the content, right? If you're listening

1284
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,620
to the podcast, but the outro, that's your nice, the long outro gives you time to pick

1285
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,220
what you're going to listen to next.

1286
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:12,340
Well, when we were new at podcasting, we thought, we told ourselves, well, we got to set the

1287
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:17,340
tone. We got to set the mood. So we got to have a nice long intro that really sets the

1288
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:22,520
mood for my great podcast. And you know, you see this on YouTube now, like so many like

1289
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:27,020
YouTubers have these really long intros with fancy graphics.

1290
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:31,420
Hey, Chris. Hey, Chris. Let's get to it. Don't you love it when they say that? Let's get

1291
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:34,140
right to it after like an eight minute intro.

1292
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:39,080
Yeah. So let's get right to it. Yeah, but podcasts do this too. But then what happens

1293
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:44,780
is if you're a listener and you've heard that podcast a hundred times, think about how much

1294
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:48,040
of your life has been just listening to that same intro music, which is coming in in a

1295
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,140
compressed MP3 likely or a compressed YouTube video.

1296
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:55,460
But I love it. Like one of the transformation experiences of my year last year was sat in

1297
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:59,140
the studio with you listening to the intro of LUP, recording LUP.

1298
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:02,300
Well, you got to have a little something, I think, you know, you got to, you got to

1299
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,980
have a little, you got to have a little something. So that way, when you hear the song, you're

1300
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:08,080
like, oh, that's from the show I like. So you got to have a little something. But I

1301
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:13,100
think where you go long is in the outro where I think the balance is struck really well

1302
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:19,100
is in user air. It's got an identifiable bong right in. But then it's got that beautiful

1303
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,980
long outro that I listened to every single time.

1304
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:23,740
Right. You don't have to skip it. You just let it fade out.

1305
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,740
I always have.

1306
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,220
What was that intro like again?

1307
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:39,900
You're trying to get me. All right. We got to pick our title. JBtitles.com.

1308
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,420
You know, when you guys were talking about the shareware and the freeware and stuff.

1309
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,420
Yeah, I remember that.

1310
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,020
Oh, yeah. And I wanted to come back to the other thing, too.

1311
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,300
And you had mentioned WinRAR.

1312
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,300
Yeah.

1313
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,940
You still haven't paid for years, bud? Oh, man.

1314
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:54,980
It was an adware, right? But the one thing about it that I don't think a lot of people

1315
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:59,860
knew is that if you just right clicked on your file, you could extract it and never

1316
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:00,860
get nagged.

1317
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:06,180
Oh, I think it was classically famous for that. So tag me in the mumble room if you

1318
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,420
had other thoughts on the whole developer burnout topic that we discussed, because I

1319
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:14,020
knew a couple other people wanted to jump in on that. Because I think what I really

1320
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:19,420
appreciated about that blog post that we read was it really made me realize that this isn't

1321
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:24,860
a Linux problem or an open source problem. It's a human problem, and you can apply it

1322
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:30,940
to software development. You can apply it to basically everything. Anybody who's in

1323
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:35,580
a situation where there's a lot of those kind of types of dynamics at play. So, Colonel,

1324
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:38,100
I wanted to give you a chance because I saw you had pinged me earlier.

1325
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:44,020
Yeah, I've been thinking for a while now about is there some way that we could maybe the

1326
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:49,340
open source community band together and create an organization that would put a framework

1327
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:56,140
around bringing in volunteers to deal with the non-development side of maintaining a

1328
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:00,900
project. So things like managing the money coming in, managing, creating a foundation

1329
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:06,700
if it gets that far for that project, maybe maintaining the servers for like a website

1330
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,900
or a racket chat or something like that.

1331
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:15,740
Yeah. Wes and I were actually just brainstorming this yesterday, and I think we both agreed

1332
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:20,420
it probably wouldn't work, but the idea was is a loose group of volunteers who are kind

1333
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,780
of like a team that can come in and say, we can help you get these things set up. They

1334
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:28,100
don't run it for you necessarily, or maybe they get something immediately resolved for

1335
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:33,060
you, but they connect you with the right people to get a foundation established or get a contractor

1336
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,460
in to help you with the accounting or something like that.

1337
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:37,660
It strikes me as it's kind of the other side of the coin. You know, we've often talked

1338
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:44,020
about how we have a lot of open source developers, but not always like technical writers or people

1339
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:48,500
to do UI work. Accountants. Yeah, but no one's managing your backlog for you when you have

1340
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,740
this open source project. Communications, troubleshooting, tech support. And these are

1341
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:56,780
all important roles. It kind of makes me want to put it together. You know what I mean?

1342
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,900
Like I want to put together a strike team that like comes, but then we started talking

1343
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,260
about it. We're like, you know, a lot of these developers are pretty proud of doing it their

1344
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,020
own way. That's the other part is it's not for work. You're not getting, right? It's

1345
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:10,220
your project and there's a little more ownership and care. And it's kind of like, Hey, knock,

1346
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,980
knock, we noticed you're doing a bad job. Would you like us to help you solve it? I mean that,

1347
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:18,460
you know, you'd have to really be careful on who you approached, how you approached

1348
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,940
it. Gotta be, gotta be respectful. Yeah. But maybe if you'd done it long enough, you'd

1349
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,620
have a reputation where people would come to you. But I kind of was thinking something

1350
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:29,380
along the same lines, Colonel. It would be nice to have a little organization that could

1351
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:34,540
pop in and just help manage that. All right. Uh, we'll do drifter first and then we'll

1352
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:37,940
do pie crash. So go ahead drifter. What were your additional thoughts? Well, I was just

1353
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:42,500
thinking like it's, it's definitely a developer thing. Being a developer myself, it's a huge

1354
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,260
issue to get burned out and it's really hard, especially when you have like the consumer

1355
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:51,020
or user, um, who, you know, is approaching you and, Oh, I got all these things that have

1356
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:55,860
to be done. And it, like you were mentioning, it's, it's really difficult if you're not

1357
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:59,780
getting out, you don't get those breaks, you burn out really easy. But I think that it's

1358
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:05,360
just a human problem. Sometimes it's really easy, whether that's like via our ticketing

1359
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:09,500
system or something like that, it's really easy to forget that there's just people behind

1360
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:13,480
it. Like it's a, it's a person problem. We forget that it's these people, sometimes they

1361
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,780
need need a little bit of a little bit of slack on that. Yeah. I can't tell you how

1362
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:24,360
many, how many emails I've gotten where somebody really gives me the third degree about something.

1363
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,460
Maybe maybe it's generally somebody who's pretty passionate about something. And then

1364
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:34,020
I just kind of respond and address a few of their points and nine out of 10 times they

1365
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:40,340
respond back saying, Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were like a dude that was just talking

1366
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:47,460
to another dude. And I was having a bad day. And I mean, I've seen that a thousand times

1367
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:53,240
over the years because people that are part of a project or somebody that's just on Twitter

1368
00:54:53,240 --> 00:55:00,100
or a celebrity or podcaster is a bit of an abstraction. And so you're communicating with

1369
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:03,020
an abstracted concept of a human. You know, you don't, you don't see, you know, you don't

1370
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:08,500
see me here with my belly and, and my beard and my hair that still looks pretty great

1371
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:12,300
and all of that. You don't see that, right? You just, you have the concept of Chris and

1372
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:16,760
you communicate with that concept. Um, and that's what I was saying earlier in the show

1373
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,620
that this low bandwidth aspect of communication over the internet really matters to like base

1374
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:24,940
levels in our monkey brain. All right. So Mr. Crash, I wanted to give you a chance to

1375
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,940
jump in.

1376
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:32,980
So the thing I wanted to talk about, it's like, uh, burnout is pretty much in every,

1377
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:39,020
everyone's problem. I mean, startup people get burnout and even students get burnout.

1378
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:45,220
I'm a student myself and I got some problem with burnout a couple of years ago. And it's

1379
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:51,820
like the problem is, uh, that's, you need to learn. And so we all need to learn to ask

1380
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:58,740
for help before we are burnout. Actually, that's a really big problem. And it's a good

1381
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:05,420
thing what wrote, that's just like, I'm asking for help.

1382
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:10,540
Yeah. And just a little understanding even just to kind of connect with where I'm at.

1383
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,540
Brent, what do you think?

1384
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:16,620
Yeah. Uh, this is a huge topic, uh, and an important one. And I feel like if, yeah, there's

1385
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:23,220
some way that we can allow our experts, you know, those who are coding, they're best at

1386
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:27,940
coding and yet they have, you know, a hundred other tasks that surround that activity to

1387
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:35,460
make it successful. Um, we need some open source, you know, it's really in any area,

1388
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,080
but if we're talking just open source, we need some people who are really passionate

1389
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:45,380
open source accountants who can, you know, come and help 10 developers with that area

1390
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:51,140
so that the developers or podcasters or photographers or whatever their expertise is, can focus

1391
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:57,020
on what they're actually really good at and not waste their cycles doing, you know, inefficient

1392
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:03,060
and also oftentimes really frustrating work that they just need to get done to allow them

1393
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:07,140
to, to make a living, but, um, aren't jazzed about.

1394
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:13,380
Yeah. Oh, there's a lot of that. I think too, conversations like this, which remind

1395
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:18,860
us, um, that they're human and conversations like you have on brunch remind us that these

1396
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:22,860
are human, humanizes these people. And I think that's also pretty helpful, even if it's only

1397
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:28,100
part of the solution. I think it's still good to do, especially in free software and open

1398
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:31,220
source. Yeah. I agree, Drifter. This could be a whole topic, couldn't it? I mean, you

1399
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,940
could have a whole podcast dedicated to this.

1400
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,600
Yeah, absolutely. I mean, and I think we could all definitely use it too. Just being able

1401
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,220
to have like an area just to vent, right?

1402
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:46,140
Yeah. Yeah. And that, I mean, I've been bashing on internet communications, but it's, it's

1403
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:51,300
at least we have this. And so, I mean, I think you could glass half full it too and say,

1404
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,460
it's not enough, but it's better than absolutely nothing. And just being by yourself in a room

1405
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:01,100
quiet, uh, it's nice to have this connection. So I think there's some positives to it too.

1406
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,100
What do you think, Alex?

1407
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:06,380
I think recognizing burnout and being honest with yourself and being able to have the courage

1408
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:12,560
to say, yes, I'm not enjoying what I'm doing is, is a real, you know, it's a real scary

1409
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:18,460
thing the first time, you know, my personal experience was, I was working for Apple on

1410
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:23,960
the genius bar and everything about that told me I should love it because I was repairing

1411
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:28,700
stuff and I was enjoying it, you know, the technical side, but dealing with customers

1412
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:35,820
all the time, just wore me down and admitting to myself that that wasn't what got me out

1413
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:40,260
of bed in the morning. Took me a couple of years, honestly.

1414
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,020
From Apple to Red Hat, but it took some analysis, right?

1415
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:48,580
Yeah. Yeah. And reading, reading books, honestly, on the topic, I would say is a huge help because

1416
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:53,060
it gives you, as you're reading, it gives your brain that time to sort of say, yeah,

1417
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:57,740
I identify with the way that this author is trying to make me feel or, or whatever it

1418
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:02,920
is and sort of say, it's okay to, you know, make mistakes in, in terms of thinking that

1419
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:07,380
this role or, you know, being a developer, it wasn't right for me either because it was

1420
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,020
too monotonous, but where I am now, I love it because, you know, every, no two days are

1421
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:17,220
the same, even though broadly speaking, I do the same thing every day, you know, different

1422
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,780
cases and whatever come through. So it's, it's a real balancing act and being honest

1423
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:27,180
with yourself is the real key to unlocking, I don't want to say like super cheesy, like

1424
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:34,060
happiness, but genuinely, I mean it, that being able to say, I need to change something

1425
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:38,480
and then putting a plan into place and kind of sticking to it, even though it can take

1426
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,380
several years is well worth the effort.

1427
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:45,700
Yeah. And sometimes having something to work towards and just being able to see measurable

1428
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:50,620
improvements out of a situation is really all it takes to change your attitude around,

1429
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:56,340
which kind of doubles your net result because you're, you know, you're energized, so you're,

1430
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:59,420
you're getting more creative, you're working a little bit harder, you've got energy again,

1431
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:03,740
so it's not as much of a slog. And it's just simply by just having a, it doesn't have to

1432
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:09,140
be a master plan, but just a few key milestones that you're working towards and you can see

1433
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:12,500
progress and if you can, you need to be able to realize that progress to actually get the

1434
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:17,620
boost. But if you can pull it off, it can be a trick. And I, you know, it's not building

1435
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:21,440
that momentum and sort of like, right, I just got that done. Okay. It was a tiny piece,

1436
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,440
but I can keep going.

1437
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,460
I'll tell you the other thing as well is, isn't, it's not necessarily just about huge

1438
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:34,260
life changing stuff like changing job or emigrating, right? It's about incremental change as well,

1439
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:38,100
making small tweaks to your morning. Like Brent said earlier, you know, take the 20 minutes

1440
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:43,420
and do the yoga, but do it regularly and build that into your routine. Like node runners

1441
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:47,500
saying in the IRC, get a standing desk so you can change it up or go and, you know,

1442
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:51,020
if you're working from home, go and work on the couch for 20 minutes or whatever it is,

1443
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:55,320
you know, he actually did that today is, um, before the show I was out in the living room

1444
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,700
of the studio working from there just to, just to change it up, change up the energy

1445
01:00:58,700 --> 01:01:02,300
flow a little bit. So that way I was getting, that way I get a little more peppy for on

1446
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:05,740
air, you know, get myself work going again and get out of the sleepy chair that I'd been

1447
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:09,900
in since like 7 a.m. And yeah, it actually does work. Just little tricks like that. That

1448
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:14,180
seems silly. That's how I describe it. It seems like a silly thing to do, but sometimes

1449
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:17,100
it works and you just got to find the ones that do for you. If you think this is something

1450
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:21,900
we could talk more about, uh, let me know. You can either tweet me at Chris LAS or Linux

1451
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:26,820
unplug.com slash contact because I think, you know, maybe that maybe we do an extra

1452
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:29,660
on it or something like that. I don't know what, I don't know what that avenue would

1453
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,500
be. People in the chat room are saying do a special on it because it does, it does apply

1454
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:36,780
so much to open source development, but it's, it's broader than that too.

1455
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:41,980
I would like to think that mr devault got something out of even writing that post, you

1456
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:48,380
know, simply putting those words down and acknowledging that himself and you know, there's,

1457
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:53,980
there's a level of, of it being, you know, just therapy, uh, for lack of a better word

1458
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:58,220
to sit down and put your thoughts out like that and admit it to the public. Right. Exactly.

1459
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:01,580
And then put those thoughts, you know, somewhere where the public can actually read them and

1460
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:04,940
understand the struggles that you're going through, I think helps a lot. And it's, it's

1461
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:09,020
kind of a first step to acknowledging that and, and changing the way that you operate

1462
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:15,180
so that you do have that little bit of downtime and you don't necessarily have to schedule

1463
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:20,820
everything, every single event of your, of your, you know, your life to, to try and,

1464
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:26,380
you know, have a little bit of time for your family or, um, that time just to walk around

1465
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:30,300
the block and, and, you know, get out of a head space for a moment.

1466
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:35,100
I think, uh, I hope at least, and I think he probably did hear from a few people like

1467
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:38,220
right there with you, man, so much on all of that, because I think it resonated with

1468
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:42,740
a lot of us listening to it. Okay. Well, um, I have something kind of special for us that

1469
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:48,740
I say for the post-show because probably it's probably too retro. Maybe Wes and I are the

1470
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:54,300
only ones that remember this, but this just felt extremely appropriate with today's topic.

1471
01:02:54,300 --> 01:03:17,100
So I leave you with this.

1472
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:24,580
It's down for you, no comment, San Diego, no more Oregon trail Tetris and the others.

1473
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:29,180
They're all going to fail. Not because we want it, but because you just taking it disrespecting

1474
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:35,700
all the folks who are making it. The more you take the less there will be. The disc

1475
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:40,660
becomes fewer. The games fall away. The screen starts to shrink and then it will fade. Programs

1476
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:45,980
fall through a black hole in space. The computer world becomes bleak and stark, loses its life

1477
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:56,140
and the screen goes to dark. Welcome to the end of the computer age.
