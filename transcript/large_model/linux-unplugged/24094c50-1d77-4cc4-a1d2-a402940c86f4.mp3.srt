1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
Since we're in pre-show mode, we should crack open our beers and talk a little open source

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,760
retro gaming hardware.

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,600
It's called the Game Shell.

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,920
And I think Poby was saying on the Ubuntu podcast that he's a backer of this thing.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,360
It looks just like a Game Boy with a few more buttons on it.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,040
And of course, it's a modular open source hardware that is meant to run classic games.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,320
And the price is pretty reasonable.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,320
You can get the early bird price at 108 bucks.

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,560
And they have real like already built hardware playing Doom, of course.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,560
That's the handheld one.

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,560
Yeah.

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
Yeah.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,560
It looks just like an old retro Game Boy.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
The old black and white Game Boy.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,640
Well, see, the problem with that is how likely is it going to be that Nintendo shuts this

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,920
down because it looks too similar?

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
Maybe you think.

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
Boy, that would be pretty awful.

19
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,440
Nintendo is pretty heavy handed with their confidence.

20
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,800
They are pretty litigious.

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,940
The thing is, is you have seen other products kind of like this.

22
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,440
This is the most Game Boy looking.

23
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,160
It is colored screen that one of the pictures they show it being black and white, but it

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,740
does have a colored screen.

25
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,400
And of course, it runs different emulators.

26
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,080
It's got support for Lua and Python.

27
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,780
Of course, it's an open source operating system.

28
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,400
The hardware is open, of course, of course, of course.

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,200
Yeah, I think it's pretty neat.

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,520
They got a pretty reasonable like set of goals and stretch goals and they're doing well on

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,520
funding.

32
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,960
They wanted $50,000.

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,160
And as we record this episode, they've raised $252,509.

34
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Hey-oh.

35
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
Yeah.

36
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,000
They've got 2,280 backers.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Not too shabby.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No, they're doing great.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So this is a game show.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a Kickstarter.

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,300
So, you know, the usual Kickstarter disclaimers apply.

42
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:53,520
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 226 for December 5th, 2017.

43
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,580
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's counting down the days to

44
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,680
the new year.

45
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
My name is Chris.

46
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
My name is Wes.

47
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
Hello, Wes.

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
And hello, Beard.

49
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
Hello.

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
Guys, today's a big episode on the show.

51
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Yeah.

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
You know, we do that from time to time.

53
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
Just sneak them in.

54
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
It happens.

55
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:13,120
I don't know how this happens for an unplugged show, but coming up on today's humble podcast.

56
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,520
That's right.

57
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,480
We're going to kick things off with a new Runs Linux this week, just for old time's

58
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,480
sake.

59
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,140
We'll get into that, then some local community news, and then something that Google's doing

60
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,160
to get people into open source.

61
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,960
Those of you looking for the perfect remote desktop solution, we may have you covered.

62
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,360
Say it's not so.

63
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
It could be so.

64
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
It could be.

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Ugh.

66
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,320
And then we have some great news for you VLC lovers.

67
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,440
I think really, really great news.

68
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,240
And then, before we get to the Gentoo challenge this week, I want to take a moment, if I could,

69
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:48,800
carve out a little bit of your time, and tell you a little bit why Linux users, more than

70
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,800
just about any other segment of the internet, should probably care a little bit about Bitcoin.

71
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,480
So Bitcoin for Linux users, why you should care about it, and specifically, I'm going

72
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,800
to answer a couple of common questions that I think Bitcoin doubters have.

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,640
Not that I'm trying to convince anybody, but I just want to give you a different perspective

74
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,280
and maybe help put some context into why the hell, as we record this episode, one single

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,600
Bitcoin is over 11,000 green US BACs.

76
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,000
What is going on?

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,600
Well, there is an expert in the Bitcoin community who I have pulled a few quotes from that'll

78
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,280
explain how Bitcoin compares to services like PayPal, how to think about all these other

79
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,760
cryptocurrencies, these altcoins that are coming out and what they mean, and is this

80
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,840
going to be an open source mess?

81
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,680
And then the potentials that Bitcoin has for charity, as well as why, without question,

82
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,760
even if it's not Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies are 100% here.

83
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,880
They're never going back in the bottle.

84
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,640
They are here forever.

85
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,680
And I'll kind of give you the ironclad reasoning behind all of that, too.

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,680
So this is really the pitch on why you should care as a Linux user, because it's an open

87
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,120
source money protocol.

88
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,760
And it's going to take over the world in one degree, not like the way Linux has.

89
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,760
Right.

90
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,600
It's easy to overstate, but it's also potentially serious.

91
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,820
If you were back in the early 90s right now looking at Linux, that's what Bitcoin is.

92
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,920
And so it's going to be an implementation detail that is incredibly valuable, just like

93
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,040
Linux is for Android and a bunch of set top boxes.

94
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
And I'm going to explain why.

95
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,200
And so that's why you should care about Bitcoin, because it's at the early stage that Linux

96
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
was.

97
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,960
And it's also an open source project that's going to change people's lives, it's going

98
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,560
to create new work.

99
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,520
And the thing you're going to see a lot of is tons and tons and tons of hype.

100
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,000
In fact, you're already starting to see blockchain apps coming out.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,040
Did you see this CryptoKitties app that everybody's talking about?

102
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,320
CryptoKitties.

103
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,040
And there's a bunch of other ones that are coming out now that help you invest in Bitcoin.

104
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,560
And Joe and I recently talked about one that's partying up with Yala for Sailfish.

105
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Is that right?

106
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,000
And they're creating a Zip currency that developers will use inside the development community

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and bug testers.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,640
And they're going to create their own cryptocurrency for development on Sailfish.

109
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
All kinds of interesting things are happening.

110
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,720
And we'll give you some of the background, but we won't take too much of your time, because

111
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,280
nominally today, we are going to get into the Bitcoin challenge.

112
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,520
We're going to kick it off officially here in a few minutes.

113
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,520
So get your systems ready.

114
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,080
Then we're going to check in with folks in the virtual lug and see how they're doing.

115
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:27,040
And then we'll reveal the desktop environment that the audience voted on for West to build

116
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
in our Gen 2 challenge.

117
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,240
So without going any further, let's stop right now and bring in that virtual lug.

118
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hello.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Howdy.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I love it, every.

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Every.

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Single.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Time.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hello, guys.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It is good to hear from you.

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,760
So let's kick it off with a little community news.

128
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,840
And this one just sort of, I don't know if you could really classify this as community,

129
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,100
but for nostalgia purposes, for old time's sake, I wanted to start off with Arun's Linux

130
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
this week.

131
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,080
And this one's a little odd.

132
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
It is a little odd.

133
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,780
Amazon has released an Ubuntu driven AWS deep lens cam.

134
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,440
And it's got a four megapixel machine learning camera with AWS hooks that runs Ubuntu on

135
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,200
an Intel Cherry Trail system on a chip.

136
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,640
So it's an Atom processor.

137
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:21,200
It's got a HD ready AWS deep lens development camera, is for machine learning, available

138
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,640
for $250 and a pre-order.

139
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:32,480
And to describe the look of it is like a big boxy webcam bolted on top of like a gigabyte

140
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
nook, like a tiny nook.

141
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,240
Yeah, it does look like that.

142
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,160
And this thing's running Ubuntu 16.04.

143
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,880
Or maybe like a cute robot with no hands and legs.

144
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,760
Yeah, like the beginnings of it.

145
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,360
One that is aware of its environment but can't interact in any way.

146
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,140
Right, it's just watching and brooding.

147
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,140
With a nice howl circle.

148
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,200
Yeah, it does have a circle, oh man.

149
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,480
So it's billed as the world's first video camera optimized to run machine learning models

150
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,460
and perform inference on the device, inference from the images.

151
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,360
It's Wi-Fi enabled and it's working with the Amazon SageMaker development framework for

152
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,820
managing machine learning models.

153
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,040
Now that's something that I'm just sort of tossing in there, but that's kind of a big

154
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
deal.

155
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,480
Like the models around machine learning are sort of like the recipes, right?

156
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,760
And so if you have a marketplace to share these recipes, then you can take your hardware

157
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,160
and you can go grab a recipe and all of a sudden you can take your box and you can start

158
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,720
doing machine learning, just any average Joe.

159
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,400
And so we got the SageMaker development framework for managing machine learning model processing

160
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,240
on this thing.

161
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,600
And some of the things that it can detect, there's like I think a category of 30 different

162
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,760
activities that this thing is aware of.

163
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,440
It obviously has face detection and object detection, it can detect the difference between

164
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,600
a cat and a dog, which is similar to Google's TensorFlow AI vision kit, which is available

165
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,560
for the Raspberry Pi Zero.

166
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,640
But this thing can also detect different activities that you're doing, ranging from brushing your

167
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,360
teeth to playing guitar, probably baiting and other things I would imagine this thing

168
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,880
is going to be able to recognize.

169
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,080
And you'll be able to train it to learn new behaviors as well.

170
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,080
And then it all can talk back up to AWS.

171
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:19,480
1604 LTS on an Intel Atom, the thing has 106 gigaflops of performance.

172
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,560
The Cherry Trail Atom processor with 8 gigs of RAM, a micro SD slot, 16 gigabytes of flash,

173
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,520
which can be expanded as dual band Wi-Fi, USB ports, HDMI out, an audio jack, reset

174
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,320
buttons and a power jack, it's pretty well spec'd, does 14 images a second by default.

175
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,800
So it's not like it's, it also does have a video mode, but by default has taken 14 images

176
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
a second.

177
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
Yeah.

178
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,680
I mean, but it does bring machine learning down to a price point for an individual because

179
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,160
it's only 250 bucks.

180
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,400
So that's what this is for.

181
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,360
This is, this isn't a consumer product.

182
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,560
This is for people at home, enthusiasts or developers to learn machine learning.

183
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,440
Is that because I'm trying, I am, I'm struggling to understand why the hell anybody would ever

184
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
want a product like this.

185
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Well, yeah.

186
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,960
In traditional AWS fashion, they've made it as confusing as possible for someone who isn't

187
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,960
already invested in their ecosystem to understand what the heck is going on.

188
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,840
So if I'm leveraging the rest of their machine learning infrastructure, this thing could

189
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
be extremely handy.

190
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,840
Yeah.

191
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,360
Well, if you like to read their, yeah, if you read their like PR announcement, you'll

192
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,640
see they reference their own products like 17 times.

193
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,760
So that'll give you a sense of how interconnected it can be.

194
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Yeah.

195
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
You're right.

196
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,560
It's a cheap way of leveraging AWS to do machine learning interfacing with the real world.

197
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Yeah.

198
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
Okay.

199
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,560
All right.

200
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Was somebody in the mumble room going to chime in?

201
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,560
Yeah.

202
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,560
Yeah.

203
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Actually he covered it all.

204
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Yeah.

205
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
I guess.

206
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
Okay.

207
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,640
I can see in that context, it doesn't creep me out as bad in that context.

208
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Yeah.

209
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,080
Just where's this going eventually?

210
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,480
Is this going in echoes eventually?

211
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,460
In some regards, I wouldn't mind my echo telling me when Dylan's come home from school versus

212
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,460
when Abby's come home.

213
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,320
You got the video echo, so it's already like 60% of the way there.

214
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,920
I also see it as their cloud play.

215
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,440
They're launching more and more products to help like, the more machine learning you do,

216
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,200
that's a lot of math, a lot of numbers that end up being crunched somewhere.

217
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,560
AWS obviously wants you to crunch those numbers on its cloud.

218
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,200
So if they can make like development kits, that's why they have all these other things

219
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,000
like cloud nine, they're like cloud desktop, anything they can get you to like, if it's

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,040
easier to integrate with them, and then when you go to production and spend real money,

221
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
that's where you go.

222
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Right.

223
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
You're already there.

224
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,800
And I think they are having a better strategy vision on this than Google at this moment

225
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,400
because of that point, precisely, that actually you will get to see the data yourself.

226
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,040
It doesn't just get crunched on their servers, but you actually get to be able to get the

227
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,120
data back because of how their services are modeled.

228
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,420
And in comparison, the Google is not doing that, it's doing the Google Assistant that

229
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,800
you can just put it in any place and you can just use their service as a whole package.

230
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,600
It is easier to bury entry, but you don't have the control there.

231
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,800
The other thing it underscores just though is that Amazon sure uses the heck out of Linux.

232
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,160
It's here, it's in their data centers, it's all over the place.

233
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,840
Yeah, and they're putting 1604 Ubuntu on there, it's the next 86 box.

234
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,920
I do think this is also kind of a thing where they are giving a cheap product to get developers

235
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,840
to expand the capabilities of their framework for them.

236
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,840
Yeah.

237
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,320
I mean, they can probably take advantage of those models too, right?

238
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,720
So that makes sense.

239
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,280
And if it's a price point that's around the cost of a high-end Echo or Kindle that you

240
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:28,920
can use to get into machine learning and then it plugs into the AWS infrastructure, it makes

241
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,920
sense.

242
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,800
Plus, they also get feedback on what developers doing this kind of stuff actually want for

243
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,800
basically free.

244
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Yeah.

245
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Oh, clever, Amazon.

246
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,200
So let's talk about something else that's clever.

247
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,760
Linux Fest Northwest, April 28th and 29th, 2018, coming up pretty soon, surprisingly.

248
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,360
Yeah, the April 28th and 29th.

249
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,520
They move it around from time to time.

250
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
They sure do.

251
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,800
This is the 19th year of Linux Fest.

252
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Wow.

253
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,920
Yeah, and I feel like they're at a transition point because different conferences have come

254
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
up over those years, obviously.

255
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:04,560
A lot of commercial conferences in the last 19 years have come up.

256
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,840
So they're trying something a little new.

257
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,720
They're doing a message in a bottle theme, which I think is interesting.

258
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,880
They say they're encouraging but not requiring that presenters touch on a theme, message

259
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,960
in a bottle, security, containerization, and personal data.

260
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,040
They don't have to follow that, but they do have a call out for papers right now if you're

261
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,440
going to be at Linux Fest Northwest or call out for presenters.

262
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,860
Why not help them make it a good 19 years because it is a transition point for them

263
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,240
where they can become a slightly different style conference and it'll be interesting

264
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,800
to see which direction they go.

265
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,160
I would also say it's just such a friendly event.

266
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,920
Like if you haven't spoke before, you want to speak, you're not sure like, well, what

267
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
is this?

268
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
You will have a great audience.

269
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,160
You'll have lots of people at your talk, most likely, if it's Linux or anything close to

270
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
that.

271
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,560
And everyone's just in a happy, sharing, open source mood.

272
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
Yeah.

273
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,640
And it's a good town in the Pacific Northwest to visit.

274
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Yeah.

275
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,360
And even if your talk goes terribly, just go get some delicious food in Bellingham.

276
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,900
Yeah, Bellingham's got some great restaurants, got a great vibe going, and it's got tons

277
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
of beer.

278
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,180
Now, it's a little busy during Linux Fest Northwest weekend, so you got to plan for

279
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,480
that a little bit.

280
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,280
But there's also just a lot of social events going on at the hotels, there's game nights

281
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,920
going on, people sitting around talking about Linux and all that stuff.

282
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,480
LinuxFestNorthwest.org, if you want to know more, if you want to maybe submit a paper,

283
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
we're going to be there.

284
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,680
We're going to be doing something different than we've ever done, too.

285
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,480
I think we may have a live stream going, but I think we'll be doing something different.

286
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,920
Instead of us sitting there like emceeing the booth, it'll be different productions

287
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,080
happening live at Linux Fest that people can tune in for.

288
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,240
Maybe some shows that aren't traditionally live.

289
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
Yeah.

290
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:40,440
But while those shows are being recorded, if it's one that not you or I or Noah is on,

291
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,760
we'll be out on the floor going to the sessions talking to people.

292
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
We'll be out and about.

293
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
The whole experience.

294
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Yeah, it's going to be really good, I think.

295
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,920
But Chris, how are we going to get JB into a bottle?

296
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,400
Well, I could talk about security and personal data.

297
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,280
Containerization, I feel like that just sort of turns me off a little bit when I hear that,

298
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,120
because it's almost like it's like it's slabbed in there like now.

299
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,340
You got to talk about containerization, and you got to talk about Docker.

300
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,840
We got to talk about containers, because that's mandatory.

301
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
You got a conference, you got to talk about containers.

302
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,840
Absolutely.

303
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,840
In fact, we should even create ContainerCon.

304
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,640
That's the only reason to have a conference is to talk about containers.

305
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
It's OK, Chris.

306
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
You can just go to DockerCon.

307
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,720
Well, I've been to ContainerCon, and I've been to DockerCon, and I've been to LinuxCon,

308
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,640
and I've been to all of these where they just go all in on containerization.

309
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,520
It sort of defocuses it instead of just putting it all in one place.

310
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,160
It sort of diffuses it, and it's not as useful.

311
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:39,600
It could be different with a convention like Linux Fest Northwest, though, because it's

312
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
more community focused.

313
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Right.

314
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,280
Yeah, you got people in the industry coming to do talks.

315
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
It's a different thing.

316
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
So I'm curious to see how it goes.

317
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,520
I like that they're trying a theme, and if anybody was going to do it right, and you're

318
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,880
going to get the right voices in the conversation, it's going to be at Linux Fest, at least around

319
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
here.

320
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,000
LinuxFestNorthwest.org.

321
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,200
And now we have just a little bit of hardware news to get to.

322
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:07,000
This is sort of the last breaking news, really, in the last couple of days.

323
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,160
And this story is getting more and more traction, and it seems to be a good way to get attention

324
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
these days.

325
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,280
And it's disabling the Intel management engine.

326
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,880
So we first start out with Purism.

327
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,520
They announced that they'd be disabling the management engine on future computers going

328
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
forward.

329
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,080
And then a few weeks after that, System76 announced that they'll be rolling out firmware

330
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:33,960
updates to disable the Intel management engine on some of the laptops sold in the last year.

331
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:41,160
And then some eagle-eyed Redditors noticed that Dell has begun selling computers that

332
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,360
can be configured with an Intel vPro ME inoperable custom order config.

333
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Is that right?

334
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,080
Yeah, no Intel ME on the Dells, too.

335
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
So it seems-

336
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
Sort of subtly.

337
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
Yeah.

338
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Not without much fanfare.

339
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,480
Now, the interesting difference between Purism, System76, and Dell is the Dell one is the

340
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,640
only one that's actually shipping.

341
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,400
What System76 and Purism have done is have announced, which is funny because that's not

342
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,880
how the news articles read.

343
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,360
They read like if you were to buy a laptop today from either one of them, it would be

344
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,640
shipped without Intel ME.

345
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,440
And so you see that sort of propagate in the different blogs, and Ferronics did this, and

346
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,360
all the different outlets just ran with the headlines as it just spreads out.

347
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,640
And now, I've actually seen in common threads that, well, PopOS has custom code to disable

348
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Intel ME.

349
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,360
Now, it goes from they haven't even shipped it yet to PopOS has been custom engineered

350
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
to disable ME.

351
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,860
That's what the pop is for.

352
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,920
I'm really curious to see how the System76 solution plays out because they're going to

353
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,040
be delivering it through their PPA, which means you'll have to be running Ubuntu.

354
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,520
So if you're putting a different distribution than a modern Ubuntu on your hardware right

355
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,040
now, you're going to have to switch back.

356
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,600
And I think they're still yet to announce exactly which models and which versions of

357
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,940
the models will be getting the firmware updates.

358
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,960
So that's also to be developed.

359
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,440
And I think Purism has also said that they'll be working potentially on updating some of

360
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,280
their previous models.

361
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,680
But I really don't think anybody gives a shit.

362
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,240
I mean, I know some people do.

363
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,640
I mean, I kind of care.

364
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,320
I care on a obviously on a technical level, I think it's shit.

365
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,240
And I care that it could be vulnerable.

366
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,240
But just even seeing the sloppy, inaccurate coverage of these announcements and how people

367
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:29,760
just propagate it around as if it's now done, it's just happened and it's fact.

368
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,040
It all reeks of armchair technologists who are taking a moral high ground position.

369
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,640
But at the end of the day, when it comes time to buy a new rig, they're going to get a ThinkPad,

370
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,900
they're going to get something, they're going to get a MacBook, they're going to get a machine

371
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,040
that Intel and management engine would be a factor.

372
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,640
And I don't think it's really more than a small percentage of people really care.

373
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,640
And those people are probably already buying ThinkPads with core boots that are two or

374
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,320
three years old that have been retrofitted.

375
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,800
Yeah, the people that are covering it, they were they just found a story that would get

376
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,520
them clicks and then they found a nice bow to tie it.

377
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,140
I'm not saying that if I could buy a computer and the computer that I wanted had an option

378
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,940
to disable management engine, I would choose that option every single time.

379
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,200
But it's not going to move the needle on which computer I buy.

380
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,920
I'm going to I'm going to pick a computer that best suits my needs.

381
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,760
And the management engine thing is it's happened.

382
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,240
It's just like the baseband.

383
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,100
If this was a problem, then everybody who is on Twitter and on Reddit making a big deal

384
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,720
about this wouldn't be using cell phones because of the baseband.

385
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,080
We will just it'll become the new normal, just like the Equifax breach becomes the new

386
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,080
normal.

387
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,640
All these things just become the new normal and we make a big stink about it.

388
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,760
But it actually reflects in our accuracy because all these armchair technologists and all

389
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,960
these armchair Linux enthusiasts on the R-Linux subreddit, they're kicking around like it's

390
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,160
already come and gone.

391
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,840
You can buy a computer today.

392
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,320
Operating systems have been custom fitted to disable the management firmware as if that's

393
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,120
even possible.

394
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,440
Nobody really cares.

395
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,520
It's just like this something, hurrah, we're better at kind of thing.

396
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Yeah.

397
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,040
The way it felt to me was that before all of this, before that recent vulnerability,

398
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,100
you had people that were concerned about it and this is a small niche market that has

399
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,100
valid concerns.

400
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,820
Maybe they're journalists or other people that are really concerned about this and are

401
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,920
probably the people running Coreboot or as you say.

402
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
Exactly.

403
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
There's definitely a market for it.

404
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Right.

405
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,920
And then there's this.

406
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,400
But then you had these people that were previously like, yeah, whatever, it's not a big deal.

407
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,920
Suddenly for like a split second, they're concerned about it.

408
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,800
But you know that in six months from now, everyone in that camp is just going to be

409
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
back.

410
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,000
It feels like the Linux user equivalent of changing your avatar.

411
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,560
I think there's actually slightly more to that.

412
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,440
I mean, when you think about that, we're moving to and touching a topic that was mentioned

413
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:43,040
in the beginning of the show, that Bitcoin and you're going to carry your money now yourself.

414
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,120
So far you trust on an institution to do it, your bank.

415
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,000
And the more you start doing that, the more you care about that security, the control

416
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,040
you do have on your device.

417
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,360
And it always starts with a nurse like us.

418
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
Yep.

419
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Yeah, I do.

420
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,160
The research thing, do it, it kind of evolves and then all of a sudden it's needed.

421
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,920
But there are other products on the market.

422
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,600
So there are other products to support this use case of having like completely open firmware.

423
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,200
Like if you look at the Talos 2 workstation, they're taking IBM's new power CPUs and they're

424
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,200
going to build a workstation and that has entirely open firmware for the entire chain.

425
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,280
And so if you are interested in going that route, it is expensive, but you can do it.

426
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,920
Unfortunately, it's not a mobile solution, but it's like a step in the right direction

427
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
I suppose.

428
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
Yeah, yeah.

429
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,360
Yeah, I mean, see the thing about all this stuff about disabling the management engine,

430
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,360
I do think it's a good thing and I'm really glad that researchers are pushing that and

431
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,440
making the discoveries that they're making.

432
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,240
But it isn't a guaranteed solution.

433
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,040
See they're flying blind and what they've managed to do is they've managed to take out

434
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,840
chunks of the management engine, but still get the CPU to boot.

435
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,080
And that's where we're at right now.

436
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,720
That doesn't necessarily, it's a black box, am I wrong?

437
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,920
You do need parts of the management engine or in AMD's case, the PSP in order to boot

438
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,400
because they are actually critical.

439
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,000
They do bootstrap the processor to some extent.

440
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's what I'm saying.

441
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,160
It's like they've taken out a chunk of it, but it's not completely gone.

442
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
It's still there.

443
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:10,160
No, but it is modularized enough that you're basically eliminating anything that's not

444
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,080
needed to boot or is not needed to keep the system running.

445
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,080
Okay.

446
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,640
I mean, it feels like you're not necessarily objecting to any of the ongoing, like two

447
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,680
months ago as Purism in particular, they've done some good work, you know, continually

448
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,120
to explore this space.

449
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,400
There was like a reasonable amount of coverage.

450
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,280
I did not object to any of that.

451
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,480
It's just more, I think more like this, the inaccurate and recent explosion of coverage

452
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,920
without really understanding or by people who aren't really invested in that effort.

453
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Yeah, I think that's probably a good summary of it.

454
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,440
Not to mention, Dell is getting credit for already having this stuff shipping, but my

455
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,360
guess would be that they already had that option many, many, many months ago for the

456
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,200
small sector of the market that is very security focused.

457
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Or the Chinese sector.

458
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,200
Yeah.

459
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
And it's a huge sector potentially.

460
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,200
It could be the other way around.

461
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,960
It could be because if I'm a non-US, if I'm like a company in Iran that's buying a bunch

462
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,920
of Dell laptops or Syria or China, anywhere where the US government might want to peek

463
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
in on what I'm doing.

464
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Yeah.

465
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,200
You don't want an American company being able to look into your CPU.

466
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,880
That's why they don't like Microsoft either.

467
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,000
So Mr. Payne, what do you think?

468
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,440
Are you ready to officially kick off the Gentoo challenge?

469
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,440
Let's do it.

470
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
Fascinating.

471
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,440
Oh boy.

472
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,840
All right, Wes.

473
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,360
We're officially going into the Gentoo den.

474
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,640
The virtual machine is spun up.

475
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
It smells weird in here.

476
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
What's going on over there?

477
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,800
Well, we're getting ready to build ourselves a kernel.

478
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
You've heard about it.

479
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,840
The one, the only Linux.

480
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,520
All right.

481
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,480
So now Wes is off to the races.

482
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,000
He'll be building his system.

483
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So it's not yet bootable.

484
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
No.

485
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Not yet bootable.

486
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You think we might get bootable?

487
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,880
Because the kernel is going to take a while to build unless you build a really lean one.

488
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,480
It might take the rest of the episode just to get to the kernel.

489
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
We're about to find out.

490
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
All right.

491
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
We'll check back in on you.

492
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
Okay.

493
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
All right.

494
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,480
So there you go.

495
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
The Gentoo challenge has officially kicked off.

496
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
Fascinating.

497
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,920
Is he going to do any like special things with the kernel compiling options?

498
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Are you there yet?

499
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
No.

500
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,880
I'm in the menu config right now.

501
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,080
So if there's people who have some opinions about how this kernel should go, we can also

502
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
fix it up later.

503
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,520
I mean, we just got to get to booting first.

504
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
Well, all right.

505
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Yeah.

506
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
We got to get a booting.

507
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
That's true.

508
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
That is true.

509
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
But if we have any quick tips from the...

510
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
Chris.

511
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
Yeah.

512
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,520
Go ahead.

513
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
I have an idea for Wes, for his kernel.

514
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Okay.

515
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,360
I have my kernel backup on my Google Drive and I'm willing to share...

516
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,360
Let me just finish.

517
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Let me just finish.

518
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,840
I have it saved and I can help him with it if he wants me to.

519
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,880
That would be an interesting cheat.

520
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,240
But would it take more time to rig up a way to transfer that thing and then get it in

521
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,720
your VM than it would to just config and build it?

522
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,400
Well, here's the thing.

523
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,200
It's almost fully set up.

524
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
You would just have to edit it for virtual option.

525
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,200
It still kind of feels like cheating though.

526
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,680
It feels like cheating a bit.

527
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Dude.

528
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
It might be.

529
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
It's not cheating.

530
00:23:50,680 --> 00:24:01,600
It's like he downloads the.config file and puts it in his user SRC Linux folder and he

531
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,560
can just change it to his hardware.

532
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
It's not that hard.

533
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Yeah.

534
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,880
I say we wing it and the mistakes are show content.

535
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
We build it live.

536
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
I mean, we got to build it live.

537
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,880
We got to build it.

538
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,880
We got to build it.

539
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
Yeah.

540
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
That's probably true.

541
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,880
If you build it, they will come.

542
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,880
Because part of the problem, right?

543
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,880
Yeah.

544
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,880
That's part of the fun of this thing.

545
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,560
You know, having a good time building a beautiful system.

546
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
It's sort of like we're doing the show.

547
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
We're doing the experience here.

548
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Trying to build some Gentoo on the side.

549
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
Yeah.

550
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
Yeah.

551
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
All right.

552
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
I kind of like it.

553
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,560
It's exciting.

554
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
So Wes is off to the races right now.

555
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Yeah.

556
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
It won't be the prettiest kernel I've ever built.

557
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,800
That's for sure.

558
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,160
But it will be a kernel.

559
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,160
All right.

560
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,600
We will check in, say, towards the end of the show.

561
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,040
See how it's going over here in the Gentoo corner, okay?

562
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,160
We're leaving the Gentoo corner now.

563
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,960
And with that, let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy this week, linuxacademy.com

564
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,440
slash unplug.

565
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,280
That's where you go to sign up for a free seven-day trial.

566
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,280
I am super jealous.

567
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
I think it's DeBill.

568
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,280
Wasn't it Ja-bill?

569
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
DeBill?

570
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,160
Yes, I believe so.

571
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,880
Check this out, Wes.

572
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,980
DeBill, now the place he works, when you sign up and you start working there, they hand

573
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,760
out Linux Academy subscriptions to get the team up to speed.

574
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
How brilliant is that?

575
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
What?

576
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:11,040
I think a lot of businesses should look into this because there was always training budgets.

577
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,620
And this is something that is going to snap in perfectly with that kind of system.

578
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,560
It's a great platform to learn more about every Linux, cloud, and DevOps topic with

579
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:24,040
hands-on scenario-based labs with instructors that can help you whenever you get stuck.

580
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,120
And Learning Pass, if you want to go down for specific types of content, like a very

581
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,980
specific track that you just need to get up to speed on.

582
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,920
Or if you're going for certifications, they got training that's dedicated to really immerse

583
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
yourself.

584
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,520
And they also have the whizbang sort of practice exam and quizzes approach, so whatever works

585
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,640
better for you.

586
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,960
And they have cloud servers they'll spin up on demand when you need them, a course schedule

587
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,560
if you're busy, especially with the fricking holidays coming up.

588
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,960
Trust me, this is the best thing ever.

589
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,640
They'll help you pick a course instead of time frame to fit to your schedule and your

590
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
learning goals.

591
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,920
And then they have a public profile where you or your employer or a potential employer

592
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,080
can see the courses that you've completed, iOS and Android apps so you can study on the

593
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,260
fricking go and study tools that you can take with you, like the guides or the lesson audio

594
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:12,920
and your personal notebook and different tools that are offline that you can just use as

595
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,800
reference or study as you need.

596
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,480
And they're always adding new stuff.

597
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,280
That's what makes the subscription valuable, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

598
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:26,200
That's where you go to sign up for a free seven day trial.

599
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,560
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

600
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:36,480
the unplugged program.

601
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:42,500
So we noticed that the elementary project has been keeping the public up to date on

602
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:47,200
their endeavors with the app center and other things that are happening over there.

603
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,200
And we just happened to have Mr. Daniel Fore from the elementary OS project in the mumble

604
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
room again this week.

605
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,840
Daniel, good to see you again.

606
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
And what the heck is going on over there?

607
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,720
You guys are just on top of it with this stuff.

608
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,800
Yeah, well, you know, people have been asking about stats.

609
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,280
And so I kind of poked everybody and we pulled together some some fun numbers if you want

610
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
to take a look at them.

611
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,280
Yeah, I was OK.

612
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,760
I noticed right out of it that the new version of calendar close was 28 reported issues.

613
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Sounds pretty good.

614
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,520
So it's like it's like these are the core apps and these are the things we've been doing

615
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
to them.

616
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,520
What's your what's your highlights here?

617
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,920
OK, so this.

618
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,600
This represents our this last blog post was our updates for November.

619
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,000
So we've got a calendar update app.

620
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,120
We got a few little bugs fixing here, but the big the big ticket items actually are

621
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,840
still app center is where we're putting huge amounts of focus.

622
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,200
Yeah, it looks like it looks like new automated tests were added.

623
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,400
Is that like automated for what?

624
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,400
What are you testing with these new automated tests in the app center?

625
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,040
This sounds really fancy.

626
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,120
Yeah, so when a developer submits their application to app center, the first thing it does is

627
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,200
it goes through an automated test suite.

628
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,000
So before it ever gets to a human reviewer, we run all these tests on it.

629
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,040
And since you're connected with GitHub, then we can kick back issues to you automatically

630
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,620
from the test suite.

631
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:12,040
So it might take a while of robot testing for a while before you even really get to

632
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,760
human reviewer so we can do reviews really quickly with this way.

633
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
That is really great.

634
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,060
Wow, I love it.

635
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,900
And I notice then you do have the OK, alright, OK, OK, here we go.

636
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,560
We got some real numbers here we got.

637
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,080
So 70,000 downloads from the app center.

638
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Wow.

639
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,040
Is that the whole run of the app center?

640
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,040
70,000?

641
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,040
Is that the whole thing?

642
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,760
That's that's just this month, what?

643
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
That is crazy.

644
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
Oh, that is.

645
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
That's fantastic.

646
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
That is amazing.

647
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,280
elementary OS was downloaded 61,000 times, with about 77% of those coming from closed

648
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,620
platforms, which I think is always the goal of the project there is to convert a bunch

649
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:55,420
of those users over and $132 were paid out to developers this month, 70 app releases

650
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,420
this month.

651
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,420
Holy crap.

652
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,420
Wow.

653
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,600
That's really taken off, Dan.

654
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,080
I mean, I think this gets it's, it's kind of a hit.

655
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:08,840
Yeah, it's been pretty crazy to see, you know, that's the 7070 releases a release is either

656
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,360
a new app or an update.

657
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,380
We've got 65 total apps in the store right now.

658
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:19,160
So that means some apps updated more than more than once this month.

659
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,480
So we're getting regular app dates up to users.

660
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,680
And I think I think it's pretty neat.

661
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,680
Geez.

662
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,600
Well, I'm every time we talk about this after afterwards, I walk away from the show and

663
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,720
go, I kind of want to try this out.

664
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,040
I want to just give it a go again.

665
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,320
It's been, it's been a little while since I didn't, I haven't checked it out since it

666
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
first launched.

667
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,840
Um, I like it.

668
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,240
How do you guys handle firmware updates and stuff like that?

669
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,640
How does, how does that get like these Intel ME stuff through, say some firmware update

670
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,200
that came around to fix stuff like we've seen in the past?

671
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
What happens in elementary?

672
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,200
I was for that.

673
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,960
Um, we don't have a GUI yet hooked up for that.

674
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,280
I think the plan is to use a whooped, right?

675
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,760
Is the kind of standard.

676
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
So.

677
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
Yeah.

678
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,160
Well, I will link to the post lots of nice screenshots too.

679
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,920
I really like the design of these apps.

680
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,920
Just all good stuff.

681
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,560
I got, I got nothing but good stuff to say.

682
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,920
This has got to be one of the best distributions that I'm not currently running.

683
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,880
I kind of, I got to put it, I got to, I had a laptop, my, my, it goes so well on my XPS

684
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,880
13 laptop.

685
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,880
Oh yeah.

686
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,880
I bet it's just beautiful.

687
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Edge to edge.

688
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
High EPI.

689
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Oh man.

690
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,880
It's nice.

691
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,360
So I think that's the laptop I'm going to put this back on and try this stuff out.

692
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Wow.

693
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,360
I can't believe that.

694
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,400
70,000 downloads in the month.

695
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
That's great.

696
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,160
That is really, that's a really solid number and shows you that your users are going in

697
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
there and really trying it out.

698
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
I think that's pretty good.

699
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,400
It really makes me think too that if you introduce some new users into the elementary ecosystem,

700
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,020
they would get a really nice idea about what this Linux world can be.

701
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,640
So Dan, what about the possibility of something like one day I could go in there and install

702
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,880
telegram or Chrome?

703
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,120
Is that, is that possible?

704
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,040
Like with flat packs or snaps, is that somewhere this could go or is it always going to be

705
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,520
a just stuff that's been built specifically for the platform?

706
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,760
We want to keep it to just stuff that's been specifically built for the platform and we've

707
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,080
actually seen in our Reddit and other places that our users want this too and without even

708
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,260
us suggesting it, we constantly get suggestions of, I want to be able to hide apps that come

709
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,440
from Ubuntu and Debian.

710
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,440
I don't want to see them.

711
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,920
I just want App Center apps.

712
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
Yeah.

713
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Yeah.

714
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,600
Cause they wanted them to match the aesthetic and fit in with the overall design theme.

715
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
So that makes sense.

716
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Yeah.

717
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,040
And they know that these apps have been tested and work on the platform.

718
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Right.

719
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
So what would be the solution?

720
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,360
Say I'm running, say I want to switch over to elementary OS for a bit and I want to get

721
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,400
a telegram and Chrome and some of those things set up.

722
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,960
What would be my, what would be my best solution on elementary OS?

723
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,760
Our stance on, on sideloading outside apps, you know, not from the store is that you should

724
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,400
use flat pack or snap.

725
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,160
And because it's, you know, we were built on the same Ubuntu 16.04 base.

726
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,640
So snap works great.

727
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Flat packs works great.

728
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,700
It's the same stuff you're used to on other Linux systems.

729
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,800
So how do you install Chrome?

730
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,440
Me personally, I still grab the, the, the Deb.

731
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,440
Yeah.

732
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
And it's not a PPA.

733
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,440
It's a repository.

734
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,440
Yeah.

735
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
Yeah.

736
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,600
And they set all that up for you for future updates for your convenience.

737
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Yeah.

738
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
Okay.

739
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
I'm going to give it a go.

740
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
I think pretty soon.

741
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,440
I really liked the aesthetic of it and I think that App Center has got to, I got to check

742
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,440
that out.

743
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,440
There's some cool stuff.

744
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,560
There's some weird distribution to get that right.

745
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,480
Since before the software center was everything on Ubuntu and since maybe click and run.

746
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
Right.

747
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
Oh gosh.

748
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,480
Yeah.

749
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
I think it's since click and run.

750
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,480
I've been waiting for this to get done right.

751
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,480
So I'm really pleased to see this.

752
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Good work, Dan.

753
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
Thanks, man.

754
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
All right.

755
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,260
Was there anything else from the lug there before we move on to something kind of cool?

756
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
Something getting young people involved?

757
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,880
I have a quick question.

758
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,680
Go for it, Ben.

759
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,360
Can you use App to get on this distro or can you not?

760
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,420
Sure you can.

761
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:51,040
It's Ubuntu LTS on the, under the, underneath the.

762
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Okay.

763
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
I was just curious.

764
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
That's all I had to ask.

765
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Yeah.

766
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
You can go to town.

767
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
If you want to go that direction.

768
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
I don't know.

769
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
Yeah.

770
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Well, that's what I'm used to.

771
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
So if I did install it, that's what I would probably end up using personally.

772
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
That's just me.

773
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,880
So Wes, are you familiar with Google Coden?

774
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
I am not.

775
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:10,000
I wasn't really super familiar with it either, but it's been going on since 2010 and they've

776
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,080
had over 4,500 students from 99 countries involved in a contest.

777
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,240
Now it's for kids.

778
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,200
So maybe that's why you, you know, I didn't get it.

779
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,360
It's like the kid version of the summer of code.

780
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
Exactly.

781
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,360
Yeah.

782
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,200
So it's running, it's running right now until January 17th, 2008.

783
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,460
And I think they're still accepting submissions.

784
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:30,680
So I'm kind of putting this out there just in case anybody, anybody that's younger in

785
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,840
our audience might be interested in something like that.

786
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,920
Students choose the tasks that they wish to work on from the following categories, which

787
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:43,400
are coding, documentation, training, outreach, research, quality assurance, and user interface.

788
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,040
And students will earn prizes for a successful completion of tasks.

789
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:54,640
And one of the organizations that's participating in Google Coden this year is Ubuntu.

790
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,720
So this could be a great opportunity if you want to work with Python or JavaScript or

791
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,700
snap craft or work on the gnome desktop environment or UC or C++.

792
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,440
There are tasks that are available for people that want to do this.

793
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,600
And so you just subscribe, you get in there and then you can go look at the tasks that

794
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,680
Ubuntu has put up there.

795
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,240
And some of them are not even really to necessarily go directly into Ubuntu.

796
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,240
Like this one's just package and publish your first Node.js step.

797
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,040
Install the Ubuntu 1710 desktop.

798
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,360
I think that's pretty doable.

799
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,360
Translate Ubuntu components.

800
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,840
And there's some ones that would generally get a student involved in creating open source.

801
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,680
And this work goes upstream and Google's flipping the bill here for this.

802
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:35,680
That's great.

803
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Yeah.

804
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:42,040
So this is a Google Coden and it's going right now, November 28th through January 17th.

805
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,920
And I will link to the Ubuntu entry if you want to get involved there.

806
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,240
There's a few other organizations that are in there.

807
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,480
But this is pretty cool.

808
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,680
And it's a great chance to get some work on some legitimate open source software and have

809
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,200
Google behind the whole thing and orchestrating it all.

810
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,280
You know what I'd like to see?

811
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,140
They have this for the kids.

812
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,600
They have Summer of Code for the university students.

813
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:10,360
What about something just to connect people that have free time to projects?

814
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,360
Like a bug?

815
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,360
Well, there's bug bounties.

816
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,800
But yeah, there's nothing that's really taken off.

817
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
Yeah.

818
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Yeah.

819
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,680
Different projects have different solutions.

820
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,800
But like us, we need somebody to help us with our bots.

821
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,840
I think one of the benefits of things like Coden and Summer of Code is that there's a

822
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:30,440
central place to look at all these different projects that want all these different things

823
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,440
done.

824
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Yes, exactly.

825
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
That's the value.

826
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,240
There's like 500 organizations that are involved in Summer of Code now.

827
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,240
Yes.

828
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,040
You can just go to one place and go through whatever projects might interest you.

829
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
Organizations and projects.

830
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,800
And now, the Coden is kind of getting, it's not the same scale, but it's getting more

831
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
and more popular.

832
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,040
I mean, they've been going for a few years.

833
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Yeah.

834
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,040
Plus something like Summer of Code offers sometimes monetary incentives as well.

835
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Yeah.

836
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,840
I didn't look to see what the monetary incentives were for Coden, but they did say prices and

837
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
whatnot.

838
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,720
I imagine it gets a little different when you're...

839
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,160
So here's a, upon successful completion of tasks, eligible students can earn prizes.

840
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,120
Digital certificates, t-shirts, and hoodies, and grand prize winners will receive a trip

841
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,280
to Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California for themselves and a parent or

842
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,280
legal guardian for four nights in June of 2018.

843
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,000
Plus, that's pretty great.

844
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,480
You know, it probably could maybe be a stand in for some homework if it's involved with

845
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,480
school.

846
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
Well, imagine if you're like a high school student.

847
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,360
What a great addition to your resume.

848
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,600
Talk about getting some real, putting, you know, Ubuntu on there and working with Google.

849
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,720
Those are things that go on a resume.

850
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,880
That was, I think, the real value there.

851
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,520
Just one last quick Ubuntu little community news item.

852
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Just an update here.

853
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:43,080
If you're a fan of all-in-one boot CD that that project, you know, the Linux AIO, is

854
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,200
the ISO image that you download and it's like all of the versions of Debian or it's all

855
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,840
of the versions of Ubuntu.

856
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:57,120
So they just updated for Ubuntu 17.10 Linux AIO so you can grab one single ISO and get

857
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:06,440
Ubuntu Gnome, Ubuntu Budgie, Ubuntu LXDE, Ubuntu Mate, and proper Ubuntu, Kubuntu, all

858
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,920
in one ISO image.

859
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,320
And then you just choose.

860
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,760
I'm really glad those guys are still doing that.

861
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Yeah, 10.0 gone and dead.

862
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,280
I was involved with the project earlier on.

863
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,800
Yeah, I could, you know, you never know.

864
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,880
They could have gone the other way.

865
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,440
You could have, it could have faded away.

866
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
But now they've expanded.

867
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
They have Linux Mint now.

868
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
They have LMDE.

869
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,400
They have, so you can get different, you know, like, anyway, it's Debian Live, Fedora, and

870
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,440
then they have what they call secondary releases, which I didn't look at.

871
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,120
They also have Ubuntu, which you didn't mention.

872
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,440
Yeah, well, yeah, it's just all of the different Ubuntu's.

873
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,640
You can get LTS when they just did 17.10.

874
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,080
So it's like you can have, you can write, the reason why I mention it, if it's not obvious,

875
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:45,040
is you download this one ISO, you DD it to a thumb drive, and then you've got all of

876
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,960
the different versions of Debian or you've got all the different versions of Ubuntu

877
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,200
for that release.

878
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,320
Something I also noticed that is becoming somewhat of a rarity is that they still do

879
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
a 32-bit version.

880
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
Oh yeah, right.

881
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,320
Huh.

882
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
Hmm.

883
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,880
I wonder if that's true for all of the distros.

884
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
So yeah.

885
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,760
So there's a little update and then, go ahead.

886
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,560
Manjaro and our other Arch-based systems including Arch themselves have dropped 32-bit.

887
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:10,480
Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Gentoo eventually drops it too.

888
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
Yeah.

889
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Yeah.

890
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
Just, you know.

891
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Good news.

892
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,560
For those of you looking for a remote desktop solution and have been avoiding TeamViewer

893
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:20,720
forever like I have, maybe we can look at it again.

894
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,720
This could be really great news.

895
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,680
And they drop a little Wayland tidbit in here too.

896
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:30,160
TeamViewer 13 preview is out for Linux and it's no longer based on Wine.

897
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,680
Yay!

898
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,680
Is that right?

899
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Yeah.

900
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
That's big news, kind of.

901
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,680
Wow.

902
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,680
It is.

903
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,680
It is.

904
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,680
Native 64 bit.

905
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,680
Yep.

906
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,680
It's cute.

907
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,680
Be still my heart.

908
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,680
Yep.

909
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,560
They started by building a new back end for the host and then from there they built out

910
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:51,600
the front end, it's the front ends in Qt, and they say that we just decided at one point

911
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,360
when we started building the new host that we needed to start over due to technical limitations

912
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:01,720
of our Wine port and increasing user, they note here in their blog that more and more

913
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,320
users that are doing technical support are doing it from Linux hosts and that their Wine

914
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,860
version just wasn't up to the task anymore, which I think is, this is just terrific news

915
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:15,840
because it's another company saying customer demand is making us release this for Linux

916
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,800
and write a native version.

917
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,400
Hallelujah for that, right?

918
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,420
And they're writing one sort of TeamViewer and TeamViewer host common code base to make

919
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,420
it...

920
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,420
Oh, see, that's awesome.

921
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,420
It is.

922
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,560
That means we can probably rely on Linux support to continue.

923
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,560
Exactly.

924
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,880
And they say that they're going to continue iterating on it and that they're going to

925
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:38,160
continue to make it seamless to work with modern Linux desktop environments too.

926
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:44,680
Now, there is a big disclaimer, or as they say, a note on Wayland.

927
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:50,660
On Wayland currently, only outgoing remote control and incoming file transfer are supported.

928
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:56,400
If you need incoming remote control, you have to sign into classic Xorg.

929
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,200
This is a funny part of the blog too.

930
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,480
This is like really frank.

931
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,920
From a developer perspective, we'd be more than happy to leave the archaic X11 technology

932
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,440
stack behind and jump on the new and shiny Wayland train, however, it is not as simple

933
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,440
as it may seem.

934
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:14,960
Now, if you've been listening to this show for a while, you are very aware of this conundrum

935
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,000
that they're facing.

936
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,400
This is, who else but TeamViewer is going to get, I mean, like this company is going

937
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,520
to get screwed by this.

938
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,480
By design, Wayland does not provide an interface to do remote control.

939
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,160
We're talking screen capture, mouse and keyboard emulation.

940
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,160
It's not in there.

941
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,440
It's to keep Wayland core lean.

942
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:38,360
The idea is that the compositor provides these interfaces, which could mean that TeamViewer

943
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:45,040
would have to implement different interfaces for every desktop environment we want to support.

944
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,520
This is what I've been talking about and why having like a common API like Mir or something

945
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,120
in between there that can implement these feature sets could be extremely useful.

946
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:58,760
So they write, this is unfortunate, but even more unsatisfying that these interfaces are

947
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,300
not even available yet.

948
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:05,320
The closest to having something useful is Gnome, they're talking about PipeWire.

949
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:09,120
So it's likely that it will be the first desktop we can support in Wayland.

950
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:14,120
We want Wayland support as much as you, and we're working on it, but it's a bit complicated

951
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,040
than just make it work.

952
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,000
But they have a native cute version of TeamViewer.

953
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
It's in preview right now for Linux, 64-bit versions.

954
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,960
They have devs and RPMs available and no more wine.

955
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,960
I am so happy to hear all this.

956
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,440
Thank you, Lord.

957
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Okay.

958
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,080
As much as I want to be excited for them and that I understand their pain, I'm not feeling

959
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,680
bad for them having all this work.

960
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,680
With Wayland, you mean?

961
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,680
With Wayland support?

962
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,680
With Wayland, yes.

963
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,440
And I'm going to give you a reason.

964
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,320
TeamViewer as a company has actually to a member of the community requested payment

965
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,880
where he was not using for more than a month just because he didn't went to the panel and

966
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,640
cancel, but he actually canceled the actual payment.

967
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,120
So the member had to pay for an extra full year because the terms say that if you don't

968
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:07,800
cancel, it gets automatically renewed and you're due to pay even if you're not using

969
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,400
the service at all.

970
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,200
And there's proof of that because he didn't log in at all.

971
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Yeah.

972
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,720
I have my qualms there too.

973
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
Yeah.

974
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:24,200
But at that point, you're kind of giving crap to the development part of TeamViewer for

975
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,920
the billing department's issues.

976
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,720
Well, it's just that, you know, over the years-

977
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,480
It's the company's overall approach to a customer base.

978
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,920
Like if you were paying a customer and you treat it like this, I don't expect better

979
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,480
treatment because I'm an open source project.

980
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,320
And I am concerned about the Wayland developments for the open source alternatives, not for

981
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
TeamViewer in particular.

982
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,320
Yeah.

983
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,440
It's interesting that they're suffering and they're having to pay the bug.

984
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,800
Stooge, you had a take on this.

985
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:49,800
Go ahead.

986
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,200
Oh, I'm kind of reminded of your rant at Chrome last week.

987
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:00,000
Yay, we have more proprietary programs now we're a feature party with Windows.

988
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,800
Yeah.

989
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,560
This is one of those applications where I completely agree.

990
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,520
I'd like guacamole or some other remote desktop solution that just becomes the industry norm.

991
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:17,040
But having worked in IT for many a years, watching TeamViewer in production, I can say

992
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,880
it is, when you have it set up right, generally fairly bulletproof and easy for a basic user

993
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,840
to get set up and they can read a number to you and you can connect to that.

994
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:32,600
And it's very compelling from just a pragmatic remote support, get the job done.

995
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:37,720
I know I installed this TeamViewer host once and I know I'm going to be able to remote

996
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,460
support that user and IT shops have full dashboards with all their TeamViewers categorized by

997
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,460
different companies.

998
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,460
And I mean, I've really seen this thing produced at scale and it seemed like a pretty valuable

999
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,460
tool for them.

1000
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:52,120
So having support on Linux is definitely a good thing.

1001
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:56,840
But I do feel like for most of us that aren't working in corporate IT or doing IT support

1002
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,360
for large groups of people, it'd be nice to have something that's just 100% free and open

1003
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,720
but offers similar functionality.

1004
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,720
Yeah.

1005
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
I've never used TeamViewer.

1006
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,720
I probably won't.

1007
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,720
Yeah.

1008
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,720
Google Chrome just works.

1009
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,760
I mean, Google remote desktop, you really want something that just gets inserted and

1010
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:11,760
works.

1011
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:12,920
I've used a little bit.

1012
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:19,440
On the flip side, there is something to be said for not having to punch something in

1013
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,040
your firewall even as an individual user and then on top of that, somehow still getting

1014
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,560
like insanely awesome performance.

1015
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,560
Yeah.

1016
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,080
I mean, you and I have used it, both of us, when we're remote and we need to get something

1017
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:33,360
out production wise, you and I, TeamViewer was the one that ended up just working for

1018
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:38,480
us when like we're moving desktop environments or we're switching different distros.

1019
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,620
TeamViewer was the one we could just kind of hit the button and it did work.

1020
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,880
When I was in Long Beach, I edited and released user error over TeamViewer.

1021
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,880
Nice.

1022
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,880
Okay.

1023
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,880
Go ahead.

1024
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:55,600
I have been using TeamViewer forever to help my family out and it always seems to work.

1025
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,600
Yeah.

1026
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,600
It is a good one for that too.

1027
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,320
And there was a time that it worked for the people who just could break the pin codes

1028
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
too.

1029
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,320
Remember that time?

1030
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,320
Yes.

1031
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
Yes.

1032
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,320
So this is just a preview.

1033
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,960
It's still early days, but the rewriting with the user interface in Qt, I think it's a good

1034
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,960
move.

1035
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,960
We'll keep an eye on it.

1036
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,400
We'll probably end up trying it out here.

1037
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,200
I'd like to pick Noah's brain about it too because I know he's been a big TeamViewer

1038
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,200
fan in the past.

1039
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,200
He's moved to other things.

1040
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,200
Yeah.

1041
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,200
Symbol help.

1042
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,200
Yeah.

1043
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:23,200
But I'd still like to talk to him about it as well.

1044
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:26,760
And then one last note, just community news-wise for folks that are big fans of VLC, some

1045
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,560
great news.

1046
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,720
The European Parliament has approved a budget to essentially allocate funds for bug bounties

1047
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,400
around VLC and they're doing it through the HackerOne project, which I am a huge fan of.

1048
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,440
I've been covering that since TechSnap days and I just think it's a great way for companies

1049
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:52,040
to get one central arbiter to act as sort of escrow and arbiter between the company

1050
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,480
and the people that have made disclosures about vulnerabilities that they've discovered.

1051
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,960
That's sort of the role that HackerOne can play.

1052
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:57,960
Make it easy on both sides.

1053
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,480
And it's a directory of this is what we are looking for, this is what our bounties are.

1054
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,720
It's sort of one centralized location like we were talking about earlier for other things.

1055
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,260
And the European Parliament is, I don't know exactly how much money in total, but we do

1056
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,040
have an idea in terms of bounties.

1057
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,360
And so looking at this, they're looking for all kinds of different issues.

1058
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,800
I'm assuming they must use VLC.

1059
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:26,200
And the nice thing is the core developer of VLC is one of these guys who has been approached

1060
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:32,840
several times with very lucrative offers to install advertising into VLC and he's declined

1061
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,600
it every single time.

1062
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,240
So I love to see...

1063
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,420
This is a great use of public funds in my personal opinion.

1064
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:45,400
So they don't have really huge, huge, huge bounties.

1065
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,240
But again, you're doing open source development here, so you're getting some money.

1066
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,420
In fact, the top bounty isn't even worth a single Bitcoin.

1067
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:59,440
It's only $2,000 for critical, 750 for high, 300 for medium, and 100 for low is what you

1068
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:00,440
get.

1069
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,040
And these are all based on like the CVSS score.

1070
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:06,540
So if you find something that's like a 7.0, you get 750 bucks, which would be like code

1071
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,760
execution without user intervention.

1072
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,960
And then if you get remote code execution, you get $2,000.

1073
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:14,720
These are all in US.

1074
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:15,720
It's interesting.

1075
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:21,360
I've never really thought of VLC as being like an attack vector for a system.

1076
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,800
What if we could like...

1077
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,680
What if we knew about a vulnerability when somebody connected to our RTMP stream?

1078
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,680
We could do like some sort of buffer overflow with our stream and get access to their box

1079
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,680
through VLC.

1080
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,680
Yeah.

1081
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,040
That would be a pretty amazing hack.

1082
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:33,040
We should do this.

1083
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,040
This would be a good revenue source for Jupiter broadcasting.

1084
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,040
We can use it to mine Bitcoins.

1085
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,040
Yeah.

1086
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:39,880
We'll start remote Bitcoin miners on people's machines.

1087
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,240
So yeah.

1088
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,240
That's that HackerOne.

1089
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,680
You can go to hackerone.com.vlc if you want to read the details on that.

1090
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,680
I think that's great.

1091
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,880
I'd like to see the US government get in that.

1092
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:55,120
Because the truth is this situation sucks as bad as it does because these governments

1093
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,640
are buying up zero-day exploits on the black market to stockpile.

1094
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,560
And they're giving them an extremely high value, which is driving people to break software

1095
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,720
at a rate we've never seen before.

1096
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:09,600
So it's about damn time they use some of that money to also pay for public bounties too.

1097
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,600
Yeah.

1098
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,600
Right?

1099
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:12,600
And it helps.

1100
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,600
You may not use VLC personally.

1101
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,840
There may be media players that you prefer.

1102
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:20,080
But it's part of this open ecosystem of there is a free and open source video player you

1103
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,720
can use that will probably meet your needs.

1104
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,000
And it's nice to see that reflected in the comments.

1105
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
I agree, Wes.

1106
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:31,240
So hey, while we're over in the Gen 2 corner, let's check in and let's go over to the corner.

1107
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,240
How is the build going?

1108
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,240
How's the kernel?

1109
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,240
What are you doing right now?

1110
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,240
Oh, it's compiling.

1111
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,240
Oh, is it?

1112
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:37,240
Oh, yeah.

1113
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,240
So you've selected your options.

1114
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,240
I've selected my options.

1115
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,240
Anything interesting and noteworthy?

1116
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,240
Well, I made sure to choose ButterFS support.

1117
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,240
Did you?

1118
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,240
Just for you.

1119
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,240
Did you really?

1120
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,240
You're going to spend time building ButterFS support?

1121
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,240
No, of course not.

1122
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,240
Oh, that's funny.

1123
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,240
I did throw XFS.

1124
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,240
Oh, good man.

1125
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,240
That's worth building.

1126
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,240
Yeah.

1127
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,240
I wanted to make you smile.

1128
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,240
So you're off to the races over there.

1129
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,240
Yeah.

1130
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:55,240
You'll probably be building for almost the rest of the show.

1131
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,000
Well, that's good, because coming up here in a second, I'm going to play some clips

1132
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:06,640
of Andreas Andonopoulos, who is, I think, one of the best thinkers and speakers on Bitcoin.

1133
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:10,720
If you're a Bitcoin skeptic, and I've been hearing from some of you, stay tuned, because

1134
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,120
we're going to get the Bitcoin out of our systems.

1135
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,880
We're going to talk about it, and then we're just going to move on for a while.

1136
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,120
But it is an open source issue.

1137
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,560
It's not even like a Beanie Babies kind of tulips.

1138
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,800
It is an open source issue.

1139
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:25,800
And I want to talk about that.

1140
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,760
So first, let's talk about DigitalOcean.

1141
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,440
Oh, DigitalOcean.com, you go over there, you create an account.

1142
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,720
Once your account's set up, you use the promo code DOUNPLUGED.

1143
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,720
It's magic.

1144
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,720
Then you get a $10 credit.

1145
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:39,980
And the next thing you know, you're spinning about infrastructure in less than 55 seconds.

1146
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,200
Everything is SSD powered.

1147
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,840
They're all SSDs.

1148
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:47,080
They have a gorgeous, simple, elegant interface to manage all of it.

1149
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,200
And it's not simple like in like the per her dumb way.

1150
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,940
It's simple in, of course, it should work like this, which is the sweet spot.

1151
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,960
They have all kinds of storage options from built in storage to your droplets, object

1152
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:03,000
storage, which is simple object storage, block storage, which is one of the easiest ways

1153
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,840
to go because it just shows up as a dev SD device.

1154
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,400
And they have monitoring and alerting that collects metrics.

1155
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,080
And you can receive alerts when things go down.

1156
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,020
Load balancing is a service that are fully managed out of the box and distribute incoming

1157
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:21,280
traffic and 40 gigabit connections into the hypervisors with data centers all over the

1158
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,280
world.

1159
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,840
And they have a lot of information.com, go spin up a Linux rig of your choosing.

1160
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,440
They got a bunch of distros to choose from.

1161
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:32,280
Use the promo code do unplugged and apply some of that to a future project.

1162
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,620
And amazingly, you can use that on BSD.

1163
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:36,240
You could, you could, you really could.

1164
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,160
You could go all in or you could do, I've been doing a lot of LTS for like even just

1165
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,160
like a half hour.

1166
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,880
I'll spin something up, try it out and be like, and just destroy it.

1167
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,880
Why would you do that, Chris?

1168
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,880
You got Portsons EFS.

1169
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,880
You don't need none of that stuff.

1170
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,080
You know, the other thing too is like when I'm doing this, like I start working, I'm

1171
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,920
like, Oh, this is something I'm keeping around.

1172
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,240
It takes like two seconds to set up the DNS.

1173
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,140
It's really easy.

1174
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,840
And then you can also attach your SSH key.

1175
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,920
So you don't have to like even like mess around with like changing passwords after the machine

1176
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:03,920
spun up.

1177
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:04,920
It's just, it's aces.

1178
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:10,400
I like the portability of storage between different droplets.

1179
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:16,080
DigitalOcean.com use our promo code do unplugged and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

1180
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:17,480
the unplugged program.

1181
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:23,440
Now let's talk a little about Bitcoin here and Andreas Antonopoulos was on the Kevin

1182
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,840
Rose show, which apparently is a thing.

1183
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:25,840
Didn't even really know this.

1184
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,840
Is that right?

1185
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,840
Yeah.

1186
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:28,840
Okay.

1187
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,840
From the Ashes of Dig.

1188
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,840
I am.

1189
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,840
Yeah.

1190
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
I'm a big fan of Andreas and I've read some of his books.

1191
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
I'm going to recommend them to you right now.

1192
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,680
Mastering Bitcoin, The Internet of Money and his one that hasn't been released yet, but

1193
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,360
I think it's going to be the one I read, Mastering Ethereum, which we'll talk more about at some

1194
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,720
point in the future.

1195
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,440
And there's several issues that I want to talk about today on the show that I think

1196
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,680
probably apply the most to Linux users.

1197
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:57,280
And it's the idea of closed services, centralized services versus distributed services, open

1198
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,180
protocols and community efforts.

1199
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:04,480
And it's in this context, I think it's where we could start talking about Bitcoin versus

1200
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,120
things like PayPal or other payment services.

1201
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,560
There's lots of payment services now.

1202
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,520
Everybody's got a payment service it seems like.

1203
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,560
So what's the difference between being able to send money with Bitcoin and be able to

1204
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:21,320
use these payment services that actually use like your local currency?

1205
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:26,560
And it's sort of the same difference between Linux and a commercial operating system.

1206
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,440
PayPal, Venmo, they're services.

1207
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,480
Bitcoin is a protocol and there's a very big difference between those two.

1208
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,760
Bitcoin is a protocol that allows you to do trusted transactions with people you don't

1209
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:44,800
trust and to independently verify the authority of those transactions without trusting anybody

1210
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,800
else.

1211
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,920
And that's really the magic behind it.

1212
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,880
By turning money and other trusted transactions into an internet protocol, it opens the door

1213
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,120
for all of the internet related goodies to happen.

1214
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:01,600
When you're talking about Bitcoin, you can't really talk about Bitcoin without talking

1215
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:07,160
about the technology of the blockchain, which is sort of that trust guarantee system.

1216
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:12,980
And I think that's one of the unique aspects of Bitcoin that you can't really rely on PayPal,

1217
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:16,800
you can't really rely on your bank and these two organizations have to be competing with

1218
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,800
each other.

1219
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,440
They don't even necessarily trust themselves and the entire relationship is awkward for

1220
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,440
the customer.

1221
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,760
All of that goes away with a public ledger.

1222
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,920
So that is one of the true core values of Bitcoin outside of the currency that you can

1223
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,680
spend itself.

1224
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,080
But I know one of the other things people are getting confused about these days and

1225
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,920
it is really confusing is all of these other currencies.

1226
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,960
There's tons of other crypto currencies.

1227
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,960
Back during Plan B, there was a couple, you know, you had Dogecoin, you had Litecoin.

1228
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:44,960
Now there's...

1229
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,960
It was simple, clean, easy world.

1230
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:52,880
Now from that has emerged great complexity and there's many crypto currencies.

1231
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,240
And this is something that people often point to and say, well, obviously Bitcoin is going

1232
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,620
to fall apart and disappear one day because there's all these other crypto currencies

1233
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:04,000
out there and it's just a mess.

1234
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,200
Well, what does that sound like?

1235
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,200
Money.

1236
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,200
Yeah, it does.

1237
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,080
And it sounds like there's a lot of Linux distributions out there.

1238
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,380
There's all these different Linux distributions out there.

1239
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,760
There are thousands of Linux distributions out there.

1240
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,640
How will you ever be able to pick?

1241
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:23,080
But just because there's thousands of Linux distributions doesn't mean that people don't

1242
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,320
install CentOS or Ubuntu.

1243
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,960
So you have to think about these as niche products.

1244
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,760
I think there are a lot of promising things happening across the entire ecosystem and

1245
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:37,440
I think part of the adaptation that we're having to go through is this idea that we've

1246
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:43,600
grown up having monopoly currencies that are national flag currencies that exist in a zero

1247
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:49,520
sum geopolitical chess game where one only wins if it beats the other and all of that

1248
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:50,520
attitude.

1249
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:56,080
Very much like in the past we used to have five national newspapers, they existed in

1250
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,400
direct competition, the space was limited, the market share was fixed.

1251
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,320
And then bloggers happened.

1252
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,280
And then you have to ask, well, how many bloggers can possibly exist?

1253
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:13,080
And the answer is all of us and it doesn't diminish or change the value of mainstream

1254
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:17,200
news if they had value in the first place, if they retained value in the first place.

1255
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,480
And it doesn't mean that all of them are good.

1256
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:22,800
Most of them are not, but some of them are great.

1257
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,320
And so the same thing has now happened with currencies.

1258
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:30,480
We have to get used to a world in which there are now thousands of currencies, there will

1259
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:37,240
be tens of thousands, then hundreds of thousands, then millions, and then billions of digital

1260
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:43,720
currencies that can be created and destroyed in moments that can be created by anyone for

1261
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:52,480
reasons as silly as a loyalty currency that's created by Joey the five-year-old in order

1262
00:55:52,480 --> 00:56:00,480
to socially engage with their primary school friends versus a global reserve currency that

1263
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,680
China is using to buy oil.

1264
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:04,320
Both of those are digital currencies.

1265
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,240
Both exist on the same spectrum of continuum, have nothing to do with each other.

1266
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:12,760
Once you get comfortable with that idea, you start realizing that all of these currencies

1267
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:18,560
effectively are now playing an evolutionary game where as programmable currencies they

1268
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:23,520
fit into specific niches and they compete for those niches.

1269
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:25,760
And some are successful and some are not.

1270
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,860
And they emerge to occupy new niches.

1271
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:34,800
And they may be designed to do one thing and then somehow the market twists them into doing

1272
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,240
something else, et cetera, et cetera.

1273
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,520
Now one of the things I think that is hard for people in the States in particular, I

1274
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:46,240
think people outside the States maybe don't suffer this problem as much, but in the US

1275
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:49,840
a lot of people, a lot of the people that don't get Bitcoin at all, they don't get the

1276
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:55,120
value of it because they have the benefit of using the US dollar, which happens to be

1277
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,960
the world reserve currency.

1278
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,980
It happens to be very well established, very good value.

1279
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:06,120
So Bitcoin doesn't really have as much of a, there's not as much of a need, there's

1280
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,440
not as much of a market demand here.

1281
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,040
But we've all heard of countries like Zimbabwe and other places where currencies are going

1282
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,920
like crazy or countries where they're using it to control the citizens in a very oppressive

1283
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:23,480
way that are outside the US, you start seeing where a worldwide accepted internet based

1284
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:26,200
currency could be extremely useful.

1285
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:31,160
But there are uses even in the West, even though our governments are fairly stable and

1286
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:36,440
our currencies are accepted for paying taxes and we're all pretty happy with this arrangement.

1287
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:42,960
Think about how open source software development brought an entirely new level of transparency

1288
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:48,060
to the software development process and there's aspects of it we still suffer from today.

1289
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:52,440
Like when Linus yells at somebody, we go, oh my gosh, somebody said something hostile

1290
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:58,320
in the workplace, as if that doesn't happen at every major company like HP and Dell and

1291
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:03,260
Apple and Amazon, as if there aren't tyrants in all of those companies that are the iron

1292
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:07,240
hand that actually get the project done, but we don't see it.

1293
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,800
Open source development brought a level of transparency to software development that

1294
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,220
we'd never seen before.

1295
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:18,120
In fact, it would make companies like Microsoft back in the 80s extremely uncomfortable and

1296
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:24,480
Bill Gates famously penned a letter to a computer society just talking about all of the downsides

1297
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,580
of free and shareware and open source software.

1298
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:32,080
It was a big warning piece because this would expose the way software was developed and

1299
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,040
it did and it has.

1300
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,880
The development history is in the public.

1301
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,960
We can review it.

1302
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,320
The mailing lists are in the public.

1303
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:44,380
That kind of transparency fundamentally changed software development, just like open source

1304
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:49,620
money and a public blockchain with a public ledger can fundamentally change money and

1305
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:53,800
fundamentally change trust and think about it in the context of charities.

1306
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:59,680
Part of the difficulty we have in the area of charity is that a lot of the need is in

1307
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,640
places far away across borders.

1308
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:07,420
A lot of the resources is on the other side of these borders and getting the money across

1309
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:13,320
the borders and distributed to people without 99% of it disappearing in the cracks is a

1310
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,880
big problem with charities.

1311
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:21,960
So there's a favorite charity of mine called BitGive that's doing, it's a Bitcoin foundation,

1312
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:30,400
it's a Bitcoin charity that is a charitable foundation and it uses this technology to

1313
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,240
re-envision how charity can be done and they have a project called Giftrack and what this

1314
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:40,280
allows you to do is watch on the blockchain and track the money you sent in all the way

1315
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:46,000
down to the money that got spent to buy the bricks to build the well for the water project

1316
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,920
in Kenya and so you can actually see all of the flows of money.

1317
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:53,420
It's not an accounting report that's sent to you.

1318
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:59,200
Every single contributor to the charity can in real time and without asking anyone audit

1319
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:05,680
the charity online and just looking at the blockchain track all of the information.

1320
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:09,760
That seems really like a very compelling use and you could, charity is one example I think

1321
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,640
we could all sort of wrap our heads around but there's so many others.

1322
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,400
I mean what about public broadcasting?

1323
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,040
Think about that for a second.

1324
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:21,760
It's just real or open source development where you could see exactly how the Gnome

1325
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:28,000
foundation spent every single mil a bit down to like you know the the forks if you wanted

1326
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:32,800
to which would just totally change transparency and you know the trust level that end users

1327
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:37,600
would have by giving and you could stand out as a brand if you participated in that level

1328
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:41,160
of transparency and cryptocurrency isn't just Bitcoin.

1329
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:47,680
It's all and you can have all these other crazy currencies but this concept, cryptographically

1330
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:52,680
verified transactions with a public ledger, it's already a huge source of application

1331
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,680
development.

1332
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,320
There's a lot of different stuff come out companies like Bank of America, IBM, the Linux

1333
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,320
Foundation.

1334
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:02,160
I was about to say we've talked about the Linux Foundation's hyper ledger several times.

1335
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:07,560
Yep they're all working on like their hyper ledger there which is a blockchain based technology.

1336
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,300
Cryptocurrencies are here to stay forever.

1337
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:11,360
There is no putting this genie back in the box.

1338
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:18,560
This idea of a network based open and decentralized currency and all of the other applications

1339
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:20,900
that happen, that has happened.

1340
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:26,120
The recipe was created, it's repeatable, it can be recreated as many times as needed until

1341
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:27,480
it succeeds.

1342
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:33,600
If it has flaws those flaws can be fixed in various evolutionary iterations, some continuous

1343
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,240
some discontinuous and disruptive.

1344
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,720
The bottom line is the world needs that.

1345
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:44,800
The world needs an open public neutral economy that's not you know being kicked around because

1346
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:49,200
of geopolitics or used as a tool for surveillance and control.

1347
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:54,400
That is needed and it's needed so much that I have no doubt in my mind that it will be

1348
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:00,200
wildly successful and it will completely transform the way we do commerce in the next 20 years

1349
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,200
absolutely.

1350
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:08,320
And it's going to transform in ways we can't even expect and that thing will underpin trillions

1351
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:13,120
of dollars of economic activity whether it's Bitcoin and we still call it that I don't

1352
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,120
know.

1353
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,800
I know that such a thing will exist there's no going away from that.

1354
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,360
You know I think I agree I don't know if it's Bitcoin either.

1355
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:25,280
You know in a year Bitcoin could be could totally crash or it could be worth a hundred

1356
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:26,280
thousand dollars.

1357
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:29,960
And I think what you were talking you know like it really is the 1990s in the Linux world

1358
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:34,160
in the in the public ledger world there's a lot more that we haven't yet seen.

1359
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,220
Ethereum is still pretty niche like there's just there's a lot of potential application.

1360
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:43,320
If you're going to be stuck in a cash controlled society then if that's going to be the real

1361
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:48,120
master that we all are obeying then why not have it be something that's open source that's

1362
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:52,760
publicly trackable that's cryptographically verified that's detached from the state.

1363
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:57,880
So we've you know you always hear about the divorce of church and state the separation

1364
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,080
of church and state.

1365
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:02,240
Well how about the separation of state and money.

1366
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:07,480
That's what that's what cryptocurrency represents is money and state becoming separated.

1367
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,040
And even I mean all the actors that are involved right because like right now it's really just

1368
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:15,600
a good old boys network of places that are deemed on the trustworthy list that get with

1369
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:20,160
algorithms that we never see that get to handle how these digits and accounts work.

1370
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,080
And if you if you follow the unfiltered show there's been lots of manipulating of things

1371
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:27,080
of like light all and or whatever it's called the yeah.

1372
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:33,560
So anyways I haven't I have a bunch of additional resources in the show notes including the

1373
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:38,320
link to the Kevin Rose show that has the entire interview with Andreas it's it's it's it's

1374
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:39,320
good.

1375
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:42,120
Kevin Rose is a really good speaker and he's really good.

1376
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,440
He's thought a lot about this and it's episode 16 of the Kevin Rose show.

1377
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,080
I got a link in the show notes if you want to catch that it's a it's pretty good because

1378
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:52,840
Kevin's a Bitcoin investor himself so he's got a lot of questions like what about quantum

1379
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,560
computing is that going to screw up Bitcoin.

1380
01:03:55,560 --> 01:04:00,700
And Andreas answers that also have links to a couple of the wallets that go on your phone

1381
01:04:00,700 --> 01:04:06,240
that he likes the best that bit give foundation that he mentioned and a link that was provided

1382
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,240
in our discord.

1383
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,240
That is so cool.

1384
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:13,320
There is a command line utility that you throw on your good news slash Linux box and it's

1385
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:18,640
called Coinmon and it spits out after you install it's like if you have MPM it's MPM

1386
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:24,400
install dash G coinmon and then you run coinmon and you could tell what currencies you want

1387
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:29,240
what not and you get look at that screen there with you get this you get this like like there's

1388
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:34,240
a dump of BTC value and the theory of all the different coins and it's a you know me

1389
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,960
I love a nice sort of anchors style it's not actually it's all ASCII.

1390
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,160
But I just love that in a terminal especially when you can put it in like a quake drop down

1391
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,960
exactly just your nerd fix right there.

1392
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,960
That's coinmon we'll have a link in the show notes just a great way to track different

1393
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,280
crypto currencies.

1394
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:55,120
You know we just we just kind of had to get out of our system I feel like because people

1395
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:59,280
been asking when it gets when it gets to these new price milestones more and more people

1396
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,080
either come out as skeptics or more and more people come out as interested all of a sudden.

1397
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:08,960
But I really do think it's a Linux you I think more than say your average tech enthusiast.

1398
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:14,320
I think Linux users should be more keen to recognize the values of something this important

1399
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,320
being open source.

1400
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:21,080
It's an old open culture sort of from the aspect of even aside from the technology aspect.

1401
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,640
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

1402
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,320
Daredevil wants to jump in I think on it.

1403
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:27,200
So before we wrap up on the Bitcoin topic Daredevil and you want to do a shoot.

1404
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,200
Go ahead.

1405
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:32,960
Yeah I actually see a couple of issues with these existing everybody that is optimistic

1406
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:35,720
and especially people that are invested want to see it succeed.

1407
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:40,520
I understand that perfectly sure I understand the value of having the transparency which

1408
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,520
is great.

1409
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,720
But there is the other point of now certain governments like Venezuela's government that

1410
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:50,680
is actually issuing their own currency Russia that is issuing their own currency cryptocurrency.

1411
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:56,200
The idea is that then they are able to avoid sanctions so you lose a little bit of the

1412
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,960
equilibrium that exists politically and you might think that that's not important but

1413
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:04,000
I personally actually believe that there is actually great importance right there as if

1414
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:10,320
it wasn't for the new strategies of war really putting in words as they are the political

1415
01:06:10,320 --> 01:06:16,860
spectrum sanctions being a form of not actually investing in physical aggression you start

1416
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:22,560
actually having again a lose of an ability that you currently have.

1417
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:25,840
What is the difference between honestly I'm asking what would be the difference between

1418
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:32,560
that or them choosing you know another currency that's not Bitcoin that's like it's gold.

1419
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:36,720
So it's not so much that is Bitcoin they're using they're actually created right.

1420
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:42,400
The purpose here for me and that I feel is this will lead to another imminent problem

1421
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,560
but don't you feel like that would be the same if they use any other currency like even

1422
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,800
if it wasn't crypto.

1423
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,520
No I don't think actually no because so when it's not crypto because there is an actual

1424
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,840
institution behind it you actually when people talk about the PayPal being a service and

1425
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,240
Bitcoin is a protocol not quite.

1426
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:02,000
There's actually an international service how trade needs to work.

1427
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,120
You actually have to set up other countries have to believe that they can actually buy

1428
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:10,040
and have some balance on your currency so they can actually trade with you.

1429
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,120
It's actually a protocol.

1430
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:14,640
Now they put a name to it and then there's an institution in the government they can

1431
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,560
look and say it's your fault you did it wrong.

1432
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:22,160
So the argument though the core of the argument is that if they go to an uncontrollable currency

1433
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:29,560
that doesn't have an organization behind it then other governments lose levers of negotiation.

1434
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,320
Yes and not so much not only that actually there's actually another piece a little bit

1435
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:39,760
which makes it worse is we're moving towards a spectrum and a state that governments will

1436
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,720
want to actually be regulating Bitcoin.

1437
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:48,920
They have the actual capacity to be having the majority of the servers just so you guys

1438
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:53,840
know and I'm not sure if you've been looking actually the current Bitcoin economy economy

1439
01:07:53,840 --> 01:08:00,400
only Bitcoin already spends more than 21 European countries in electricity bill.

1440
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,400
Yeah I've heard that.

1441
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,580
I don't I don't buy it either and not combined.

1442
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:08,700
It's not combined but if you look at individual European nations are small so it is very likely

1443
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:12,660
impossible that that can happen but in order to get that that's a rabbit hole I don't we

1444
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:16,000
address that on Linux action news a few weeks ago so I'll just I'll refer people to that

1445
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:22,000
but so just to just so you see I guess where I'm coming from here is I totally follow your

1446
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:28,920
point that if Russia goes off and creates you know the Moscow coin and now the Russian

1447
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:35,640
economy is doing sales with other large economies using the Moscow coin I do I do grok that

1448
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:40,920
then the US and the West in general lose a hammer that they can hit Putin over the head

1449
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:45,760
with but at the same time that feels almost similar to the argument of well if you open

1450
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:49,240
source the software and give it away then these huge corporations are going to go out

1451
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:53,080
of business and there's lots of jobs they're going to be not at all I'm not going on that

1452
01:08:53,080 --> 01:08:59,020
route what I'm going is there is a lot of things that are tied to the fact that there's

1453
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:03,940
actual power structure and money is what governs this power structure yeah what we're moving

1454
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:09,640
away is the power structure for us as people that have been enjoying democracy it is fantastic

1455
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:14,700
that we can get these extra further control of our lives it's awesome and it feels great

1456
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:20,500
as a principle the problem I see is the other power plays that we actually don't have to

1457
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:25,920
deal on a daily basis that we are totally dependent on but we don't realize in an every

1458
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,580
that's a hard sell that's a pretty hard sell to get people to care about that I mean because

1459
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:33,680
you're essentially you're also at the same time advocating for the for the ability for

1460
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:38,860
some nations to abuse that lever which likely happens more than it gets used correctly try

1461
01:09:38,860 --> 01:09:43,880
really hard to not be hypocritical when in the way I live my life and that requires that

1462
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,680
I acknowledge what the advantage you're right there is an advantage there it's a fair point

1463
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:52,640
it seems like a lot like oh sorry I mean advantage in in the terms of you know as Trump would

1464
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,840
see it that's an advantage for Donald Trump or Rex Tillerson at the State Department is

1465
01:09:56,840 --> 01:10:01,180
not necessarily advantage for Chris the podcaster well you also get other than the benefits

1466
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:05,800
I guess I receive remotely at us as a citizen of a nation that is using those levers to

1467
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:10,660
make life better I would say to I would wrap I would wrap this segment with this thought

1468
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:15,760
is we are at the really early stages and it's weird because the value is trying to get to

1469
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:19,740
the point where it feels like it's bigger than it's it's like it's bigger than it fits

1470
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:25,820
in its own boots right now exactly and I think we're gonna see probably I don't know 20 years

1471
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:30,440
of iteration and that's where all these different cryptocurrencies will sort of battle it out

1472
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:34,740
and again to make a comparison just like we see a bunch of different open source forks

1473
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:39,720
and projects sort of battle it out over years and sometimes it looks like a waste of resources

1474
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:46,040
or a deferral of resources but over time usually projects emerge as the dominant player in

1475
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:50,880
that particular vertical if you will right and it's I think we're gonna see that same

1476
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,880
thing happen with cryptocurrency I think I mean to summarize both you and daredevil

1477
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:59,720
its points it's this is early days there's a lot of effects both positive and negative

1478
01:10:59,720 --> 01:11:04,400
so it's just we should be paying attention proceed responsibly yeah and there we go yeah

1479
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:09,720
and also consider that any of this stuff could be replaced by something superior because

1480
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:13,780
it's a technical thing right so you can actually have something even more innovative come along

1481
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:18,200
one day in theory yeah so it's a it's a totally different beast that people are now actually

1482
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:23,160
putting real money into and overall it is going to make like international monetary

1483
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:28,440
stuff more transparent because like if foreign governments implement something on a blockchain

1484
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:34,480
well you can now track the the movement of money through foreign governments on a public

1485
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:38,720
way boy it'd be really inconvenient to have like isis on the blockchain that would that

1486
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:42,280
would be really inconvenient track that let's go let's move on now and get ready for the

1487
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,640
gentoo challenge so everybody get ready that wants to check in uh we're gonna we're gonna

1488
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:48,520
follow up on the gentoo challenge here in just a moment yeah you feeling good over there

1489
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,680
yeah yeah oh very good all right well before we go to the gentoo corner i'll mention ting

1490
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:56,880
real quick here go to linux.ting.com go check it out this is the perfect time to pick up

1491
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:01,600
a ting sim for about nine dollars seven dollars depends on the sale they have going you can

1492
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,800
even get it off of amazon prime you can get a ting sim you pop that in a device and when

1493
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:12,640
you're ready it's pay for what you use wireless service your minutes your messages and your

1494
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:17,120
megabytes whatever you use that's what you pay my friends it's that simple it's just

1495
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:21,220
six dollars for your line and then you got the uncle sam cut in there for your particular

1496
01:12:21,220 --> 01:12:25,320
region and then it's just your minutes and your messages and your megabytes with no contract

1497
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:31,000
nationwide coverage you pay for what you use and they have a cdma and a gsm network to

1498
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,240
choose from which gives you the option to pick up whatever might be better in your area

1499
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:39,160
like i did a little speed test here and i think on average i get about i get about 21

1500
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:43,220
megabits on gsm here at the studio which is a little bit better than i got on the cdma

1501
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:48,240
so for the most part i i use gsm now and it's wonderful when i travel to have those different

1502
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:52,080
options they have a dashboard that makes it easy to use you can see your usage at a glance

1503
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:57,040
have complete control set up usage alerts if you want to buy a device directly from

1504
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,440
ting you can do that too you don't have to buy the sim card if you want you can just

1505
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:04,080
buy a device directly it's a really easy process to bring a phone over though and i recommend

1506
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,940
that because if you bring a phone you get 25 in service credit and that'll probably

1507
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:11,920
pay for more than your first month average ting bills 23 a month per line the compatibility

1508
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,840
is pretty crazy especially with both networks like of all the people i've switched to i

1509
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:18,760
don't think any of them wasn't able to bring your phone it was just like they have a real

1510
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:22,120
easy pyod page too that makes it super easy to look it up is this going to work or not

1511
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:25,560
um so yes go to linux.ting.com because if you want to get a device if you just want

1512
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:29,680
to hit the easy button and buy one directly from them they'll take 25 off the device too

1513
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:33,540
you deserve it a new shiny christmas present i mean come on yeah really yeah give it out

1514
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:36,840
to somebody in their stocking they can put in a device they have sitting around all of

1515
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,560
a sudden they have great use at a device they just pay for what they use with it and it's

1516
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,840
a stepping stone from there you go geez ting's great then you get another device and it's

1517
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:48,760
only six dollars for each line so it's easy to go from there and they'll love it you can

1518
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:55,900
get it for yourself too i suppose linux.ting.com linux.ting.com all right so let's go over

1519
01:13:55,900 --> 01:14:01,280
into the gen 2 corner here how is your build going over there mr wes oh we've got a kernel

1520
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:06,160
do you oh yeah i'm impressed so i think that's a pretty good way to end it uh now we just

1521
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:10,640
need to do a little more configuration yeah bootloader fs tab a few couple other niceties

1522
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:15,800
to have hostname you know those things yeah i think next episode will be booted and ready

1523
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:20,080
to go i am impressed i am glad to see that's going well so are you ready for the reveal

1524
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,680
then on the desktop environment that people want you to build yeah i'm excited should

1525
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:26,840
we take guesses yeah all right i mean do you remember do you remember which ones we asked

1526
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:32,280
about we asked about three enlightenment uh sway and lumina you are correct those are

1527
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:38,200
the ones do you have a guess as to how it's gone knowing our audience they probably chose

1528
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:44,240
the most boring one sway why is that the most boring one i think that's the most exciting

1529
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:51,240
one it's boring yeah 48 of the audience voted for sway lumina desktop came in at deuce and

1530
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:55,360
then enlightenment uh with 25 of the votes actually really close to lumina oh wow see

1531
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:58,960
but the thing about sway is that it's a wayland compositor and dropping a replacement for

1532
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,640
i3 so you got the i3 lovers and you got the wayland lovers they're all going to come together

1533
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,440
behind sway and it just seems to make sense to me yeah but you don't get like the esoteric

1534
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:12,640
ness of lumina yeah or the eye candy of enlightenment but it will be our first sway review on the

1535
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,080
show too true yeah we do need to get back to enlightenment and lumina though that is

1536
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:20,200
something that does need to be all right we got to get to that all right so let's check

1537
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:24,120
in with the virtual log uh how are we doing in here guys how's your how's your gen 2 day

1538
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:34,400
going anybody anybody no i thought ben was i'm a bit sad that you went with sway even

1539
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:38,760
though i understand it's the most popular yeah yeah but you would have covered sway

1540
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:44,000
inevitably at some point that's true i like that you did with it like that you actually

1541
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:48,840
went with it because i've been actually uh the lame i switched this way so well we put

1542
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:52,760
it up for a vote so it was really you know on the flip side it does mean that we're going

1543
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:58,440
to be compiling wayland on gentoo yeah well it's either that or x so right we're building

1544
01:15:58,440 --> 01:16:03,680
one way uh now bashful were you doing an install uh along with us i noticed you said you grabbed

1545
01:16:03,680 --> 01:16:09,680
the minimal iso during the show there what kind of shenanigans were you doing no that

1546
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:16,520
was actually back regarding the multi-abundance installer oh that'll work too that's an easier

1547
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:21,840
path that would be yeah that would be so are you feeling good about sway i'm meeting to

1548
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:26,320
try you could as a challengee i suppose you could override you could submit an override

1549
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:30,520
but i i have been wanting to see it you could secretly install all of them that's true was

1550
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,960
built taking a long time yeah i might have to do some pre-building in that case i know

1551
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,920
we have some people building along with us and so if they would like to do sway as well

1552
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:45,760
i think though ben did um it's like gnome 2 recently so that's an option we should we

1553
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:52,800
haven't considered at all dude it's hell you do not want to go down there i've got i've

1554
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:57,000
got i can imagine let's do gnome one it was just such a huge like going from sway to gnome

1555
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:04,240
2 that's a bit of a leave that's what it is wow so might be tricky gnome 2 on wayland

1556
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:08,920
yeah that would be a thing and it will it all be in an x wayland session yeah the power

1557
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:13,420
of x wayland there so any other notes ben on your journey so far as we've uh as we've

1558
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:19,760
done the gen 2 challenge i think i'm good thank you okay i like that you tried gnome

1559
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,480
2 though good on you and uh i think the report works so next week then we'll get the system

1560
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:29,120
bootable it sounds like and if anybody back for that okay all right and if anybody else

1561
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:33,840
wants to play along at home if you want to catch up to us at this point you have to get

1562
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:40,160
your vm essentially uh booting off of the install yep stage three get your kernel built

1563
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:45,320
with your particular parameters and then i suppose next episode it's bootloader set it

1564
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:49,880
all up and reboots have you already partitioned uh yes okay so you've got your file system

1565
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:53,680
set up uh yeah that's right yeah yeah okay and it went just real simple this time so

1566
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:58,800
it's basically like an efi partition we are doing gpt efi here so uh okay that's an extra

1567
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:05,360
layer of fun all right well that closes out the the gen 2 corner this week very nice wes

1568
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:09,280
good job over there you pulled it out it's making me want to build some gen 2 on digital

1569
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,880
ocean too now that we're just doing this already well i need to have a lot faster cpu yeah right

1570
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:18,100
exactly yeah but you got the kernel built so challenge day one is completed episode

1571
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:22,080
one 226 we're gonna see how long this takes i think you're gonna go faster than we were

1572
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:26,200
initially expected i think you're gonna have this done pretty soon all right well let us

1573
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,920
know what you think on your thoughts about bitcoin and open source currencies on the

1574
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:34,280
gen 2 challenge and any other news items you think we should cover go over to linux unplug

1575
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:39,320
dot reddit dot com linux unplug dot reddit dot com is where you go if you want to give

1576
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:43,200
us your email thoughts if you don't like the social medias you can go to the jupyter broadcasting

1577
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:48,160
dot com slash contact otherwise you can also always hit me up on twitter at chris las with

1578
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:54,840
your show thoughts and ideas also check out wes and i on the new brand new rebooted texas

1579
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:57,760
coming out later this week i guess we probably should have teased this a little more that's

1580
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:02,240
probably true it's going to be a soft lid it's going to be a re-envisioning of the show

1581
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:06,680
and i think one for the better and i hope you guys will give it a go and share your

1582
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:12,200
thoughts with us and in the meantime go over to jupyter broadcasting dot com slash calendar

1583
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:17,680
and uh observe the live time observe the live time because there's only a few left this

1584
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:23,160
year wow yeah boy and there's some more bitcoin coverage on upcoming user as well yeah we'll

1585
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:28,240
do a little more yeah stay tuned for that friend of the show often a frequent contributor

1587
01:19:34,400 --> 01:19:38,080
be coming out down the road though there's just so much good stuff a holiday yeah like

1588
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,920
a holiday special if you will which we may do a holiday special of this year show too

1589
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:45,240
as well so i'm open to ideas for that too if you want to leave a comment on what we

1590
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:49,360
should do for a holiday special let me know at chris las thank you for joining us on this

1591
01:19:49,360 --> 01:20:15,920
week's of unplugged and you know what we'll see you back here next week

1592
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:35,960
i feel like for the holiday show all options are on the table so i think we should be

1593
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:41,240
drinking some sort of uh oh like a holiday beverage alcoholic holiday i'm in oh i don't

1594
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:45,880
do big on eggnog no oh just because the dairy yeah right but like what about like a spiced

1595
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:50,640
apple cider or something yeah i'm sticking with the eggnog what would we do i'm open

1596
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:55,280
i'm open to ideas from the chats and the and the discords and the uh and the mumbles on

1597
01:20:55,280 --> 01:21:00,160
what we should do for a holiday special open source yule log maybe i don't know what that

1598
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:08,400
means yeah yeah like or suveen with wes and chris oh boy is our food judge yeah we um

1599
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:13,440
we could uh make things from the open your mouth repo yes that's right i forgot about

1600
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:17,640
that we could that's an interesting those open source recipes are up there uh so a bit

1601
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:23,840
of emerging value emerged unplug gen2 madness those are our irc kind of like gen2 madness

1602
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,560
it's not bad although it doesn't talk about anything else in this show plus we got to

1603
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:31,760
save some bitcoin yeah and we got it oh that's right and plus i think we want to save it

1604
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:37,600
for the finale too the gen2 thing um so we have uh the open economy welcome to the real

1605
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:42,680
world open source doing it in public that's not bad kind of like doing it in public so

1606
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:47,160
i had a real basic one but i thought it would maybe be the most descriptive and it was bitcoin

1607
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:52,480
for linux users yeah kind of felt like that is like the heart of your message in this

1608
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:58,160
episode yeah i think that's reasonable um all right so yeah anybody in the mumble room

1609
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:01,560
have any ideas on what we should do for our holiday special bashful you could come down

1610
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:05,920
and celebrate with us come down here and do a holiday special what day are you doing it

1611
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,840
i don't know i just thought of this we just we literally just we have something we know

1612
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:12,920
we need to do we're probably gonna do it in the next couple of weeks you know so that

1613
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:17,440
way what with the holiday time yeah yeah the sooner probably the better but we need to

1614
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,480
come up with a fun idea first i like it sounds like we're trending towards food at the moment

1615
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:25,680
but i don't know if that's what we're gonna do we're trending towards food you could you

1616
01:22:25,680 --> 01:22:30,080
could uh play a bridge game on gb did you see how many people did you see that was like

1617
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:34,440
one of the number one feedbacks from the last user errors people want people wanted to learn

1618
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:39,120
about like you use a video stream bridge game or something okay yeah that would be good

1619
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:44,960
that is doable i'll bring my 2v machine i'll show west like one thing and then he could

1620
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,920
destroy me at bridge what a great how do we do that how do we do bridge in an audio podcast

1621
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,800
though that's the question probably a video stream for that one yeah because a lot of

1622
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:58,800
people listen to unplug that's the you know um but there's something there there's something

1623
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,720
there too hungry though right yeah that's the problem something to think about we should

1624
01:23:03,720 --> 01:23:07,480
have talked about this at the end of a podcast when we're tired and hungry yeah something

1625
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:10,920
to think about that if you guys have any ideas give it some thought all right well i think

1626
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:15,480
we're gonna go with the boring basic bitcoin for linux users just because that's sort of

1627
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:19,960
