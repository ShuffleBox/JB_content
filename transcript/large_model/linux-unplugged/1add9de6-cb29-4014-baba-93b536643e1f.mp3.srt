00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 4 for September 3rd, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, pour yourself a cold one, because honestly this show probably

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,440
makes a lot more sense if you've had a few drinks, otherwise it sounds like a couple

4
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,360
Linux users rambling about using Linux.

5
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,560
My name is Chris.

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,560
My name is Matt.

7
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,000
Hey Matt, so we made it to four episodes, that's a month solid man, that's awesome.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,520
So I was just telling the, well I was just about to tell the story, I thought, no wait,

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,160
I'll share it on air because it's embarrassing enough that I should share it with the audience.

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,680
So when my wife was pregnant, you know one of the things preggo ladies do is they like

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,900
to have certain foods, right, they want to have a food, for my wife it was citrusy flavors.

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,000
So lemonade was perfect, it's summertime, it's hot outside, let's get some lemonade

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,920
going on in this house.

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,200
I got hooked Matt, I got hooked on lemonade, like I've never been hooked on it, every day

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
gotta have a little lemonade.

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,840
Oh this glass of water doesn't have any lemonade in it, I'll fix that, pour a little, you

17
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
know.

18
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,760
Yeah, gotta have lemonade, so I'm mixing it with everything, so I'm at the grocery store

19
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,520
doing the shopping because the wife was on bed rest, and I'm like, we got a lot of lemonade

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,600
at home, look at this, lemonade vodka, didn't know that was a thing, I mean I've never tried

21
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,120
it, I knew it was a thing, but I've never tried it.

22
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,720
So I grabbed myself a big bottle of lemonade vodka, or lemon vodka, and it turns out you

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,980
could pour like half of that into a cup and pour half the other half with lemonade, go

24
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:58,400
half and half and it's just a delicious treat Matt, well, I had two of those like a week

25
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,120
ago, and I'm still feeling a little hungover from that, just a little bit.

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh yeah, well vodka doesn't play around, especially if you get the good stuff.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,480
Well I did not get the good stuff I don't think, I think it was being sold in the grocery

28
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,480
store.

29
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,040
Alright so we have a fun show today, one of the things that's new is we've dialed into

30
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,760
a new mumble server, we called up on our 56k modems and called in, and no we got it set

31
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,760
up, it's now hosted on Scale Engine, PriceTX has been working, took us off, got it all

32
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,600
dialed in, we were on a hosted solution, the Arbulous had set up for us that was awesome,

33
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,840
but we kept hitting user limits.

34
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,640
Turns out people wanted to hang out and chat with each other while we were doing the show,

35
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,840
they wanted to be involved with the show, and it was a lot more popular than we expected,

36
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:52,600
so now we're on a new mumble box at TS.JupiterColony.com, and hopefully somebody in the IRC chat room

37
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,480
will paste the port in there, but it's on a funky port.

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,040
I'll try to put it in the show notes, because it's going to be open 24-7, so if you guys

39
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,320
just want to hang out, it's essentially kind of like, it's an adjunct to the IRC, it's

40
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
always going.

41
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,160
And we got rooms in there for every show, we got general hangout rooms, so we're going

42
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,720
to jump in there, we've got an on-air channel now, it's port 64-734, which by the way, if

43
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,840
you just highlight that line that Tox put in the IRC, and then you open the mumble client,

44
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,440
it will automatically detect that on your clipboard and fill it into the server settings

45
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
for mumble.

46
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
It's really nice.

47
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
That's kind of slick, right?

48
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,760
Yeah, that's, you know, that's an application you can really feel like was meant for the

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
Linux desktop.

50
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,840
Yeah, I like that.

51
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,160
And that audio ducking thing they do, it feels like that Linux version of mumble is a first

52
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,840
class Linux desktop application.

53
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,760
Makes me excited what we might see in the future.

54
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,760
Oh, definitely.

55
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,600
So, we're going to chat with one of the, Ray, one of the folks that's in there.

56
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,120
He's replaced Dropbox with InkFS, and I think Git, and a couple other things, he's sort

57
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,640
of put these things together, he's wrote up a good post about it, and we caught it in

58
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,400
our subreddit and said, let's talk to you, so he's come on, he's joined us, it's like

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,360
11pm where he's at right now, and he's had a heck of a day.

60
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,480
Today was one of those days, Matt, so on Friday I went to PAX, as you know, and while I'm

61
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,720
at PAX, go figure, my phone starts buzzing.

62
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,820
And I look down, hey, can you give us a call, we have an emergency.

63
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,600
And so the way this works is, I don't have any clients that I go to on a regular basis

64
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,320
anymore, but in a few circumstances, if their main IT guy is out, and then their backup

65
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,800
guy is out, and they're really, really screwed, they'll call me.

66
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm like third guy in line, and if you're calling Chris, at that point, you're really

67
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
screwed, right?

68
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,800
At that point, you really don't want to be the guy going in.

69
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,260
Oh, so true, man, so true.

70
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,560
So there I am at PAX, and I'm getting the third guy call, and I'm like, oh no, this

71
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,860
is bad, this is real bad.

72
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,140
So I ended up working out a schedule with them, and worked them through some problems

73
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,080
Friday night, then Monday was Labor Day, a holiday here, so they were closed, thankfully,

74
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,040
so I was able to do code radio and all that.

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:02,000
Go in there this morning, first thing, I roll in there at 8.30 a.m., and they've been down

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,320
now for three days, essentially, they went down roughly Wednesday night, Thursday morning,

77
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,700
they were down all day Thursday, all day Friday, and they are under contract with Washington

78
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,080
State to have certain things posted on their website within four hours of receiving it

79
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,080
from the state.

80
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Oh, that's not good.

81
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,480
Or they're in violation of this contract, right, and that's a huge revenue source, right?

82
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,160
So if they violate that contract, then the contract goes up for bid, they lose it, and

83
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,080
then they lose like 70% of their funding.

84
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,160
So of course, everything's on the line.

85
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,400
And that was my morning, and I got in there, it's this whole custom scripted up system

86
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,520
using R-Sync and NFS mounts all over the place, every server's got a mount to every

87
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,080
other server, R-Sync's running, GNU parallel running all up in this place, it was, I mean,

88
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,560
it is a spider's web of automation, Matt.

89
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,880
It sounds like a mess.

90
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,200
It was a mess.

91
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,280
So before we get to talking with Ramy and do a couple of follow-up items, I wanted to

92
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,400
do a quick public service announcement, speaking of things that are fantastic and optimized.

93
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,840
Today, just before we went on air for Linux Unplugged, the Jupyter Broadcasting browser

94
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,720
plugins for Chrome and Firefox, which are linked to the bottom of our website, were

95
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
updated.

96
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,480
Now, first thing you should probably know is, at least in Chrome, not sure about Firefox,

97
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,920
it's requesting permissions, so you have to go in there and re-enable it, it'll be under

98
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,720
the little hamburger menu, the little three-line button, that's officially, by the way, being

99
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,040
called the hamburger button.

100
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,040
The hamburger button.

101
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,240
So yeah, you click that, there'll be a notification, and the reason why, it is requesting new permissions,

102
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,280
and it's very vague with the way they make it look, but the reason is, we've made it

103
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,580
a little more polite.

104
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:37,100
So now, if you're on somebody else's website and they have an Amazon affiliate link and

105
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,400
you click it, our extension will not override that, it'll detect that, and it'll be graceful

106
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
about it.

107
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,260
So that requires permission changes for that to happen, but that's one of the things.

108
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,360
And then we've added woot.com, so now if you're shopping at woot.com and you have our browser

109
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,480
extension installed, we will get a portion of your shopping session, which is awesome.

110
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,400
And then on the Firefox side of things, I'm not positive if you have to re-enable it or

111
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,760
not, I haven't tried it on my Firefox install yet, but we have Firefox integration improvements,

112
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,000
performance improvements, and goodies as well, of course, there's woot and all that stuff

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,120
over there as well.

114
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,600
So new extensions being updated today, so your browser will probably get the update,

115
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,620
and if you don't know about this yet, these are open source extensions, we have them linked

116
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,240
up on GitHub in the Linux Action Show show notes, or you go to jbdev.... Where was that?

117
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,480
I can't remember, there's a jbdev site I have linked to on the show notes, and those are

118
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:30,320
posted up on GitHub, they're open source, and we've actually got a good amount of people

119
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:35,280
now, this is so funny, when we launched these extensions, I said, well let's go open source

120
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,180
so that way people know we're not doing anything shady and anything like that, and if people

121
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,040
want to use them, they can, that's fine.

122
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,560
And people didn't necessarily think that was a good idea because there are other podcasts

123
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,640
networks that take them, right?

124
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Oh, right.

125
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Exactly.

126
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,400
Yeah, I mean that happens, but the other thing that's been really interesting is it's been

127
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
big in churches.

128
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Oh.

129
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,360
So, I've heard from several people that are grabbing it for their church, setting it up

130
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,600
and coding it for an affiliate code for their church, and then the people, the members of

131
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,400
that church, when they shop at home, are using a modified version of the Jupiter Broadcasting

132
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,280
extension to benefit the church.

133
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
That's clever.

134
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,720
Yeah, so I thought that was kind of a neat use of it.

135
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,400
So there you go, so you can find links to those linked at the very bottom of jupitabroadcasting.com,

136
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,280
and then when you have those installed, they just automatically take your shopping session

137
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:26,840
at Amazon, Newegg, Woot, Monoprice, eBay, lots of popular sites, and then it helps keep

138
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
us on the air.

139
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,280
All right, well I'm going to unmute our Mumble channel here and say hi to the folks in the

140
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,920
Mumble room, and specifically I want to welcome Remi to the show.

141
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,440
He's been a contributor to the network for a while, he's sent in emails to many of the

142
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,000
shows, and he's active in our subreddits.

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
Remi, welcome to the show.

144
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,680
Good evening, Chris.

145
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,480
So now, did I have it right, it's about 11 p.m. where you're at right now?

146
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Yes, that's correct.

147
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,320
It's now just 11, 9 p.m. in the Netherlands.

148
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,520
Well I know that you were fighting server outages all day, so I appreciate you joining

149
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,440
us after the day of hell that you've had.

150
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,680
And you caught my attention, I think it was last week when you submitted a blog post about

151
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,900
your encrypted file synchronization solution.

152
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,280
Can you tell us what it is and what tech you're using?

153
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,960
Okay, yes, it's correct.

154
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:18,440
I just recently bought a Chromebook and I used Spideroak, which is a locally encryption

155
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,520
and then upload to the cloud.

156
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,440
And it doesn't work on ARM, and I have an ARM Chromebook, so I had an issue.

157
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,880
I was already having issues with Spideroak because of RAM usage, because I have over

158
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,000
90,000 files in there and it doesn't really like that.

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Wow.

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,520
I've also tried Oowala, and it's also a local encryption and then dump the blobs in cloud

161
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
tool.

162
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:45,480
And it also had RAM issues, and so I was looking for something else.

163
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,200
And I already use AnkaFest, AnkaFest is a user space tool that mounts your local folder

164
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,240
and you have an encrypted folder and then you mount it and then you have the unencrypted

165
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
part.

166
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,040
It just works with a password.

167
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,320
And that's the encryption part and the synchronization part, because that's really important that

168
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,440
you also have the files on multiple devices, is using DVCS auto sync.

169
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,960
It's distributed version control system auto sync, and it works both with Git and material

170
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,280
and other version control systems.

171
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:19,520
So you're not using Spideroak at all because you're on ARM?

172
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,440
Yeah, I had to switch because I also needed the files on my Chromebook.

173
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,720
The Chromebook runs Arch Linux, but Arch Linux ARM.

174
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,400
Oh, okay.

175
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,680
So you're using, okay, so just so I get this, you're using AnkaFest for the encryption,

176
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,440
you're using SSH to Git?

177
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,640
How are you doing SSH to Git?

178
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,600
Well, I have a VPS just somewhere else and the point is, the AnkaFest folder is only

179
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,760
decrypted when you mount it.

180
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:57,080
So the folder which I sync to the cloud is the folder, the encrypted data.

181
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,120
And how does it handle like small file changes?

182
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,560
Like if you do like, you're only updating maybe three lines in your notes file, does

183
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,560
it update the whole file?

184
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,360
The AnkaFest part works like this.

185
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,720
It works per file.

186
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
So that's very nice.

187
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,040
It's not like you have a true grid volume and you have to unmount it.

188
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
Yeah, right.

189
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,040
It works per file, but because I have it set very strictly, you can give options if you

190
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,160
want per file chaining and that kind of stuff.

191
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,760
I've set it very strictly so that every change I make in a file after a write makes the entire

192
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,720
file gets re-uploaded and synced.

193
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,560
But you can also set less restrictive options which make only bigger changes to a file make

194
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,840
it upload again.

195
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:40,600
Now any way to make this work with a Windows machine?

196
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Yes.

197
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,760
You have, I think it's a few tools which support SSH on Windows.

198
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,920
You have a few tools which support Git on Windows.

199
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,800
What is your solution for mobile?

200
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,560
Well, Android.

201
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,480
I only use Android phones and there is an open source application in the Android app

202
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,760
store, it's called Ankdroid, which I use to mount it, the encrypted folder.

203
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,880
And there's also a few Git clients in the app store so which you can sync back the encrypted

204
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
part.

205
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,400
The beautiful thing is you only in the cloud you have the encrypted part and everywhere

206
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,000
you have AnkaFest, you can mount a local part.

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,360
So with Inkdroid, I'm going to go look that up right now, I did not even know about that.

208
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,280
You also have an app that's called, I think it's Boxcryptor and it's a closed source app

209
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,960
and it supports AnkaFest, but it's for me really important that you have open source

210
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,040
code so that you can make sure that nobody else gets your password and key.

211
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,480
Yeah, big advocates of that here.

212
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
Wow.

213
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,440
With this solution when you set it up and I use it on a Chromebook, on a MacBook Pro,

214
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,440
which I have for my work, on an Android phone and on two other Ubuntu and Arch Linux machines

215
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,720
and it really works fine.

216
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,000
It also handles deletions of files and folders.

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,440
So when you say deletions, do you mean it handles revisions of deletions?

218
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,920
No, just when I remove a file, it's also removed in the version control.

219
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Yeah, okay.

220
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Okay, so that's the same.

221
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Despite the issues on that, when I had deleted the file in one machine, on the other machines

222
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,080
it would just re-upload it because it thought it was a new file on the machine on which

223
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,080
it was deleted.

224
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,300
So how do you, so with having all of your files in Git, then are you able to go in with

225
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,320
like a Git Explorer and like pull out certain versions of stuff that you want and things

226
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
like that?

227
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
No.

228
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
No.

229
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,400
And that is because in Git, only the encrypted part is.

230
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:33,360
So that's quite of a disadvantage, not really for me, because the important files, I make

231
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
manual backups.

232
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,240
So because Git doesn't, because it's encrypted, Git can't make revisions because it doesn't

233
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
know.

234
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
What is what?

235
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,240
Yeah.

236
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,380
Yeah, it makes revisions of the encrypted data, but not of the decrypted data.

237
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,380
That's the whole point.

238
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,380
Right, yeah.

239
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,380
That makes sense.

240
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,080
One other disadvantage is that you cannot have selective sync, so you cannot have a

241
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,520
big mess with all your files in your phone with just a few.

242
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,720
And also because it's a disadvantage of not knowing what is what and having to mount it

243
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
encrypted locally.

244
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
Right.

245
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,640
Selective sync is nice, but it does allow you to be lazy too, which honestly that's

246
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,640
how I use it.

247
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
This is true.

248
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
And complacent.

249
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
Yeah.

250
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,480
And one of the other nice things with this solution is that, as I said, I have a lot

251
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,120
of source code for companies I work for in my encrypted folders.

252
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,680
And as I said, I had over 9,000 files and it has totally no performance issues with

253
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,400
that RAM usage of the syncing process and the anchor phase is, I think, less than 90

254
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,160
megabytes, where Spyder Oak was on three to four gigabytes.

255
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,160
Holy cow.

256
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,760
I got to play more with that.

257
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
That's interesting.

258
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,600
So you've got how you've done all of this written up on your site, rayme.org, and I'll

259
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
have a link to it in the show notes.

260
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
It's also linked in the subreddit.

261
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,680
You know what a nice part was about, I put the article on Saturday evening.

262
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,800
It's the first article I did with a picture, with a diagram, and it was also on the front

263
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,840
page on Hack News.

264
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:55,720
And normally my website has about 1,000 visitors a day, and it got 40,000 extra visits in the

265
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
last four days.

266
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Whoa.

267
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,720
Oh my goodness.

268
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Whoa.

269
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Whoa.

270
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
You really notice that people are looking for such a solution.

271
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Exactly.

272
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,040
And it's not a one-click easy solution, but it still is there.

273
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,240
People are really looking to go off the grid, in a sense.

274
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,880
Not actually off the grid, but off the surveillance grid.

275
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,680
Well, to put themselves in more control, too, I think is really the big focus.

276
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
Yeah.

277
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
Isn't that interesting?

278
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,840
Because now, on the other end of it, I've seen such an explosion in bit message adoption.

279
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,280
I'm just buried now in bit messages.

280
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
It's awesome.

281
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
Yeah.

282
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
No kidding.

283
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,960
So it's like people are really looking, and we've seen a huge interest in mail servers,

284
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
too.

285
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,600
Well, Remy, before we move on to the next topic, is there anything you wanted to mention

286
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,680
about it, or anything you want to touch on?

287
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,920
Well, just as I said, it's not an easy one-click solution, but I hope it will help people with

288
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,400
having their encryption and data truly secure and locally.

289
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Yeah, I mean, you've got an encrypted sync solution here that is off the surveillance

290
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,240
grid, and it's using all open source code, right?

291
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,720
Yes, that's totally correct.

292
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Yeah, I mean, that's awesome.

293
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
That's very awesome.

294
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
That's very cool.

295
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,720
So we'll have a link.

296
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Thank you.

297
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
Thank you for having me on.

298
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Yeah, you bet, man.

299
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,720
Thanks for staying up for us after your rough day.

300
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
I appreciate it.

301
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,680
Have you experienced rate cards that only detect issues when you reboot the server?

302
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,680
Oh, oh, oh.

303
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,000
Yeah, it's funny how something about that reboot process, if there's something that's

304
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,440
going to die, that's when it will die, even if it's a drive.

305
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,520
But yeah, I've had the rate card go out on the database server.

306
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:26,280
Today I had eight servers which had that issue, and about 24 drives are now dead.

307
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,280
Eight separate servers?

308
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,440
Yeah, with all the same rate card and the same firmware, the latest firmware from HAPI.

309
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
Oh, wow.

310
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,160
Oh, did the firmware nuke it?

311
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,160
That might be it.

312
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,800
No, the rate card only detects changes in disk issues when you reboot the server, so

313
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,120
we had to reboot after scheduled updates, and eight servers just said, whoa, my hard

314
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
drives are dead.

315
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
Bye.

316
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Oh, my.

317
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Oh.

318
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Goodness.

319
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
That is not a good day.

320
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
That's a bad day.

321
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
That's OK.

322
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,360
I was up at 6 a.m., and it's now 11 p.m., and I'm only home for about an hour, so I'm

323
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,360
going to sleep now, and my alarm goes at 4 a.m. the next morning, because I have to

324
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,920
be in the data center again.

325
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,640
Well, arm that coffee pot, man, and thank you for joining us.

326
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,520
Yeah, we'll have a good show, and I will listen to it tomorrow.

327
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
All right.

328
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Thank you for having me on.

329
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
Yeah, you bet.

330
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Thank you.

331
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Thank you.

332
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
Bye.

333
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,520
Yeah, bye.

334
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Bye.

335
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Thanks.

336
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,080
So I wanted to just mention a couple of follow-up items before we chat more with the mumble

337
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
guys there.

338
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,080
I meant to follow up on this a little while ago.

339
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:29,640
I mentioned that I was frustrated that the GNOME search in GNOME 3 is not searching documents.

340
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:35,160
It's just on my machine, and the only GNOME time I've ever used GNOME 3.8 is in this

341
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
installation of Arch.

342
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,080
In fact, when I installed this installation of Arch, it was like one of the few places

343
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,360
you could actually get GNOME 3.8.

344
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,720
It hadn't hit the other distros yet.

345
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,360
Well, so I don't know why it doesn't work on my machine.

346
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,160
It does work for everybody else on the internet, though, and they all told me.

347
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,040
So we even got like on the comments section for last week's show, we even got like a really

348
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
nice screenshot.

349
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,200
I don't know if you saw that, but it even looked, of course, it's GNOME related, so

350
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,200
it just looked gorgeous.

351
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Sure, sure, sure.

352
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Oh, that's bizarre.

353
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
That's bizarre.

354
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,120
You know, I'm using Synapse or whatever you want to call it, and so I just, yeah, I don't

355
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,000
really have too many troubles there.

356
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,080
Yeah, your days are numbered, my friend.

357
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,840
That Synapse project, they haven't been pushing new code for a while.

358
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
They have not.

359
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,840
I'll probably go to GNOME do.

360
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,520
Yeah, there you go, yeah.

361
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,440
And also, just a quick update, I made an app pick on last, GDmap for scanning your drive

362
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,180
and showing up in blocks.

363
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,680
For us KDE users, K4derstat.

364
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,680
Durst?

365
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,680
Really?

366
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,680
Okay.

367
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
K4derstat.

368
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Yeah.

369
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
K4derstat.

370
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
And that is a KDE version.

371
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
That's very German.

372
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,720
Some people say that even Winderstat's based off of, so take that as you will.

373
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,560
Okay, so I wanted to get to a topic today that it kind of got me thinking.

374
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,120
In the subreddit, I think it was like an episode, actually one of this show, I said, man, it

375
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:01,640
sure would be great, gosh, it'd be great if there was some sort of website out there collating

376
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,560
the Steam numbers and giving us some nice charts to look at.

377
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,560
That would be fantastic.

378
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,560
Right?

379
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,760
And, well, that happened.

380
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:17,460
One of our listeners, Mateci, I bet it's Mateci, I bet that's how you say it.

381
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:25,780
He started a Steam survey charts over at his site and it is not looking good for Linux.

382
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,780
Not looking good, Matt.

383
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,740
In fact, when I say not looking good, I mean it looks real bad.

384
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,600
It looks real bad.

385
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,520
Would it be bad, and I'm going to get probably set on fire for this, but is it bad to say

386
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,420
it's because the folks that run Linux have jobs?

387
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,600
I was going to say it's because I was going to ask you, and so here's what I'm thinking.

388
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,360
I think we take a break, we'll thank our first sponsor, then I'm going to toss it to you.

389
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,600
I got a couple things I want to throw your way.

390
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,320
I'm going to toss it to you.

391
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,720
Are Linux users, on a whole, obviously there's going to be individual cases, but are Linux

392
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
users cheap?

393
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm going to convince you otherwise, I think, but we'll see.

394
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
We will see.

395
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,720
But first, Matt, I want to thank our first sponsor this week, and that is Ting.com.

396
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:12,720
Now Ting is mobile that makes sense, my friend, and Ting was the lifesaver at PAX.

397
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,520
I think I mentioned this on Sunday's last, but really I was the only guy, except for

398
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,280
another guy that also was on Ting's service, that had a working cell phone.

399
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,720
I cannot tell you, when I had a client who was in full-fledged freakout mode and they

400
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,360
needed Chris to make everything better, having to make that phone call, being able to make

401
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:38,840
those phone calls while I was on the exposition floor of PAX was invaluable.

402
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:42,320
I would have paid any monthly service for that, and of course I'm just paying for what

403
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
I use.

404
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,320
That's one of the great things about Ting.

405
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,600
Look, go to linux.ting.com.

406
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,400
We got Linux for this show, so go to linux.ting.com.

407
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,880
That'll get you $25 off your first Ting device, or $25 of service credits for your first month

408
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,360
of service.

409
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,760
I have the HTC One, and that guy powered through it real well, real good.

410
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,760
I was quite happy.

411
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,120
However, now I know this is the same phone, but I just noticed now Ting has the HTC Blue.

412
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
Ooh, hey, that's new, right?

413
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Yeah, yeah.

414
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,280
Oh, and they also have this S4 Purple, I didn't know that.

415
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,800
The HTC One Blue is gonna be the phone I want, but what?

416
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
I'm holding out.

417
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I'm gonna see.

418
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,680
I wanted to say, if you've been looking at phones, go over to linux.ting.com, and you're

419
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,880
not sure which one you wanna get, because these are off contract.

420
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,120
That's a good thing, but it also means they're gonna be a little bit higher in price.

421
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,200
Of course, in the long run, you're saving money, and even after the cost of the phone,

422
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,760
you're probably gonna save money in some circumstances.

423
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,120
Oh yeah, you're gonna save big buckets of money.

424
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
Right.

425
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,120
However, you can buy used on Ting, and there's really a lot of options here.

426
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,600
On that tab, they have buy used, and they have the personal shopping service, where

427
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,440
you go out and find a device, you just give them the parameters, screen size, OS, etc.,

428
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,160
and they'll go get you a refurbished phone that works on Ting.

429
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
That's awesome.

430
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,840
That's really awesome.

431
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,800
However, maybe you might be in a situation where you wanna have multiple people on the

432
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
line.

433
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Ting makes that real easy.

434
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
It's just $6 a month, and you pay for what you use.

435
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,000
So you could have yourself a smartphone, and maybe there's somebody else in your family.

436
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,080
Maybe it's a significant other, maybe it's a parent, maybe it's a kid, and they don't

437
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,320
need to have a full-fledged smartphone, or you don't want them to have a full-fledged

438
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
smartphone.

439
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,000
You don't want a full-fledged smartphone.

440
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,520
I mean, I can totally understand that.

441
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,160
They have got the Samsung, which is a really great flip phone, the Samsung M370.

442
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:33,200
It's very sturdy, very reliable, $52, and if you go to linux.ting.com, Ting is gonna

443
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,400
take $25 off of that.

444
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,200
So that's practically nothing.

445
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,680
That's practically nothing to get you on a Ting phone, and then you're only paying for

446
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,840
the price you use.

447
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,880
Ting just takes your minutes used, your text, and your data, adds them all up at the end

448
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,480
of the month, and then puts you in a bucket, and you can check on their online dashboard

449
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,800
at any time to see where you're at, to know exactly where you're trending.

450
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,640
And the great thing is, if you go with a smartphone, you get all these great features like built-in

451
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,080
hotspot and tethering.

452
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,720
You've gotten caller ID, and all these things that the other cellular companies will sort

453
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,120
of fit into the tax brackets, or sort of fit into like these bolt-on services, and none

454
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
of that happens.

455
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,480
No ride-alongs with Ting.

456
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,400
It's just nice, easy, straight, simple, forward mobile.

457
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,280
They've also got that airwave, so if you want to boost cellular service in your house, you

458
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,840
can plug one of these into your house.

459
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,720
It'll use your internet connection, and then you get four bars, or five, or whatever your

460
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,720
phone reads.

461
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,600
You get full signal in your house, but the phone, the OS, everything is just talking

462
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,880
over the cellular, so everything that you would have work over your cellular works right

463
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,880
over one of those things.

464
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
It's really, really cool.

465
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
That's cool.

466
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,880
Yeah, and to be able to take 25 bucks off of any one of those, especially that little

467
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,880
flip phone.

468
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,880
That's pretty cool.

469
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,880
I know.

470
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,080
When you're starting at 50 bucks, and then you take 25 bucks off, and then you're paying

471
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,760
just for what you use every single month, this is the value.

472
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,840
This is the best value out there, and the service is great, the people are great, and

473
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,240
the company's really good, too.

474
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,520
So go to linux.ting.com, and get yourself something nice on a really easy to use, simple

475
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
to follow site.

476
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,840
I was so impressed when I activated my devices, how easy that was.

477
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,320
Matt, you just recently did that.

478
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,840
Tell me, is that not the most straightforward device activation process?

479
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,280
I couldn't believe how simple it was.

480
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:11,440
Even though I had to make sure it was basically deactivated from your stuff, because I got

481
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,880
a phone from you, it was brain dead simple to do.

482
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,320
I mean, it was just like, type in a couple buttons, I mean, the instructions were easy

483
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:20,800
to set up, and then once I actually activated the phone, it was like three seconds, like

484
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,920
boop, boop, bam, boom, done, reboot.

485
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,000
I feel like good UI designers, and I think maybe Ting's got a real good group on their

486
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,560
hands, and maybe, here's what their trick is.

487
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,760
If I was a good, here's what makes a good UI designer.

488
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,080
I say you get three or four beers into the wind, then you try to use your site, and if

489
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,000
you can use it efficiently, you know you got a really well-designed site.

490
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,080
Well let me tell you, Ting passes the three or four beer test.

491
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,160
I've been on Ting's website several times, three or four beers in, and I never get lost.

492
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:50,160
So I just say, if you're an interface design person out there, go take a look at their

493
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,200
site, learn a little bit, and try the beer challenge for yourself, and it makes for a

494
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
fantastic website.

495
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,440
It makes it super clear and easy, so that way when you have family members, like my

496
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,200
mom's on Ting, and when I have her go to the Ting site, I can just remember it all from

497
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,320
the top of my head when I'm walking around, because it's so straightforward.

498
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,400
So I'm like, yeah, click there, click there, okay, you're done, bye mom, and we're all

499
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
set.

500
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,160
But if mom wanted to call into Ting, she could.

501
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:17,400
Ting has representatives that answer the phone, you can call them, 1-855-846-4389, and they're

502
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,080
available 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.

503
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,640
You call in, and a real person answers the phone.

504
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,360
And so if there's something mom can't do on the website, I just have mom call Ting.

505
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,220
Well, and that's awesome, because not only are they going to get a real person when they

506
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,640
call in, but if maybe they're not really into doing stuff on the website, they prefer to

507
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
deal with a person, what a great option.

508
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah.

509
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,840
So go to linux.ting.com and start saving right now, you guys, don't be crazy.

510
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,840
Don't be crazy.

511
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,240
All right, Matt, so here we go, you ready for my Linux users might be cheap?

512
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,240
And I'm a Linux user, I'm not cheap, but I'm just saying.

513
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,640
So I got an inside guy, I don't know if he's in the chat room right now, but I got an inside

514
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,400
guy, and he's been sussing out the number, suss is my word of the week, he's been sussing

515
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,120
out the numbers from the Ubuntu Software Center.

516
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,520
And we're looking now, Ubuntu, supposedly the number one deployed desktop Linux operating

517
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
system.

518
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,480
Our own web stats would back that up.

519
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:19,380
The number one app in the Ubuntu Software Center right now is FileCryptor Professional.

520
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,720
The number two app is WPA Generator, and the number three app is FileCryptor.

521
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:30,800
All right, of these top apps, the first app goes for $4.99, the second app goes for $3,

522
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:34,000
and the third app goes for $2.99.

523
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,800
Now here's the thing, these are the top three applications in the Ubuntu Software Center.

524
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,460
None of them have ratings, none of them have average, none of them have comments, nothing.

525
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,760
They're all blank, I should take comments back, ratings, none of them have any interaction

526
00:26:50,760 --> 00:27:00,140
on that level, and when talking to these developers, they're making at best a couple hundred dollars

527
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,140
a month.

528
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,140
And that's being pretty generous.

529
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,140
From the software center.

530
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,140
Really, yeah, that's pretty generous.

531
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,600
It is, and that's like the top, that was like the top app, actually, that made that much

532
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
money.

533
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,740
Now the time skew was a little short, it wasn't a full month, but still, it is, the numbers

534
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,920
are devastating.

535
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,460
Now we go over to Steam.

536
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,260
Since Steam has launched, it has gone in a sharp decline.

537
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:27,520
On January 13th, Steam had, Linux Steam usage, had a 1.12% market share.

538
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,340
On February 13th, it went up to 2.02%, that was after we were out of beta and all this

539
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,420
good stuff.

540
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:38,020
Then from that point forward, June, it goes down to 1.07%, July, 1.06%.

541
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:43,800
Now in August, we're below 1%, we're at 0.93%.

542
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,380
So we're dropping off.

543
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:52,660
Now you gotta ask yourself, because Linux is free, and a lot of the software is free,

544
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:58,700
is it more attractive to people who don't wanna pay for software?

545
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:03,940
Is this not a marketplace where you can make a living writing software and selling it to

546
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,660
Linux users?

547
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,220
So here's how I see it.

548
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,940
First of all, if I'm gonna buy anything, if I can get an equitable alternative for free,

549
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,940
I would be mouth breathing stupid not to.

550
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,940
So of course I'm gonna go that route.

551
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,540
Now as far as the two marketplaces, whether it be Steam or the Ubuntu Software Center,

552
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:27,380
the Ubuntu Software Center is a little bit like trying to do grocery checkout at your

553
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,580
dentist's office, or at the B&B, it's horrible.

554
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,780
It is absolutely hideous.

555
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,340
Now for free apps, it's reasonably painless because all you're gonna do is enter a password

556
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,340
and you're done.

557
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,260
Yeah, but when you buy an app, you gotta put in your shipping address and everything.

558
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,420
It's just stupid.

559
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,180
So that's hideous.

560
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,300
Steam's is actually not so bad, but I think that the bigger problem, especially when you

561
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,740
look at it from the fact that, like I'll use Steam as a better example because that's really

562
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,500
where we had a nice peak and it kind of dropped off, I think the people that were really excited

563
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,060
about getting on the games have then done so.

564
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,820
And I would be interested in comparing a contrast with what's going on in the Windows space.

565
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,780
Is there also a decline there?

566
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:10,060
Or perhaps maybe there's a surge of new Windows games coming out to where maybe there's not

567
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,220
as many compelling new Linux coming out.

568
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:19,820
The Windows penetration seems to be fairly steady and in January it was 94.56%.

569
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:25,740
It drops down slightly between February and July, but then it's back to 94.59%, slightly

570
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,060
above where it was in January.

571
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,900
So since Linux has come out for Steam, Windows usage has actually gone up slightly.

572
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,220
And so I would say that it's not so much a problem, I don't think the problem was with

573
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,220
Linux at all.

574
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,980
I think it's a lot of its availability of give me something compelling, you know, okay

575
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:41,940
for existing Linux games, do you have a map pack that's come out?

576
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,700
Maybe there's something compelling to add on to my existing games.

577
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,740
What new things are out there as an existing Steam user that's going to make me say, oh

578
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,560
hey, let me make that purchase.

579
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,420
Maybe there are some games that are out there, maybe there aren't.

580
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:58,120
Maybe you're already into your game and you would like to expand on that existing experience.

581
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,060
So I would need more data before I can completely rule it out as a Linux thing because I mean

582
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:08,580
like, you know, the Humble Bundle is done really well.

583
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:12,820
But then again, it's something different and I think honestly the success of that Humble

584
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,300
Bundle was one of the things that brought Steam over.

585
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,540
I mean, you know, so yeah, that's a good point.

586
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,420
I'm going to, so I'll ask the mumble room.

587
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,460
I don't know if the guys in the On Air channel have any, if anybody in here has any thoughts

588
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:31,100
on if Linux users are just cheap, you know, with software I would say yes, but not with

589
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,100
games.

590
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
That's my big difference.

591
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,900
Do you think it's maybe Linux users are willing to pay for certain things and not other things?

592
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,900
Oh yeah.

593
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,420
Well, I mean, I look at like when I try and find something on OS X, because I have to

594
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:47,700
do this occasionally, it astounds me at the stupid software titles that are being, they're

595
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,700
charging $20, $30.

596
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
Oh yeah.

597
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,700
I know, right?

598
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,700
It's just like, and it's like, you really think I'm going to do that?

599
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,700
No.

600
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,580
You know, it's like, I'm not going to give you my money.

601
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,860
So I think that it's a lot of what you're used to.

602
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,180
Linux users have an expectation that if they hunt hard enough, because the Ubuntu Software

603
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,500
Center is not the end all to be all of software, you hunt hard enough, a lot of times you can

604
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,540
find a package that's compatible with your distro.

605
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:13,640
That's going to offer you a way to accomplish the task you're trying to do.

606
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,220
May not be as glossy, may not be as pretty, but a lot of times you can get it done.

607
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,420
And you can get it done for free.

608
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:23,180
So we got the mumble room up and we just heard Jack in the box type in a little bit, but

609
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:28,580
I'm curious, anybody in here, Josh or Mad Joe or Miracode, we haven't heard from you

610
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,340
or Westeros in here.

611
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,520
We haven't heard from you guys.

612
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,940
You guys think Linux users are cheap?

613
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,900
Do you think it's something else?

614
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
What is your explanation?

615
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
Go ahead, Miracode.

616
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,900
You first.

617
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,900
Oh, I'm sorry.

618
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:46,900
I'm a few milliseconds closer than any of you.

619
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,820
I think it's a mix of the fact that people are a little bit cheap, however, I think a

620
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:57,620
lot of professional users also use the new systems.

621
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,780
That may be part of the issue, where we have people who are generally busy filming and

622
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,300
not having time really to play these games.

623
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
All right.

624
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,660
So Josh, what do you think, Josh?

625
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,220
Is it Linux users are too busy?

626
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,460
No.

627
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:20,880
So my opinion is, for instance, with the Ubuntu Software Center, those apps, half of those

628
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,980
apps are not integrated with the operating system.

629
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:30,620
They're using an old GTK library, which for instance, GTK 2, which one, looks terrible

630
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:37,940
and two, the apps just suck, and three, then they're just charging an obscene amount.

631
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:42,420
Well, it's $4 or $3 out of an obscene amount.

632
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,940
So the top, we had $4.99, $3, and $2.99.

633
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:52,500
I think for apps that don't integrate with the OS that are outdated, or for instance,

634
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,900
when I went on there the other day, I saw a Windows Phone 8 app in there, which is just

635
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,940
like, I don't even know how that got through the review process, but it was in there.

636
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,660
Oh, so you're talking about applications rather than...

637
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,620
I'm talking about applications within the Ubuntu Software Center.

638
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:14,860
Regarding Steam, I think people want a very smooth experience, and I don't think we're

639
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:21,260
quite there yet, and it's not at the fault, it's not exactly at the fault of the developers.

640
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,540
With some, it's regarding their game optimization, but with some, it's the drivers.

641
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:30,380
We're getting there, I think it might be a couple of years, depending on Linux adoption.

642
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:36,260
I think Valve's really pushing it, so I think we're going to see drivers improve a lot,

643
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:40,100
but I just don't think we're quite there yet with a lot of the games.

644
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,980
And a lot of the AAA titles aren't even on Linux, so until then, I'm kind of stuck on

645
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,980
Windows.

646
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
Yeah, that's true.

647
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,980
We are still missing...

648
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,980
Okay, well, so is it this?

649
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:53,380
Oh, so Green in the chat room is mentioning System76, and I would say they are a premium

650
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,380
brand.

651
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:00,180
It's a high-quality device that delivers on what they say, and I feel like, as a Linux

652
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,220
user, I'm more picky about what I spend my money on.

653
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,020
I'll buy Steam games if it's a good game.

654
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,100
I've bought apps from the Ubuntu Software Center, now I can't really use them, but I

655
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,380
have, and I'll buy a Bonobo when there's a good Linux laptop.

656
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:17,940
So for me, is it actually that Linux users maybe are just more discerning?

657
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,460
Yeah, I would lean with that.

658
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:25,380
I think that our expectations are, the first bill of goods that you serve to us, we're

659
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:31,340
not going to necessarily jump on board like we see with OS X and Windows, OS X especially.

660
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,680
That's where I've really seen it the worst.

661
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,580
So I think that's definitely a big piece of it.

662
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,460
But as far as integration and all that, and as far as making an application center that

663
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:45,540
doesn't suck, I hate to beat the dead horse again, but I'm sorry, it's been done, and

664
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,660
Ubuntu went backwards.

665
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:51,840
Not only did they go and hire Linspire developers that worked on CNR from Linspire and actually

666
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:57,580
integrated them into the Ubuntu software project, they then managed to make it suck harder.

667
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,220
So it's like, I don't know how that works because Linspire sucked, don't get me wrong.

668
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,220
I hated their model.

669
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,420
I didn't like a lot of what was going on there, but that piece of it, before they decided

670
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,820
to make it available to all the distributions, was the most seamless software experience

671
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,820
I've ever seen.

672
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,820
It was just apt.

673
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,820
It wasn't anything wonderful.

674
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:17,060
You could do an entire aisle of software, go to another computer, log in, aisle bam

675
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,060
done.

676
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,060
It was very, very seamless.

677
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,620
So the Ubuntu Software Center really lacks that seamless experience.

678
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,780
Steam, however, is pretty close.

679
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,940
I think Steam is probably closer than anything else out there for Linux.

680
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,660
But we're going to see that.

681
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,660
Go ahead.

682
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,660
Sorry.

683
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,660
Go ahead.

684
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,660
Go ahead, Josh.

685
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,660
Yeah, go ahead.

686
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:40,380
I just think, going back to that question you asked, are Linux users cheap?

687
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,580
I don't think we are cheap.

688
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:47,860
I think because we're power users, we're all power users, we want to find the best for

689
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:54,660
us and we will look until we can't look anymore to find what we want.

690
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,860
And then at the end of the search, if there's something that's not free, then we will end

691
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,860
up buying it.

692
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,860
Yeah.

693
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,860
Okay.

694
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,860
All right.

695
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,860
All right.

696
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,860
All right.

697
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:06,860
Well, I'm going to move on.

698
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:07,860
I'm going to move us on.

699
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,860
Can I address something?

700
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
Yeah, go ahead.

701
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,860
Go ahead.

702
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,860
Go ahead.

703
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:15,860
So with Ubuntu Software Center, yes, there are some issues.

704
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:18,260
Performance is certainly one of them.

705
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:22,860
And one of the other issues is the minimum payment level is quite high.

706
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:28,140
So there are no 99 cent apps in Ubuntu Software Center because of the payment provider that

707
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:34,060
Canonical uses to do the payments for apps in Software Center, which makes it less attractive

708
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:40,460
for people making very small apps that could potentially get very high volume sales.

709
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:45,900
Not everyone in every region can pay because certain restrictions with credit cards and

710
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:51,300
certain ages, it makes it difficult and they might not be able to use PayPal either.

711
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:56,620
And there's also a significant hurdle to installing apps because you have to sign up for an Ubuntu

712
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:02,300
single sign on account and that's seamless inside Software Center.

713
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,620
And the fundamental issue, there's a lack of content.

714
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,740
When you don't have enough content, when there isn't the sea of applications that you get

715
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:14,140
on Android and on iOS, where you can just page down and page down and page down and

716
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,580
keep going, okay, you'll find some dross in there, but there'll be an awful lot of stuff

717
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:20,540
in there for you to choose from, you'll almost certainly find it.

718
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:26,660
And until we've got that vast amount of content, it's very difficult to get realistic sales

719
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,660
figures.

720
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,860
So is AppGrid going to solve some of this problem?

721
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:36,260
Is Ubuntu's new Software Center redesign going to be sort of a reset on some of this?

722
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,980
Yes, to some degree.

723
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,420
I mean, part of it is that we haven't jumped the chasm yet.

724
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,540
We're still, as Chris says, we're geeks.

725
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:49,980
The people who are using Linux and Ubuntu, even now, are mostly geeks and so they're

726
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:56,580
looking for geek tools and they're happy with Wget and downloading an RPM and using alien

727
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,580
to turn it into a deb or that kind of stuff.

728
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,580
Whereas normal people, we haven't got to them yet.

729
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,780
The moms and dads and then the kids, we haven't got to them.

730
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,900
So it's very difficult to say that this is like normal behavior.

731
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,180
It's normal for us, but it's not normal for them.

732
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:20,380
And ideally, yeah, this will all be fixed with 14.04 and 14.10 with click packages and

733
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,540
in-dash purchases.

734
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:27,140
So you'll be able to just scroll down through the dash, see an app and just click on it

735
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,900
and install it.

736
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,500
You won't have to go off to a store to go and find it.

737
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,140
I've always wondered if that would be coming to the dash.

738
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,580
That makes a lot of sense that that would be in the dash because the dash has the ability

739
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,740
to suggest and recommend apps in the software center.

740
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,420
And then the dash becomes useful.

741
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,940
You can kind of see the pieces of it are there.

742
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
So cool.

743
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:52,540
I'm going to link to a little article here that's talking about getting the app grid

744
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,980
on 13.04 and it takes a little look at it.

745
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,860
I know it's something that Canonical is working on.

746
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:06,380
So I'm hopeful that what I come back to is I hope it does come down to it's the challenges

747
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,380
to payment.

748
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,540
It's the challenges to create an account.

749
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,260
It's the price issue.

750
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,360
It's the inventory issue.

751
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,980
And it's also the volume issue.

752
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,380
And so it's not any one particular thing.

753
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,360
So it's not fair to say, well, Linux users are cheap.

754
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,980
That might be a component of it.

755
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,580
I would say it's they're more picky.

756
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:29,740
And there's also we haven't had a decent unified SDK across across all the platforms.

757
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,500
And now we have now we're building one that works on phones, tablets, TVs, desktops, you

758
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
know, everything.

759
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Yeah.

760
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,380
So effectively, a developer can write their app, sell it for 99 cents and run on all those

761
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,380
form factors.

762
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,900
Ideally, that should bring more people in.

763
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,900
I don't know.

764
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,900
We'll have to wait and see.

765
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:45,900
Come back in a year.

766
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,900
Right.

767
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,900
Yeah.

768
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,900
It's fixed.

769
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,900
Yeah.

770
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:54,180
So it's definitely if it doesn't cause if it if it if it doesn't result in that, it's

771
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,780
at least the right move to make.

772
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,540
And it seems to only be setting up for success.

773
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,340
Who knows if it'll bring success, but it's at least positioning in the right direction.

774
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,580
So let's hope so.

775
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,580
I'm hopeful.

776
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,580
All right.

777
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:06,580
I'm hopeful as well.

778
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:09,740
So we declared Linux users not necessarily cheap and to stay tuned.

779
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,060
And you know, honestly, I think what you see there in the steam stats actually being reflected

780
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,660
is initial excitement and then sort of people getting like you guys are all saying, getting

781
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,660
back to work.

782
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:22,860
And what it does show you is when all the Linux users are really excited to go in for

783
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,380
some reason and maybe it's some new release or some update, you can get up to two percent

784
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,580
of steam on Linux.

785
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:35,080
Now, maybe your maybe your sustained average run rate is one percent.

786
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,660
But on peaks, if you can get up to two percent, that at least means the audience is there

787
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,660
for steam.

788
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:43,680
And, you know, it could be different members of that two percent are in there at different

789
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,420
times at any given time.

790
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,620
Their concurrent rate is only one percent.

791
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,620
That's true.

792
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,620
That's a good point.

793
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,580
I still think that could really do wonders if they could find a way to get people to

794
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,980
come back and say, hey, I've got the games I'm really excited about.

795
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,980
That's not going to change.

796
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,380
I'm not necessarily looking for new ones.

797
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:01,240
Get me something that's going to enhance my existing game experience.

798
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,420
That's why I like that natural selection too so much.

799
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:07,140
That just feels like a triple A. I turn people send me in bit messages and turn down your

800
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,860
texture quality won't crash as much on you, which always hurts.

801
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,860
Right.

802
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,660
Because on the bonobo, the first thing I do, I go in and say everything, crank crank, crank

803
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,660
everything.

804
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,660
It's out of principle.

805
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,660
Yeah, exactly.

806
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,140
I just wanted to kick a topic around with you.

807
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,820
It's not too related to Linux, but it happened today.

808
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,620
And you got to wonder, you look at Ubuntu Touch, you look at Firefox OS.

809
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,380
So I'm going to ask you, Matt, Unity Sync.

810
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,420
I got to talk about Unity Sync before we go on.

811
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,960
Our second sponsor this week.

812
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,960
What is Unity Sync?

813
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,960
We'll find out for yourself.

814
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,780
Go to derwiz.com slash Unity Sync, but I'll give you a hint since you're asking me.

815
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:41,120
Unity Sync is a centralized service that synchronizes data between different types of directories.

816
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,340
Now I don't mean like a directory on your hard drive.

817
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:49,140
I'm talking real enterprise-grade directories, actor directories, Zimbra directories, OpenLDAP,

818
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:53,140
ComniGate Pro, Oracle Internet Directory, Sun One, iPlanet.

819
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,780
Yeah, it'll do iPlanet group-wise.

820
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,380
Yeah, enough people actually asked.

821
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,700
They implemented group-wise support.

822
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:04,260
It'll also do Microsoft SQL access, Oracle, Sybase, MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, LDF, CFV

823
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,260
files.

824
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,260
Here's what you can do.

825
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,720
You can move either the entire directory or just attributes of the directory seamlessly

826
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,140
between the different directories and all from the Unity Sync service that runs on either

827
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,020
a Windows box or a Linux box and doesn't require its own database.

828
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:25,300
Unity Sync allows you to solve this problem that has plagued IT for centuries.

829
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,220
Since we have had online databases, IT has struggled with this.

830
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,220
I know.

831
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,220
I know.

832
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,220
I know.

833
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,860
I know your plight, friends.

834
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,860
I know your plight.

835
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,860
Here's the good news.

836
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,460
No scripting or programming is required.

837
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:41,180
All of Unity Sync's attribute management is handled by an easy-to-learn template system

838
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,060
requiring no programming experience.

839
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,060
However, there is a little Python under the hood, or not Python, Perl, that you can get

840
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,700
in there and do some Perl scripting if you want to do some massaging.

841
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,700
These templates are great.

842
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,540
You can make sure data is exactly what you expect.

843
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:58,500
Look, when Susie in HR updates her application because somebody changed their last name,

844
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,340
you need to get that reflected in whatever the IT database has pointed out for the global

845
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,740
directory for your entire company.

846
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,460
You want to look like one unified organization with different data stores?

847
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,420
Unity Sync solves that for you by bringing all of these things together and letting you

848
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,420
control.

849
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,740
Plus, Unity Sync's easy-to-use web interface lets you do dry runs, lets you get reports,

850
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,620
lets you just check on the status of things.

851
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:21,860
It's really quite easy and quite simple to set up, but yet extremely powerful, clocking

852
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,220
in at just under five megabytes.

853
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:29,740
This enterprise-grade software, friends, and of course, it runs on Linux, is used by some

854
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,100
really big names, including, oh, the Canadian Department of National Defense.

855
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,020
Yeah, yeah, those guys, yeah, yeah, you've heard of them.

856
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,020
What about General Dynamics?

857
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:41,660
Yeah, General Dynamics, they're a customer of Unity Sync, and they use Unity Sync to

858
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,100
move data between their different directories.

859
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:49,900
Oh, the MLB, Washington Nationals, as well, MLB Major League Baseball HQ also uses Unity

860
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:50,900
Sync.

861
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,820
You baseball fans, FYI on that one, you're welcome.

862
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:56,420
Go over to durwiz.com and check out Unity Sync.

863
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:58,900
Just go to durwiz.com slash Unity Sync.

864
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:02,980
And when you decide you want to grab it, just to try it out, you can get a free trial.

865
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,700
If you use the code LINUX, it'll extend it to a full 30-day trial, so you get an extra

866
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,820
extended trial, plus your first year of maintenance is going to be absolutely free.

867
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,620
So once you pull that trigger, you're going to be taken care of for a year, and that's

868
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,980
a really great deal.

869
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,380
So go to durwiz.com slash Unity Sync.

870
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:18,380
Check it out and be impressed.

871
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:20,140
I know it's going to solve your problems.

872
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:24,420
I have struggled with this myself, and if you're out there with this kind of problem,

873
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:26,500
Unity Sync is going to make you the IT hero.

874
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,380
So thanks to Durwiz for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

875
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,900
So I'm going to ask you, Matt, Microsoft today announcing they're buying the Nokia phone

876
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,980
division for $7.2 billion.

877
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:42,220
This is coming from, well, everywhere on the internet.

878
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,840
Stephen Elop will be stepping down as Nokia's CEO, and he'll be heading up Nokia's devices

879
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,540
and services division, which is actually going to just become part of Microsoft.

880
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:57,460
And Nokia will now focus on their Nokia Now brand, which is their mapping stuff, and their

881
00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:03,000
Nokia network services stuff, which I guess they've had some good traction lately.

882
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:11,100
And the 30,000 employees of Nokia will be joining Microsoft, and Microsoft will be taking

883
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:16,940
the Apple route and the Nexus route of developing their hardware more closely, sort of like

884
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:17,940
the Moto X or the iPhone.

885
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:18,940
Right, right.

886
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:19,940
Well, yeah, they're following Google suit.

887
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:21,140
I mean, that's exactly what they're doing.

888
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:23,420
So what do you think this means for...

889
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:25,580
So it's already a very locked down market.

890
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:31,740
I mean, you got your incumbents, Android, iOS, and Blackberry, and Microsoft in there.

891
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,700
And we were already saying, like, gosh, this doesn't seem like it's very practical for

892
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,860
somebody like Ubuntu Touch or Firefox OS to break in.

893
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:44,980
Is Microsoft becoming a phone maker?

894
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:45,980
Is this a big deal?

895
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,820
Is this going to lock it down completely, or is this a total irrelevant move?

896
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:54,620
Well, here's the problem is that, first of all, let's go to the Firefox phones, for example.

897
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,980
They've mastered grassroots.

898
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,340
They obviously have got it nailed.

899
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,800
I think they totally nailed that one.

900
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,800
So that's something...

901
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,980
They can go to eBay or something totally obscure and still get the sales happening.

902
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,980
Microsoft is under the...

903
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:11,060
I'm using a delusion that they're still relevant in this space, and it just cracks me up, especially

904
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,580
as the CEO is retiring.

905
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:16,380
Anyway, so, you know, cough, cough.

906
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,380
Yeah, right.

907
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:21,660
Anyway, so the whole point of it is that, you know, so just because you go and buy a

908
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:27,180
company like Nokia, who back in the 90s were really awesome, and they still maintain decent

909
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:31,500
numbers out of the United States, I'm sure there's still people that use those phones

910
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,180
over the borders.

911
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:37,060
But honestly, I don't really see that as being a real relevant, exciting thing because, you

912
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,660
know, the Firefox phone comes out or the Ubuntu phone comes out.

913
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,860
It's something completely unique and different that we haven't tried before, where with the

914
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:49,380
Windows phone, we already tried it, we weren't real impressed with it, so now we want more

915
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,380
of it.

916
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:51,380
It doesn't really jive.

917
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,380
I get you.

918
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,380
You know what I mean?

919
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,380
Let me give you a devil's advocate here.

920
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,220
So, okay, I'll play devil's advocate.

921
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,220
I'm in the enterprise.

922
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:59,220
I'm a business.

923
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,220
Let's say I'm a hospital.

924
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,780
I've got a lot of Windows applications.

925
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:07,940
But one of the things you can't argue is Surface RT is kind of a snore, right?

926
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:09,900
And it's crap.

927
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,780
But Nokia, on the other hand, makes fantastic hardware.

928
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:23,100
And if I had a Nokia-made Surface X86 or whatever, and I'm a doctor's office, I'm a hospital,

929
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:26,980
I've got all of this stuff already on the Windows platform, I can get these devices,

930
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:31,420
I can have them cooperate with my file formats, I can have them access my Windows file servers

931
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,580
and join the domain potentially and all this kind of stuff, I can have group policy applied

932
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:36,580
to them, etc.

933
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,700
Maybe not an RT, but on the X86 version.

934
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:47,380
Could it be that what Microsoft is going to do is sort of lock down this sector of the

935
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:52,260
market where it's a personal device, but it's a business device first?

936
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,940
And it needs to get some work done, and it needs to be compatible, and maybe this is

937
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:02,060
what they're going to do is create a hardware platform that is all of these disenfranchised

938
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:06,100
Windows 8 corporations who are refusing to go to Windows 8 eventually going to have to

939
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,100
pick something.

940
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,540
They're either going to have to go to 8 or 9, whatever it is at the time they make their

941
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,180
leap, they're going to have to switch to Linux, they're going to have to switch to the Mac.

942
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:16,620
What if Microsoft came to them and said, well look, a ton of your staff members are coming

943
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:21,900
in with iPads and Android devices, and this is driving your IT crazy, and you guys can't

944
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,220
standardize on this.

945
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:26,660
But they obviously need this functionality, it's great for meetings, it's great for taking

946
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,820
inventory, etc, etc, blah, blah, blah.

947
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,280
So here's what we're going to do, we're Microsoft, we now own this hardware company, we're going

948
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,100
to work directly with them to make a Windows product, and this is what you can move to.

949
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,020
You can have Windows on the desktop, you can have Windows on the server, and now you can

950
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:43,140
have Windows on the mobile client device, and we create all of it.

951
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:47,340
I think that if they, that's the right idea, but here's why they won't do it.

952
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,260
I mean, they should, and that would be, if you were working for them, they'd actually

953
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:53,060
be doing well, because you're right, that's exactly where they need to be, they need to

954
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:57,820
be an enterprise, and they need to make things seamless for the end user, as well as sane

955
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:58,820
for the IT folks.

956
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:02,480
Look man, I got a good piece of malware, and I need to get that across your entire organization

957
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,480
as fast as possible.

958
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,460
Exactly right, well yeah, but I mean, they can still lock it down at some level I'm sure,

959
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,060
but it's Windows, so you're still going to always have that as an issue.

960
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:14,280
But besides that, I think that yes, if they stuck with the IT market, or stuck with the

961
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:19,420
enterprise market, and really continue to master that's where they do well, that would

962
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,240
be fine, but that's not what's going to happen.

963
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,140
What we're going to see is we're going to see another commercial with dancing idiots

964
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:27,640
and flapping tablets, and they're going to try for consumer again.

965
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,640
That's the problem.

966
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,880
You see, if they stuck with what you're talking about, that would actually make a lot of sense,

967
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,020
but they won't do that exclusively.

968
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:38,360
They'll dabble in that, but the consumer market is sexy.

969
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,280
They want to be kind of the Apple folks, and when they get a new CEO in there, I think

970
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,280
that's what's going to happen.

971
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,840
I think that they're going to be like, well, we need to be more relevant in the consumer

972
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,900
market because that's really where growth is, because the enterprise market, they tend

973
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,640
to kind of lock down in segments and blah, blah, blah, blah, but you know.

974
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,640
Yeah, stagnate.

975
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,240
Yeah, I mean, I've seen banks still using Windows 2000.

976
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,360
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's bad, it's bad.

977
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,880
So they know that, so they want growth.

978
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,560
I'll ask, okay, mumble chat room, anybody in here that wants to chime in, what do you

979
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:08,640
think, is Microsoft buying up Nokia bad for the free and open mobile operating systems?

980
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,840
I'm thinking specifically Firefox OS, Ubuntu Touch, because I kind of saw them as having

981
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,800
potential inroads to the enterprise, especially Ubuntu Touch with Convergence.

982
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,720
I think that could be big in enterprise, but if Microsoft comes along and they've got

983
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,220
Nokia hardware, they've got the Windows desktop, they've got the Windows mobile crap, it's

984
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,000
all crap, but enterprises will buy it anyways.

985
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,080
It's standardized, that's why, yeah.

986
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:35,880
Is this sort of closing the door of opportunity for these up and coming mobile operating systems?

987
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,520
Mumble room, I ask you.

988
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:44,600
Not, I hope not, but as Mr. Mango also in the chat room mentioned, Nokia owns a lot

989
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:50,760
of patents and I think that Microsoft is going to use those patents to hurt Firefox and all

990
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,240
the other operating systems.

991
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,320
Oh, that's a great point, yeah.

992
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:01,760
Nokia still owns a large segment of their IP.

993
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,760
The difference is Microsoft has a 10-year reciprocal license with Nokia regarding those,

994
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:13,160
so I believe Nokia still owns a lot of its patent portfolio.

995
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,360
The Qualcomm stuff goes to Microsoft.

996
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,600
The other stuff, Microsoft has a 10-year license, I believe, with the option at some point,

997
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,560
at any point, to make it a perpetual license.

998
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:23,560
Right.

999
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:28,080
Now, regarding Nokia getting bought out, for the most part, by Microsoft, it shouldn't

1000
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,600
come to anyone by surprise.

1001
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:36,780
Back in Build 2012 and reiterated in 2013, Microsoft clearly stated that they're pushing

1002
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:41,640
more towards becoming a devices and services company.

1003
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,640
Because they've done so well so far.

1004
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,640
Yeah.

1005
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,640
Right.

1006
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,480
Well, apparently, Surface Pro is doing all right.

1007
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,760
It's just the Surface RT that's been a complete flop and everyone knows why.

1008
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,960
That's true, that's true.

1009
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:59,600
But Nokia is a very established brand, and if they could bring that level of hardware

1010
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:04,360
to Microsoft's other products, we might see a bit more success.

1011
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,680
I don't know, and I guess time will tell.

1012
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,680
Yeah, I think the patent thing is going to be the scary thing to watch.

1013
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,600
I totally agree with you guys.

1014
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,760
The patents are still owned by Nokia, and Microsoft just have a cross-license to use

1015
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,760
them.

1016
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,600
That doesn't mean they get an opportunity to use them in court against other people.

1017
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:26,320
Well, some of the Qualcomm stuff will be owned by Microsoft, and there's a lot of cellular

1018
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,520
stuff in that Qualcomm portfolio.

1019
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,800
Right, but they don't own Qualcomm license.

1020
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,680
They just are allowed to leverage the current deal that Nokia has with Qualcomm.

1021
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:37,680
Yeah, right.

1022
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:38,680
So they probably couldn't sue over that.

1023
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,680
Yeah, right.

1024
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:40,680
They can't pull the trigger on it.

1025
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:41,680
Yeah.

1026
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,680
Okay.

1027
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,680
Good point, good point.

1028
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:51,000
What I find interesting is that Microsoft used the name Nokia on their products.

1029
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,720
And Nokia can't make smartphones under this agreement until 2015, in which case they are

1030
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,560
allowed to make smartphones.

1031
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:05,660
And the announcement said that their award-winning design team manufacturing and assembly facilities

1032
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:11,520
around the world that Microsoft are absorbing, but it doesn't actually mention engineering,

1033
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,520
software development, and research.

1034
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:13,520
Right.

1035
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:16,560
In fact, I believe Nokia's lead engineer, or I mean lead designer, just announced he's

1036
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:21,320
leaving Nokia to pursue entrepreneurial opportunities, it was.

1037
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:28,040
Yeah, and that could be a good move for Yola, or Mozilla may go around hiring.

1038
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,040
True.

1039
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,040
Oh, man.

1040
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,040
In Canonical.

1041
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,040
Oh, man.

1042
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,600
That would be interesting if they snapped him up.

1043
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:37,600
And like Jarem's saying, man, am I glad QT is out of Nokia now, right?

1044
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,600
No kidding.

1045
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,080
QT has been saved.

1046
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,800
Now, what do you guys think about the kind of the elephant in the room is, so Stephen

1047
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,440
Elop, former Microsoft employee, goes to Nokia, everyone has always said, he's a Trojan horse.

1048
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,400
Now he's going to step down as CEO, and he's going to become head of devices and services,

1049
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,240
which is getting absorbed by Microsoft.

1050
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:01,800
Julie Larson Green, who had just gotten promoted in this whole reshuffle, she got like moved

1051
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:06,200
way up to the top and was reporting right to Balmer, now reports to Elop, and Elop reports

1052
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,200
to Balmer.

1053
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,240
So do you think Elop is our next CEO of Microsoft?

1054
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,240
Yes.

1055
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,520
I would say he's either that or he's going to be Arthur Cheney.

1056
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:20,480
I'm sorry, I mean, he's not, I mean, just looking at this picture, you got to have someone

1057
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,200
that's, no, he's, I can't, you got to have a nice figurehead in there, and I think they

1058
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,080
learned their lesson from Balmer that he's just not really, the consumers just aren't

1059
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,080
really buying it.

1060
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,080
You got Elop pulling the strings of some public.

1061
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,120
Yeah, I got him pulling the strings.

1062
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,320
I think he's the brand of the operation for sure, but I don't think he's the front man.

1063
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,800
I think he's behind the scenes.

1064
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:36,800
Yeah, yeah.

1065
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,800
Might be.

1066
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,560
I mean, almost anybody would be an upgrade from Balmer though, right?

1067
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,960
Oh my gosh, don't get me started.

1068
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,960
Man.

1069
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:48,080
So, Heaven's Revenge just joined us.

1070
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:51,720
Before we move off on this topic, did you want to chime in with any thoughts?

1071
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:56,960
Well, Balmer might've kept them as a, if you can hear me all right, Balmer might've kept

1072
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,560
them as a devices or a personal computer company because I don't think they're going to try

1073
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,440
to stay as a PC company for very much longer.

1074
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,440
Not at all.

1075
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:13,880
I think we're seeing them advance more towards promoting Windows Azure, which is already

1076
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,520
a $1 billion business.

1077
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:20,880
We see them bringing Office over to multiple platforms, which, lol, good luck.

1078
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,400
I don't think they're going to drop it, right?

1079
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,360
I think they're going to canonical focus a little bit on mobile.

1080
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:31,680
They're going to kind of make that shift where mobile is the priority, but desktop is an

1081
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,420
important client operating system that also interacts with some of the same cloud services

1082
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,420
that mobile does.

1083
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:41,840
I'm not saying this is a good idea, but what I'm saying is I think they see the consumer

1084
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:46,760
devices as just as critical to the success as their enterprise devices.

1085
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:53,440
Because what Balmer, at least Balmer, I believe, has felt like he's learned from Apple is if

1086
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:57,440
you get the consumers to buy the gadgets, they'll bring it to the enterprise.

1087
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,520
And so you kind of, it's like a front.

1088
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,120
You got to have a stake in the consumer space and you got to have a stake in the enterprise

1089
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,480
space because the two merge together and meet.

1090
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:10,120
So I think he's thinking, I mean, I would assume Microsoft always sees Windows as key

1091
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:14,400
to that overall strategy, but right, it's no longer going to be a Windows company, right?

1092
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:18,160
I mean, Windows is going to be part of that company, but it's just like Canonical is no

1093
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,480
longer the Ubuntu desktop company, right?

1094
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,480
Exactly.

1095
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,480
Exactly.

1096
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,440
Yeah, no, I see them just and with their heavy focus on going into basically a hardware mindset,

1097
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:29,920
someone said, well, they do hardware well.

1098
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,240
I mean, remember the Xbox and that's true.

1099
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,240
But from my memory that that division was left alone enough to where they were able

1100
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:37,240
to be successful.

1101
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:43,000
The other departments in Microsoft, not, you know, it's kind of hit and miss really.

1102
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,160
And I think Windows is probably the one that's really taken the biggest hit.

1103
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,520
So I don't know, this whole reorganization thing where Ballmer ends up, you know, he

1104
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,080
leaves, who comes in, all this sort of stuff.

1105
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,080
At the end of the day, what you're left with is they need to make a decision as to who

1106
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,320
the hell they're marketing their product to.

1107
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:59,280
I don't care if they're selling pears or bananas or what.

1108
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,640
It doesn't make any difference who's their market and they can't seem to get the brain

1109
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,640
around that.

1110
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,800
You brought up a great point that, you know, they start with the enterprise and then, you

1111
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,880
know, or they start as consumers and bring it into the enterprise or even vice versa.

1112
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,540
In Microsoft's, honestly, Apple was always strongest in consumer.

1113
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,120
Microsoft was always strongest in enterprise.

1114
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,920
They need to figure out a way to keep it in the enterprise.

1115
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,740
And if they can get it down, trickle down to the consumer, great.

1116
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:23,080
But anything to do with consumers is just going to backfire.

1117
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:27,720
One of the things that they said that was interesting is that they put out this PowerPoint

1118
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:32,160
presentation that All Things Deep posted up on their website and I don't know who this

1119
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,040
presentation was for, but Microsoft, I guess, has got to have a PowerPoint for everything.

1120
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:42,160
In the PowerPoint presentation for this acquisition, they mentioned that right now Microsoft makes

1121
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,480
$10 on average per Windows phone device.

1122
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,240
Now it's funny because I think they make more than that on an Android device.

1123
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:58,560
However, if once they own Nokia, they project they will actually generate $40 per device.

1124
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:05,000
So it's interesting to see as a licensee and they talk about how in the, they say it used

1125
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,920
to be common knowledge that the best way to have a successful platform was to license

1126
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,040
it and become the standard.

1127
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:15,320
But now we've learned that the best, now the market has changed and the best solution is

1128
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,440
an integrated approach of hardware and software and services.

1129
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,200
We're going to do it all, try to be the one all, answer all.

1130
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,320
And the problem with this is it's very against the whole Linux, Unix philosophy where you

1131
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:29,160
have a lot of tools that work together that do one thing really well.

1132
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:34,360
And I want to go back, I want to go back to when the iPhone just launched and Android

1133
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:38,960
just launched, Amazon didn't have their own mobile device, Google was totally cool with

1134
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,760
integrating with everybody, Apple didn't want to have to own absolutely everything and have

1135
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,680
an iCloud service and all this garbage so I could use Amazon for my MP3s, I could use

1136
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,680
Google for my search.

1137
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:53,380
It was this really nice, you know, now everybody has to own the whole stack, right?

1138
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:58,160
Everything has to be an integrated, custom-built solution that's custom-tailored to you.

1139
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,680
I'm just getting so sick of it.

1140
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,520
But I think there's a market for it, you know.

1141
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,200
My wife certainly is a market for it.

1142
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,120
She wants iEverything because she likes all that.

1143
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,120
She doesn't want to get an app, she just wants it to work.

1144
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,080
I think your wife would probably agree with that.

1145
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,080
Yeah, yeah.

1146
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:12,080
You know, that's kind of her thing.

1147
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,480
So there are people that definitely want that for sure.

1148
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,680
Yeah, and it's interesting too because I think we're moving, oh sorry, Miracode.

1149
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,120
I think we're moving towards a world that maybe not all users realize we're moving because

1150
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:28,600
when Angela made the switch to Android for a little while, she was like, wait, wait,

1151
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,600
wait, wait, wait.

1152
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:33,280
What do you mean I need to put all of my photos and music up on the server?

1153
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,600
I want them here on my hard drive.

1154
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,560
I don't want them up on the server.

1155
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:39,760
Why would I want to use my data to listen to my music that I already own?

1156
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,840
Why am I paying for it twice in her mind?

1157
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:46,760
And you got to figure a lot of people are smarter than we give them credit for.

1158
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,960
Sometimes people can just see the common sense of a situation and say, wait a minute, wait

1159
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:52,080
a minute, I got to buy this track and then I got to pay for the storage and I got to

1160
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:56,600
pay for the data to stream it instead of just having it sync over to my machine for my hard

1161
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:57,600
drive.

1162
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:01,200
That doesn't, for her, what was the killer for Android was that it was too dependent

1163
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,080
on Google services.

1164
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:04,640
She wanted to have everything local.

1165
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:09,060
She wanted to be able to just plug in a USB cord to her computer, click a sync button.

1166
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:11,680
Everything is copied from her hard drive to the device.

1167
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,440
There's also a strong network effect with these platforms.

1168
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:23,000
Like my daughter has been saving up her money to buy herself and she wanted an iPod touch

1169
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,800
and I said, well, how about a Nexus 4 because it's ridiculously cheap and it can do everything.

1170
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,440
And she was like, yeah, okay.

1171
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:35,000
And then when she thought about it a bit more, the reason she didn't want a Nexus 4 and she

1172
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,640
wanted an iPod touch was because all of her friends in her class use FaceTime and that

1173
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,320
would lock her out and she wouldn't be able to talk to her friends.

1174
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,640
So there's a strong network effect that once, you know, half the kids in the class have

1175
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:51,040
an iPod or an iPhone, the rest of them are guaranteed to get one.

1176
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:55,000
It's the whole ecosystem thing, isn't it?

1177
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,520
If you've got Apple's ecosystem, you're tied into it.

1178
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:03,760
The people at work, they don't want to move over to Android because they're tied into

1179
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,760
iTunes.

1180
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,760
Everything's into iTunes.

1181
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,320
The same happens with Google.

1182
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:14,720
You get tied into Google with all of those services that ship on an Android device these

1183
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:15,720
days.

1184
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,600
You can get very tied into the Play Store and you bought all your purchases in the Play

1185
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,600
Store.

1186
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,560
You've got all your email in Gmail.

1187
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,080
It's a hard thing to switch away from.

1188
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,080
Yeah, I agree with that.

1189
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:33,040
I think Miracle, you might be making the same point and so is Alex Bell in the chat room

1190
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:39,240
is iMessage gets a lot of crap, but I think it's the most understated feature and FaceTime

1191
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,240
as well.

1192
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:45,420
Although it kind of sucks that FaceTime is being relayed now, but iMessage and the thing

1193
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,840
about iMessage is different than Hangouts because Android has this now with Hangouts.

1194
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,840
In some ways it's superior because it can be opened up to groups.

1195
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:56,560
It's easy to throw Hangouts on any computer that has Chrome.

1196
01:01:56,560 --> 01:02:01,200
So Hangouts are superior in every single way except I'm a paranoid bastard and I know that

1197
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:07,060
everything I say is being stored indefinitely by Google and available immediately by a Homeland

1198
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,120
Security note.

1199
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:15,400
And it's just stupid things, but if I say to my wife, oh yeah, I'll go upstairs and

1200
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:20,120
I'll beat the children and she knows I'm joking because I would never do that, but that's

1201
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:24,520
in a text message now that is logged on a Google server forever that is being indexed

1202
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,720
by the National Security Agency potentially.

1203
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:37,120
What's to say that Apple, the biggest consumer company around, isn't also storing everything?

1204
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,840
You never know, especially with Apple and especially in a closed source environment.

1205
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,840
You never know.

1206
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:50,040
Now their docs illustrate what happens is the Apple servers essentially are involved

1207
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,280
for the initial handshake.

1208
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:55,800
So if Matt was an iPhone user and I was an iPhone user and I sent Matt an iMessage and

1209
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:01,480
that initial iMessage is coordinated by the iCloud service, whatever you want to call

1210
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:03,240
it, their push service.

1211
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:09,480
Once the two devices link, there is a key generated on each handset that is then exchanged

1212
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,540
and they then communicate directly to each other from that point forward.

1213
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:22,760
Maybe that's just because the Apple ecosystem has been directly tied into the business world.

1214
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,040
So they've had to develop that kind of encryption.

1215
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:31,600
I think when it happens to Android, they'll update it or they'll have to update it to

1216
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,560
be able to enter into that ecosystem.

1217
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,500
I think it's deeper than that by an order of magnitude.

1218
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:42,400
What I think it is is Google is inherently an internet connected company.

1219
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,920
Everything is orchestrated through the cloud.

1220
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:44,920
Everything is synced through the cloud.

1221
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:48,080
Like in Google, you don't sync your calendar, right?

1222
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:52,280
Google Calendar is the master source of the calendar you can push and subscribe.

1223
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:56,980
But Apple was a company that existed before there was an internet.

1224
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:04,000
So what Apple does, Apple is local land first and they don't have any reason to be internet

1225
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
first.

1226
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,140
For example, AirPlay.

1227
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:11,520
When you AirPlay something from an iOS device to an Apple TV, that is a direct IP connection

1228
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:14,140
from the iOS device to the Apple TV.

1229
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:18,760
But when you use Chromecast, that sends a notification message up to the cloud.

1230
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:21,840
The cloud then orchestrates the connection from the YouTube video down to the Chromecast

1231
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:25,000
initiates the play, and then the commands from your handset are sent up to the cloud

1232
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,760
server and the cloud server sends the commands down to the Chromecast.

1233
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:36,040
Potentially, each one has its advantages for sure, but one is inherently more private.

1234
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:40,760
One is inherently more private because it never has to leave your land.

1235
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:45,000
The fact that iMessage and FaceTime can in some capacities work like that and the fact

1236
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,680
that it enables free text messaging and that they support pictures and messages is a huge

1237
01:04:48,680 --> 01:04:51,200
advantage to that platform.

1238
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:56,940
So that is a lock-in that we don't even talk about when we talk about Ubuntu Touch or Firefox.

1239
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:02,160
We talk about apps, but we don't even talk about all of these services like video stores

1240
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,200
and music stores and these messaging services, Hangouts or iMessages, that are sort of becoming

1241
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:11,520
indispensable for some people.

1242
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:17,000
I think both Google and Apple are inherently evil, I just think they do evil differently.

1243
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,960
I know we get some flack for the Ubuntu Software Center, but if you buy stuff from the Software

1244
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,880
Center, they're just a bunch of PPAs and you can just log into Launchpad and get those

1245
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,360
packages back out and port them across to another Linux distro if you like.

1246
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,720
It's not so easy on either iOS or Android.

1247
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:42,760
Another thing, back to the original point regarding whether the move by Microsoft to

1248
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:53,040
Nokia is going to affect Ubuntu Phone and such, Canonical and Mozilla and Yola, they

1249
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:58,120
don't care if you use Amazon for your books and Google Music for your music, they don't

1250
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,120
care.

1251
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:05,400
It's just to create this wonderful OS that everything can coexist on and I think that's

1252
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:14,440
kind of the point we need to get back to regarding these new, I guess you could say, indie OSs.

1253
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,480
I think it also helps define their market.

1254
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,480
That's their market.

1255
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:21,640
For people that want to select and choose those individual services, folks like us that

1256
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,160
care about that sort of thing, that's attractive.

1257
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,440
I think that's great because it definitely defines that market for folks.

1258
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:35,040
My solution for this was kind of the final straw that made me roll my own XMPP server.

1259
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:41,160
I just wanted to, all of this NSA stuff has made me just, it's not that I'm worried about

1260
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,520
being monitored, it crosses my mind now.

1261
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:45,680
I think about it.

1262
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,600
I was doing a whole bunch of reading about Syria recently and then I got down a path

1263
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,040
so there's been protests outside of John Kerry's house.

1264
01:06:52,040 --> 01:06:55,920
I haven't seen that on the news so I wanted to see pictures of it.

1265
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:01,000
Now I realize I'm searching for Syria locations on Google Maps, I'm searching for chemical

1266
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,520
weapons, I'm searching for John Kerry's house.

1267
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,520
And nothing happens.

1268
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,640
But the fact that I have to worry about it makes me uncomfortable.

1269
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:12,080
And so I'm just like, you know what, I'm going to go to XMPP, I'm going to chat with my wife

1270
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:15,840
on our own private chat server so that way I never have to worry about it at all.

1271
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,040
It never even crosses my mind.

1272
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,960
It's not a distraction anymore.

1273
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:24,880
And I like that peace of mind and I like the idea that Yala or Ubuntu Touch or Firefox

1274
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:31,940
OS is more about the phone getting something on there but not necessarily locking you into

1275
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,640
any particular service.

1276
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:39,080
That to me as a customer might be their biggest advantage, that they don't have that ecosystem.

1277
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:43,440
I completely agree with that and I think the way I've always looked at privacy long before

1278
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,040
all this stuff with privacy concerns really came about is I always looked at privacy as

1279
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:53,840
a very simple analogy in that absolutely I can if I choose to stand in front of my window

1280
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:57,400
and get undressed and hop into the shower and if someone sees me it's really no big

1281
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,400
deal.

1282
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,400
Please don't.

1283
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:02,960
But I feel more comfortable if no one has to subject their eyes to that and I just pull

1284
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,440
the blinds and that's kind of where I see this taking privacy back into our own hands

1285
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:09,680
thing is that for me it's out of principle.

1286
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,440
It's just like it's none of their damn business period.

1287
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:13,440
Doesn't matter why.

1288
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,200
It's just none of their damn business and that's just my perspective.

1289
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,400
I just keep it simple.

1290
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:22,880
Alright so while we got the mumble line open I wanted to toss something around in the chat

1291
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:24,320
room and I'll watch you too.

1292
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:29,680
So something I get an email about once a day is hey the CAPTCHA isn't working on the Jupiter

1293
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,680
colony.

1294
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,840
The Jupiter colony is the form not you know Jupiter colony is kind of what we is is an

1295
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,880
overall branching title that we have for a lot of things but the Jupiter colony form

1296
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:41,280
specifically the PHP BB bulletin board that we have up at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash

1297
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:43,520
forum is retired.

1298
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,160
It's in sort of read only mode we're not allowing new account creations there's still activity

1299
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:48,160
there.

1300
01:08:48,160 --> 01:08:51,740
Partially because I don't know.

1301
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:55,800
So the main reason is I don't have the time to take care of that anymore and it just it's

1302
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:59,560
something that just needs attention from time to time and I don't have it.

1303
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:03,680
So I thought well okay social networks have kind of replaced this but then not everybody

1304
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,680
wants to have a social network account.

1305
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:09,280
Reddit kind of replaces but not everybody wants to have a reddit account.

1306
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:14,200
So we have a great G plus Jupiter colony community I really would like to have seen everything

1307
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:18,400
move from the forums to that but so many people said I don't want to use G plus.

1308
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:24,480
So what in this day and age so there's apparently some forums that the community still wants

1309
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:28,560
to organize on and discuss a subset of the community but they don't want to create accounts

1310
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,880
on some other services servers or anything like that.

1311
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:37,000
What do you use and or maybe is it our forms just dead is it just maybe time we just say

1312
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,280
goodbye forms you're in read only mode stop trying to make accounts everybody.

1313
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:44,880
I mean I kind of have but people but people are still trying to do it.

1314
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:48,480
Still trying to sign up still trying to engage in conversation in there.

1315
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:53,120
We've been in Ubuntu we've been promoting discourse which is made by the same people

1316
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,400
who make stack exchange Jeff Atwood and it's brilliant.

1317
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:04,120
We've stood up Ubuntu discourse dog and it's a really lovely way to have discussion.

1318
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:08,600
It's it it looks a bit like a forum and a bit like stack exchange it's got the best

1319
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:10,960
bits of stack exchange and the best bits of forum.

1320
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:14,080
What's the management like so like what's the up is it hosted or thinking about for

1321
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,240
a while.

1322
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:20,840
So we we run it on I think we run it on HP cloud but you know you can run it on anything

1323
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,120
it's it's it runs on Linux.

1324
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:27,760
We've written a juju charm for it so we can stand up an instance anywhere at any time

1325
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:35,520
and we we we have the the upstream developers contribute on our discourse when this is when

1326
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:36,520
I use this.

1327
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,520
Yeah this I like.

1328
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,520
Yeah I agree.

1329
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:43,760
I think this is and you don't have to sign up it uses an open ID or whatever so you can

1330
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:48,640
you can sign in with some other you know single sign on.

1331
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:49,640
That is pretty cool.

1332
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:50,640
All right that's a good recommendation.

1333
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:53,960
What's attractive and yeah like you said with the sign on that's great.

1334
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:59,160
Yeah so is this actually hosted as in could we host our own copy.

1335
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,160
Yes.

1336
01:11:00,160 --> 01:11:01,160
Okay.

1337
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,400
It's open source.

1338
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:07,160
It's something I've been thinking about for quite a while Chris because I'm I'm one of

1339
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,400
those people that try to sign up.

1340
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:14,720
I'm actually a PHP developer and I was going to send you an email actually and ask if you

1341
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:19,640
wanted something built but it's funny that you've spoken about it now.

1342
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:24,160
Yeah yeah I know I get emails about it a lot so I know it's kind of a topic of that I just

1343
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:28,360
don't really have a great forum to address a forum to address it.

1344
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:32,280
I do like this discourse thing but I guess my the fundamental question I have is is it

1345
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:33,720
still needed today.

1346
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:40,000
I mean between all the social networks the IRC a mumble server TeamSpeak servers the

1347
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,040
subreddits do we really need a forum too.

1348
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:49,800
I personally I've sworn off forums ever since the change of the last Jupiter Colony forum

1349
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:50,800
change.

1350
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:51,800
I've been through forums ever since.

1351
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,840
Dude that was like six years ago.

1352
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:54,840
Wow.

1353
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:58,360
Never have I gone on another forum since.

1354
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:02,960
Well I was thinking of maybe doing something similar to maybe have a forum but with the

1355
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,320
social networking aspect built in kind of with our own custom accounts on the Jupiter

1356
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:08,320
Colony.

1357
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,160
So how would that work?

1358
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:19,280
We would have to find some software to run it on or have somebody develop it.

1359
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,640
Well since discourse is open source why don't we just extend that.

1360
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,200
Yeah I think that's something we should look into right there.

1361
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,200
I like that.

1362
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,200
I think that's the smartest approach.

1363
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,200
All right.

1364
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,200
Well thanks guys.

1365
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:31,200
Sounds good.

1366
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,200
Thanks guys.

1367
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:33,200
So I'm going to mute the channel just for a little bit as we get to a couple emails

1368
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:34,960
then we got to run because we're running long.

1369
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:40,080
I don't you know it is it is a hard thing to get to these emails Matt but we got some

1370
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,080
good ones.

1371
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,080
Oh yeah.

1372
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:43,080
We got some good ones and I think this one came in.

1373
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:44,080
I think this one might have been on.

1374
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,880
We got some bit messages too and it was from B via bit message.

1375
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,120
Chris and Matt great job last unplugged.

1376
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:52,040
We're going with Linux unplugged now.

1377
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,040
Thanks to you clowns.

1378
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,880
I will never ever get through my podcast back catalog.

1379
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:59,920
Not only do I have another JB podcast on my list but you've turned me on to Star Trek

1380
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:00,920
podcasts.

1381
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,040
Now I get around 130 podcasts in my current queue.

1382
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,480
I guess I'll have to tell my boss that it's your fault.

1383
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,480
On the subject of mail service I've been running one for years.

1384
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:11,240
I started out running CoLab on a spark station back in the day.

1385
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:15,000
That box died about 10 years ago so I began running Zimbra on a P4 rack mount I had in

1386
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,000
the basement.

1387
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
He likes Zimbra quite a bit.

1388
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,760
He says I was getting an email from my public mail service and collected them locally however

1389
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:26,760
since ISPs had enough force I had to push the ISP had to push the force server used

1390
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,600
but I'm going to jump ahead here.

1391
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:35,120
He says that he says that he now that he's got now these really now the NSA shenanigans

1392
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,160
have happened that he's doubled down on this in light of all of that and he's going to

1393
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:42,080
set he's going to set it up for real again and maybe this time include Nagios alerts

1394
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,000
and things like that for when it goes offline.

1395
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Yeah.

1396
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Sounds pretty snazzy.

1397
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,280
I know I agree.

1398
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,360
So all right.

1399
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:50,400
So I want to read just a couple more.

1400
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:54,200
I'm going to make it quick because I promised Matt I promised we would do it so I cannot

1401
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:55,200
go back on my promise.

1402
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,200
Here we go.

1403
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:57,200
We did make that claim.

1404
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,200
Juris, Linux handhelds.

1405
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,560
Hello Chris and Matt.

1406
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:05,200
Can I share can can you share your opinion on Linux handhelds in the open market at the

1407
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,200
moment?

1408
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:11,280
Like for example the open Pandora also the I have the new GW you want to know what we

1409
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,960
thought about Linux on like handheld consoles.

1410
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:15,960
Matt do you have any thoughts on that?

1411
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:19,340
Honestly I can't speak intelligently to it because I haven't really subjected myself

1412
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:20,340
to it extensively.

1413
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,760
I think that actually is kind of an answer.

1414
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:25,080
It's kind of like I want to.

1415
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,080
I'm interested.

1416
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,080
I'm open minded.

1417
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:31,160
I know this GCW zero but it's kind of like you'll be really great.

1418
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:35,480
What would make this GCW perfect is that if good old games were just like boom that's

1419
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:38,160
our console of choice and we're now you're talking right.

1420
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:39,160
Yes.

1421
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:40,160
Right.

1422
01:14:40,160 --> 01:14:41,160
Right.

1423
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,160
Because you can run DOS box on this thing.

1424
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,280
So if you got DOS box going on this you could put you could run a ton of good old games

1425
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:51,000
and if good old games could make a package and just be like pow I really think then you'd

1426
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:55,860
really have something because the thing is is these little these little handheld consoles

1427
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:59,160
like the open Pandora and the GCW zero are really cool.

1428
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:00,160
They're open.

1429
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:01,160
They're really neat.

1430
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,160
They have.

1431
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,560
Each one of them does something unique and interesting.

1432
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,280
But the end of the day they're really going up against smartphones now.

1433
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,200
You know if you know five six years ago that maybe not have been the case but now they

1434
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:15,040
really are going up against smartphones so it's really got to stand out in some way.

1435
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,960
So I'm hopeful the GCW but we'll see.

1436
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:18,960
That would be cool.

1437
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:22,880
I love the idea with good old games because that really solves the ecosystem problem for

1438
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,040
that particular thing.

1439
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:31,280
Yeah they just got to see the light and I am a big GOG fan.

1440
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:35,040
But you know just like we've kind of seen them not really get the whole Linux thing.

1441
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,040
All right.

1442
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,040
We'll see.

1443
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:38,040
Well chicken or the egg.

1444
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,040
Chicken or the egg.

1445
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,040
Exactly.

1446
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,560
So John writes and he says I've been using play on Linux for some time now and the most

1447
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,860
part I had moderate success.

1448
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:49,680
What are your thoughts or experiences using any of these and which has worked best for

1449
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:50,680
you.

1450
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:53,360
I'd love to see some information on the subject.

1451
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:58,320
Well boy for myself as a as a rule I think wine is a fine project where developers have

1452
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,880
put in a lot of work and done wonderful things.

1453
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:03,040
As a usage thing I won't use wine.

1454
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:08,040
I will play in traffic on the freeway before using it just because it's not really my it's

1455
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,880
just not my style.

1456
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:15,960
I try to put my feet down and stick in a native environment if at all possible.

1457
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:20,320
I almost in some cases will prefer to just do full on virtualization.

1458
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,320
True.

1459
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,320
That's it.

1460
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:27,400
And this I think goes back to as a Linux user when I see something of value I buy it.

1461
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:31,980
And since the mid 2000s I don't know when I mean for a very long time I have bought

1462
01:16:31,980 --> 01:16:33,960
every release of crossover office.

1463
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:39,640
I have a current version as of today and I'm not a huge I play on Linux I've had really

1464
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:44,540
hit and miss success with but crossover if they say it works in that.

1465
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:47,760
So in crossover you first of all you get a really nice wrapper around wine.

1466
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:48,760
You do.

1467
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:52,960
You get bottles real nice so each thing you want to you get right under wine it has its

1468
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,840
own self-contained configuration you can you can load stuff into it or you can have everything

1469
01:16:56,840 --> 01:17:00,840
isolated you can have different versions so I can have an XP bottle a 2000 bottle and

1470
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,800
a Vista bottle or whatever.

1471
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:09,760
And that's how I do Star Trek Online is and once you know and to their credit once crossover

1472
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,560
said yeah we're going to support Star Trek Online it has worked solidly.

1473
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:17,480
And a lot of things are like that and sometimes their list is a little lackluster like it's

1474
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:21,160
like office 2010 is the latest but I found it to be accurate that's one thing I will

1475
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:25,320
give them props for us that if they say it works it works yeah it's you know that I'll

1476
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:26,320
give them props.

1477
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:30,000
They've expanded a community supported section now so they've got ones that users can submit

1478
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,440
that have been sort of vetted.

1479
01:17:32,440 --> 01:17:36,760
It's nice it's still not great though I mean like for example Star Trek Online takes ten

1480
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:41,080
minutes to launch once it launches it's okay but for some reason under crossover wine it

1481
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:43,120
takes ten minutes.

1482
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:49,120
I know that so I just accept it and it works fine and it's fine.

1483
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:54,640
But you know I'm with Matt I it's my it's my last resort.

1484
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:58,840
Exactly and one other thing I thought they did well is at least they used to do bounties

1485
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:03,760
so where there were you could actually chip in to help make this more compatible I don't

1486
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,620
remember if they still do that or not now but they used to be you could actually throw

1487
01:18:06,620 --> 01:18:10,040
money in that direction to say I want this particular game or particular app to run.

1488
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:12,880
I don't know I haven't tried that for a long time but yeah they had a voting system I think

1489
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,880
that's still around.

1490
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:18,080
A couple of quick things I just wanted to mention this is like pissing in the wind here

1491
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:23,640
but if anybody out there has access to a computer around them that has iTunes Linux Unplugged

1492
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:27,080
just hit the new and noteworthy section of iTunes if you give us a rating in the comment

1493
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,880
that helps Discovery keeps us kind of in the charts for a while.

1494
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:35,580
Once we're up there it helps and and the reason why I mentioned that is because if we stay

1495
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:39,140
up there for a few days we'll probably have a few new thousand people several thousand

1496
01:18:39,140 --> 01:18:42,760
people find the show and that's that's a great thing for Linux and for the network in general

1497
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:46,640
so I know it can be challenging for some of you Linux users out there to get access to

1498
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:52,000
iTunes but if it happens somehow we would appreciate a vote absolutely and that's another

1499
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,800
thing you can use wine for while you're not gonna be able to do a lot with it yeah you

1500
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,280
can probably get an older version of iTunes cross over has like an installer script for

1501
01:18:58,280 --> 01:19:02,920
that yeah yes yeah it does okay so I think that was all the emails now I was kicking

1502
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:07,680
around an idea before the show okay we don't have to do it you you have final call on this

1503
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:13,640
Matt all right a lot of the pre shows on unplugged have been Star Trek heavy talk a lot of Star

1504
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:20,360
Trek on the live show I unplugged we're recording Tuesdays a 2 p.m. Pacific over JB live TV

1505
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:27,440
which is 9 p.m. UTC I believe join us over JB live TV if you can do it what do you think

1506
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:35,360
Matt of watching Star Trek deep space 9 episode 1 before next week's unplugged and then at

1507
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:40,400
the last last like 10 minutes or so of unplugged we'll sort of wrap up all of our topics and

1508
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:44,080
we'll talk about that first episode it might just be for just like a minute or two or something

1509
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:48,440
oh absolutely no I'm totally fine if that shoot me a email reminder the DS9 challenge

1510
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:53,160
you want to the DS9 challenge okay and I that's one I'm actually my favorite out of the entire

1511
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:57,040
I actually prefer that over TNG in a lot of ways so yeah I'm I've watched the hell out

1512
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:01,640
of it so there's not a problem I I was I was really not sure what direction to go TNG

1513
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:05,800
I lean heavily toss I definitely had to consider I mean it's the original the reason I'm not

1514
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:10,400
doing toss is there's already a really great podcast out there that's talking about toss

1515
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:14,880
mission log I mentioned them before and I don't want to step on their thing and it's

1516
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:21,040
their whole show and but I need to I need to bring DS9 back into my life as a Star Trek

1517
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:26,540
fan I go through these cycles of Star Trek re-ingestation where I reprocess and re-watch

1518
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:31,600
and re-understand and I am now at that point with deep space 9 and I need to do it in order

1519
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,480
so I'm in for this the long haul as long as the audience and you are so if you guys can

1520
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:39,520
stick with it every single week I'm up for another episode I have I can somehow manage

1521
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:45,000
to watch one episode of DS9 on Netflix between now and next week I can make that happen you

1522
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:49,240
can make that commitment right yeah I can do it I can do it I'm you know I don't remember

1523
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:53,400
it was a good episode you got like some bored cube action in there you got Jean-Luc in there

1524
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:58,600
right there's a it's a very and it's really setting the pace for that first season yeah

1525
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:03,040
so we'll see how it goes we'll see how you guys respond to that and and I know I said

1526
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,520
I'd give you some more of my thoughts on the GCW zero but honestly I just haven't had much

1527
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:12,200
time to play with it since last I did play with a little more and kind of waiting to

1528
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:16,800
see my wife really likes it she thought it was really awesome she thought it was like

1529
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,340
she said I think her words were like it looks like a much more modern DS or something she

1530
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:24,240
said it looks really good so I'm gonna see how my kids react to it too because they haven't

1531
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:28,400
really done a lot of controller stuff so maybe the next week or so we'll do a little chat

1532
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:34,360
about the GCW zero sounds good alright so I'm gonna bring us through a close then if

1533
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:38,120
you want to email the show you can do that just email Linux action show at Jupiter broadcasting

1534
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:42,880
dot com we'll be watching that also you can submit things to our subreddit over at Linux

1535
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:48,740
action show dot reddit dot com and that's a that's probably your best out of all of

1536
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:51,960
your resources that's probably the best way to get something in front of us you can always

1537
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:56,460
hang out in our IRC room too of course and join us there and chat with us and don't forget

1538
01:21:56,460 --> 01:22:01,660
to join us live and subscribe and download and if you're near an iTunes machine we could
