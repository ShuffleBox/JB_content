00:00.880 --> 00:07.520
Wes's adventures with IP tables. What happened? Oh, no, I just I just had a machine running some old monitoring software

00:07.520 --> 00:13.520
I need to just it's just terrible. I'd love to kill it, but it's the thing receiving SNMP traps right now

00:14.720 --> 00:20.200
But it doesn't use I mean like wraps net SNMP, but it doesn't use SNMP trap T

00:20.200 --> 00:25.320
So it wasn't that I couldn't just have it stop listening or I couldn't set up my own proxy without having to take it down

00:25.320 --> 00:31.960
for some times, but I was able to use IP tables with the dash dash T, which I'd never used before and

00:33.480 --> 00:37.760
Then that sense it sends it over to a secondary host which then does a

00:38.840 --> 00:41.120
pre-routing rule on it to change the

00:41.720 --> 00:46.200
Where it's addressed to which then sends it off to my actual house where I'm going to capture all these so I know

00:46.520 --> 00:48.520
You know, hey, what's actually hitting this machine?

00:48.880 --> 00:53.040
But I was really it was like two commands. It was really yeah, I didn't have to oh, I know it

00:53.040 --> 00:55.520
No, that's Wes. You had me at IP tables

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
This is Linux unplugged episode

00:58.880 --> 01:00.880
190 for March 28th

01:01.240 --> 01:03.240
2017

01:13.200 --> 01:19.680
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's converting file systems in real time. My name is Chris. My name is Wes

01:19.680 --> 01:26.800
Hello, Wes. Keep your hands off my file system. Haha. I know I don't just there's actually a few file system things coming up today, but

01:27.360 --> 01:29.080
First we're gonna get through some updates

01:29.080 --> 01:33.360
There's a project that's been on the back of my mind for months that we haven't talked about

01:33.920 --> 01:37.440
Saving it a big huge change up with free NAS this week

01:37.440 --> 01:40.360
We're gonna talk about that kind of kind of fit in with some other topics that we have

01:40.680 --> 01:46.280
Coming up down the road just some overall stuff really kind of like major changes for a few projects. We talked about then

01:46.280 --> 01:49.920
I'm really looking forward to this. I'm very excited about this

01:50.640 --> 01:52.640
towards the end of the show

01:52.720 --> 01:54.720
We're gonna spend a little bit of Wes's money

01:55.680 --> 02:03.200
Yeah, yeah, Wes Wes has entered that wallet at home. Haha, you know, we've all been there like I think it's time for a new laptop

02:03.200 --> 02:06.520
Yeah, I gotta get a new computer and it this can be like a multi-month search

02:07.200 --> 02:10.240
Sometimes it can be a couple of days search depending on your situation

02:10.240 --> 02:15.060
And so this week Wes is on the search for the ultimate Linux machine

02:15.060 --> 02:18.240
we're gonna find out what his requirements are and then our

02:18.780 --> 02:24.920
Panel of Linux experts the virtual lug will chime in with their ideas on what might be a fitting machine

02:24.920 --> 02:29.680
And there happens to be some new Linux hardware releases coming very soon that may fit

02:29.680 --> 02:32.880
We'll talk about those we all of that to go through plus

02:33.560 --> 02:34.840
kind of a

02:34.840 --> 02:38.840
kind of an out there futurist kind of idea about how maybe we could

02:39.560 --> 02:45.040
Sort of take Linux and mobile Linux to the next level and some really like taking some low-end machines and just giving them huge upgrades

02:45.040 --> 02:48.280
So we'll talk about that in a little while too. So we got it

02:48.280 --> 02:51.920
I'm got some good hardware stuff got some good file server stuff coming up

02:51.920 --> 02:56.560
Got some huge project changes that people need to know about like stuff. That's like relevant to all of our interests

02:56.560 --> 02:58.600
I think it's gonna be I think it's gonna be a great show West

02:58.600 --> 03:01.960
So let's get started by bringing in that virtual log. Hello time appropriate greetings virtual log

03:07.720 --> 03:12.880
Hello, holy that was that was that was I wake you up that was a moment right there

03:12.880 --> 03:16.320
So Wes if we're gonna talk about hardware that might work for you this week

03:16.360 --> 03:22.760
We got to start with the zero terminal a tiny Linux PC that you can build using a Raspberry Pi and a smartphone keyboard

03:22.760 --> 03:25.720
Look at how cute that is. It is super cute called the zero terminal

03:25.720 --> 03:32.640
It's an all-in-one handheld computer that features a 3.5 inch screen and it gives you remarkable portability with a Raspberry Pi

03:32.880 --> 03:37.240
Yeah, you got HDMI out. You can put a big old battery in there to run this thing

03:37.240 --> 03:42.960
I don't have a tab key. That's what I want to do. Does it have an escape key? That's what you really want

03:42.960 --> 03:45.760
Yeah, and it's got a video. That's always a win

03:47.200 --> 03:50.000
Yeah, you see that? Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's your massage. Yeah

03:52.600 --> 03:55.920
This is the third iteration of the handheld Linux terminal project

03:55.920 --> 03:57.360
I've been working on for a while now

03:57.360 --> 04:01.960
Like the others the aim is to create a small all-in-one computer that is both portable and usable

04:02.280 --> 04:07.160
One of the main problems with the last version was that it took way too long to make and some of the finishing

04:07.160 --> 04:09.700
Wasn't as good as it could have been. I like this idea actually

04:10.280 --> 04:15.060
Node plans to release the files for the 3d printed parts soon. So that's kind of neat but maybe

04:15.560 --> 04:21.080
Maybe that's not really your style West. Maybe you want something more laptop style. So keep this in mind. I

04:21.600 --> 04:28.040
Also saw this week. There is like a laptop like concept where you could snap something like that in

04:28.040 --> 04:29.920
So you take a like a standard laptop?

04:29.920 --> 04:34.280
Maybe in this case the Acer travel mate. Yeah, sure and you cut it open

04:34.280 --> 04:37.480
and so you get it off eBay and you install a

04:38.280 --> 04:43.840
Raspberry Pi into this thing and take advantage of its keyboard its screen you can use HDMI to drive the display

04:43.840 --> 04:47.440
You can hook up keyboards and stuff like that and you put a Raspberry Pi inside a laptop

04:47.880 --> 04:50.960
Okay, I'm just putting these out here as options. I know you're in the early that first one

04:52.360 --> 04:53.880
That actually

04:53.880 --> 04:57.280
Would be you like that because you can put it in the pocket. Yeah, you could put it in the pocket

04:57.280 --> 05:00.460
I like that idea too. Okay, there's a few of these out there right now

05:00.460 --> 05:04.840
There's one we covered on last recently too that's trying to build that in your pocket computer

05:04.840 --> 05:10.120
That one was a more straight-up like we were gonna run Ubuntu and I don't I can't remember if it was arm or not

05:10.120 --> 05:16.280
Yeah, a GPD pockets pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah, that's what it was. Do you remember William? Is that arm? It's just an atom

05:16.280 --> 05:21.040
No, it's just like cheap low-end atoms like five watts or something. It's meant for like tablets and phones

05:21.160 --> 05:26.360
Yeah, the GPD is atom and the Gemini is arm and these are all kicking around right now

05:26.360 --> 05:34.840
They're both being crowdfunded at the moment. Yeah. Yeah, isn't that funny? Yeah, the GPD is like really funded like 2.5 million raised

05:34.840 --> 05:38.620
Yeah, yeah. Yeah 1200 percent over their goal. Yeah

05:41.240 --> 05:43.240
You have with these days

05:43.520 --> 05:50.100
All right, so wait, okay, so it's been so funded man because at what point does it become a liability, you know

05:50.100 --> 05:55.280
Like how how can they fulfill all those orders, you know, they were expecting to fulfill a few thousand now

05:55.280 --> 05:59.360
They've got to fill a few tens of thousand. That's just a logistical nightmare

05:59.360 --> 06:04.120
So that's what's kind of put me off the GPD. So here's it looks awesome. So that's a great point Joanne

06:04.120 --> 06:08.000
So here's what I want to do because we have a unique opportunity Todd from purism is joining us right now

06:08.000 --> 06:11.320
So I want to get to him because I think you could be our resident expert on crowdfunding

06:11.320 --> 06:15.640
But at first before we go to Todd, I wanted I want to ask wimpy. Are you hedging your bets?

06:15.640 --> 06:23.000
You're you're backing two different portable hardware devices. Like you sir are crazy. What you must really want this form factor

06:23.000 --> 06:27.260
I do really want this form factor. And also as I've said before just recently

06:28.120 --> 06:29.680
Bitcoin is

06:29.680 --> 06:31.680
Trending really nicely

06:32.160 --> 06:40.440
I'm making a few luxurious purchases around backing. Yeah, I've also bought something old and crusty as well

06:40.440 --> 06:43.040
Which I can talk about later if you're really yeah, I am

06:44.400 --> 06:51.800
So I saw the GPD and I thought that looks very interesting and I'm sort of 5050 as to whether or not we'll ever see it

06:51.800 --> 06:57.940
Because there's a lot of renders and maybe they've now they've got you know, loads of backers there. Maybe it'll happen

06:57.940 --> 07:04.380
Well, we'll we'll see what happens, but I'm not sure it's a little bit almost shady some of it. Yeah

07:05.180 --> 07:06.540
the actual

07:06.540 --> 07:08.060
prototypes now

07:08.060 --> 07:14.580
Yeah, yeah, though they have shipped a product in the past that's very similar and it was on indiegogo and it did ship

07:15.140 --> 07:20.580
Yeah, too many hackers. So they do at least have successful products in the past sure that were crowdfunded

07:20.580 --> 07:26.220
It was it was when it was first announced that there was lots of renders and not much substance and it was just a little case

07:26.220 --> 07:31.820
We're indiegogo. Yeah. Anyway, so that's that one's that looks interesting, but then the Gemini

07:32.500 --> 07:37.380
Again, so this is an organization that really has sort of previous in in this area

07:37.740 --> 07:40.020
They've worked in this space a lot before

07:40.820 --> 07:47.860
And I bumped into them at MWC as well. So I had the had the opportunity to press the flesh

07:47.860 --> 07:49.540
so

07:49.540 --> 07:57.220
Yeah, I I've backed that because I think that that I think that will probably arrive later than they're hoping because they don't have all

07:57.220 --> 07:59.220
of the manufacturing pipeline

07:59.460 --> 08:03.300
Arranged yet unless they get you know, really good at that and that all comes together quickly

08:03.900 --> 08:08.880
But I think when that one ships it will be the better device in terms of the way

08:08.880 --> 08:14.520
It's designed and the ergonomics and things. Yeah, okay. It's interesting to hear how everybody now

08:14.520 --> 08:19.820
I think we've all sort of we've shifted our expectations in what we get from crowdfunding here

08:19.820 --> 08:21.820
Everybody's like well, this is kind of rolling the dice here

08:21.820 --> 08:24.500
But Todd I wanted to toss to you first of all

08:24.500 --> 08:28.380
Welcome to Linux unplugged and to Joe's point when you have phenomenal success

08:28.380 --> 08:31.700
You have almost you've almost gone too far. You can't as a small company

08:31.700 --> 08:38.980
Is it difficult to sort of now meet that demand which could start with what could possibly start a whole snowball effect of bad PR

08:38.980 --> 08:43.700
Struggling for a new company. What are your reflections on this story Todd?

08:44.460 --> 08:47.020
Yeah, well, thanks for having me on

08:48.220 --> 08:53.420
So it obviously is a can be a challenge crowdfunding is you know?

08:53.580 --> 08:58.400
Still really relatively new as a way to start a business and a lot of times

08:59.860 --> 09:03.060
What will end up happening is, you know, especially if they're just you know

09:03.060 --> 09:06.740
If we're talking about like a developer who says hey, I always want to do this or they get together with their buddies

09:06.740 --> 09:12.540
And they're like, yeah, we think we think our cost is probably around, you know X dollars and what ends up happening is

09:13.620 --> 09:17.820
To operate a business. Of course, it's you know, it's X times four usually

09:18.980 --> 09:21.580
right, so it so that's one of the things that

09:22.340 --> 09:28.180
Tends to to underfund you meaning on a per quantity basis. So they might know a lot of

09:29.860 --> 09:31.860
Projects that

09:31.860 --> 09:38.660
That they get overfunded and oversubscribed which of course is a great problem initially when you think hey, this is awesome

09:38.660 --> 09:40.660
People are really excited what we're doing

09:40.820 --> 09:46.580
but then I think to Wimpy's point was that when you're actually looking at a per

09:47.020 --> 09:51.580
Cost per item that you need to start scaling your operations, right?

09:51.580 --> 09:53.580
You have to start dealing with how you're managing inventory

09:53.900 --> 10:00.380
Right the entire operational side of things which a lot of those types of campaigns don't end up having so it

10:00.380 --> 10:01.620
you

10:01.620 --> 10:06.980
know the sadly a crowdfunding track record is is not as good as

10:07.780 --> 10:12.460
As we'd all like it to be because obviously it's such a great way to you know to get these things

10:12.580 --> 10:16.420
Off the ground and you know see projects and it's sort of a new way to start businesses

10:17.020 --> 10:19.020
really what they tend to do is

10:19.980 --> 10:27.140
kind of stay in the hobby area or obviously, you know delivery is I think I think I could safely say that

10:27.140 --> 10:30.340
99% of the projects are delivered late

10:31.580 --> 10:35.140
Because that's just you know, the nature of the beast, especially when you're dealing with hardware

10:35.140 --> 10:35.740
Yeah

10:35.740 --> 10:36.260
Yeah

10:36.260 --> 10:41.300
especially it seems to when it's something that's pushing the edge a little bit where you might have to get manufacturers on board with

10:41.300 --> 10:44.660
A new idea or a new way of doing something or shipping in a way

10:44.660 --> 10:49.820
They've never shipped before it seems like the the the difficulty gets exponentially tougher

10:50.300 --> 10:56.340
Do you agree with that assessment Todd? Yes, I think you're exactly right and and so like in our case

10:56.340 --> 11:00.820
We actually I've had a previous company use the same exact supply chain

11:01.620 --> 11:02.820
and

11:02.820 --> 11:04.820
but that's that

11:04.900 --> 11:10.460
You know just made it where I had the contacts to be able to do things that we were trying to do

11:10.620 --> 11:15.180
But but you know, we obviously had a lot of learning curves along the way

11:15.860 --> 11:17.860
Mostly it was around

11:18.780 --> 11:21.820
You know delivery times or what products were actually available

11:21.820 --> 11:28.100
And obviously even one of the things Chris that you might remember is that we were originally slated to get 4k screens

11:28.180 --> 11:31.300
So we said yeah, we can do 4k screens because we heard from the supply chain

11:31.300 --> 11:34.060
We can do 4k screens and then that ended up turning into

11:34.860 --> 11:41.220
You know constant delays because the the actual source manufacturer of Samsung was getting bought up by

11:41.620 --> 11:43.620
much larger suppliers

11:43.900 --> 11:48.820
Or much larger buyers and so so we kept kind of falling to the back burner

11:48.820 --> 11:52.180
and then at some point we just had to you know, cut our losses and say, you know

11:52.180 --> 11:55.660
what we're gonna have to we're gonna have to ship what we can right now and then

11:56.260 --> 11:57.860
and then

11:57.860 --> 12:05.620
Basically place another order with a more reliable supply chain. So it really that supply chain management is an area that is

12:06.980 --> 12:08.980
Really difficult to manage through

12:09.060 --> 12:15.620
you know and now we ended up after we've just because we've grown to the point where we can have a really solid supply chain and

12:15.620 --> 12:18.740
Through negotiation and really to some degrees trial and error

12:19.460 --> 12:21.460
But a lot of the new new

12:22.660 --> 12:26.840
Crowdfunded campaigns that that is I think wimpy's point is exactly right when you start to get

12:27.900 --> 12:33.820
Oversubscribed then they introduce all sorts of new problems, right? It's not just like a hobby putting this together

12:33.820 --> 12:37.820
They're trying to actually now start to form a business and if they didn't get their pricing, right?

12:38.300 --> 12:40.060
It could end up being

12:40.060 --> 12:46.020
That that they won't be able to actually fund the entire process, right if they don't have if they don't have

12:46.620 --> 12:48.620
experience working with manufacturers and

12:49.180 --> 12:52.220
Like to your point which I don't really think a lot of us think about

12:52.580 --> 12:57.180
if they get to a certain size now all of a sudden they have to also have experience with managing inventory and

12:57.260 --> 13:04.380
Tracking support issues and support staff that if you don't have the past experience standing those groups up and integrating those employees into your business

13:04.620 --> 13:05.180
You know

13:05.180 --> 13:09.300
It's gonna be a huge learning curve while you're also trying to ship the product that you just promised everybody

13:09.300 --> 13:11.580
It's like zero to medium-sized business today

13:11.580 --> 13:16.620
So I'm glad wimpy is risking the Bitcoin on it because I really want to see both of these be successful because I love the form

13:16.620 --> 13:19.220
Factor idea totally. So thanks with me. Yeah

13:19.300 --> 13:24.340
Yeah, and you know if I end up with two of these then one will be for my daughter. So that'll be fun. That's nice

13:24.340 --> 13:28.580
Yeah, that's that's brilliant. Well Todd. Thanks for being here and I hope you stick with us

13:28.580 --> 13:30.180
We got a whole bunch of stuff coming up

13:30.180 --> 13:34.020
I just want to give a quick heads up to folks that may be using last pass

13:34.140 --> 13:37.380
I've been looking at different password managers recently if that wasn't obvious and

13:37.380 --> 13:38.900
And

13:38.900 --> 13:45.220
It's that time again, and I keep coming back when it comes to mobile integration and stuff like that. I keep preferring last pass

13:45.780 --> 13:47.460
So I this applies to me

13:47.460 --> 13:52.640
I don't know if some of you are out there but over the weekend a Google security researcher reported a new client side vulnerability

13:52.900 --> 13:55.900
So this is in the browser side, which could be potentially dangerous

13:56.900 --> 14:00.860
There is an update now last pass is not giving us the details

14:00.860 --> 14:04.420
Maybe those tech snap guys will keep an eye out for the details on what the actual vulnerability was

14:04.420 --> 14:06.900
But right now as of yesterday

14:07.740 --> 14:12.420
The the word from last passes is just update and we'll tell you all the details soon

14:12.460 --> 14:17.100
Or maybe Google actually will because a lot of times that Google project zero blog. Yeah sure has that stuff

14:18.420 --> 14:22.060
Speaking of tech snap we should mention more often that you can find more of mr.

14:22.060 --> 14:27.380
Wes on the tech snap program was it last week you guys did a deep dive was it or is the week before last week?

14:28.060 --> 14:32.300
Broke from the traditional format and did a deep dive into bacula, which is such a badass

14:32.300 --> 14:38.980
Backup system that Dan knows very well. Yes, he does. Yeah, he's a bacula guy and I tell you what?

14:38.980 --> 14:43.780
If you've ever been curious about a really rock-solid backup system, it can do bare metal restores

14:43.780 --> 14:45.180
It can do individual file restores

14:45.180 --> 14:48.060
It can it can really manage a lot of day sets of data

14:48.540 --> 14:52.340
Bacula and check out the last week's episode tech snap about it, which is an open source. I

14:52.980 --> 14:57.940
Used to use bacula. Oh, really? Yeah, I used to use it to back up a company that sold antivirus

14:57.940 --> 15:01.740
Nice yeah, that makes sense and it works great for something like that. Yeah, and it was perfect

15:01.740 --> 15:06.460
It really was so that's a different time. You don't know now I might use it with digital ocean

15:06.460 --> 15:09.180
I could picture it digital ocean comm go over there

15:09.180 --> 15:10.780
In fact do me a favor after you sign up

15:10.780 --> 15:15.900
You can get a $10 credit and support the show by applying the promo code do on a plug to your account

15:15.900 --> 15:19.100
I like the way that this works too because you can you fund the account?

15:19.100 --> 15:24.020
Yeah, so this is just one of the funding methods you can find it with PayPal or credit card or probably pixie dust

15:24.020 --> 15:28.900
But use the promo code. I'm not sure about that last one do unplugged one word you get a $10 credit

15:29.340 --> 15:33.540
You can spin up a linux rig up on their infrastructure all SSDs for the storage

15:34.740 --> 15:37.940
Wes it makes a difference. It sure does you know what also would help with that bacula thing

15:37.940 --> 15:42.300
They're private networking dude you mean for like backing up your own droplet stuff

15:42.300 --> 15:47.120
Yes, because also that's brilliant a because then your backup server isn't on the public net

15:47.120 --> 15:53.300
But be the transfer all over the private networking doesn't count towards your total data transfer. Oh, that's money right there

15:53.300 --> 15:55.580
That's a good idea yeah check that out

15:55.580 --> 16:00.500
So one of the many great features of digital ocean go over there use our promo code do unplugged and spin up a rig you

16:00.500 --> 16:03.940
Can try out bacula for just a few pennies on the dollar if you want to run it for a few hours?

16:04.220 --> 16:07.180
Try out the $5 rig two months for free it's gonna be all SSD

16:07.180 --> 16:10.420
So it's nice and fast and if you want to back up to digital ocean

16:10.420 --> 16:15.260
They have block storage which you can add up and add up and add up and just keep growing as you need or even reduce

16:15.260 --> 16:19.300
Or this is brilliant didn't realize this until recently move it to another droplet

16:19.300 --> 16:25.540
Freaking mind-blown in the context of backups freaking mind-blown

16:25.540 --> 16:28.780
It's and that's just the beginning to if you're into this kind of stuff

16:28.780 --> 16:31.900
You might also fight you might also favor their new monitoring system coming soon

16:31.900 --> 16:34.620
It's gonna be coming I little birdie tells me very soon

16:34.620 --> 16:39.260
And you can sign up for early access when you go to digital ocean comm go there create an account big

16:39.260 --> 16:43.300
Thank you digital ocean have a great interface for managing all of this an API that really works

16:43.300 --> 16:50.780
Hell of a good service at digital ocean comm use our promo code do unplugged and thanks to them for sponsoring the unplugged program

16:51.520 --> 16:53.520
okay, so I want to talk just briefly about

16:54.500 --> 16:57.820
File servers, I know I know some people's eyes are gonna glaze over

16:58.220 --> 17:01.740
But there's one that we don't talk about very much, and I want to give it a little love right now

17:02.060 --> 17:07.060
And that's rock store. I've mentioned it once before but a couple of days ago. I missed it first

17:07.100 --> 17:09.300
They had a new release and I think it's worth mentioning

17:09.300 --> 17:14.140
Because they've put a ton of release a ton of effort into this they have now six contributors coming together

17:14.500 --> 17:21.160
To work on bug fixes and performance improvements the code quality is from what people tell me has had a big jump in this one

17:21.620 --> 17:24.340
They've had a lot of improvements to their Python back-end stack

17:24.340 --> 17:31.300
They are still and this could be actually I think a feature to some of you all in on butter FS for the NAS file server

17:31.700 --> 17:35.540
File system so if you're a big fan of butter fest which people remain fans

17:35.540 --> 17:42.540
This is a great file server for you potentially they also seem to offer some some commercial products or offerings

17:42.540 --> 17:47.860
I'm not totally familiar with support available as well. Yeah, maybe we'll make you feel a little more secure. Yeah

17:48.540 --> 17:50.900
But if that's file system underneath so rock store

17:50.900 --> 17:55.980
Just had a had a new release with which sounds like a lot of nice refinements and improvements

17:55.980 --> 17:59.980
Which is pretty much exactly what you want from your NAS yeah now on the other end

18:00.660 --> 18:02.020
there is

18:02.020 --> 18:05.740
Free NAS coral, which is also known as free NAS 10. This is a

18:06.300 --> 18:10.820
Massive release in my opinion for free NAS. It's it's big

18:10.820 --> 18:18.260
It's it's sort of in some ways a total revisioning of the way the UI works. It's got a brand new slick UI

18:19.100 --> 18:21.840
it's got a rewritten middleware architecture and

18:21.840 --> 18:31.840
The big and probably one that has gotten the most discussion changes. There's they're transitioning from using jails for plugins to

18:32.440 --> 18:37.860
Using Docker can say what Docker containers isn't that a Linux the Docker?

18:38.480 --> 18:43.040
containers with full ZFS integration and a new command line and

18:44.220 --> 18:48.200
There is some caveats if you're migrating from free NAS 9

18:48.200 --> 18:51.600
Your plugins that you have installed via jails. They don't get deleted

18:52.320 --> 18:58.840
They just get deactivated and you'll have to kind of come up with your own solution to maybe converting those into Docker containers

19:00.200 --> 19:06.760
Now this is this is interesting because I think this is probably one of the biggest competitors in this sort of rock store sort of Linux

19:06.760 --> 19:09.680
You know the household date. Yeah. Yeah friend free NAS is

19:10.680 --> 19:14.680
Making huge changes and along those are also some of the changes on the back end team

19:14.680 --> 19:19.560
Jordan Hubbard, who I've had the pleasure of meeting and watching a presentation on free NAS 10 at

19:20.080 --> 19:23.400
meet BSD who seemed to me a big part of the project he's

19:24.640 --> 19:26.400
He's moving on

19:26.400 --> 19:32.600
Now he was the main dev. So he's also the CTO of IX systems. So that's a that's a big change

19:32.600 --> 19:35.960
He's sounds like he's you know moving into something that he's gonna be super passionate about so

19:36.800 --> 19:42.240
He's going into I think like that. Yeah, he says the nanotech biomedical field. It's a complete career change

19:42.240 --> 19:46.400
Wow, yeah, yeah, which that's got to be nice from time to time. So really reinvigorate. Yeah

19:46.920 --> 19:51.960
Good for him, but it's got to be a huge change also back in December. They had another long-time

19:53.240 --> 19:58.520
Free NAS developer who was with free NAS since version 8 7 years

19:59.160 --> 20:01.440
He's also moving on from free NAS

20:01.440 --> 20:06.440
So some big changes Jonathan says that he will not be or Jordan not Jonathan. Sorry, Jordan Hubbard

20:06.440 --> 20:12.360
Jordan says that I don't know Jonathan Jordan Hubbard says that he won't be a developer anymore, but he'll still be part of the community

20:12.360 --> 20:17.120
So Jordan's still gonna be in the you know as a user, right says he'll be filing bugs and yelling at those devs

20:18.120 --> 20:24.640
And some people have speculated. Well, is this because of all of the breakage from upgrading from free NAS 9 to 10, but I

20:26.120 --> 20:29.480
Don't buy it. I don't buy it because free NAS free NAS

20:29.480 --> 20:33.560
9.10 is still available for download still supported like you don't have to upgrade

20:33.560 --> 20:39.720
Yeah, and you can roll back your upgrade if it goes wrong, so I don't really buy that like Jordan was pushed out

20:39.720 --> 20:44.840
Which is what read it there right at the reddit conspiracy theories right now that the free NAS 10 was such a failure that it pushed

20:44.840 --> 20:49.240
Jordan out which seems a little a little over the top, but if he was just pushed out

20:49.240 --> 20:54.680
He'd probably go to a company with similar interests or do something in a similar vein not change careers completely

20:54.680 --> 20:56.800
Yeah, I agree. I just I don't know

20:56.800 --> 21:00.040
I think what it was is he what he worked on this until it was done

21:00.040 --> 21:03.640
And he got you know something he sort of got it some stuff wrapped up, and now he's a natural type

21:03.640 --> 21:06.120
It's like it's like a nice smooth transition. Yeah

21:06.840 --> 21:08.840
and it I

21:08.880 --> 21:13.560
The but all that is my way of saying there is there is some there is some

21:14.600 --> 21:18.000
Some pushback on this new release this free NAS coral. I'm sure there is yeah

21:18.000 --> 21:24.240
And I wonder if things like unraid or another Linux out-of-the-box file server could step up to fill the gap

21:24.240 --> 21:27.520
I don't know a free NAS is got a pretty big lead at this point and

21:27.520 --> 21:32.280
Like I said version 9 still perfectly good still perfectly usable still perfectly

21:32.280 --> 21:37.120
But you do have to wonder I mean there was even a question to the Texas program about what's that support cycle gonna be which I?

21:37.120 --> 21:41.720
Was I'm sure it's gonna be very reasonable. You know especially since there's a community around it

21:41.720 --> 21:42.840
That's what it seems not that worried

21:42.840 --> 21:47.320
But you do have to think like you know like you've been talking about like if you're planning in the next five years

21:47.320 --> 21:50.240
I mean it would probably still work for that time frame, but ten years

21:50.800 --> 21:53.840
What do you think about Docker? I mean that's an interesting

21:53.840 --> 21:59.520
Interesting the doctor just win right there the doctor just win like I can't see it from their perspective of does that

21:59.520 --> 22:04.160
Much easier like if it's packaged at Docker is it now pretty easy for them to make sure it works in their environment

22:04.160 --> 22:09.360
Versus having to put together plugins with their own custom jail format that kind of thing

22:11.160 --> 22:18.000
To me it seems to represent like sort of the industry even even the people on the BSD side of the fence coming to a

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
recognition that

22:19.000 --> 22:24.040
Well, if you want to be able to distribute software that runs across multiple platforms

22:24.840 --> 22:26.240
Dockers

22:26.240 --> 22:30.920
Just the container technology we're gonna use and it's not so much that they're like betting on Docker so much as they want to

22:30.920 --> 22:38.120
Make all of the stuff that's already in a container available to free nas so they instead of having reaches

22:38.120 --> 22:42.800
Yeah, instead of having to have a plug-in author who creates something specifically for a free nas now

22:42.800 --> 22:45.480
Just exactly Joe free nas using a container

22:45.480 --> 22:50.240
Specifically for a free nas now just exactly Joe free nas user can pull down a Docker container

22:50.240 --> 22:55.680
Do we know yet how they're doing it? Is it using it's probably still using jail. That's what I would others

22:55.680 --> 23:00.960
It's just that the Docker format gives you this like universal format to package the thing up with and then she you know

23:00.960 --> 23:03.080
I wonder I don't look controls that just work

23:03.080 --> 23:06.700
I wonder because the way they say listen to the way they put this

23:07.440 --> 23:13.440
Support for Docker containers its own built-in hypervisor that supports virtualization with full ZFS integration

23:13.440 --> 23:18.120
So to me, it sounds like they're using a hypervisor to run this and they would have like a Linux kernel

23:18.120 --> 23:23.080
It'd be you think they're able to run Linux Docker images. This is where they're going with this. They are Linux dockers

23:23.160 --> 23:27.920
No, they are Linux dock because you're because they're making it available for you to pull down pre-created Docker containers

23:27.920 --> 23:31.560
Then it's probably yeah beehive with Linux running on top of it. Yeah

23:32.400 --> 23:36.200
That's to me is a huge statement. Yeah. Hmm. Don't you think?

23:37.960 --> 23:39.680
That's pretty cool

23:39.680 --> 23:44.560
That's sort of like when Microsoft started shipping Docker support and bash on Windows. It's just sort of like this

23:44.920 --> 23:49.680
Linux is the runtime Linux is the runtime and however you get that runtime on your machine sure

23:49.680 --> 23:53.200
Yeah, and the container technology is the is how you get the runtime right now

23:53.200 --> 23:56.960
But it's really but those half of those containers are running Ubuntu, right?

23:56.960 --> 24:03.040
So it's it's really Linux is the platform. Yeah, and in a lot of those cases, it's Ubuntu 70% There you go

24:03.040 --> 24:04.040
Yeah

24:04.040 --> 24:10.000
So it's that's that I think they came up with a way to run Ubuntu on free NAS

24:10.000 --> 24:11.120
Let's look more into this

24:11.120 --> 24:14.360
I'm very curious about it because I wonder if it'll create any pressure for their

24:14.800 --> 24:17.720
Compact layer to implement those primitives, you know

24:18.120 --> 24:20.440
Is they're just using beehive with a Linux kernel, right?

24:21.800 --> 24:23.800
Didn't have to run a whole hypervisor

24:24.560 --> 24:28.120
Support like OCI or other types of things that suddenly you could have like hey

24:28.120 --> 24:33.160
I want to run for BSD as my you know base platform for Kubernetes or whatever most reliably

24:33.160 --> 24:35.500
Using the hypervisor route is probably the best way

24:35.500 --> 24:40.760
Yeah, don't yeah to start and maybe down the road they allow you to pick whether it's using the ABI or using a hypervisor

24:40.760 --> 24:43.440
Yeah, and I think that's what Microsoft is doing up and at

24:44.120 --> 24:46.800
230 the file system upgrade just finished on the phone

24:47.200 --> 24:52.320
So in from to hot. Yes. There you go. The real the file system in real time is completed

24:52.320 --> 24:57.120
Oh, geez, now I got to sign in. What is this crap just for one point release?

24:57.840 --> 25:00.480
Does this mean if Ubuntu is running on freedom?

25:00.480 --> 25:06.040
Yes, does that mean we can get snaps running as well? Well, if you I wouldn't you if you could run Docker containers on there

25:06.040 --> 25:08.080
Couldn't you just run essentially like a small Ubuntu system?

25:08.800 --> 25:13.320
And that's the stage. Yeah, you could and you could make snaps on it as well if you wanted to

25:14.240 --> 25:20.120
Fascinating that is interesting. I really want to see what the web UI I've looked at the early betas

25:20.680 --> 25:25.400
I would don't know they have supported this do you all right? So it would make sense that they might

25:25.400 --> 25:29.700
Yeah, they have another built-in via they have a section called VMs, right? Exactly. Exactly

25:29.840 --> 25:32.200
It's just that's what I would think it just another built-in VM

25:32.280 --> 25:35.800
So it's something I think I'm gonna play around with now that I can get Linux on my free NAS

25:35.800 --> 25:37.800
This is a game changer for me

25:38.200 --> 25:41.560
But it's a big controversial feature in the free NAS community right now. Oh, I'm sure

25:42.160 --> 25:47.760
All right. Well, there you go. I thought that was oh, oh and by the way, if you are going to upgrade

25:47.760 --> 25:49.760
Let me see I have

25:49.760 --> 25:56.440
Somewhere in this mess of show notes. Here we go. I have a migrating from free NAS 9 to free NAS coral

25:57.280 --> 26:02.320
Entry on the free NAS wiki place that covers all of it and like issues you have

26:04.600 --> 26:07.560
Especially for using encryption maybe just give this a read doesn't sound like it's gonna be too complicated

26:07.560 --> 26:12.480
But probably stuff you should be aware of so check that out. I have all that go try the new version

26:12.480 --> 26:15.160
I'd love to hear you think about it. Do you have a file server at home?

26:16.280 --> 26:18.280
not anything

26:18.280 --> 26:19.800
pre built like this

26:19.800 --> 26:25.400
Hmm. I have a I have a box that has a container that runs my router and that it has a container that you know

26:25.400 --> 26:30.480
Yeah, if you just if you just built a big desktop PC, you could put a bunch of disks in it

26:30.480 --> 26:33.440
I sure could and you could just use that

26:34.080 --> 26:37.600
Like a double duty. Hmm. All right, listen to that. We're gonna talk about your new machine

26:37.600 --> 26:41.320
We're gonna go spend your money here. We're gonna go spend your money here just about now actually

26:41.320 --> 26:44.000
So, uh, I think it's just about time. Let's so let's do that

26:44.000 --> 26:48.760
Let's let's actually let's mention Linux Academy Linux Academy comm slash unplugged then we're gonna go home man

26:48.760 --> 26:52.680
West see my favorite thing to do is to spend other people's money and I'm gonna get you set up much more fun

26:52.680 --> 26:53.600
We're gonna get you hooked up

26:53.600 --> 26:57.280
We're gonna get you hooked up with a good machine and then when you're ready to put that machine to use and you want to

26:57.280 --> 27:01.560
Do more I want you to go to Linux Academy and learn more Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

27:01.560 --> 27:05.280
You land there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial

27:05.280 --> 27:07.280
It's a platform to learn more about

27:07.280 --> 27:15.120
The Linux with self-paced in-depth video courses hands-on real-world scenarios that help shake off that test anxiety because you've got actual

27:15.120 --> 27:16.560
Expertise I love it

27:16.560 --> 27:19.400
They spin up the lab server when you need it you SSH into that shenanigans

27:19.480 --> 27:25.600
You get a real environment seven plus Linux distros you choose from the servers and the courseware. I'll snap

27:26.280 --> 27:29.960
See what I did there to that distro. I'll snap to that distro

27:29.960 --> 27:33.120
You can also take practice exams to like prepare for a cert test

27:33.120 --> 27:37.960
You can get note cards have been forked by the community improved you get nuggets

27:37.960 --> 27:42.880
Which are just tiny bits of wisdom you just do a little deep dive into a singular topic for five minutes or an hour depending

27:42.880 --> 27:45.960
On the subject which is great when you've got a busy week speaking of busy weeks

27:45.960 --> 27:49.520
They have course schedulers to work with you to help match content to your busy

27:50.040 --> 27:56.840
Schedule a community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting members downloadable tools like guides and lesson audio that you can take with you

27:56.840 --> 27:59.440
iOS and Android apps to study on the go damn

27:59.440 --> 28:04.040
Damn, the list just keeps getting longer and longer, and they're always adding more courseware

28:04.040 --> 28:05.960
You can just look at their Twitter feed to see that

28:05.960 --> 28:11.640
It's just it's so awesome that something like this where you sign up once and then they just keep working their butts off to get

28:11.640 --> 28:17.160
You more and more stuff Linux Academy comm slash unplugged and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

28:17.680 --> 28:23.660
Linux Academy comm slash unplugged so if we're not gonna do the Raspberry Pi with a keyboard for you Wes

28:23.680 --> 28:27.940
It sounds like you are what can you tell people what you got right now give people a base?

28:27.940 --> 28:30.080
So they know what you're coming from right now. I've got a

28:30.960 --> 28:32.920
core i5

28:32.920 --> 28:40.520
Was it second generation third what generation is this one? I think first that might be my first yeah first gen XPS

28:40.840 --> 28:46.040
Yeah, with a I think that was the first gen i5 yeah 13 inch screen 13 inch screen

28:46.040 --> 28:52.000
And what's the resolution of the screen 13 whatever yep? Yep, so that's the icing on this horrible cake

28:52.000 --> 28:55.600
Oh my good, which at home. I have external monitors, so it's not that big of a deal

28:55.600 --> 29:00.160
But has the monitor hookup display port yeah, okay, all right, so that'd probably still be the same. Yeah, so that's fine

29:00.160 --> 29:05.040
I'm SSD SSD and four gigs eight gigs four gigs of room. Oh my god. Oh

29:06.000 --> 29:09.640
My god, okay, wow yeah, we really got a talk

29:10.960 --> 29:17.160
So 13 inch now. What do you like most about that form factor? I mean it is very convenient. It's not a heavy machine

29:17.360 --> 29:21.560
It's easy to throw in a bag. I think I could do up to a 15-inch

29:21.560 --> 29:27.040
As long as it wasn't you know crazy. I would like to like you don't be able to easily take it to a coffee shop

29:27.040 --> 29:29.520
Or a bar to do some work, okay, okay?

29:30.080 --> 29:34.080
All right, well see I was I was going to recommend. I was gonna recommend something a little bigger

29:34.080 --> 29:39.900
I was gonna recommend you've ever seen this Acer here with the with the 20 inch curved screen

29:44.920 --> 29:50.960
Okay, maybe not maybe not it looks like it has a nice keyboard though are those is that like a real keyboard yeah, man

29:50.960 --> 29:55.880
Yeah, yeah, that's legit right there. Not the dumb pad not the dumb. No. It's the rest. It's like a mechanical keyboard

29:55.880 --> 30:00.440
That's also the numpad actually comes out and can be a trackpad. Oh wow it flips over

30:02.520 --> 30:08.080
Yeah, isn't that sweet so not that that's too big yeah, so what do you like least about the form factor?

30:08.200 --> 30:11.040
Did you feel constrained on the screen and you must oh yes?

30:11.040 --> 30:14.140
So it's not it's not that bad like I honestly spent a lot of the time

30:14.140 --> 30:17.120
I have like you know a chat program or two

30:17.120 --> 30:20.800
But once at a time a terminal and a web browser, so it's not that bad

30:20.800 --> 30:23.840
But when I'm away from home, and I'm trying to do some development

30:23.840 --> 30:28.400
Which I need you know like a couple terminals and a web browser then suddenly I'm all tabbing over the place

30:28.400 --> 30:32.680
It's you see okay, so on not just because they're friends of the show

30:32.680 --> 30:34.680
But it seems like something like the galago pro

30:34.960 --> 30:41.120
Would be a pretty strong contender for you what you have to decide here is do you want to go bigger than 13 inch screen or

30:41.120 --> 30:43.780
Not because I think that's that's the classifier

30:43.780 --> 30:47.300
It sounds like you're leaning 15 inch I mean

30:48.820 --> 30:54.620
The 13 inch I like 13 14 even I think I think I would be okay with a 15 inch

30:54.780 --> 30:57.740
That's where it kind of forks the discussion. Maybe a little bit as well

30:59.140 --> 31:02.660
Do I also want to consider building a new desktop rig right?

31:02.660 --> 31:07.300
Okay, I haven't built a desktop and a desktop or or you know maybe not of the laptop

31:07.300 --> 31:12.060
I guess there's both option. I would still like a new laptop

31:12.060 --> 31:17.140
but if I have a nice desktop at home that beats I could have a you know a different yeah, I would probably want a

31:17.140 --> 31:18.260
13 inch or

31:18.260 --> 31:22.820
But how are these options with Thunderbolts e GPUs and I'm gonna be for your laptop

31:22.820 --> 31:25.340
So here's what I think so I think we should I think we should do this

31:25.340 --> 31:28.380
I think we should do this since people at home are probably thinking some of the same stuff

31:28.380 --> 31:35.220
I think we should break that particular the desktop into a separate conversation because I think we can quickly get there because I think that might

31:35.220 --> 31:41.060
Be the way to go. Although although there are some super nice laptops. Like is it called Kratos?

31:41.060 --> 31:46.260
Is that how you pronounce it wimpy the Kratos Kratos? Yes, it's the entroware Kratos

31:46.260 --> 31:52.240
That looks like a nice real. Yeah, if you're on this side of the Atlantic so in Europe

31:52.980 --> 31:56.440
They've just released their new updated version of that which

31:57.180 --> 32:01.780
Is an i7 and it goes up to 32 gigs of RAM and it's got an Nvidia

32:01.780 --> 32:04.780
1050 in it GTX 1050

32:05.900 --> 32:07.900
15 inch display that matters

32:08.460 --> 32:14.640
Yeah, 15 inches kind of tasty. I think I think Wes you really deserve dedicated graphics if you can

32:15.660 --> 32:17.660
There's something there's another route you could consider

32:18.580 --> 32:21.140
This is something I know you've been looking at. That's why I bring this up

32:21.140 --> 32:24.820
So audience behind the scenes Wes has been reading up a little bit about using

32:25.380 --> 32:30.220
Say like a Thunderbolt cable to hook up an external GPU. You could also go this route

32:30.220 --> 32:34.860
So if we go if we if we keep this in mind, this also opens up your your possibilities

32:34.860 --> 32:36.940
I just don't know how well this kind of thing works with Linux

32:36.940 --> 32:42.860
I'd love to know if anybody in the audience or in the Mamba room has any any information about external Thunderbolt

32:43.240 --> 32:49.500
GPUs with Linux looks like WWS get something you do www. I got something on the windows side

32:49.500 --> 32:57.740
Okay, so from I've only seen one person on YouTube actually test what Thunderbolting an external video card

32:57.740 --> 33:04.180
What the performance is actually like and from that one series of like two videos?

33:04.780 --> 33:09.740
It's a 30 to 40 percent decrease from desktop performance

33:10.100 --> 33:17.860
For a 4 to 12 percent gain and that is if you're using the monitor hooked up to the external

33:18.660 --> 33:24.620
Right right GPU unit. So I mean that's all windows your performance could vary wildly

33:24.620 --> 33:31.660
Very you happen to know what what connection interface they're using if it was Thunderbolt 2 or 3 because I mean I think it was

33:32.100 --> 33:33.100
Thunderbolt 3

33:33.100 --> 33:36.660
Wow, I think most of the gear is Thunderbolt 3 driven

33:37.500 --> 33:42.420
Thunderbolt 3 those 40 gigabits it is it what's cool is if you get a laptop that has the Thunderbolt 3

33:42.420 --> 33:44.500
But it also has the reverse feed display port

33:44.500 --> 33:47.540
So the graphics card can feed a display port back in and power the screen

33:48.420 --> 33:53.100
Because like the Apple I want to say just the MacBook or the MacBook Pro can do that

33:53.100 --> 33:54.980
And I know there are other laptops

33:54.980 --> 33:59.340
I think like the razor blade and stuff can do that where you can plug in the external GPU and still use the laptop

33:59.340 --> 34:04.300
Monitor with the external GPU feeding it instead a lot of people in the chat room have been suggesting razor blade

34:04.300 --> 34:09.580
Have you looked at razor? I have done. I mean, I'm really aware of the price. Aren't they horrible with Linux though?

34:09.580 --> 34:11.580
Are they are they so?

34:12.660 --> 34:19.220
see this is this is this is the thing Wes is I I would I would encourage you to really get your head around what screen

34:19.220 --> 34:20.940
size you want and

34:20.940 --> 34:25.700
Really draw the line somewhere for me personally over the years having right next to me

34:25.700 --> 34:30.980
I have my Librem right right now and I and I have the Apollo and one is a 13 inch and one is a 15 inch and

34:31.340 --> 34:33.660
It if I want something that I take on the couch

34:33.660 --> 34:37.740
I like the 13 inch if I want something that I'm gonna work from I like the 15 inch

34:37.740 --> 34:40.140
It's just so it's really what you're gonna use it for. What are you gonna?

34:40.140 --> 34:44.260
Is it more of a work machine or is it more of a browse the web have fun machine?

34:45.900 --> 34:47.720
Honestly probably more of a work machine

34:47.720 --> 34:51.940
I mean, I will use it in a casual capacity but portability do you take it with you to work?

34:52.380 --> 34:57.980
Not to work, but I like to work out of the house a lot of my own personal projects show work that kind of thing

34:57.980 --> 35:03.920
Yeah, that's where this really fails. How much time do you spend looking at the screen when you're doing that sort of stuff?

35:05.360 --> 35:06.740
What do you mean?

35:06.740 --> 35:11.620
When you're working on your own stuff and you want to use it, you know for working on your own projects

35:11.620 --> 35:15.820
How much time might you be spending at the computer then those those moments?

35:15.820 --> 35:20.220
Uh, I would say anywhere from two to six hours. Whoa

35:20.740 --> 35:25.700
Depending okay. Jeez. I can't believe you've put up with that resolution for this long. I would not I would not man

35:25.700 --> 35:28.500
That's gotta be rough. Well, that's how I find myself here today

35:29.740 --> 35:32.340
Good for you. I'm really proud of you for taking so what?

35:32.980 --> 35:37.420
So I've effectively got the same machine. I've got a 13 inch and a 15 inch variant

35:37.420 --> 35:44.620
so it's the 13 inch XPS and the 15 inch XPS and the 13 inch XPS is what I take out when I'm going

35:44.620 --> 35:48.480
Traveling that's the device. I sure because it's small. It's powerful

35:49.300 --> 35:51.300
It's no compromise

35:53.180 --> 35:58.900
But for extended periods working on that machine, it's not so great because 13 inch screen

36:00.140 --> 36:03.700
You do find yourself, you know, you can't quite get close enough to it now

36:03.700 --> 36:07.100
That's probably compounded by the fact that that's a high DPI screen

36:07.100 --> 36:15.100
That's right. So I've actually been thinking about potentially selling that XPS 13 and getting the version with the

36:15.420 --> 36:17.180
1080p screen

36:17.180 --> 36:19.340
Because I think that would be better to work on

36:20.220 --> 36:22.740
For longer periods. Oh, yeah, that's an interesting point

36:23.660 --> 36:27.580
Yeah, and I'm not like I don't need a touchscreen. I don't have I mean, they're nice

36:27.580 --> 36:31.140
I would maybe occasionally use it but not a deal breaker

36:31.140 --> 36:38.500
I says it looks like razors working the razor core which is their external eGPU with a 970 in it hooked up to an XPS

36:38.500 --> 36:44.340
13 running on arch looks like it's working to power an external monitor. That's in the XPI, you know interesting

36:44.340 --> 36:48.060
I really like these most links for that somewhere. He put in the chat room. I

36:48.660 --> 36:54.780
Really like I really like the XPS 13, but if it was my only computer

36:54.780 --> 36:58.180
I would probably opt for the 15. Yeah, and wimpy

36:58.180 --> 37:01.380
What was the battle like to put because this thing only ships with Windows

37:01.380 --> 37:03.980
So what was the what was the process like to put Linux on?

37:03.980 --> 37:09.220
Is it just a format nuke pave install Linux or is there some did you replace Wi-Fi and whatnot?

37:09.820 --> 37:12.220
so I got my

37:13.140 --> 37:18.260
machines both from Adele reseller and they were able to sell the

37:18.460 --> 37:26.460
XPS 15 with a configuration that had the same Wi-Fi chip in it as the XPS 13 developer edition

37:26.460 --> 37:28.700
So I didn't have to do any

37:29.580 --> 37:34.860
Monkeying around it obviously arrived with Windows 10 on it, which was actually quite helpful because

37:35.700 --> 37:38.660
Around the time I got mine sort of September last year

37:38.780 --> 37:42.740
they were just working out the last of the firmware bugs in the BIOS and

37:43.140 --> 37:44.940
So you did it anyway?

37:44.940 --> 37:47.540
So yeah, I needed to do the updates anyway

37:47.540 --> 37:53.060
So it was quite handy to have that do the updates and then it's just been running Ubuntu ever since hmm

37:53.060 --> 37:59.160
Hmm. Yeah, I I wonder if even now if the latest model even would have if you'd have to replace the Wi-Fi

37:59.740 --> 38:03.420
That may not be an issue anymore. Yeah, and I mean I'm comfortable doing that

38:03.780 --> 38:09.660
It'd make me happier if it had a if it had a 10 series card. It has a GTX 960. It's not a hard swap

38:09.660 --> 38:12.700
I've done it. You just take the bottom off and it's right there

38:12.700 --> 38:17.860
It's not a hard swap at all and you can just get a replacement card on Amazon for like 35 bucks 60 bucks

38:18.180 --> 38:22.980
But that seems like that seems like a decent way to go. Alright, so that is I so

38:22.980 --> 38:26.780
You're so if you go if you go into like the 15 inch range that you know

38:26.780 --> 38:28.540
There's some there's some nice machines there

38:28.540 --> 38:34.200
but you said something that I think is probably the more exciting thing to consider because it's something I've gone through myself is

38:34.340 --> 38:39.740
What if I do something like an ultrabook or even this is crazy, but even like a chromebook

38:39.940 --> 38:40.420
Yeah

38:40.420 --> 38:44.940
And then I get myself like a six core or more I seven machine

38:45.100 --> 38:50.580
32 gigs of RAM lots of storage and you just go all out and plus it's kind of fun if you haven't done it for

38:50.580 --> 38:52.580
A while to build a PC like when's the last time you built a PC?

38:52.580 --> 38:56.980
Ages yeah ages. Yeah, it's like seven years or something. So if you've been on laptops for years now

38:57.660 --> 38:59.660
Okay, so we got to talk about this because I did this

38:59.980 --> 39:05.700
There's like a gaming rig kind of thing, but it's not like new has a nice graphics card, but older processor

39:05.700 --> 39:10.540
So yeah, it's not where you're working. It's not where I'm working. No. Yeah. Hmm. Okay. All right, so

39:11.340 --> 39:16.100
So I I I recently made this transition myself where I was on all laptops for years

39:16.100 --> 39:19.260
Even the machines here at the table, right? Oh, yeah looking back at it seems

39:19.260 --> 39:22.980
Really crazy. Yeah ludicrous. It seems ludicrous

39:23.580 --> 39:27.420
Absolutely ludicrous and now cuz now you just it blows my mind

39:28.220 --> 39:31.940
Yeah, so let's ludicrous. That could be your new handle Chris ludicrous

39:32.740 --> 39:34.340
Like that

39:34.340 --> 39:39.220
That's not bad. That's not bad. You know, what else is ludicrous ting go to linux.ting.com

39:39.220 --> 39:42.340
You'll save twenty five dollars off your first device and support the show

39:42.340 --> 39:47.780
If you already have a GSM or CDMA device that works check their BYOD page you get twenty five dollars in service credit

39:47.780 --> 39:52.820
That's nice because it's six bucks for the line and then just your usage on top of that for minutes messages megabytes

39:52.820 --> 39:57.340
I was having a telegram conversation today with I think it might have been it might have been Cory

39:57.340 --> 40:01.840
I can't remember it on telegram. You see Chris is my mom does not want data on her phone

40:02.500 --> 40:04.100
And he says can I use ting anyways?

40:04.100 --> 40:08.900
I said actually thing would be perfect because you can just go in and completely turn data off

40:08.900 --> 40:11.500
I guess I guess his mom like had a bad experience with data

40:12.580 --> 40:17.100
Happens but and not Brent Spiner data, but what that one time you get that extra bill. Yeah

40:17.100 --> 40:22.140
Hey, that's it. I just want phone calls. And so he goes in there can turn it right off boom

40:22.140 --> 40:23.780
That's the thing team makes it so easy

40:23.780 --> 40:27.780
And if you do want it, it's super easy to set like hey, let me know what I've crossed this boundary

40:27.780 --> 40:29.980
Yeah, or if you just want to turn it back on just go check a box

40:29.980 --> 40:31.540
They got apps for the phone to manage all of it

40:31.540 --> 40:36.500
They've also got a great website and customer service that really sets the bar you get to talk to real human beings

40:36.540 --> 40:40.580
So all of that combined with the fact that they're a really cool company with geeks that work there

40:40.580 --> 40:43.580
They're really into this stuff and they follow stuff like on their blog all the time

40:43.580 --> 40:48.180
They've got the moto g5 plus available now for pre-order that could be kind of quick

40:48.180 --> 40:52.960
That could be kind of a cool device. It's got two. It's got a two gigahertz octa-core processor four gigabytes of RAM

40:54.980 --> 40:59.620
It's like around what I think it's like what 300 bucks for a nice moto smartphone with

41:00.260 --> 41:05.500
With damn four gigs of RAM. Damn. I think that's as much as the iPhone's got as much as my laptop

41:05.500 --> 41:10.620
Oh, that's so horrible. Oh my god. We got out. We got a talk West. We got a talk

41:10.620 --> 41:13.420
All right. Thank you to Ting for sponsoring the show Linux dot ting.com

41:13.420 --> 41:18.420
Oh, yes, I tell you when I made that transition from I know what these are nice laptops, right?

41:18.420 --> 41:25.980
Yeah, but no bo's XPS is you have been for laptops now. No, they're good. Yeah, I five I seven processors SSDs

41:26.620 --> 41:31.940
This is why I thought and like the bonobos, you know for a while. They were dedicated GTX 510

41:31.940 --> 41:36.220
And like the bonobos, you know for a while. They were dedicated GTX graphics cards

41:37.620 --> 41:39.580
What could that in my mind?

41:39.580 --> 41:45.020
I understand that some of these things are clock slightly slower and they run slightly slower for for for heat, right?

41:45.220 --> 41:51.580
But in them not necessarily in the bonobo, I I don't I couldn't really conceptualize that there would be a

41:52.340 --> 41:57.900
noticeable difference in my day-to-day usage couldn't really I even in my main workstation upstairs. I was using a laptop and

41:57.900 --> 42:02.780
I'm not just doing that, you know and filter editing show editing. Yeah

42:03.300 --> 42:08.540
Try and reviews and then when when it came time like I think I guess it was last year

42:08.540 --> 42:11.580
I can't like was it last year the year before we built new rigs for the last week

42:11.580 --> 42:16.340
Yeah, and I one of the things I can if I if it's possible whenever I can I'll buy two of everything

42:16.340 --> 42:18.140
So that way we have a backup because we're live right?

42:18.140 --> 42:23.540
I want to have a production machine and a backup machine. And so I bought and so you know what?

42:23.540 --> 42:28.300
What if we're gonna build these anyways, I'll buy a third one because I mean I'm like I'm using Bitcoin, right?

42:28.300 --> 42:31.100
It's not like I'm using actual cash here. It's not real money. So it's like

42:32.540 --> 42:35.220
Yeah, looking back at it has it been money for ages

42:36.380 --> 42:41.260
anyway, so we build a third one slightly nicer configuration because it's my personal workstation and

42:42.220 --> 42:47.380
Put it in and I sit down to start working on it and now looking back at it

42:47.380 --> 42:55.620
It is it's it's a it's a totally different computing experience. Wow. There is a just a it's something about the just the amount of

42:55.780 --> 43:03.460
Sheer work. I can have this one system doing because not only am I doing like things like video encoding and editing and transferring large

43:03.460 --> 43:04.980
Files around the network all at once

43:04.980 --> 43:10.380
I've also got YouTube streams telegrams like all this regular desktop my email my web browser like all this huge

43:10.380 --> 43:15.980
I've got all this regular desktop stuff going to and then in the back end. I've got usenet. I've got indexers

43:15.980 --> 43:19.780
I've got downloaders extractors. I've got I've got sonar monitoring feeds

43:19.780 --> 43:24.540
Like I've got all this other server stuff that this thing's doing that in the past would have been like on its own dedicated machine

43:24.540 --> 43:29.900
And it's doing that all of it while I'm doing all this other stuff and it never misses a beat and it's just the sheer

43:29.900 --> 43:35.100
Amount of productivity I get out of one machine. I for my main computer. I will never ever

43:35.700 --> 43:38.300
Well, I shouldn't say that I cannot

43:38.940 --> 43:44.060
Yeah, I cannot see me going back to laptop for my main work. That's a pretty that's a pretty strong opinion

43:44.060 --> 43:47.580
Plus it takes the pressure off the laptop pick right which is so hard just right

43:47.580 --> 43:51.020
Yeah, it doesn't have to be perfect anymore. Just has to yeah fill that niche

43:51.020 --> 43:55.420
So that's anybody in the mumble room have a opposite or similar experience like, you know

43:55.420 --> 43:59.320
You switch over to a desktop and it's just a totally different amount of work you get done for me personally

44:00.020 --> 44:03.740
Especially working with video and stuff. I love the fact that I can start an encode job

44:03.740 --> 44:05.600
I get I just gonna run for 15 minutes

44:05.600 --> 44:09.020
I switch over to another desktop and it's like you start even worry about it don't not at all Wow

44:09.020 --> 44:15.380
So as someone who's building a lot of software, it's invaluable to have like a dually five machine sitting in a closet somewhere

44:16.140 --> 44:20.700
Sort of SSH and for my laptop to be able to build software on 32 threads. Yeah

44:22.620 --> 44:24.900
My my bill I just have to change into everything

44:25.520 --> 44:31.540
My build machine is my intro where Athena which is an absolute monster. So that's a laptop

44:31.940 --> 44:33.940
And it's my gaming laptop

44:33.940 --> 44:39.780
But when it's not being used for gaming which is infrequently it sits on the desk behind me during the day

44:39.780 --> 44:43.080
And that's the machine that I do all of my builds and what have you on?

44:44.620 --> 44:46.220
See that would be nice because

44:46.220 --> 44:50.900
That's a big machine like the one I used to be able to get like a nice ultrabook with a huge battery say like

44:50.900 --> 44:56.940
An x270 from Lenovo and be able to go 13 hours without plugging in and you're just SSH ing into your powerful box

44:57.100 --> 44:59.960
So you can get a lot of work done, but still go forever on battery

44:59.960 --> 45:05.760
It would be nice as well to have that kind of home base because I don't find this laptop

45:05.760 --> 45:10.240
Especially like when I format it for the show or distro reviews or whatever like it's just not that consistent

45:10.240 --> 45:14.600
So it ends up that I have to promote some like cloud server or droplet or other thing to be my kind of like

45:14.640 --> 45:19.840
That's where I do ansible runs from that's where my main backups from my sink thing are taken or whatever

45:19.840 --> 45:21.840
That might not be a bad strategy

45:21.880 --> 45:22.440
Yeah

45:22.440 --> 45:26.680
But it would be nice for some things to have like a home base that I could that's like me is like I just end up

45:26.680 --> 45:30.480
There's some things. I just want to run on my local machine. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I think you should

45:30.480 --> 45:34.320
I think you should give the idea a serious consideration because if you've made it this long on this machine a

45:35.000 --> 45:41.480
Fairly modest laptop would be a pretty big spec bump so you could do a modest laptop bump and really invest in the desktop

45:41.480 --> 45:43.480
You know it's not it's not all fun though

45:44.040 --> 45:48.320
You know I also I mean you you know we got a stack of dead motherboards right there that right there is a

45:48.680 --> 45:52.000
It's not I don't feel like it's quite as good as it used to be I feel like I get a lot more

45:52.000 --> 45:57.440
Dead-on-arrival parts when I when I custom build now than we used to but you know I guess

45:58.080 --> 46:00.280
It doesn't seem like it's as big as an industry find to me

46:01.520 --> 46:07.240
Yeah, so Wes how important is battery life to you um I don't need like

46:07.920 --> 46:12.320
Crazy battery life. I would like you know like five plus

46:12.960 --> 46:14.320
More would more would be nice

46:14.320 --> 46:18.800
But I am usually in a position where I could find power or know of you know like my favorite

46:18.800 --> 46:22.280
Establishments to work have a pretty readable power outlets that sort of it

46:22.720 --> 46:26.280
Right so the reason I asked the question is when I got my

46:26.800 --> 46:33.280
Entrower Apollo I suddenly walked into a new era of battery endurance that I'd not

46:33.640 --> 46:39.640
Experienced before and I got used to having like seven hours plus battery life, and that was pretty great

46:40.280 --> 46:45.080
When I got the XPS 13 I was looking for

46:45.080 --> 46:48.880
Touchscreens and high DPI because I wanted to play with all the new toys

46:48.880 --> 46:55.840
right and I I'm somewhat jaded because the the trade-off there that you make is

46:56.320 --> 47:00.480
Battery endurance because those high DPI screens and the touchscreen

47:01.400 --> 47:09.220
Just arriving in more power. Yeah, so I I will get comfortably four and a half hours on the XPS 13

47:09.220 --> 47:17.180
Maybe five at a push, but nothing more than that and that's another reason why I've been considering for the

47:17.540 --> 47:22.620
for the XPS 13 perhaps the 1080p model which

47:23.740 --> 47:30.100
Doesn't have the touchscreen has a low res screen and the battery life is almost double. Yeah. Yeah, I think I could do

47:30.100 --> 47:32.100
That's my observation as well also

47:32.900 --> 47:38.580
You just there's more Linux software that works better at at right regular DPI

47:38.580 --> 47:40.140
You cannot you can definitely make it work

47:40.140 --> 47:44.860
Especially if you're working with cute five apps or GTK three apps you really you're gonna have a fine

47:44.860 --> 47:48.740
You're gonna have a fine experience, but almost all of them will screw it up out of the box

47:48.900 --> 47:51.020
So you're gonna you're gonna have to make some tweaks

47:51.220 --> 47:55.940
But and I still I still I'm making small refinements to my plasma desktop on the XPS 13

47:55.940 --> 47:58.940
I would I would also agree if you if you don't need it

47:58.940 --> 48:04.460
I personally think it's you know, I don't know of any laptops that have the screen resolution, but 2k is perfect

48:04.460 --> 48:10.860
Yeah, perfect. Yeah, perfect. It's perfect. Hmm. I really wish we had more 2k screens on laptop

48:10.860 --> 48:13.060
The other thing to consider is on the high DPI

48:13.260 --> 48:19.980
laptops most of the 13 inch laptops when you've pixel doubled them are like the equivalent of 1600 by 900 in terms of

48:20.260 --> 48:28.020
You know, yeah usable, you know equivalent resolution. Yeah, so you actually have more screen space on a 1080p

48:28.020 --> 48:30.020
hmm when we know it's

48:30.020 --> 48:36.060
I'm just I'm just mentioning these things because these are things that I hadn't considered going into my purchasing decision

48:36.060 --> 48:38.480
Yeah, I'm now aware of having having made it

48:38.480 --> 48:41.580
I mean I wanted to I in fact, I still want I still want a machine

48:41.580 --> 48:44.780
I can try out high DPI stuff on for review purposes. Yeah, no that makes sense

48:44.780 --> 48:46.580
But if you're not doing that, I don't know

48:46.580 --> 48:49.940
Depends like most of my time is at the terminal maybe some like photo editing

48:49.940 --> 48:52.140
But if I had a desktop I could do that there too. Yeah, dude

48:52.140 --> 48:54.940
You can also get a 2k screen for a reasonable price on the desktop

48:54.940 --> 48:59.980
That's so I have the new x1 carbon is a 2k screen 14 is it? Oh in case you're curious lick

49:01.300 --> 49:03.300
What now I might have to sell something

49:05.420 --> 49:10.740
It's like the infinity display right it's got the thin bezel. Yeah, we were just talking about in the pre-show that pretty cool

49:10.940 --> 49:12.940
Take a look at it. Excellent

49:13.620 --> 49:17.980
See charging on the new ones. Oh, I love that. I'm that would be that would be awesome

49:17.980 --> 49:21.820
That would feature the XPS 13 and this that way see charge. Did I take Bitcoin?

49:21.820 --> 49:24.500
Seriously, cuz yeah that oh

49:27.340 --> 49:31.100
70 I'm curious if that also type-c charges off the type-c port on it

49:31.100 --> 49:33.860
So I'm so done with John to type-c me too

49:33.860 --> 49:39.740
I was just having a conversation last night with Noah about how I just want everybody to go all in on USB C

49:39.740 --> 49:41.740
Let's just do it. Yeah

49:41.820 --> 49:44.140
That's why when I saw the Gallego ultra pro with the new one

49:44.580 --> 49:47.820
See, I was like you guys you better fix this before you ship this

49:47.820 --> 49:51.180
I would really love to see them have USB C on that. Maybe the next rev can do it

49:51.180 --> 49:55.700
I'm not sure why they can't do it now, but it is time. It's time for cameras. It's time for everything

49:55.700 --> 50:01.380
I want I want to charge my remotes with USB C my phone with USB C my camera my laptop

50:01.380 --> 50:03.940
The thing that did it for me was I bought one of those battery packs

50:03.940 --> 50:09.820
But it had one that you could use to jumpstart a car on it and it was chargeable and it used USB C

50:09.820 --> 50:15.940
So I was like so in theory if I had my phone I could charge this battery from my phone and then start my car

50:15.940 --> 50:21.700
Maybe yeah Wow drain your phone though. Yeah, but whatever I can go drive somewhere. Yeah, exactly

50:22.620 --> 50:29.220
Okay, somebody at Chris Ellie asked me a Lenovo reseller that sells the x1 carbon with the end accepts Bitcoin

50:29.300 --> 50:34.040
Okay. All right. So there's there's that now wimpy though. You were teasing earlier that you got new hardware

50:34.040 --> 50:35.820
You got something a new device

50:35.820 --> 50:40.500
Yes, I have I can't tell you much about it other than what it is, but I have bought a

50:41.060 --> 50:43.060
an old computer

50:43.060 --> 50:45.900
I have bought an IBM x200

50:46.820 --> 50:49.860
But this x200 has Libre boot

50:51.220 --> 50:53.560
It's an FSF approved laptop

50:54.000 --> 50:57.740
Now this is a brand new purchase. Oh, you just got you got this old new device

50:57.740 --> 51:04.940
This new old arrived it arrived today and other than getting it out of the box and the bubble wrap and turning it on

51:04.940 --> 51:06.460
I haven't done anything with it

51:06.460 --> 51:13.580
well hasn't that just isn't that just perfect because Todd's here and I just recently saw news from from purism about

51:13.780 --> 51:18.580
Work on Libre boot Todd. Can you bring us up to speed what's going on over with with Libre boot?

51:19.820 --> 51:21.260
Yeah, so

51:21.260 --> 51:27.460
Well Libre boot of course is just the port from core boot that removes the binary blobs. So right, right

51:27.460 --> 51:32.640
So so which which I guess to I guess can you back up and explain more binary blobs of what?

51:33.220 --> 51:34.360
so

51:34.360 --> 51:35.860
Anything that's built?

51:35.860 --> 51:39.820
Pre 2008 you can actually have a core boot

51:40.540 --> 51:43.580
Running without any binary blobs, which are of course

51:44.140 --> 51:46.320
mystery code that runs at the BIOS level

51:47.180 --> 51:53.300
And obviously this is getting more and more attention. Yeah, especially with vault 7 releases where about 90% of those

51:54.140 --> 51:56.140
security based exploits were

51:56.700 --> 51:58.580
EFI or UEFI

51:58.580 --> 52:00.580
exploits so

52:00.580 --> 52:07.180
And then obviously so one of the biggest ones and the biggest worry is called the Intel management engine

52:07.780 --> 52:11.060
Then there's also something else called Intel AMT

52:11.420 --> 52:16.040
That is that actually allows for remote access of your machine when it's even powered off

52:16.100 --> 52:20.700
So those are a couple of things that are binaries at the lowest level

52:20.780 --> 52:25.700
And the way that I like to describe that is basically from a security standpoint. It's kind of how deep do you go?

52:26.460 --> 52:28.940
and so some people, you know, they'll just like install a

52:28.940 --> 52:33.900
You know ad blocker and they think that they're you know happy as it can be

52:34.420 --> 52:35.460
And then you know

52:35.460 --> 52:38.200
Then you can go deeper down to the operating system where you you know

52:38.200 --> 52:41.740
Do you have binaries that power your wireless card or your graphics, etc?

52:41.740 --> 52:45.400
and then you can go deeper than that which of course gets you to the bootloader and then the

52:45.540 --> 52:51.880
Lowest level is the firmware on the machine, which of course is the BIOS or EFI or in our case is core boot

52:51.880 --> 52:53.340
so we actually just

52:53.340 --> 52:57.340
ported core boot for the Purism Vibram laptops and

52:57.340 --> 53:00.520
And and then we have also

53:01.180 --> 53:05.560
What's called neutralized the management engine which means we've removed the network stack remove the kernel

53:05.620 --> 53:12.940
So we have a very small bit of code to reverse engineer or actually just get to the point where we can disable the management

53:12.940 --> 53:15.020
engine and at that point we'd actually qualify for

53:15.820 --> 53:20.760
Respects your freedom certification on a brand new i7 6th gen

53:21.940 --> 53:23.740
CPUs. Yeah

53:23.740 --> 53:27.780
Yeah, that that's that's how I feel. I just disable the damn thing. Just turn it off. I don't

53:28.700 --> 53:32.460
Yeah, that's exactly what's funny about it. Is that I mean, it's one of those things that

53:33.140 --> 53:37.580
Initially, I don't think it was like really a nefarious reason why the management engine was initially started

53:37.580 --> 53:39.940
It was part of this sort of business push to

53:40.500 --> 53:47.140
To make it where sysadmins and you know remotely control a device at a lower level than the operating system to you know

53:47.140 --> 53:49.860
To reinstall or repair etc

53:49.860 --> 53:55.100
And then it turned into this, you know, wow, this can actually be this black box that does a tremendous amount

53:55.100 --> 53:58.140
So that actually now has a separate its own separate core

53:58.700 --> 54:00.620
It's an art core

54:00.620 --> 54:05.220
But the thing at the end of the day is that it can be completely removed, right?

54:05.220 --> 54:08.580
So we've actually proven it can be completely removed and the machine can operate

54:09.260 --> 54:15.180
But it happens to operate for 30 minutes because there's a little watchdog timer that disables the CPU actually powers it off

54:15.460 --> 54:17.460
so now we have

54:17.460 --> 54:23.300
Ninety three percent removed the last seven percent is a this watchdog timer

54:23.300 --> 54:24.100
So okay

54:24.100 --> 54:26.460
So you're telling me just to just a pause there

54:26.660 --> 54:33.140
In the process of trying to figure out how this damn thing works and how to how to disable it or just bypass it all

54:33.140 --> 54:38.120
Together you're getting down the path. Oh my god. I think we got this working high fives all around everybody

54:38.120 --> 54:42.460
We did it and then 30 minutes into it. It shuts the system down and it's like then you discover

54:42.460 --> 54:48.780
There's a timer in there this that's yeah, that's exactly right. So there is a separate watchdog timer that basically

54:49.260 --> 54:54.700
when the machine first powers on there's a signature check against one of the partitions within the

54:55.180 --> 54:59.580
Management engines you can think of it like as like a zip file of partitions

54:59.740 --> 55:05.500
so but the signature check is only on the very first file or partition of the

55:06.060 --> 55:10.900
Management engine so the networking stack and the kernel are in other partitions

55:10.900 --> 55:15.600
So we can actually zero out all the partitions except the one that has a signature check

55:16.340 --> 55:22.940
And then if the signature check fails, then this watchdog timer triggers for 30 minutes

55:23.540 --> 55:29.820
But because we manufacture the motherboard we actually have fusing capabilities that get us a little bit deeper than

55:30.260 --> 55:32.740
Then what would otherwise be there?

55:32.820 --> 55:39.500
So we can actually start to really debug and say we can put the CPU in a debug mode or the management engine in a disable

55:39.500 --> 55:42.940
Mode, so we're starting to test those features out

55:42.940 --> 55:50.660
And obviously the end goal for us is we want to have a device that can operate with completely free software throughout the entire stack

55:51.140 --> 55:58.540
From the very first firmware loaded all the way through all the operating system and all the applications that run Todd my my

55:59.860 --> 56:03.340
Capitalist sense would tell me that there would be some other

56:03.340 --> 56:09.660
Market leader that would seem to want to jump to the call of organizations that want to have more secure

56:10.220 --> 56:12.700
Laptops, especially in a post Snowden era

56:12.700 --> 56:18.420
It seems like there could be even entire governments that would want computers that are rid of management engine

56:18.420 --> 56:25.000
That's controlled by a US corporation. Why in your estimation? Is this something that's not being why is Lenovo not leading this charge?

56:25.660 --> 56:31.900
It's yeah, it's such a great question and I don't happen to know the answer because obviously we're focusing on that

56:31.900 --> 56:37.140
the the area that I think the only way I can really sort of answer that is that

56:38.460 --> 56:39.740
for us

56:39.740 --> 56:43.020
We need it. We we need to have the entire stack and it's really a game of depth

56:43.020 --> 56:46.260
So if your operating system if you're gonna be running, you know Windows 10

56:46.260 --> 56:50.340
well, then you're exploited at the operating system level, so it's right so it's

56:50.780 --> 56:54.380
hmm, so the for us we look at it as

56:55.780 --> 56:57.860
The game of security is a game of depth

56:57.860 --> 57:05.560
And so we want to have all of our applications running free software the entire operating system itself the kernel

57:05.780 --> 57:11.660
not running any binaries for wireless or for GPU and then of course the bootloader being freed and then the

57:12.380 --> 57:14.620
firmware at the lowest level being freed so

57:15.140 --> 57:19.180
And obviously the more these documents get leaked. It just really

57:22.340 --> 57:24.340
It seems to me Todd like it's such a

57:24.340 --> 57:29.760
Herculean effort to actually do this that by the time you get to completely done

57:30.100 --> 57:35.400
there's there's the real honest potential that the market could shift out from underneath you and like

57:35.700 --> 57:40.020
AMD's PSP system the system that you know a lot of people are talking about now that risins getting more attention

57:40.340 --> 57:45.700
could all of a sudden start showing up in a lot of laptops and now the market demand might start leaning that direction right as

57:45.700 --> 57:49.100
We finally get this problem checked off. Is it do you see what I'm saying?

57:49.100 --> 57:55.300
Like it feels like as long as we're finding this uphill battle. It's we might never really be on time with the market demand

57:55.300 --> 57:57.300
Do you think it's possible?

57:57.300 --> 58:01.980
So I absolutely think it's possible and of course with AMD right now. It's a lot of potential

58:02.780 --> 58:07.720
But we're not at the point where even if they were to say tomorrow. Yeah, well, let's go ahead and release this

58:07.720 --> 58:11.900
You're talking about 2018 by the time they actually have something that's you know into a product

58:11.900 --> 58:14.780
Yeah, and and I also think feel like right now

58:14.780 --> 58:20.980
It's a lot more talk than it is actual product and the reason is because now is the time where they can talk about it

58:20.980 --> 58:24.780
And have the you know, the theories start, you know spewing around and at the end of the day

58:24.780 --> 58:30.180
It's going to be a business decision and you know and where in their triage list is it going to be to release the source

58:30.180 --> 58:34.420
Code for the a Giza binary, right? It's going to be it's going to be way down their triage list

58:35.060 --> 58:39.200
You know, but we but we're still we're pushing for AMD to to release it

58:39.820 --> 58:43.420
And as well as pushing with Intel to say we want an emulous design

58:43.420 --> 58:49.640
The you know the cryptographic bond and the goal for a lot of these corporations to you know

58:49.640 --> 58:52.620
Really lock up a lot that you can start to see

58:53.420 --> 58:56.680
especially with the CIA vault 7 release that

58:57.060 --> 59:02.060
It's clear that at least the CIA as well as the tools that they were using

59:03.220 --> 59:05.820
That they have the philosophy right if you were to ask me

59:06.180 --> 59:12.260
Hey, you know, I want to I want to hack all the encrypted communication services on Android phones

59:12.260 --> 59:13.460
How should I do that?

59:13.460 --> 59:19.540
I would say go a level lower than the application right target the operating system and you own everything above it or the base

59:19.540 --> 59:21.020
man goes more

59:21.020 --> 59:23.020
Yeah, so the same way goes for

59:23.780 --> 59:28.300
Management engine or obviously phones which with the baseband which were we're working on

59:28.300 --> 59:31.940
We actually have all of our hardware specification ready for manufacturing a phone

59:32.900 --> 59:37.180
That'll come out in 2018. So these are all things that that we're really concerned about

59:37.180 --> 59:43.540
But to answer your question about you know, where's the market demand? Is it going to shift from underneath us?

59:43.540 --> 59:46.380
I think where everything is trending right now is

59:47.100 --> 59:51.900
That digital rights for users are getting stripped privacy is getting worse

59:52.780 --> 59:55.220
and and the

59:56.140 --> 01:00:03.900
Those who want to have access to your data or your devices is growing in number. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think it's a market

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.940
I think it's a market that's gonna just get and more and more leaks

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:09.900
They're just gonna keep coming out Joe you had a question about working with Intel. Go ahead

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:19.340
Yes, so Todd when you originally launched your crowdfunding campaign and everything you were very positive and very optimistic about working with Intel

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:21.340
and trying to get the

01:00:21.340 --> 01:00:23.620
You know the various binaries freed

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.820
Presumably you've come up against quite a lot of walls with Intel

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:31.780
You know, I just wanted to ask, you know, is your optimism still there?

01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:38.260
I mean you've talked about what you want to happen. But I mean what you realistically think can happen and that's really what I'm getting at

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.420
here sure, that's a great question, so

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:46.080
One of the great things about buying product from Intel is that we're cutting checks to Intel

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:50.340
And so therefore we have account managers and we have therefore dollar leverage now

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:53.040
Our dollar leverage is obviously a whole lot smaller than Google

01:00:53.460 --> 01:01:01.480
but the as we grow then our dollar leverage starts to increase where we can start making demands to Intel and they'll start to

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:07.540
Actually listen, so we have submitted, you know a petition. We've talked with Intel about you know, creating an MULS design

01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:14.680
Actually, that's they came up with the name from us discussing it that there wasn't anybody talking with Intel about having an MULS design

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:22.780
So as an example Google once they had core boot running then they were perfectly fine with getting using the MRC bin that they

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:26.860
used from Intel's FSP binary, so

01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:34.100
Google at that point was, you know, content with core boot running even though they're using that binary and we're just

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.100
digging levels deeper, so

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.660
for us we're looking at

01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:42.660
Having our solution in parallel

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:45.060
There's actually three parallel paths

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:52.060
The first is communicating to Intel our intent and what we want and then they in turn actually share documentation

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:57.660
You know BIOS writing documentation so that we can start to find

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:03.940
Oh, you know, maybe there is something actually within the existing documentation that nobody's been able to really exploit

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:10.460
Such an example as the being able to disable the management engine from NVRAM

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.180
fuses on the CPU so those are

01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:18.060
Some things that Intel is helping with

01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:23.260
Oh, so the fusing tip came from Intel's documentation?

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:30.260
That's correct. Oh, okay. Yes. So that's one where by having an account manager and having access to

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:34.860
Documentation allows us to have more knowledge than let's say just you know

01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:38.500
Someone else just trying to you know, plunk away and hack or reverse engineer

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:44.380
Yeah, try to trigger things out that way. So and their their documentation Intel's documentation is

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:46.980
immense, right so

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:51.540
So we have a lot that we can end up doing that way. That's the first Avenue

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:57.420
That's basically working with Intel saying hey, you know, you're not the enemy right? We we want to continue to use your hardware

01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.700
We want to purchase from you

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:07.220
But these are the goals that we want then the second option is you know that that we by using the documentation?

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:13.760
Find our own way to you know, either modify code or disable the ME

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:20.860
one of the nice things here is that since it's not actually hostile towards Intel because we're not trying to reverse engineer and release like

01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:26.540
A management injury and replacement, right? What we're trying to do is just not use it period so that's

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.700
Not a hostile relationship with Intel to go down that path

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:34.620
And then the third path of course is is looking at alternatives, right?

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:39.500
What do we end up wanting to use AMD or do we want to actually scrap it and go to something?

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:46.660
It's really low-powered. So with AMD's talk that ends up helping us with the leverage where we could possibly switch to AMD or

01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:51.220
continue to talk with Intel about you know about switching so

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:58.260
So I am very optimistic because you know, I get to read through the documentation on you know

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:03.940
The me design for BIOS writing guide. It's a you know, 192 page document

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:12.040
So Intel has very deep knowledge and and documentation on on areas that you'd be really surprised about so

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:19.340
So that to answer your question is that Intel is I'm very optimistic because Intel has been helpful

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:23.460
In providing documentation and the long-term game

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:29.380
It might very well be that they don't put out an ME list design and we end up finding it something ourselves through their documentation

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:36.020
Or maybe in you know in a much later version that they say that there is a market demand for that and then they then

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:42.540
They offer that up. So I guess Todd. Here's what I here's here's the pessimist in me because I see it almost feels like two

01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:43.540
scenarios

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:45.540
scenario one is a

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:48.300
triumphant

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.780
Arrival at some solution that

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:58.500
Essentially gives people the ability to use Libre boot to bypass and disable Intel management engine and and everybody's happy less blobs

01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.900
Everybody's happy

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:05.500
but all of that work will just quickly be snapped up by vendors like system 76 and intro where and so

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:10.180
There won't be a there won't be a market advantage that lasts very long. So that's scenario one

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:15.820
Oh scenario two though, but scenario two would be that Intel just decides to do this and then everybody gets it and

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:22.380
Market advantages also lost there. So what's the what's the upside for purism long-term here, right?

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:25.100
So there's a couple pieces. So first of all, you have to be running core boot

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:30.660
So if your machines not ported to core boot, then you're then you have to do that port

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:37.300
So it's not like by us disabling the ME. Okay, and it's right that you still have that would be within the range of other

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:42.740
OEMs or especially those that are getting more serious about their own manufacturing. It seems like they could be within their capability

01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:47.260
Oh, yeah, absolutely. They would just need to say I'm gonna invest and actually have that ported. So that's that's step one

01:05:47.780 --> 01:05:51.500
But of course right now you're there. There isn't it. Everybody's using

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:57.620
EFI or UFI except except Chromebooks, right? So or you know

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.700
Pre 2008 machines right lever boot based machines. Yeah

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:08.060
So so that is obviously an advantage that we would end up having over others is that we're investing in that space

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:15.000
To have a really depth of credibility on the security side. That's true. Yeah, so okay then so that's you know point one. So but

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:20.920
Yes of system 76 or or even you know, let's say Dell decided. Hey, you know what?

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:26.760
We we don't like all these threats coming in from vault 7 where all of our machines are gutted because it's an EFI threat

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:34.400
That they could end up putting core boot on at that point then they would still be using the default installs from Intel

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:40.580
Then they would have to actually go through the fuses that we have and of course we'll publish what you know fuses word targeting

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.580
Because it actually helps users so

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:45.540
So then it would basically they'll be paying playing catch-up

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:52.100
But the question is are they gonna want to have the same depth of credibility that we have if they're installing Windows the depth of

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:55.340
Credibility is completely right. Yeah, it seems like you yeah

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.940
I guess your point there is by by dredging this journey

01:06:57.940 --> 01:07:02.860
you'll establish the purism brand as sort of being like that not only one of the first on the scene with it, but also

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.140
Having expertise with it, which is obviously going to give it some credibility

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:09.420
So I I guess I guess that is a good point

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:14.300
But what about if Intel just decides to play ball? Do you feel like? That's still a net win for purism

01:07:14.300 --> 01:07:19.180
I do and the reason is because then it actually allows the users to control it

01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:23.660
Which would be that the ME is going to be on by default. That's just how it's going to be so

01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:30.820
You know a manufacturer or reseller who has access to being able to fuse the CPU

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:38.380
Would be able to so our proposal to Intel is actually to opt to add one of the fuses that we have

01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:43.940
One of the fuses that we get as a manufacturer because we get the CPUs in manufacturing mode

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:48.100
So then we have the capabilities to fuse the CPU and right now

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:53.500
we have 14 fuses that we can fuse and I were saying make a 15th fuse that allows us to actually disable the ME and

01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:58.220
You can ship it where they'll be you know that it can be fused by default

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:05.620
But we can we can achieve it'll have the ME by default and then we can fuse the CPU during the fabrication process

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:11.140
To disable the ME and then that that's all we need so in that case then you know it it

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.660
Accomplishes a few things the first is that

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.140
We would then have a CPU that from Intel

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:23.220
It's Intel supported that would allow us to be able to disable at the lowest level a core that we don't need

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:28.940
The second piece is then it doesn't change that for any of their other

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:37.620
Buyers right because they would they would get what they had to be in and then they would likely would not be all that

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:42.340
Encouraged or motivated to make a change like going back to Lenovo or somebody because they are even pushing this if they were

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.520
Yeah, that's exactly right. Okay. That's a that makes sense all right Wow okay?

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.700
Well, I'm glad you guys are working on this because you know I go back going back to wimpy

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:57.460
I imagine wimpy your goal here is to have something that's sort of a unique fully open source stacked machine, right?

01:08:57.460 --> 01:09:02.500
Are you gonna put like triskel on this thing, or what's what's your plan wimpy? It was shipped with triskel seven oh?

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:08.540
Really? Yeah, yeah, are you gonna get it or is this a mate test machine like what's going on here wimpy?

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:14.220
What's your what's your and why why this machine? It's it's a curiosity okay?

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:18.820
You know I as we said earlier. You know there's some Bitcoin

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:20.980
value at the moment

01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:24.740
there are some unusual items floating around and this was one of them and

01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:30.420
I was interested to have one of these and actually have a poke around with it and that yeah retrofitting

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:34.900
You know the the core boot Libre boot on these devices is not is non-trivial

01:09:34.900 --> 01:09:39.420
Oh, so I wanted to have a play and see what it can do and what it's doing the first thing

01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:44.740
I've noticed boots very fast that that initialization piece is I bet shockingly quick

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:51.540
It makes that old machine seem quite pokey. I've heard that yeah, I've heard that I've had the same curiosity as you

01:09:52.100 --> 01:09:54.100
and so is this

01:09:54.100 --> 01:10:00.100
Is that is the end goal here to experiment with just the just the process?

01:10:01.940 --> 01:10:08.460
Yeah, it's just it's just another interesting bit of technology. I'd like to learn more about and I've had a helping hand in that

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:10.460
I haven't had to

01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:18.700
Wrestle the laptop open and put it under my rather dodgy soldering skills somebody else has done that for me is an SSD

01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:24.660
Yeah, so it's been refurbished. So they they've fitted it with a qualcomm atheros

01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:28.340
wireless end card and a Samsung

01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:34.540
850 256 gig and it's got eight make eight gigs of RAM in it as well. So it's like a full

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:45.260
Yeah, yeah, actually better not your laptop where's I could yeah, I bet you the performance is not that bad

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.980
It's actually very decent. It's actually very decent. Yeah, and I've got a I've got a

01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:51.940
An X to a one which I've had for a while

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:56.860
So I I know how to compare the performance, you know, because the tour ones a little bit newer

01:10:57.740 --> 01:10:58.740
And yeah

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:05.900
The thing that surprised me because it's obviously got the SSD in it is just how quick the machine comes on and actually starts

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.900
Booting so it comes up fast

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:13.300
But it's just not having to sit around and wait around for the BIOS and EFI to happen

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:15.300
It's very quick

01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:18.060
But it's still a core to do isn't it?

01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:19.740
Yeah, yeah

01:11:19.740 --> 01:11:20.860
I mean I've not done much with it

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:25.820
Like I say, I've literally turned it on being impressed by the boot speed and done the updates on the box

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:27.820
I've not actually tried to use it for anything

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:34.780
Serious. Yeah, I'll get to that. Huh? I kind of want to check back in if I remember I won't be here next week

01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:39.300
Oh, I won't be yeah, so I'm gonna be on the road next week. I think we're gonna I don't know who's gonna guest

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:42.260
I haven't we get to find out. Yeah, I so much going on

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:46.540
I haven't it might just be West so everybody show up in the Mamba room. Everybody everybody have a lot of fun

01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:47.940
However, I do have this computer set up

01:11:47.940 --> 01:11:51.300
So if we do have a guest they'll be able to call in and they'll be able to talk to mom

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:53.620
We'll be able to hear them. So we'll see we'll see what happens

01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:56.780
We may have a surprise guest host next week, but maybe in a couple weeks

01:11:56.780 --> 01:12:00.300
I'll check in wimpy and see what you think. I think that I think I think

01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:04.780
I think we may talk about it on the Ubuntu podcast. So you can

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:12.140
Surprise go find wimpy over there surprise and also poppies on there so you can find poppy also, but he's not here today

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:16.020
Oh, yeah, the Ubuntu podcast a one of the one of the podcast

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:20.140
I am subscribed to you can also Joe Joe is on Linux late-night Linux

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:22.820
I almost call the Linux after dark again, because I keep thinking the screensaver

01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:28.300
I know I'm sorry. I'm sorry and that's a great show too. So go subscribe to that as well

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:32.500
It turns out it turns out despite what might be going on with those guys over at Linux action

01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:37.020
She can't trust him. Don't trust those guys. The unplugged show is sticking around here. So what will be here?

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:41.020
I might not be here, but we'll all be next week. It's a community. That's what makes it

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:46.620
You know, I thought about trying to join in mumble, but I was looking at the timing for next week. Yeah, and I

01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:50.500
Just you'll be driving like a bad man. I think it's gonna be like peak driving

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:56.060
I think it's gonna be like an 11-hour day for me driving. Well Dylan's going along right just pop him up at the wheel

01:12:56.060 --> 01:13:01.860
Yeah, well Hadid offered like oh I could drive for a bit. Oh, yeah, you know the thing is it's not just driving

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:05.620
It's like then you don't know where you're gonna be reception wise either because you're moving so much

01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:07.900
So I just feel like I would be a board in the past

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:13.800
I'm sorry from a car man. That would be unbelievable, wouldn't it? Yeah, somebody no never that would never happen Joe

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:18.300
That would never happen. That's I'm heard of somebody joins from a car never crazy. Yeah

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:21.740
Hey, by the way mumbles on Android, so we'll see what happens

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:26.000
But I think well something something something will happen next week. Just got to tune and find out

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:30.180
We'll keep it fresh there will be sure there will be a show as long as these guys can figure out how to turn on

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:32.380
The studio which I think you've got I think you got it

01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:37.420
I just stroked the beard the magic beard and everything comes up when I asked the beard about he said yeah

01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:41.460
I mean, I think so. I mean the show might just be late. Yeah

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:48.620
That's fine, I suppose that really is fine

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:51.820
You tune in over JB live TV and you don't have to worry about it

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:55.260
You just get to watch the show go down and I know it won't be here to bail you guys out

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:58.080
Yeah, cuz he's gonna be flying right? Yeah, we're gonna be in Tejas

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:03.980
Meeting up with Dell. I wonder if they'll have any XPS 15s in the lab that I can check out go fine

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:07.340
If you see one of the hallway just snag it. Yeah, man. Totally. All right

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:10.000

See you guys

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:08.340
And we canonical a lesson

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:24.180
Bob it up that Bob it up. Alright, so JB titles calm. Let's go do our title thing now

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:28.900
I know that Nick lob who I almost want to call Nick Bob in the show had a question

01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:31.920
Regarding the Intel management engine probably for Todd. So Nick go ahead

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.440
Are you I saw you asking you get first go?

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:38.120
Hello

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:41.360
Thoughts left actually just a second ago. Oh

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.260
He did. Oh, was it for him? Okay. Well, thanks Todd for joining us. Goodbye

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.240
Maybe it was our sick tunes drove them away

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:56.000
Jail that whale. What's that a reference to? Oh the docker stuff. That's pretty good. That's pretty good

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.160
Boot free or die trying that was my suggestion

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.160
Like it

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:12.580
Who should I have a guest co-host next week, who should I ask because obviously I can't make them do it, right? Who should I invite?

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.280
Takes we won't put my lap on right now

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:29.800
Chase just to throw it as a wild card. I feel like I feel like I could ask Joe

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.720
But I feel like it's a lot asking that's a lot of Joe

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.720
I mean, that's a lot asking a lot of Joe. But yeah, that would be good

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:38.200
That would be good for people to get to meet Joe. That's a good mix it up. Have my core

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:41.920
I'd have to not be in my car, but I could work something out

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:47.080
Yeah, that we don't want to impose too much on you. So I have Skype set up here and Joe could call it

01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:49.080
All right. I like this Joe

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.960
The bus I'm gonna go with it Joe if you're down for it boy that shirt so that solves my problem right there and I

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.880
Actually probably is a good chance for the JB honest to get to meet you. Yeah

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:04.720
Digital ocean is like and honestly, there you go. Yeah, that helps

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.680
I heard the read in the plug for the affiliate in late night Linux in it. Yeah, it's legit

01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:16.160
All right, awesome, well, that's awesome Joe, thank you

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:20.200
Alright, so I'll just you can just be able to Skype to Jupiter broadcasting it in West

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.720
You'll be able to just should I think I'll set it to automatically login

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:32.080
Cool well, that's awesome. Thank you guys. Well, that's that's excellent and wimpy. I'm glad I'm officially Joe's agent now. Yeah, right

01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:34.320
financial attractions

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.320
transactions

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.800
Whoa, there's Skype there's Skype, you know, I'm gonna do I'm gonna log into Skype

01:17:39.800 --> 01:17:46.840
I'm gonna turn off all of the notifications for you right now West. I'm gonna hook you up with those. Yeah, I hate those so much

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.400
And wimpy I owe you a beer or two. That's for sure

01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:54.640
But yeah beers only redeemable at Linux fest Northwest

01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:10.280
I'm gonna pull my finger out and sort my travel out this weekend at a boy. I'll be in touch
