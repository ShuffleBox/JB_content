WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
How about this for a little bit of troubleshooting?

00:02.000 --> 00:06.000
A second-hand television wiped out the broadband

00:06.000 --> 00:07.120
for an entire village.

00:07.120 --> 00:10.080
And this went on for months and even impacted

00:10.080 --> 00:11.760
neighboring communities at time.

00:12.320 --> 00:14.480
And poor broadband was just a way of life

00:14.480 --> 00:15.760
starting at 7 a.m.

00:16.480 --> 00:18.960
despite repeat visits by engineers

00:18.960 --> 00:20.560
to try to find and fix the fault.

00:20.560 --> 00:24.160
They replaced equipment, large sections of cable even,

00:24.160 --> 00:25.360
but the problems remained.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.480
Local Openreach engineer, Michael Jones,

00:28.480 --> 00:32.080
was determined to find the Aberrosian broadband smoking gun.

00:32.080 --> 00:33.040
And I should note there,

00:33.040 --> 00:34.560
I don't know if I'm saying that town right

00:34.560 --> 00:36.880
because my Welsh is a little rusty.

00:36.880 --> 00:37.680
That's strange.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.840
Well, they say on their blog post about this,

00:41.840 --> 00:42.800
as a last resort,

00:42.800 --> 00:45.200
we decided to bring in a crack squad of engineers

00:45.200 --> 00:47.040
from the chief engineer's office

00:47.040 --> 00:49.680
who were based in other parts of the UK to investigate.

00:49.680 --> 00:52.000
Accommodation was understandably hard to find

00:52.000 --> 00:53.840
due to COVID-19 lockdown,

00:53.840 --> 00:58.000
but we eventually found a field where we camped

00:58.000 --> 01:00.480
and made the 55-mile journey back to the town

01:00.480 --> 01:01.360
the next morning.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.200
They exhausted all avenues.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.280
So they wanted to take a final test

01:05.280 --> 01:08.320
to see if maybe a phenomenon known as shine,

01:08.880 --> 01:11.840
single high-level impulse noise

01:11.840 --> 01:13.520
was causing this interference.

01:13.520 --> 01:14.240
I love this, right?

01:14.240 --> 01:15.280
It's sort of a moonshot like,

01:15.280 --> 01:16.960
okay, we've tried everything we know.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.800
What about this weird random thing?

01:19.440 --> 01:22.240
Well, by using a device called a spectrum analyzer,

01:22.240 --> 01:23.680
we walked up and down the village

01:23.680 --> 01:26.560
in the torrential rain at 6 a.m.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.400
uphill both ways, I'm sure,

01:28.400 --> 01:30.320
to see if we could find an electrical noise

01:30.320 --> 01:31.760
to support our theory.

01:31.760 --> 01:35.760
And at 7 a.m., like clockwork, it happened.

01:35.760 --> 01:37.520
Our device picked up a large burst

01:37.520 --> 01:39.840
of electrical interference in the village.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.600
The source of the electrical noise

01:41.600 --> 01:43.120
was traced to a property in the village.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.800
And it turned out that at 7 a.m. every morning,

01:46.800 --> 01:50.000
the occupant would switch on their old TV,

01:50.000 --> 01:52.240
which would in turn knock out broadband

01:52.240 --> 01:54.320
for the entire village.

01:54.960 --> 01:55.840
As you can imagine,

01:55.840 --> 01:57.520
when we pointed this out to the resident,

01:57.520 --> 02:00.480
they were mortified that their old second-hand TV

02:00.480 --> 02:03.680
was the cause of an entire village's broadband problems.

02:03.680 --> 02:06.080
And they immediately agreed to switch it off

02:06.080 --> 02:07.440
and not use it again.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.360
And since then,

02:09.360 --> 02:12.640
there has been no reported issues with the network.

02:22.720 --> 02:25.520
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.480
My name is Chris.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.600
My name is Wes.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.120
Well, hello, Wes Payne.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.440
You are a gentleman that looks good in uniform.

02:31.440 --> 02:32.640
It's looking good on you today.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.080
I thought you might like this cap.

02:34.080 --> 02:34.800
I do.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.080
You know me too well.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.160
Today's episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru,

02:38.160 --> 02:39.600
the leader in hands-on learning.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.400
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.040
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs

02:45.040 --> 02:47.120
in Cloud Linux servers and much more.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.000
Get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.440
Well, here we are with episode 372.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.200
And we are going to ask a question that has been evolving

02:57.200 --> 02:59.760
in the back of our minds, I think, for a couple of years.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.800
We ask it with all sincerity.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.800
Is there really just no room for new boutique distributions?

03:06.800 --> 03:09.360
Is it essentially a three distribution world

03:10.000 --> 03:14.320
with Ubuntu derivatives, Arch, Fedora, Red Hat?

03:14.880 --> 03:16.400
There's some Debian flavors.

03:16.400 --> 03:19.040
It's a small world of Linux distributions these days.

03:19.040 --> 03:22.240
And Wes and I recently tried out some really great distributions

03:22.240 --> 03:24.080
and wonder why more people aren't using them.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.040
And so we'll talk about that.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.600
But of course, we have a bunch of community news to get into.

03:28.160 --> 03:30.240
And we have a special guest joining us today,

03:30.240 --> 03:33.520
the CEO of System76, an all-around great guy.

03:33.520 --> 03:34.480
Carl is here.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.280
Hello, Carl.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.560
Welcome back to the Unplugged program.

03:36.560 --> 03:37.360
It's been a while.

03:37.360 --> 03:37.920
Hey, Chris.

03:37.920 --> 03:38.960
Thanks for having me.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.240
Carl, we're going to get into a new story from System76 here

03:42.240 --> 03:43.360
in a little bit.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.680
So feel free to chime in on everything.

03:45.680 --> 03:48.240
But of course, we'll go to the source for that one.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.240
But I wanted to start with some news

03:50.240 --> 03:51.600
that I'm super excited about.

03:51.600 --> 03:54.400
So to help us analyze all of the community news this week,

03:54.400 --> 03:56.720
we have to bring in our team of detectives,

03:56.720 --> 03:57.920
our crew of captains.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.520
Why, yes, it is our virtual lug.

03:59.520 --> 04:00.320
Hello, Mumble Room.

04:00.320 --> 04:00.800
Hello.

04:00.800 --> 04:01.440
Hello.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.640
Hello.

04:02.640 --> 04:03.600
Bienvenido.

04:04.880 --> 04:05.760
Absolutely.

04:05.760 --> 04:06.640
Good to see.

04:06.640 --> 04:08.480
Good to see we got 21 in there.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.880
We're shy a little bit today of a few folks.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.800
I guess they didn't know you're wearing your uniform today.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.320
Or maybe you scared them off, Wes.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.880
I look a little too authoritarian today, I think.

04:16.880 --> 04:17.520
But don't worry.

04:17.520 --> 04:19.280
We're friendly here at Linux Unplugged,

04:19.280 --> 04:21.200
as long as you comply with our orders.

04:21.200 --> 04:21.680
That's right.

04:22.400 --> 04:22.960
Thank you.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.000
Got to make that disclaimer.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.600
All right, now, some news I'm actually super excited about.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.640
I haven't got to mess with it yet.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.200
In fact, I'm not even sure if it's fully shipping anywhere yet.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.960
I just saw this on GitHub and wanted

04:32.960 --> 04:34.320
to talk about it immediately.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.320
It appears that if not right now,

04:36.320 --> 04:39.280
very soon the Raspberry Pi 4 will officially

04:39.280 --> 04:42.480
be able to directly boot from USB.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.920
This sounds pretty cool, Wes, because this

04:43.920 --> 04:45.440
is kind of like the big performance

04:45.440 --> 04:47.120
limitation in my Pi setup.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.000
Yeah, it was.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.680
You know, I think this change is basically

04:49.680 --> 04:51.760
that the support had been in beta,

04:51.760 --> 04:54.160
and now they're finally saying, yeah, all right.

04:55.520 --> 04:56.640
Everyone can use this now.

04:56.640 --> 04:58.560
You don't have to jump through even more hoops.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.080
Although I still think updating the firmware on a Raspberry Pi

05:02.080 --> 05:04.160
is a little non-standard.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.000
And so that part can be a little confusing.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.200
You got to do like a full upgrade

05:07.200 --> 05:09.680
and then use the firmware-specific commands

05:09.680 --> 05:12.240
that OSes like Raspbian have to make sure

05:12.240 --> 05:13.520
that you've got the right firmware

05:13.520 --> 05:15.840
and the right configuration so that you can actually

05:15.840 --> 05:17.920
use these handy new features.

05:17.920 --> 05:19.440
Tricky, tricky firmware.

05:19.440 --> 05:20.960
I think we'll talk more about that in a moment.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.400
But something else I noticed is it,

05:22.400 --> 05:23.520
and I don't know if you saw this,

05:23.520 --> 05:25.040
but it looks like they're playing around

05:25.040 --> 05:29.120
with treating the USB disks or block devices more

05:29.120 --> 05:32.160
like SCSI devices, which could also improve performance.

05:32.160 --> 05:32.960
Have you seen this?

05:32.960 --> 05:35.360
Yeah, it seems like people are taking it seriously,

05:35.360 --> 05:37.360
that you might actually use these things, well,

05:37.360 --> 05:41.040
I guess like you do, Chris, and host your whole home

05:41.040 --> 05:42.080
infrastructure.

05:42.080 --> 05:46.640
And if a whole bunch of the audience is running from USB,

05:46.640 --> 05:48.800
it makes sense to maybe invest in whatever technology

05:48.800 --> 05:51.040
you can find to make that work a little more efficiently.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.200
It's not just a drive there that's

05:53.200 --> 05:55.360
going to have big files from your NAS

05:55.360 --> 05:56.560
that you never access.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.400
It might be your whole OS.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.840
Wes, anyone could have a whole home off-grid internet

06:01.840 --> 06:05.120
hot cache in their house as long as they're

06:05.120 --> 06:07.040
willing to have like four Raspberry Pi.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.240
That's all it takes, four.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.360
Is it really only four?

06:10.560 --> 06:13.360
Actually, at the moment, it's only three.

06:13.360 --> 06:16.240
Once I got on the ButterFS sauce and started

06:16.240 --> 06:18.880
combining my volumes and reloaded everything

06:18.880 --> 06:23.440
onto LTS Ubuntu 20.04, I'm like rocking with less pies

06:23.440 --> 06:24.240
than I ever had to.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.560
It's kind of ridiculous, actually, how great

06:26.560 --> 06:27.760
these Raspberry Pis are.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.320
And now, I can say I have driven them

06:30.320 --> 06:34.400
into the summer of Texas and back, where the booth got up

06:34.400 --> 06:37.840
to 104 degrees in there where these things were running.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.600
And they kept on delivering.

06:39.600 --> 06:42.560
There was a couple of times where thermal throttling kicked

06:42.560 --> 06:45.200
in and the Plex stream cut out or something like that.

06:45.200 --> 06:48.080
But I mean, really, I am very impressed.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.440
They're still running right now.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.800
And I have like no reason to replace them.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.760
Like I fantasized about an x86 system in there,

06:55.760 --> 07:00.800
just one x86 box with Proxmox that runs everything in VMs

07:00.800 --> 07:03.360
and then just keep it super easy to do snapshots

07:03.360 --> 07:04.640
and swap it to a new box.

07:04.640 --> 07:07.920
But the reality is not only have they been problem-free,

07:07.920 --> 07:10.240
but their low power draw is great for somebody

07:10.240 --> 07:11.600
who's trying to run on solar.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.040
So it's kind of just been a win-win.

07:13.040 --> 07:13.920
I think they're really cool.

07:13.920 --> 07:17.040
And so I'm glad to see the community picking up

07:17.040 --> 07:20.800
around them and making them even more serious boxes in a way.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.440
Now it just has all those little architecture problems

07:23.440 --> 07:24.560
to work out.

07:24.560 --> 07:24.960
Yeah.

07:24.960 --> 07:28.320
I mean, it's still probably not an ideal home server,

07:28.320 --> 07:31.280
but with faster disk access coming online,

07:31.280 --> 07:33.680
maybe support for trim, things like that,

07:33.680 --> 07:34.960
it's getting closer.

07:34.960 --> 07:38.560
I was talking to Alex in the old self-hosted podcast

07:38.560 --> 07:42.480
about a future where I netboot these things.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.800
And maybe one Pi has all the storage

07:44.800 --> 07:46.800
and the rest all just netboot.

07:46.800 --> 07:51.200
And in that netboot environment, it could just be one cable

07:51.200 --> 07:54.560
because you can get a PoE hat for Raspberry Pis

07:54.560 --> 07:56.960
and you could power them with the ethernet cable

07:56.960 --> 07:58.880
you're using to supply them networking.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.800
And so I could run all these Pis with just a single clean cable

08:02.800 --> 08:04.160
that goes back to the switch.

08:04.160 --> 08:05.600
That sounds perfect.

08:05.600 --> 08:07.760
And the Raspberry Pi sounds like a great candidate

08:07.760 --> 08:09.680
for being a little netbooting server, right?

08:09.680 --> 08:10.720
I mean, maybe.

08:10.720 --> 08:11.280
We'll see.

08:11.280 --> 08:12.640
I'll see how far I take it.

08:12.640 --> 08:15.840
But the possibilities seem like they're pretty appealing

08:15.840 --> 08:18.400
with the Raspberry Pi platform because it's low power,

08:18.400 --> 08:19.680
because you could run it off PoE,

08:19.680 --> 08:22.640
and now you can netboot or USB boot.

08:22.640 --> 08:23.920
For the kind of setup I'm using,

08:23.920 --> 08:26.000
it just sort of seems to be a perfect little device.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.440
I don't know if I'd recommend it for everybody.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.680
And such a low-cost investment, right?

08:29.680 --> 08:30.960
I mean, you don't have to go all the way

08:30.960 --> 08:34.080
to configuring a smaller x86 system or something like a NUC

08:34.080 --> 08:36.480
and invest in all that, where you're thinking a lot about,

08:36.480 --> 08:37.680
oh, I got to buy extra hardware.

08:37.680 --> 08:40.080
What memory and SSD am I putting in here?

08:40.080 --> 08:41.760
You're just assembling these Pis, you know,

08:41.760 --> 08:43.440
as you've got a few extra bucks here and there

08:43.440 --> 08:45.440
because the price point's so low.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.480
Pretty low risk.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.560
And in fact, the last thing I'll say about it

08:48.560 --> 08:51.440
is because it's not going to break the bank,

08:51.440 --> 08:53.600
even to buy an 8-gigabyte one, when you're comparing it

08:53.600 --> 08:56.560
to the cost of a traditional x86 computer,

08:56.560 --> 08:59.760
and if you just need, like in my case, a test one,

08:59.760 --> 09:02.240
I have, I know it sounds silly, but I basically

09:02.240 --> 09:05.680
have a bench Pi that I just use for testing things

09:05.680 --> 09:07.760
before I roll it out on my home setup.

09:07.760 --> 09:11.600
And it's just sort of one of the things you can do

09:11.600 --> 09:13.440
when the thing just costs $40.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.400
Yes, right.

09:14.400 --> 09:17.760
And I mean, in your old life as a professional admin,

09:17.760 --> 09:18.960
you would have spare machines.

09:18.960 --> 09:19.760
You have backups.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.680
You might have hot standbys.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.680
That's also something that's a little more accessible

09:23.680 --> 09:26.320
in the home lab when your base is a Raspberry Pi

09:26.320 --> 09:28.720
and not a big old x86 server.

09:28.720 --> 09:29.200
Yep.

09:29.200 --> 09:33.120
And actually, to that point, I carry a spare Pi in the RV,

09:33.120 --> 09:34.800
fully ready to go in the case.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.800
All I have to do is just pop in an SD card,

09:36.800 --> 09:39.440
or a USB drive, and it's functional again.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.440
And the idea was that when I went down to Texas,

09:41.440 --> 09:44.800
if I burned out a Pi, because it seemed very possible.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.640
Literally burned out.

09:46.640 --> 09:47.200
Yeah.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.440
I would pull that Pi, pull its storage,

09:49.440 --> 09:52.640
and then pop in the new Pi, which are literally Velcro

09:52.640 --> 09:53.680
to the inside of this booth.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.960
So it's literally, you pull it off,

09:54.960 --> 09:56.560
and you slide in the new one to the Velcro

09:56.560 --> 09:58.640
and just reconnect all of the accessories,

09:58.640 --> 10:00.480
and it just picks up and takes right over.

10:00.480 --> 10:04.320
And because it's a $40 device, for me, it's worth it.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.320
It's like an insurance policy to just have one.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.720
To just have one in the cupboard ready to go.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.720
So there's advantages to it.

10:10.720 --> 10:14.160
But there is those tricky things like the firmware.

10:14.160 --> 10:14.800
Yes.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.720
And that's why it's the perfect opportunity

10:16.720 --> 10:20.880
to chat with Carl Rochelle from System76, who, I got to say,

10:20.880 --> 10:25.520
has really delivered on a promise that didn't seem all

10:25.520 --> 10:26.080
that deliverable.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.120
How often do people say, buy this product from us,

10:29.120 --> 10:31.280
and it's running this type of firmware today,

10:31.280 --> 10:33.840
but we promise one day we'll make it possible for you

10:33.840 --> 10:34.720
to replace that firmware.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.920
That's just often one of those promises that gets missed.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.720
And I think System76 has delivered here.

10:40.720 --> 10:43.760
Because if I'm not mistaken, not only has the OpenFirmware

10:43.760 --> 10:46.160
project at System76 gotten continued development,

10:46.160 --> 10:48.640
which is awesome, but it looks like it's

10:48.640 --> 10:51.120
been widened to previous machines

10:51.120 --> 10:52.400
that have already shipped.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.360
Is that right, Carl?

10:53.360 --> 10:54.640
Well, you're hitting on, I think,

10:54.640 --> 10:57.520
what is the most notable part of this work.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.760
I mean, first, it's quite an achievement

10:59.760 --> 11:04.480
to get OpenFirmware on machines on day zero.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.360
Meaning, when they're available from Intel or AMD,

11:07.360 --> 11:08.480
we have OpenFirmware.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.400
Well, AMD coming soon.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.520
But Intel, we have available on day zero

11:13.520 --> 11:16.000
when the chipsets are available and when the CPUs are available.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.160
And that was quite a lift.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.880
But once you start building the infrastructure

11:20.880 --> 11:22.560
and the knowledge and the know-how to do it,

11:22.560 --> 11:23.600
things start moving faster.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.920
And so being who we are, we like to try

11:25.920 --> 11:27.280
to push it further to more things

11:27.280 --> 11:31.440
that will further liberate our customers and their computers.

11:31.440 --> 11:35.120
And so we went to the OpenEC, which to me

11:36.000 --> 11:38.880
is the most exciting part about all the firmware,

11:38.880 --> 11:41.440
because the EC is what controls the things

11:41.440 --> 11:44.640
that you feel about a machine, like the fan curves,

11:45.200 --> 11:48.880
the hotkeys, and the interaction between the-

11:48.880 --> 11:50.880
And we're talking about the embedded controller here,

11:50.880 --> 11:51.440
right?

11:51.440 --> 11:52.560
Right, the embedded controller.

11:52.560 --> 11:54.320
Yeah, the interaction between the computer,

11:54.320 --> 11:57.520
the hardware, and the operating system,

11:57.520 --> 11:59.040
those things that you really see as a user,

11:59.040 --> 12:00.000
that happens at the EC.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.920
So with the Lemur, when that came out,

12:01.920 --> 12:04.720
that was our first model that had an open source EC

12:04.720 --> 12:06.720
that we wrote all the firmware for.

12:07.520 --> 12:11.360
As you had alluded to, even though all that's super exciting,

12:11.840 --> 12:12.960
something that we were able to do

12:12.960 --> 12:14.800
that I don't think most companies would do

12:14.800 --> 12:17.280
is invest in bringing this technology

12:17.280 --> 12:19.520
to existing customers for products

12:19.520 --> 12:20.800
that we're already shipping,

12:21.280 --> 12:23.760
and we're working on bringing it to customers

12:23.760 --> 12:25.440
whose products we aren't shipping any longer.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.120
So you're going to get those advantages

12:29.120 --> 12:30.560
from that work that we've done,

12:30.560 --> 12:33.600
and we really are starting at a chipset level.

12:33.600 --> 12:37.600
So we can say the chipsets in the current Gazelle

12:37.600 --> 12:41.760
and Adder and Serval were the same chipsets

12:41.760 --> 12:44.560
as the previous models, although there were some changes,

12:44.560 --> 12:46.240
but that means the bulk of the work was done,

12:46.240 --> 12:49.120
so we can port to those previous models,

12:49.120 --> 12:50.720
run through the QC team,

12:50.720 --> 12:53.920
and ship our customers liberated firmware.

12:53.920 --> 12:54.880
Well, congratulations.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.680
So I have a question about that.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.520
But just on the side, Karl,

12:59.520 --> 13:03.120
has Intel's protracted development cycle

13:03.120 --> 13:04.800
enabled this in any way?

13:04.800 --> 13:05.360
No, not really.

13:05.360 --> 13:08.560
What enabled it was Intel reaching out to us

13:08.560 --> 13:11.600
and asking us to partner on making open source firmware.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.320
Oh.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.280
Right, yeah.

13:14.000 --> 13:14.640
Okay, wait a minute.

13:14.640 --> 13:15.360
Hold on, hold on a second.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.200
That's not something I understood about this before.

13:17.200 --> 13:21.120
Intel is aware of what you are doing

13:21.120 --> 13:22.800
and copacetic with it?

13:22.800 --> 13:24.720
Oh, not only that, we have a Slack channel

13:24.720 --> 13:26.400
where we chat with their firmware engineers

13:26.400 --> 13:27.920
How is this a thing?

13:27.920 --> 13:30.960
Yeah, well, that's what got it all rolling.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.480
Wow, that's amazing.

13:32.480 --> 13:33.680
Yeah, they reached out to us and said,

13:33.680 --> 13:35.280
hey, we want to do open firmware.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.960
And then their team came out.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.240
They had, it was quite, it was kind of wild.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.480
Their firmware team came out

13:44.480 --> 13:47.120
and they had this long presentation

13:47.120 --> 13:48.640
that after eight hours, they're like,

13:48.640 --> 13:49.600
okay, let's come back tomorrow.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.800
We have some more to show you.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.320
Wow.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.800
So we cut for the day, we come back the next day,

13:54.800 --> 13:56.880
so we cut for the day, we come back the next morning.

13:56.880 --> 13:58.720
They have like a few more slides to go through

13:59.360 --> 14:00.400
and they were back chatting

14:00.400 --> 14:02.160
and they're like, they say,

14:02.160 --> 14:04.960
hey, so will you guys partner with us on firmware?

14:04.960 --> 14:09.200
And we essentially said, you had us at open source.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.880
So that was enough.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.320
You had us about 12 hours ago.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.440
Well, that's really neat.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.360
I didn't quite realize that.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.960
Yeah, we have access to the documentation

14:18.960 --> 14:21.520
that's necessary to enable hardware,

14:22.080 --> 14:24.000
things like Thunderbolt that we just couldn't do before

14:24.000 --> 14:25.040
that now we're able to do

14:25.840 --> 14:27.920
and offer on products with open firmware.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.320
And now the same thing's happening with AMD.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.360
We're working with Google and AMD

14:33.360 --> 14:36.080
on open source firmware for AMD platforms.

14:36.080 --> 14:37.040
How is that developing?

14:37.040 --> 14:39.360
Is that also going pretty smoothly?

14:39.360 --> 14:40.320
It's going pretty well.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.840
We were working,

14:41.840 --> 14:43.760
well, we've just been working through legal for a moment,

14:43.760 --> 14:45.440
but I think we're past the-

14:45.440 --> 14:46.640
Sure, I bet there's a lot of that.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.120
Yeah, there's a bit of that,

14:49.840 --> 14:53.040
but I think we're past the legal as of this week

14:53.040 --> 14:56.080
and that means, it didn't slow us down too much,

14:56.080 --> 14:57.360
but it does mean certain,

14:58.720 --> 15:00.480
just want to be on good sound footing

15:00.480 --> 15:02.560
when you're doing any kind of open source work.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.280
Sure, absolutely.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.720
Yeah, we'll be able to move more quickly

15:04.720 --> 15:06.800
now that that's past us

15:06.800 --> 15:10.000
and onwards and upwards with open firmware.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.920
Well, so here was my actual original question

15:11.920 --> 15:13.200
before that aside is,

15:14.320 --> 15:16.640
practically speaking as an end user,

15:17.440 --> 15:18.560
what is the benefit for me?

15:18.560 --> 15:20.240
I mean, I like the idea

15:20.240 --> 15:21.760
of the world having a better understanding

15:21.760 --> 15:22.960
of what makes my computer run,

15:22.960 --> 15:25.120
but what is an actual practical benefit that I get?

15:25.120 --> 15:26.720
Right, because this is like a big investment

15:26.720 --> 15:27.680
for you guys, right?

15:27.680 --> 15:29.360
You're putting engineering hours

15:29.360 --> 15:30.960
investing in making all these changes.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.560
What does that mean to a customer?

15:32.560 --> 15:34.240
Right, well, the first thing is

15:35.040 --> 15:37.040
that we can very rapidly respond to our customers

15:37.040 --> 15:38.400
in ways that we couldn't before.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.800
If there's a problem or an enhancement

15:40.800 --> 15:42.800
that we can do through the firmware,

15:43.360 --> 15:44.960
something simple like, for example,

15:44.960 --> 15:46.880
when you close the lemur lid,

15:46.880 --> 15:48.480
with a customer reported to us,

15:48.480 --> 15:49.600
it's a little scary to do,

15:49.600 --> 15:51.520
but if you put enough pressure on the lid,

15:51.520 --> 15:52.960
you can touch one of the keys underneath

15:52.960 --> 15:54.560
on the keyboard and turn on the machine.

15:55.520 --> 15:59.200
So now we can very quickly spin out,

15:59.200 --> 16:01.680
work on a fix and roll that out to our customers

16:01.680 --> 16:04.000
and that keyboard when the lid is shut,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.240
will no longer activate or resume from suspend.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.400
So our response, our ability to respond

16:08.400 --> 16:09.120
is a lot faster.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.680
And the really cool stuff

16:11.680 --> 16:12.640
you're gonna start seeing

16:12.640 --> 16:14.240
coming over the next few months.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.760
That's things like battery thresholds

16:17.760 --> 16:20.400
that are built in to the embedded controller

16:20.400 --> 16:22.240
or can be controlled in the embedded controller

16:22.240 --> 16:23.760
in the operating system.

16:23.760 --> 16:26.080
So in Pop OS, you can do things

16:26.080 --> 16:27.680
to extend your battery life

16:27.680 --> 16:29.680
or the life of your battery.

16:29.680 --> 16:30.800
The life of your battery.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.080
Is that, so are you implying like

16:32.080 --> 16:33.440
charge control settings?

16:33.440 --> 16:34.400
Charge control, right.

16:34.400 --> 16:36.080
Yeah, battery thresholds and charge control.

16:36.080 --> 16:36.320
So...

16:36.320 --> 16:37.440
Oh, that's great.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.560
Yeah, in GNOME settings,

16:38.560 --> 16:41.760
you'll see options for maximum,

16:41.760 --> 16:42.960
charge it all the way up

16:42.960 --> 16:43.920
or charge it 80%

16:43.920 --> 16:49.600
and or maximum battery longevity, 60%.

16:50.160 --> 16:52.000
Oh, that's fantastic.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.120
It's, you know, again,

16:53.120 --> 16:55.120
those are things that you can't do

16:55.120 --> 16:56.480
without control of the firmware.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.160
And then one that I'm really excited about

17:00.160 --> 17:02.720
because I like altering my keyboards.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.480
I like to change the key map around

17:05.280 --> 17:07.280
to things that I'm more efficient with.

17:07.280 --> 17:08.720
So I like to do that.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.880
Are we talking Dvorak here or something else?

17:10.880 --> 17:13.040
No, mostly I like to use,

17:13.040 --> 17:14.160
I like to move around the things

17:14.160 --> 17:15.200
down by the space bar.

17:15.200 --> 17:15.920
Oh, sure.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.400
Yeah, see, I like to use my thumbs when I can

17:18.400 --> 17:22.400
and having alt next to my space bar

17:22.400 --> 17:23.440
is basically useless

17:24.000 --> 17:25.520
and then don't do anything with it.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.640
So with this, with open source firmware

17:28.640 --> 17:29.760
and the embedded controller,

17:29.760 --> 17:31.760
we're working on an application

17:31.760 --> 17:34.320
that will ship as a utility with our products

17:34.320 --> 17:35.920
that you can move the key maps around.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.200
You can create function layers.

17:37.200 --> 17:37.920
You can alter...

17:37.920 --> 17:39.280
Is this firmware level changes?

17:39.280 --> 17:40.880
So it would be persistent or is this...

17:40.880 --> 17:42.560
Right, right. And it's persistent.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.280
So when you save them, it saves it to the EC

17:45.280 --> 17:47.520
and those changes are persistent.

17:47.520 --> 17:48.720
All right, well, I mean,

17:48.720 --> 17:49.840
I bet you have a whole other list,

17:49.840 --> 17:51.040
but you've got me convinced.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.040
So my question is, what is the risk

17:53.040 --> 17:55.520
do you feel like as a company

17:55.520 --> 17:58.160
for reflashing these firmwares

17:58.160 --> 18:00.160
on machines that are in production?

18:00.160 --> 18:02.640
They're out in the wild doing who knows what

18:02.640 --> 18:04.720
connected to who knows what

18:04.720 --> 18:07.040
and you're updating a pretty core part.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.120
That must have been at least some point

18:09.120 --> 18:11.120
of heart burning consternation for a bit

18:11.120 --> 18:12.160
to figure that out.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.200
Well, that is challenging

18:13.200 --> 18:14.960
and it hasn't gone without some hiccups.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.760
Usually what we'd like to do

18:17.760 --> 18:20.240
is roll it out into the factory first.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.480
So that means the factory is going to see

18:24.480 --> 18:26.080
a lot of different configurations

18:26.080 --> 18:28.640
that might not be in the wild

18:29.200 --> 18:30.320
or that are in the wild,

18:30.320 --> 18:31.680
but we're on proprietary firmware.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.840
And through that process,

18:33.840 --> 18:36.480
we can catch a lot of problems

18:36.480 --> 18:37.920
that might happen.

18:37.920 --> 18:38.960
But yeah, it is risky.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.880
And so we also enabled rolling back

18:41.600 --> 18:43.280
so that if there's something

18:43.280 --> 18:44.560
that we haven't caught,

18:44.560 --> 18:46.160
a customer can roll back to price

18:46.160 --> 18:47.520
proprietary firmware.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.080
We can examine what might be the cause

18:50.080 --> 18:51.840
and get it fixed.

18:51.840 --> 18:52.640
Oh, OK.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.080
So there is an escape hatch.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.360
So that's always nice.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.720
That's the best you can really go for

18:56.720 --> 18:58.000
when you're doing these kinds of things,

18:58.000 --> 18:58.480
really.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.440
Wow, well, this is pretty exciting.

19:01.440 --> 19:04.800
So what customers starting now

19:04.800 --> 19:06.400
can get this that didn't have this before?

19:06.400 --> 19:08.080
It looks like it's the Adder workstation

19:08.080 --> 19:08.640
and the Gazelle.

19:08.640 --> 19:09.360
Is that right?

19:09.360 --> 19:10.400
The Adder and the Gazelle.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.920
We're also looking at the previous

19:13.920 --> 19:14.960
generation Adder,

19:14.960 --> 19:16.480
previous generation Oryx.

19:17.280 --> 19:20.080
And I think that's going to probably

19:20.080 --> 19:21.760
fill out the product line for where

19:21.760 --> 19:23.200
our starting point is.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.800
And from there on out,

19:24.800 --> 19:26.880
we will be working with open firmware.

19:26.880 --> 19:27.680
Wow.

19:27.680 --> 19:30.400
Well, I guess my last obligatory question

19:30.400 --> 19:32.400
is, do I have to be on Pop OS

19:32.400 --> 19:33.520
to get these new firmwares?

19:33.520 --> 19:34.720
Or is there a means for people

19:34.720 --> 19:35.760
outside of Pop OS?

19:35.760 --> 19:37.280
Outside of Pop OS to get it too?

19:37.280 --> 19:39.120
No, you can get it with any Linux

19:39.120 --> 19:40.320
distribution or Windows.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.160
You just use a USB stick

19:42.160 --> 19:43.840
and you boot to the USB stick and run it.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.280
It's like a it's like a mini operating

19:45.280 --> 19:46.400
system, really, that will

19:46.400 --> 19:48.080
will update the firmware for you.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.600
Could you do it from within Pop OS,

19:49.600 --> 19:50.000
though?

19:50.000 --> 19:51.440
You can do it from within Pop OS

19:52.000 --> 19:54.480
and you could do it within

19:54.480 --> 19:56.240
I think any Ubuntu base would be

19:56.240 --> 19:57.600
essentially the same.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.240
OK.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.560
The features that we're working on that

20:00.560 --> 20:02.960
to improve the operating system

20:02.960 --> 20:04.160
experience of the hardware experience

20:04.160 --> 20:05.040
through the operating system

20:05.040 --> 20:06.800
with this firmware are things

20:06.800 --> 20:07.840
that we're going to have.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.520
Some of them will be add on applications

20:10.400 --> 20:11.520
like the keyboard mapping

20:11.520 --> 20:13.120
and that that utility.

20:13.120 --> 20:15.360
But we're working upstream with Gnome

20:15.360 --> 20:16.640
on battery thresholds.

20:16.640 --> 20:18.240
We just filed some issues up there

20:18.240 --> 20:19.440
and we're working on design.

20:19.440 --> 20:20.480
So we hope that that's something

20:20.480 --> 20:21.760
that will be usable not only

20:21.760 --> 20:23.120
by System76 customers, but

20:23.680 --> 20:26.320
there are standard interfaces,

20:26.320 --> 20:27.600
kernel interfaces for this.

20:27.600 --> 20:28.800
So that means if we can get

20:28.800 --> 20:31.040
this work done, other laptops

20:31.040 --> 20:32.640
that do have this type of

20:32.640 --> 20:34.640
functionality in their firmware

20:34.640 --> 20:36.320
will be able to take advantage of it, too.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.600
Carl, don't you know how capitalism

20:37.600 --> 20:38.080
supposed to work?

20:38.080 --> 20:39.120
You're supposed to keep all this stuff

20:39.120 --> 20:39.680
for yourself.

20:40.320 --> 20:42.320
You know, I don't think that's

20:42.320 --> 20:43.360
the way to do it anymore.

20:45.680 --> 20:46.800
You might be onto something.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.520
You might be.

20:47.520 --> 20:47.920
Yeah.

20:47.920 --> 20:48.800
You know, I don't know.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.320
You know, this does make me curious.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.480
You know, you guys have been exploring

20:52.480 --> 20:53.760
more, you know, with the Thelio

20:53.760 --> 20:54.560
making your own stuff.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.720
And there's talk maybe someday

20:56.720 --> 20:58.800
of a, you know, in-house laptop

20:58.800 --> 21:00.960
has working at this low level of hardware

21:00.960 --> 21:02.240
given you guys any insights there

21:02.240 --> 21:03.520
to future designs?

21:03.520 --> 21:05.600
It has. Well, in some ways,

21:05.600 --> 21:07.360
in that we want the work that we do

21:07.360 --> 21:09.200
to be as open source as

21:09.920 --> 21:12.480
is possible, given the resources

21:12.480 --> 21:13.520
and supply chain we have.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.200
So we've learned things from that.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.040
But where we've learned,

21:17.040 --> 21:18.320
where I think we're learning more

21:18.320 --> 21:19.920
is actually in our keyboard project,

21:19.920 --> 21:20.560
believe it or not.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.440
Because in that project,

21:23.440 --> 21:24.800
we've designed a PCB.

21:25.520 --> 21:27.280
There's some secret sauce

21:27.280 --> 21:29.040
in the keyboard project

21:29.040 --> 21:31.120
that enables us to learn

21:31.120 --> 21:32.080
some other things

21:32.080 --> 21:33.520
and had great gain experience

21:34.480 --> 21:35.360
with laptops.

21:35.360 --> 21:37.040
But the third thing it does is

21:37.040 --> 21:38.720
we're working on precision milling

21:38.720 --> 21:39.520
with the keyboard.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.480
Oh, sure.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.000
So with precision milling,

21:43.200 --> 21:44.400
we'll have a better understanding

21:44.400 --> 21:46.400
of how to approach laptop chassis design.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.760
What an interesting way to kind of

21:47.760 --> 21:50.000
step to that kind of project

21:50.000 --> 21:52.560
and learning at this level

21:52.560 --> 21:54.720
is not only safer for the business,

21:54.720 --> 21:56.640
but you'll also no doubt

21:56.640 --> 21:57.680
end up making a product

21:57.680 --> 21:59.600
that I think the community would be

21:59.600 --> 22:00.560
interested in purchasing.

22:00.560 --> 22:01.840
So it's kind of a win win.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.360
It's kind of clever, Carl.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.800
I didn't expect all of the perks

22:06.800 --> 22:08.000
that you mentioned with the open firmware.

22:08.000 --> 22:08.640
And I got to say,

22:08.640 --> 22:09.760
I didn't expect the...

22:09.760 --> 22:11.360
I don't know how I missed that detail

22:11.360 --> 22:12.400
about the fact that you guys

22:12.400 --> 22:13.280
were working with Intel,

22:13.280 --> 22:15.280
but all this stuff looks really good.

22:15.840 --> 22:16.640
You know, as long as...

22:16.640 --> 22:17.760
As soon as I can get a laptop

22:17.760 --> 22:18.960
with a 2K screen, Carl,

22:18.960 --> 22:21.360
soon as I think you might have

22:21.360 --> 22:22.080
a new customer.

22:24.320 --> 22:25.040
It's just a dream.

22:25.040 --> 22:25.440
It's a dream.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.800
But it's the panel manufacturers

22:26.800 --> 22:27.520
that need to deliver.

22:28.080 --> 22:28.880
Have you seen the Adder?

22:28.880 --> 22:29.680
I just have to ask.

22:29.680 --> 22:30.480
I don't recall.

22:30.480 --> 22:31.440
I do know about the Adder,

22:31.440 --> 22:33.440
but does it have a dedicated GPU?

22:33.440 --> 22:34.160
It does.

22:34.160 --> 22:34.800
Oh, okay.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.040
Let's see.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.640
I thought it was Intel GPU.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.440
It's dedicated,

22:37.440 --> 22:39.040
but with hybrid graphics

22:39.040 --> 22:41.760
and it has an OLED display

22:41.760 --> 22:43.120
that is the absolute

22:43.120 --> 22:44.640
most gorgeous display.

22:44.640 --> 22:45.120
Really?

22:45.120 --> 22:45.840
Possible.

22:45.840 --> 22:46.400
Yeah.

22:46.400 --> 22:47.120
It's striking.

22:47.120 --> 22:47.440
Really?

22:47.440 --> 22:49.440
I can't even put my laptops next to it.

22:49.440 --> 22:51.840
This might look terrible next to it.

22:51.840 --> 22:52.880
Okay.

22:52.880 --> 22:53.600
Too good.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.100
Yeah.

22:55.280 --> 22:55.760
All right.

22:55.760 --> 22:56.240
All right.

22:56.240 --> 22:56.640
Okay.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.080
I'll have to give that one a look.

22:58.080 --> 22:59.600
Well, Carl, thanks for coming on

22:59.600 --> 23:00.320
and chatting about that.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.680
You're welcome to hang out

23:01.680 --> 23:02.400
for the rest of the show

23:02.400 --> 23:03.440
or you are cleared free

23:03.440 --> 23:04.560
to navigate as Unique.

23:04.560 --> 23:05.760
I'm sure you got lots to do too,

23:05.760 --> 23:08.000
but I appreciate the update on stuff.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.200
He's got keyboard settings to tweak.

23:09.200 --> 23:09.840
Come on, Chris.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.040
Thanks for having me, guys.

23:13.040 --> 23:13.360
Yeah.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.000
Thanks, Carl.

23:14.000 --> 23:14.480
It was great.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.960
Linode.com slash unplugged.

23:18.960 --> 23:21.200
Get a $100 60-day credit

23:21.200 --> 23:22.560
on a new account.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.440
Linode solves the problem of servers,

23:25.440 --> 23:28.880
whether it's a big powerful GPU powered server

23:28.880 --> 23:30.560
or something that just gets a job done

23:30.560 --> 23:31.040
in the background

23:31.040 --> 23:31.920
that you never think about.

23:31.920 --> 23:34.480
They've got the whole range to choose from.

23:34.480 --> 23:35.280
I go with Linode

23:35.280 --> 23:36.800
for not only my personal stuff,

23:36.800 --> 23:37.440
but for all of our

23:37.440 --> 23:39.840
Jupiter broadcasting infrastructure as well.

23:39.840 --> 23:42.160
And Linode costs 30 to 50% less

23:42.160 --> 23:44.000
than competitors like AWS.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.760
And they have a much better interface

23:45.760 --> 23:46.560
and dashboard.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.080
But I think more importantly for us,

23:49.120 --> 23:51.040
Linux is baked into their culture.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.240
You might recall Jeff Dyke,

23:52.240 --> 23:53.680
who was an active Linux contributor,

23:53.680 --> 23:54.800
had developed a technology

23:54.800 --> 23:57.520
called User Mode Linux a decade ago.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.560
Plus now.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.280
Wow.

23:59.280 --> 24:00.880
User Mode Linux allowed developers

24:00.880 --> 24:01.840
create virtual machines

24:01.840 --> 24:04.080
within Linux computers.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.280
And at the time,

24:05.280 --> 24:06.720
single use applications

24:06.720 --> 24:08.160
seemed like the way to go.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.920
But some developers saw a different path.

24:09.920 --> 24:10.960
And one of those developers

24:10.960 --> 24:12.000
was a young technologist

24:12.000 --> 24:13.280
named Christopher Acker.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.480
He saw an opportunity

24:14.480 --> 24:16.560
to use the hypervisor technology

24:16.560 --> 24:17.600
not only to build something

24:17.600 --> 24:19.040
like Salesforce or Amazon,

24:19.600 --> 24:20.640
but to build something

24:20.640 --> 24:22.000
that made cloud computing

24:22.000 --> 24:23.360
less complicated,

24:23.360 --> 24:24.560
less expensive,

24:24.560 --> 24:25.440
and more accessible

24:25.440 --> 24:26.320
to every developer,

24:26.320 --> 24:28.080
regardless of where they're located

24:28.080 --> 24:29.840
or what their resources were.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.520
He built a company around that idea.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.280
And that company is Linode.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.280
They helped pioneer cloud computing.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.520
And now, two decades later,

24:37.520 --> 24:39.600
Linode is the largest independent

24:39.600 --> 24:41.440
open cloud provider in the world

24:41.440 --> 24:43.760
with 11 global data centers.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.280
The culture and experience

24:45.280 --> 24:46.240
in the Linux community

24:46.240 --> 24:48.000
is baked into every aspect

24:48.000 --> 24:48.800
of the company

24:48.800 --> 24:50.160
from their own internal culture,

24:50.160 --> 24:52.560
but also the controls they give you

24:52.560 --> 24:54.480
over the servers themselves.

24:54.480 --> 24:55.520
For my infrastructure,

24:55.520 --> 24:57.360
I generally go with a mid-tier system.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.360
But for the boxes that do encoding,

24:59.360 --> 25:01.040
we went with dedicated CPUs.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.720
And for my system that essentially

25:02.720 --> 25:04.000
just acts as a jump host,

25:04.000 --> 25:05.760
well, that's a $5 a month system.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.280
I take advantage of object storage

25:07.280 --> 25:08.800
is backed by native SSDs

25:08.800 --> 25:09.680
and enterprise grade

25:09.680 --> 25:11.440
40 gigabit connections.

25:11.440 --> 25:12.480
It's really fast.

25:12.480 --> 25:13.440
It's easy to use.

25:14.160 --> 25:15.680
And they're part of the Linux community.

25:15.680 --> 25:16.720
You get started by going

25:16.720 --> 25:18.560
to linode.com slash unplugged.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.640
You get that $100 60 day credit

25:20.640 --> 25:21.600
on your new account

25:21.600 --> 25:22.960
and you're off to the races.

25:22.960 --> 25:24.160
Go see what you can build.

25:24.160 --> 25:28.880
linode.com slash unplugged.

25:28.880 --> 25:31.280
I fantasize about an open power,

25:31.280 --> 25:33.440
you know, like an open power PC laptop.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.560
Who doesn't?

25:34.560 --> 25:36.400
And it turns out

25:36.400 --> 25:37.840
that the Open Power Summit

25:37.840 --> 25:38.720
was this week.

25:39.360 --> 25:41.440
And there has been an update

25:41.440 --> 25:44.320
on the status of a power PC laptop.

25:44.320 --> 25:45.360
It's not power PC

25:45.360 --> 25:46.160
like you used to note.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.920
IBM has really been promoting

25:48.480 --> 25:49.360
how in they are

25:49.360 --> 25:50.640
with how open this thing is.

25:50.640 --> 25:51.520
They also released

25:51.520 --> 25:52.400
a bunch of other stuff

25:52.400 --> 25:54.000
open source over the week.

25:54.000 --> 25:54.800
We'll have a link

25:54.800 --> 25:56.640
to all of the video presentations

25:56.640 --> 25:57.520
which cover a ton

25:57.520 --> 25:58.400
of the announcements

25:59.440 --> 26:00.560
in the show notes.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.000
But the Linux Foundation

26:02.000 --> 26:03.280
had the Open Power Summit

26:04.400 --> 26:05.680
North America edition

26:05.680 --> 26:06.240
is what it's called.

26:06.240 --> 26:07.920
I guess there's multiple editions.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.400
I didn't realize that,

26:10.400 --> 26:11.840
but the recordings are online.

26:11.840 --> 26:13.200
So we're going to leave

26:13.200 --> 26:14.720
most of the homework up to you.

26:14.720 --> 26:15.440
But there was one

26:15.440 --> 26:16.960
that did catch our attention.

26:16.960 --> 26:19.360
Roberto Inocenti provided an update

26:19.360 --> 26:21.680
on the power 64 laptop

26:21.680 --> 26:22.960
and still being worked on

26:22.960 --> 26:25.120
via community donations

26:25.120 --> 26:27.760
as an open hardware platform.

26:27.760 --> 26:28.640
Now we should know

26:28.640 --> 26:30.160
before you get too excited.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.960
Mostly this is R&D right now

26:32.960 --> 26:34.000
as opposed to being focused

26:34.000 --> 26:35.440
on making or selling

26:35.440 --> 26:36.720
a physical product.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.320
But you got to start somewhere.

26:38.880 --> 26:40.240
We have this difficult know

26:40.240 --> 26:41.200
how to solve this

26:41.200 --> 26:42.640
was not simple to find

26:43.360 --> 26:45.680
even already built

26:46.880 --> 26:48.640
body, notebook body.

26:48.640 --> 26:49.680
But at the end,

26:49.680 --> 26:51.680
thanks to Slimbook

26:51.680 --> 26:55.520
we was able to find this solution.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.880
So nowadays we have the possibility

26:58.880 --> 27:01.440
we have designed our motherboard

27:01.440 --> 27:05.760
especially for Slimbook's Eclipse.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.080
This is the model

27:08.080 --> 27:11.600
that is a game oriented

27:11.600 --> 27:12.960
the notebook body.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.680
Yeah, the Slimbook Eclipse chassis

27:15.680 --> 27:18.160
is what they're aiming at.

27:18.160 --> 27:20.160
And they think that it's kind of like

27:20.160 --> 27:21.680
it's kind of like you got to know

27:21.680 --> 27:22.880
the chassis you're building for

27:22.880 --> 27:23.520
to really do all

27:23.520 --> 27:24.800
the electrical stuff properly.

27:24.800 --> 27:25.680
So this is going to great

27:25.680 --> 27:26.640
to just get this nailed down

27:26.640 --> 27:27.760
and they're going to include

27:27.760 --> 27:28.800
a GPU in there.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.160
I don't I don't know where it really

27:30.160 --> 27:31.840
stacks up in the grand scheme of things.

27:31.840 --> 27:32.800
But this entire project

27:32.800 --> 27:35.120
really been going since 2014.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.120
It's it's slow R&D

27:37.120 --> 27:38.400
but there's been various points

27:38.400 --> 27:40.400
along the way where they've

27:40.400 --> 27:41.840
done a community fundraiser

27:41.840 --> 27:43.440
to get over whatever

27:43.440 --> 27:44.640
particular mountain they happen

27:44.640 --> 27:46.160
to be climbing at that moment.

27:46.160 --> 27:47.440
And they're reaching another

27:47.440 --> 27:48.960
one of those moments right now.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.200
And I got to say,

27:51.200 --> 27:52.560
it's not going very well.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.000
This is getting really close

27:54.000 --> 27:55.840
to an actual laptop here,

27:55.840 --> 27:57.600
an actual power PC laptop

27:58.240 --> 28:00.000
that isn't a known good chassis.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.720
But the funding is stalled.

28:02.720 --> 28:06.080
They are aiming for five thousand

28:06.080 --> 28:08.160
and they've got eight hundred and ten

28:08.160 --> 28:10.320
of non-U.S. funny money.

28:10.320 --> 28:11.280
And the reality is,

28:11.280 --> 28:12.400
is that that trajectory,

28:12.400 --> 28:13.520
they're just not going to get there.

28:14.080 --> 28:15.760
There's been a couple of two hundred dollars.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.560
Well, not dollars.

28:16.560 --> 28:17.280
It's funny money.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.560
There's been a couple of donations

28:18.560 --> 28:19.060
here and there.

28:19.840 --> 28:20.400
But I don't think

28:20.400 --> 28:21.280
it's going to make it, Wes.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.160
I don't unless unless this changes

28:24.160 --> 28:25.040
or they get the word out

28:25.040 --> 28:25.920
and this has been running

28:25.920 --> 28:27.280
since the 7th of September.

28:28.080 --> 28:28.800
Unless they get the word out,

28:28.800 --> 28:29.920
I don't think it's going to make it.

28:29.920 --> 28:30.320
Yeah.

28:30.320 --> 28:31.600
I mean, if you're interested,

28:31.600 --> 28:33.120
I guess now's the time.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.800
We were recently debating,

28:34.800 --> 28:36.880
discussing, contemplating

28:36.880 --> 28:38.800
the future after the Nvidia

28:38.800 --> 28:39.920
ARM acquisition.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.160
And we sort of jokingly

28:42.160 --> 28:43.840
threw out open power.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.520
But it does turn out that there's

28:45.520 --> 28:47.360
there's a lot going on in this space

28:47.360 --> 28:49.840
and maybe maybe we all need to be

28:49.840 --> 28:50.960
paying a little more attention

28:50.960 --> 28:52.880
and just investing a little bit more.

28:52.880 --> 28:53.760
Maybe it's a pipe dream.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.640
Maybe everybody just feels like it's

28:56.640 --> 28:57.600
you know, they're writing it off.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.000
It's just it just seems like it's

29:00.000 --> 29:01.680
it's been going since 2014.

29:01.680 --> 29:02.800
And by the time they're done,

29:02.800 --> 29:03.520
it's not even going to be

29:03.520 --> 29:04.640
really a competitive system.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.240
It's just going to be a right.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.600
I mean, you're still in those stages

29:07.600 --> 29:08.880
of trying to get it to work

29:09.520 --> 29:10.480
at all, really, right?

29:10.480 --> 29:11.040
To get it, you know,

29:11.040 --> 29:12.000
get it all pieced together,

29:12.000 --> 29:13.280
get it in the right form factor.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.800
And then by the time you're done,

29:15.360 --> 29:16.320
well, it's hardly going to be

29:16.320 --> 29:18.640
competitive with the latest XPS 13

29:18.640 --> 29:20.480
or system 76 offering.

29:20.480 --> 29:21.600
Yeah, yeah.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.960
Well, OK, speaking of arm.

29:23.840 --> 29:24.960
You know, Endeavor OS,

29:24.960 --> 29:27.440
which born out of integrals.

29:27.440 --> 29:29.840
Well, they're aiming

29:29.840 --> 29:32.000
for an arm launch themselves.

29:32.000 --> 29:32.720
So you'll be able to get

29:32.720 --> 29:34.320
Endeavor OS on arm,

29:34.880 --> 29:37.440
which since Manjaro has been

29:37.440 --> 29:38.800
pretty much the only arch

29:38.800 --> 29:39.840
derivative targeting arm,

29:39.840 --> 29:41.280
they've kind of ran away with it.

29:41.280 --> 29:42.720
But now Endeavor OS realizes

29:42.720 --> 29:43.920
maybe we missed the mark.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.000
Now, we probably should note

29:46.000 --> 29:47.440
that Endeavor OS at the moment

29:47.440 --> 29:49.040
is still a small team,

29:49.040 --> 29:50.800
so they haven't tested it on

29:50.800 --> 29:52.160
all possible arm devices

29:52.160 --> 29:54.240
because that's just crazy.

29:54.240 --> 29:54.880
But if you're, you know,

29:54.880 --> 29:56.080
running like an Odroid

29:56.080 --> 29:59.120
or, of course, a Raspberry Pi 4,

29:59.120 --> 30:00.480
well, then, yeah, you're in luck.

30:01.200 --> 30:04.080
Yeah, let's let's file

30:04.080 --> 30:06.000
Endeavor OS away for talking about

30:06.000 --> 30:07.280
later on in the show today,

30:07.280 --> 30:08.880
because I think that kind of comes up

30:08.880 --> 30:10.560
in the area that we're

30:10.560 --> 30:11.520
going to be talking about.

30:12.480 --> 30:13.520
Yes, in the meantime,

30:13.520 --> 30:16.880
let's do a little housekeeping.

30:16.880 --> 30:18.640
Now, this here program is live

30:18.640 --> 30:20.240
on a Tuesday at noon Pacific

30:20.240 --> 30:21.520
over at jblive.tv.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.200
We were off last week,

30:23.200 --> 30:24.160
but we're back.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.360
I mean, if you get the download,

30:25.920 --> 30:26.880
we were never away.

30:26.880 --> 30:28.480
You won't notice a thing.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.640
But we're back in our regular lifetime,

30:30.640 --> 30:31.280
and we'd love to have you

30:31.280 --> 30:32.640
join us in the Mumble Room.

30:33.200 --> 30:35.280
Also, if you're around on Sunday

30:35.280 --> 30:36.080
at the same time,

30:36.080 --> 30:36.960
just a different day,

30:36.960 --> 30:38.400
the Luplug is going.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.120
You can get in there

30:39.120 --> 30:40.000
and just chat Linux

30:40.000 --> 30:41.280
with like-minded folks

30:41.280 --> 30:43.280
in our Mumble Room lobby.

30:43.280 --> 30:44.240
And then, you know,

30:44.240 --> 30:45.280
your mobile is all set up.

30:46.080 --> 30:46.720
So when you're playing

30:46.720 --> 30:47.440
hooky from work,

30:48.080 --> 30:48.800
you could jump in there

30:48.800 --> 30:50.160
and join us on the show.

30:50.160 --> 30:50.960
That's great.

30:50.960 --> 30:51.760
You're already set up.

30:51.760 --> 30:52.400
Why not do it?

30:53.200 --> 30:54.800
And also, last but not least,

30:54.800 --> 30:56.560
thank you to our members.

30:56.560 --> 30:58.320
Our core contributors are helping

30:58.320 --> 30:59.840
not only this show run independently,

30:59.840 --> 31:01.360
but right now they're helping

31:01.360 --> 31:02.080
do the production.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.280
Like it just wouldn't be possible

31:03.280 --> 31:03.840
without them.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.760
It's it's fantastic.

31:05.760 --> 31:07.360
If you'd like to be a core contributor,

31:07.360 --> 31:09.120
you can go to unpluggedcore.com.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.440
You get two feeds to choose from

31:11.440 --> 31:12.400
the live version,

31:12.400 --> 31:14.800
which is a lot longer of a show.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.320
So if you have a long commute

31:16.320 --> 31:18.800
or you just want more Linux unplugged,

31:18.800 --> 31:20.960
you want to hear all of our mistakes.

31:20.960 --> 31:21.920
Yeah, or, you know,

31:21.920 --> 31:23.840
welcoming guests on as they join us

31:23.840 --> 31:24.880
and we get all set up

31:24.880 --> 31:25.520
and all of our friends

31:25.520 --> 31:26.320
join the Mumble Room.

31:26.320 --> 31:27.920
We all catch up with each other.

31:27.920 --> 31:29.440
That's what's going on there.

31:29.440 --> 31:30.080
And then, of course,

31:30.080 --> 31:30.640
in the post show,

31:30.640 --> 31:31.360
we're usually fired up

31:31.360 --> 31:32.880
about something from the show.

31:32.880 --> 31:34.640
We usually get into something

31:34.640 --> 31:36.160
and it just doesn't make into the show

31:36.960 --> 31:38.240
because we also want to have

31:38.240 --> 31:39.360
a tight edited version

31:39.360 --> 31:40.640
available for everybody.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.440
And if you're a member,

31:41.440 --> 31:43.360
that's where that second feed comes in.

31:43.360 --> 31:44.640
You get a version of that show

31:44.640 --> 31:45.520
with limited ads.

31:45.520 --> 31:46.720
There's some that are contractually

31:46.720 --> 31:47.760
obligated to be in there,

31:48.720 --> 31:50.880
but most aren't.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.480
And we cut them out.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.160
You still get the same great production,

31:54.160 --> 31:56.080
just no ads.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.760
And those are available for our members

31:57.760 --> 32:00.080
at unpluggedcore.com.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.280
Unpluggedcore.com.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.360
Thank you, everybody who joined up.

32:03.360 --> 32:04.240
We really appreciate it.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.840
And Mr. Payne with that.

32:07.600 --> 32:08.480
That's the housekeeping.

32:08.480 --> 32:10.160
Still keeping it pretty tidy these days.

32:10.160 --> 32:11.360
Yeah, it looks good in here.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.480
I got the natural light,

32:12.480 --> 32:14.160
a few more houseplants,

32:14.160 --> 32:15.200
ship shape.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.400
You got houseplants?

32:16.400 --> 32:16.880
Really?

32:16.880 --> 32:18.160
Do you really have houseplants?

32:18.160 --> 32:18.720
Of course.

32:19.440 --> 32:19.920
Huh.

32:19.920 --> 32:20.400
I don't know.

32:20.400 --> 32:22.640
I just I didn't picture you as

32:23.280 --> 32:24.720
not that you wouldn't have houseplants

32:24.720 --> 32:25.440
because I mean,

32:25.440 --> 32:26.480
I'm sure you have a lovely place.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.160
But what I didn't picture

32:28.160 --> 32:29.360
is you being the kind of guy

32:30.000 --> 32:31.520
who takes an afternoon

32:31.520 --> 32:33.360
to go out and buy plants,

32:33.360 --> 32:33.600
you know,

32:33.600 --> 32:34.560
because it's not like you just

32:34.560 --> 32:35.680
it's not like a precision thing

32:35.680 --> 32:36.320
where you just run out

32:36.320 --> 32:36.800
and get a plant.

32:36.800 --> 32:37.920
You got a plant shop.

32:37.920 --> 32:38.560
You got to figure out

32:38.560 --> 32:40.240
what plant place you're going to go to.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.240
You got to get plant maintenance supplies.

32:42.240 --> 32:43.600
And that's where I just didn't really

32:43.600 --> 32:44.720
see you being into it.

32:44.720 --> 32:45.840
Well, it helps when you have

32:45.840 --> 32:46.560
too many friends

32:46.560 --> 32:48.160
who are also into plants

32:48.160 --> 32:50.000
and just offering you cuttings

32:50.000 --> 32:50.720
all the time.

32:50.720 --> 32:50.960
I see.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.000
So they come over and they go,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.080
Wes, plant pushers.

32:54.080 --> 32:55.520
Wes, we got to do something about this.

32:55.520 --> 32:56.880
We got to liven it up in here.

32:56.880 --> 32:57.680
There's no green.

32:58.400 --> 32:59.680
These poor dogs.

32:59.680 --> 33:00.880
Well, OK, so let's talk about

33:00.880 --> 33:01.840
some poor distributions

33:01.840 --> 33:03.280
that despite how interesting

33:03.280 --> 33:04.240
and compelling they might be,

33:05.120 --> 33:05.760
I don't know if they're ever

33:05.760 --> 33:06.960
going to get traction.

33:06.960 --> 33:08.560
It might be my bias.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.600
You may have noticed

33:09.600 --> 33:10.560
in this here program,

33:11.360 --> 33:12.000
we don't do a lot

33:12.000 --> 33:13.200
of distro reviews anymore.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.240
Used to do a lot

33:14.240 --> 33:15.120
of distro reviews.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.520
But now we kind of just

33:18.640 --> 33:19.920
do the big heavy hitters

33:20.640 --> 33:21.840
because I think

33:21.840 --> 33:22.400
and it's just been

33:22.400 --> 33:23.440
an unspoken bias

33:23.440 --> 33:25.360
that may have developed.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.360
I can't really see me

33:27.360 --> 33:28.320
coming on this show

33:29.200 --> 33:30.240
and telling you about

33:30.240 --> 33:31.840
how great Deep in 20 is

33:32.640 --> 33:34.640
and getting more than five percent

33:34.640 --> 33:36.320
of you from actually switching

33:36.320 --> 33:37.200
from your actual

33:37.200 --> 33:38.240
daily driver Linux.

33:38.880 --> 33:39.520
It just doesn't seem

33:39.520 --> 33:40.400
like it's going to happen.

33:40.400 --> 33:40.880
Yeah, you know,

33:40.880 --> 33:41.680
this really started

33:41.680 --> 33:42.960
quite the discussion between us.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.160
Just we were, you know,

33:44.160 --> 33:45.200
Deep in 20 came out

33:45.200 --> 33:46.480
and it was it was on our radar.

33:46.480 --> 33:47.600
We were interested in it.

33:47.600 --> 33:48.320
I mean, there's a lot

33:48.320 --> 33:50.000
about it to like, seemingly,

33:50.000 --> 33:50.880
at least from the bit

33:50.880 --> 33:51.840
that I've played with it.

33:51.840 --> 33:53.680
But yeah, who are we

33:53.680 --> 33:54.720
recommending it for?

33:55.440 --> 33:57.200
And where does that fit

33:57.200 --> 33:58.480
in where Linux is going

33:58.480 --> 34:00.160
and where desktop Linux

34:00.160 --> 34:01.760
fits in 2020?

34:01.760 --> 34:02.880
And here's a scenario for you.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.560
OK, so we're not going to be able

34:04.560 --> 34:06.000
to convince a diehard

34:06.000 --> 34:08.800
arch user or a person

34:08.800 --> 34:10.160
who believes in the elementary

34:10.160 --> 34:11.120
way of designing

34:11.120 --> 34:12.480
an operating system or somebody

34:12.480 --> 34:13.760
who has been an Ubuntu user

34:13.760 --> 34:15.280
and used it for work for years.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.560
We're not going to convince them

34:16.560 --> 34:18.000
that Deep in 20 is something

34:18.000 --> 34:18.800
that's even worth them

34:18.800 --> 34:20.000
really trying because they've

34:20.000 --> 34:20.720
got work to do.

34:20.720 --> 34:21.920
They're set in their ways.

34:21.920 --> 34:22.880
You have people who like to

34:22.880 --> 34:24.560
hobby hop and they'll try it out,

34:24.560 --> 34:25.280
but you're not going to get

34:25.280 --> 34:26.320
actually any real traction.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.360
Like the distribution isn't going

34:27.360 --> 34:28.720
to see millions in growth.

34:29.680 --> 34:30.720
And so then I thought, well,

34:30.720 --> 34:31.920
maybe it's for new users,

34:32.560 --> 34:34.000
new users who are already

34:34.000 --> 34:35.040
not set in their ways.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.080
You know, they're open to the

34:36.080 --> 34:38.320
possibilities that the many,

34:38.320 --> 34:39.520
many distros provide.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.320
But then I thought, wouldn't

34:42.320 --> 34:44.320
that be a disservice to that

34:44.320 --> 34:46.240
end user if you set them up

34:46.240 --> 34:48.400
on a niche distribution

34:48.400 --> 34:49.920
and then expect them to just go

34:49.920 --> 34:51.920
about their computing life

34:51.920 --> 34:53.280
as if they can just get

34:53.280 --> 34:54.400
everything done that they could

34:54.400 --> 34:55.600
if they are on Windows or Mac

34:55.600 --> 34:56.320
or Ubuntu?

34:56.960 --> 34:57.600
No, of course not.

34:57.600 --> 34:58.800
Now, now that they're on this

34:58.800 --> 35:00.080
niche distribution, it's much

35:00.080 --> 35:01.120
harder for them to do any

35:01.120 --> 35:02.080
research and find support,

35:02.080 --> 35:03.040
especially if their Google

35:03.040 --> 35:04.400
foo isn't tuned to years of

35:04.400 --> 35:05.280
Linux searching.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.000
That's just it.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.160
Sure, Deepin has a Debian base,

35:08.160 --> 35:09.280
but if you don't really

35:09.280 --> 35:10.720
understand how all of that

35:10.720 --> 35:11.840
works and you're Googling

35:11.840 --> 35:13.360
specifically for the OS that

35:13.360 --> 35:14.480
your system tells you you're

35:14.480 --> 35:16.160
running, that might be more

35:16.160 --> 35:16.640
trouble.

35:16.640 --> 35:17.760
Well, and how would they even be

35:17.760 --> 35:19.600
able to deduce what the base OS

35:19.600 --> 35:20.000
is? Right.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.680
I mean, that's just they're

35:21.680 --> 35:22.720
just not thinking like that.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.560
That's not how a consumer that

35:24.560 --> 35:26.000
isn't actively selecting and

35:26.000 --> 35:27.200
choosing an operating system

35:27.200 --> 35:29.120
like this conceives of the

35:29.120 --> 35:30.160
construction of the computer.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.280
That's just not that's not where

35:31.280 --> 35:32.240
their head is at.

35:32.240 --> 35:32.800
Right.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.160
So Deepin isn't great for new

35:34.160 --> 35:36.240
users, then necessarily unless

35:36.240 --> 35:37.440
it's a managed environment,

35:37.440 --> 35:38.800
perhaps where there is an

35:38.800 --> 35:40.160
administrator who can guide and

35:40.160 --> 35:40.960
help users.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.560
But that's a pretty niche case

35:42.560 --> 35:44.000
for a pretty niche distribution

35:44.000 --> 35:44.560
all of a sudden.

35:45.200 --> 35:46.720
And so as you whittle it down,

35:46.720 --> 35:47.840
you start to you start to

35:47.840 --> 35:49.440
realize like we really have no

35:49.440 --> 35:51.680
shot of convincing an arch user

35:51.680 --> 35:53.120
to move off arch or a Fedora

35:53.120 --> 35:55.200
user to switch to Ubuntu.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.240
I mean, they may elect on their

35:56.240 --> 35:56.960
own based on some of the

35:56.960 --> 35:58.480
features we talk about, but I

35:58.480 --> 35:59.600
think I just started realizing

35:59.600 --> 36:01.440
there's almost no point to it

36:01.440 --> 36:03.520
other than just for the

36:03.520 --> 36:05.040
technical exploration, which I

36:05.040 --> 36:06.720
enjoy and I think is worth it on

36:06.720 --> 36:07.360
its own.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.800
But it doesn't really seem to go

36:08.800 --> 36:09.360
beyond that.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.080
And and so I can't really fathom

36:12.080 --> 36:16.000
a reality where a distribution

36:16.000 --> 36:19.440
like Deepin or a distribution

36:19.440 --> 36:21.680
like Endeavor OS really has a

36:21.680 --> 36:23.200
shot of ever going beyond a few

36:23.200 --> 36:24.560
hundred thousand users.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.000
You know, Mini Mac over in the

36:26.000 --> 36:28.560
IRC raises the question if if

36:28.560 --> 36:30.160
we're not going to be, you know,

36:30.160 --> 36:32.560
spreading the word, who will?

36:32.560 --> 36:33.760
Yeah, I guess the question,

36:33.760 --> 36:36.960
Brent, is what is their what is

36:36.960 --> 36:38.240
their definition of success?

36:38.960 --> 36:40.000
If it's perhaps to scratch

36:40.000 --> 36:42.080
their own itch, then, you know,

36:42.080 --> 36:42.640
check.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.960
But if it's to attract a rich

36:44.960 --> 36:46.640
community, then there needs to

36:46.640 --> 36:47.920
be a way of spreading that

36:47.920 --> 36:48.800
regularly.

36:48.800 --> 36:49.120
Right.

36:49.120 --> 36:52.800
And maybe there's a fatigue

36:52.800 --> 36:55.040
there, fatigue for finding new

36:55.840 --> 36:56.880
interesting stuff.

36:56.880 --> 36:57.840
Yeah, I could definitely see

36:57.840 --> 36:58.080
that.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.200
And I think there's also the

36:59.200 --> 37:00.560
question of relevancy, the

37:00.560 --> 37:02.240
operating system as a whole.

37:02.240 --> 37:03.200
If you were to just take the

37:03.200 --> 37:04.800
base temperature of the

37:04.800 --> 37:06.480
computing industry, the

37:06.480 --> 37:08.080
importance of the desktop has

37:08.080 --> 37:09.920
rescinded a bit and the

37:09.920 --> 37:11.520
importance of the web browser

37:11.520 --> 37:13.680
and the importance of mobile has

37:13.680 --> 37:14.880
ascended quite a bit.

37:14.880 --> 37:15.920
And I think you have to

37:15.920 --> 37:18.080
consider that has to have some

37:18.080 --> 37:19.840
sort of perceptive knock on

37:19.840 --> 37:21.120
effect on the Linux desktop as

37:21.120 --> 37:21.280
well.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.000
It has to.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.400
You could imply from that that,

37:24.400 --> 37:26.000
well, if the desktop itself has

37:26.000 --> 37:28.720
become less important, then the

37:28.720 --> 37:30.240
operating system it runs has

37:30.240 --> 37:31.360
become less important.

37:31.360 --> 37:34.000
And then the distro has become

37:34.000 --> 37:35.040
less important.

37:35.040 --> 37:36.000
And it's really can I run

37:36.000 --> 37:38.480
Firefox and Chrome?

37:38.480 --> 37:39.920
And then there's the essential

37:39.920 --> 37:41.200
question of what's the base aim

37:41.200 --> 37:42.080
of the distro, Neil?

37:42.080 --> 37:43.280
Like what what market is it

37:43.280 --> 37:43.920
going after?

37:43.920 --> 37:46.080
And to that, that seems like

37:46.080 --> 37:47.040
that's where it appeals to each

37:47.040 --> 37:48.240
individual user.

37:48.240 --> 37:49.520
There's usually two different

37:49.520 --> 37:50.160
aspects.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.640
What is the novel aspect of the

37:52.640 --> 37:55.920
distribution and what is what is

37:55.920 --> 37:58.000
the goal of the distribution?

37:58.000 --> 38:01.680
So, for example, if I take my

38:02.880 --> 38:04.800
preferred distribution Fedora,

38:05.600 --> 38:08.160
the novel part of Fedora is that

38:09.440 --> 38:10.960
it's a community that attempts

38:10.960 --> 38:12.400
to integrate all the software

38:12.400 --> 38:13.440
and make it work together while

38:13.440 --> 38:14.880
simultaneously working with the

38:14.880 --> 38:15.920
upstream projects.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.200
So like things fit together, but

38:19.200 --> 38:21.520
not in a way where nobody else

38:21.520 --> 38:22.400
benefits from it.

38:22.960 --> 38:25.200
Now, then, you know, that's that

38:25.200 --> 38:27.040
fits the novel and the aim

38:27.040 --> 38:28.720
because it's both about bringing

38:28.720 --> 38:30.480
the latest stuff in, which is

38:31.040 --> 38:32.560
which is part of the aim of it to

38:32.560 --> 38:33.760
support, you know, bringing the

38:33.760 --> 38:34.720
latest stuff and making it

38:34.720 --> 38:36.080
available to people.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.840
And, you know, what is the novel

38:37.840 --> 38:39.440
aspect of it is that instead of

38:39.440 --> 38:40.880
just doing it on its own in its

38:40.880 --> 38:43.200
own island, it, you know, it aims

38:43.200 --> 38:44.560
to contribute and benefit the

38:44.560 --> 38:45.920
larger Linux community.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.480
Now, if you look at, let's say,

38:48.480 --> 38:52.320
a pop OS, the system 76 pop OS

38:52.320 --> 38:55.200
platform provides them an

38:55.200 --> 38:59.280
opportunity to to experiment and

38:59.280 --> 39:00.800
develop a more integrated

39:00.800 --> 39:02.560
experience with the hardware and

39:02.560 --> 39:03.520
software.

39:03.520 --> 39:04.800
That doesn't necessarily imply

39:04.800 --> 39:06.160
that it needs to be an Ubuntu

39:06.160 --> 39:08.080
base or a Debian base or Fedora

39:08.080 --> 39:09.440
base or an OpenSUSE base.

39:09.440 --> 39:11.600
But having a platform in that

39:11.600 --> 39:13.360
sense that they can ship with

39:13.360 --> 39:15.200
their hardware allows them to

39:15.200 --> 39:17.040
demonstrate in the best possible

39:17.040 --> 39:19.920
light the possibility of using

39:19.920 --> 39:20.960
their hardware.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.240
I agree with your point to an

39:22.240 --> 39:24.720
extent, except for I would argue

39:24.720 --> 39:26.800
that the Ubuntu base was not only

39:26.800 --> 39:29.440
a safe bet for system 76 and an

39:29.440 --> 39:30.560
encouraging bet for their

39:30.560 --> 39:32.000
existing customers at the point

39:32.000 --> 39:33.360
in time had been using Ubuntu

39:33.360 --> 39:34.960
that shipped with the laptops,

39:34.960 --> 39:36.480
but it also was a signal to

39:36.480 --> 39:38.000
enterprises and customers that

39:38.000 --> 39:39.040
if your software works on

39:39.040 --> 39:41.360
Ubuntu, it'll work on pop OS.

39:41.360 --> 39:42.400
Just like Carl mentioned in the

39:42.400 --> 39:43.760
interview, if you know, if

39:43.760 --> 39:44.880
you're on any Ubuntu base, you

39:44.880 --> 39:46.880
can use the system 76 updater.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.720
That, I think, is a contributing

39:48.720 --> 39:50.080
factor to its success.

39:50.080 --> 39:51.600
But it is also an outlier here

39:51.600 --> 39:53.120
because it is so highly coupled

39:53.120 --> 39:55.920
with the OEM's overall ambitions

39:55.920 --> 39:57.520
and goals that it clearly serves

39:57.520 --> 39:59.120
a purpose in multiple respects.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.040
It's a distribution appealing to

40:01.040 --> 40:01.600
end users.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.640
I have it running myself and I

40:02.640 --> 40:03.760
think it's pretty good.

40:03.760 --> 40:06.480
And it's obviously serving some

40:06.480 --> 40:07.680
of their longer term goals.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.120
So I think pop OS is kind of an

40:09.120 --> 40:10.080
exception here.

40:10.080 --> 40:11.440
Well, actually, it's not an

40:11.440 --> 40:14.400
exception because PC maker,

40:14.400 --> 40:16.480
boutique PC maker that actually

40:16.480 --> 40:16.960
does this.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.760
Tuxedo Computers has Tuxedo OS.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.760
Yeah, but have you looked at

40:21.760 --> 40:23.280
Tuxedo OS?

40:23.280 --> 40:24.080
I think you can make this

40:24.080 --> 40:25.280
argument with Manjaro.

40:25.280 --> 40:26.880
I think Manjaro demonstrates it

40:26.880 --> 40:28.480
was a niche distribution that now

40:28.480 --> 40:29.520
actually has some significant

40:29.520 --> 40:31.120
momentum and hardware deals.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.320
So it's clearly possible.

40:32.320 --> 40:33.840
Elementary OS has seen a similar

40:33.840 --> 40:34.640
trajectory.

40:34.640 --> 40:37.840
Without a combination of purpose,

40:37.840 --> 40:39.680
which, you know, elementary OS is

40:39.680 --> 40:40.880
demonstrating their Pantheon

40:40.880 --> 40:42.160
desktop environment, trying to

40:42.160 --> 40:44.080
show an integrated design centric

40:44.080 --> 40:46.000
user experience, you know, that's

40:46.000 --> 40:47.280
very tightly controlled.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.920
And, you know, without that, with

40:49.920 --> 40:52.960
that, you don't really have a lot

40:52.960 --> 40:53.440
of value.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.600
Deepin attempts to showcase the

40:55.600 --> 40:58.640
Deepin desktop, and maybe they

40:58.640 --> 41:01.360
actually do ship on hardware in

41:01.360 --> 41:01.680
China.

41:01.680 --> 41:02.720
We don't know because we don't

41:02.720 --> 41:04.400
really go down that route.

41:05.120 --> 41:08.640
Like the usual suspects for why a

41:08.640 --> 41:10.400
distribution tends to exist and

41:10.400 --> 41:12.080
has some staying power usually

41:12.080 --> 41:15.680
has to conclude some kind of

41:15.680 --> 41:17.520
purpose that is novel and

41:17.520 --> 41:21.760
distinct, as well as some kind of

41:21.760 --> 41:26.400
avenue in which it satisfies or

41:26.400 --> 41:28.960
fulfills a particular market

41:28.960 --> 41:29.520
demand.

41:29.520 --> 41:30.800
Yeah, we were talking about this

41:30.800 --> 41:32.880
like package managers, desktop

41:32.880 --> 41:34.400
environments, installation,

41:35.120 --> 41:36.480
thoughts to, you know, how you

41:36.480 --> 41:37.600
treat the whole end user

41:37.600 --> 41:38.720
experience.

41:38.720 --> 41:40.160
When we talk about distros, those

41:40.160 --> 41:41.920
all get lumped in together.

41:41.920 --> 41:43.200
So, Brent, let me see if I've got

41:43.200 --> 41:43.760
this right.

41:43.760 --> 41:45.040
You have a distribution that

41:45.040 --> 41:47.040
right. You have if it's serving

41:47.040 --> 41:48.800
the right audience and if it's

41:48.800 --> 41:50.400
built in the right philosophy,

41:50.400 --> 41:51.520
using the right tools with the

41:51.520 --> 41:53.600
distribution and then which

41:53.600 --> 41:54.640
reflects itself in the way

41:54.640 --> 41:55.920
packages are handled and

41:55.920 --> 41:56.320
installed.

41:56.320 --> 41:58.080
But then you also have the

41:58.080 --> 42:00.160
support aspect of it, which I

42:00.160 --> 42:01.200
think for a lot of us in this

42:01.200 --> 42:02.720
conversation is trickier to

42:02.720 --> 42:04.640
think of because we are often our

42:04.640 --> 42:05.440
own support.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.800
Being your own sport also means

42:06.800 --> 42:07.760
finding the answers.

42:08.480 --> 42:09.920
And so I know for my own

42:09.920 --> 42:12.320
trajectory into the Linux world,

42:12.320 --> 42:14.320
I've had to work hard at, you

42:14.320 --> 42:15.600
know, typing into the keyboard,

42:15.600 --> 42:17.040
into the search engine to find a

42:17.040 --> 42:17.760
bunch of answers.

42:17.760 --> 42:20.720
And it seems to me that, you

42:20.720 --> 42:23.360
know, I'm not a crazy super user

42:23.360 --> 42:25.440
like some of our wonderful

42:25.440 --> 42:27.680
guests here, but I've, you know,

42:27.680 --> 42:28.720
been around Linux for a long

42:28.720 --> 42:28.960
time.

42:28.960 --> 42:31.360
And so my ability to find

42:31.360 --> 42:33.520
answers about the little tiny

42:33.520 --> 42:35.680
things that go wrong on any

42:35.680 --> 42:38.960
system has been a big decision

42:38.960 --> 42:40.240
in my choice of which

42:40.240 --> 42:41.680
distribution to run and my

42:41.680 --> 42:44.080
hesitation to jump to some of

42:44.080 --> 42:45.040
the lesser knowns.

42:45.600 --> 42:48.560
And it's too bad that that's a

42:48.560 --> 42:50.400
reality for me personally, and

42:50.400 --> 42:51.600
it may be for many others.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.760
But I, you know, I just want to

42:53.760 --> 42:56.160
get work done most of the time.

42:56.160 --> 42:57.040
Sometimes I play.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.240
But that's a hesitation for me,

43:00.240 --> 43:00.800
for sure.

43:00.800 --> 43:02.640
I have to say, I mean, you know,

43:02.640 --> 43:04.080
there are some resources that I

43:04.080 --> 43:05.040
always go back to.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.200
And it's often the best

43:07.200 --> 43:09.280
resources I find are, and I'd

43:09.280 --> 43:10.800
say in this order, Arch because

43:10.800 --> 43:12.000
of the Arch Wiki, roll your

43:12.000 --> 43:13.440
eyes, then Ubuntu because you

43:13.440 --> 43:14.880
have the Ask Ubuntu community

43:14.880 --> 43:16.960
and all of the related blogs

43:16.960 --> 43:18.400
and then Fedora, which not only

43:18.400 --> 43:19.680
has a big community, but also

43:19.680 --> 43:21.360
has really good documentation.

43:21.360 --> 43:22.800
But I think this is for us,

43:22.800 --> 43:23.280
Wes.

43:23.280 --> 43:24.480
And, you know, a couple

43:24.480 --> 43:26.240
episodes ago, we had Wimpy on

43:26.240 --> 43:28.160
and he got us thinking about

43:28.720 --> 43:30.720
the younger generation like,

43:30.720 --> 43:31.920
you know, my kids age and a

43:31.920 --> 43:33.200
little bit older and a little

43:33.200 --> 43:33.920
bit older than that that are

43:33.920 --> 43:34.720
going to be coming over to

43:34.720 --> 43:35.920
Linux and open source.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.520
The next generation of Linux.

43:37.520 --> 43:38.880
Yeah, yeah.

43:38.880 --> 43:39.920
And you got to wonder what's

43:40.560 --> 43:42.320
where are they going to land?

43:42.320 --> 43:43.440
Yeah, you do have to think about

43:43.440 --> 43:43.920
that, right?

43:44.960 --> 43:46.240
And what makes sense in a world

43:46.240 --> 43:48.160
where we're trying to, you

43:48.160 --> 43:50.400
know, seduce them over to the

43:50.400 --> 43:52.400
to the light side of things?

43:52.400 --> 43:53.920
And I mean, it's not it's

43:53.920 --> 43:55.120
probably not going to be a niche

43:55.120 --> 43:55.760
distro, right?

43:55.760 --> 43:57.360
It's going to be one of the big

43:57.360 --> 43:59.280
ones or maybe not.

43:59.280 --> 44:01.360
OK, how about this for a theory?

44:01.360 --> 44:03.760
The niche distro pulls in the

44:03.760 --> 44:05.840
technologically curious out on

44:05.840 --> 44:07.440
the edges there, like if you

44:07.440 --> 44:09.760
look at it as a sales funnel,

44:09.760 --> 44:11.600
the niche distros are on the

44:11.600 --> 44:13.120
edge of the funnel and then they

44:13.120 --> 44:14.400
get people in because they look

44:14.400 --> 44:15.840
flashy and do something new and

44:15.840 --> 44:16.400
cool.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.240
And then as people try them and

44:18.240 --> 44:19.440
and they get more experience and

44:19.440 --> 44:20.560
more practical, they move

44:20.560 --> 44:22.160
inwards into the funnel.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.600
And by the end, they're coming

44:23.600 --> 44:24.400
out the other end running a

44:24.400 --> 44:27.840
boon to that stuff.

44:27.840 --> 44:28.480
I mean, you're right.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.880
I think that works for the the

44:30.880 --> 44:32.960
very curious or the the folks

44:32.960 --> 44:35.200
who are willing to do more

44:35.200 --> 44:36.640
troubleshooting on themselves.

44:36.640 --> 44:38.160
But the advantage to just

44:38.160 --> 44:39.520
starting with whatever the latest

44:39.520 --> 44:41.680
amount to is, I mean, you've got

44:41.680 --> 44:42.960
all the Stack Overflow answers,

44:42.960 --> 44:43.200
right?

44:43.200 --> 44:45.280
You can Google any random error

44:45.280 --> 44:46.320
that you come up to when you're

44:46.320 --> 44:47.760
trying to first try out this

44:47.760 --> 44:49.120
strange new Linux thing.

44:49.840 --> 44:52.320
And it's just an easier upload

44:52.320 --> 44:52.820
path.

44:53.200 --> 44:54.560
Yeah, and then you obviously see

44:54.560 --> 44:56.320
some specializations getting a

44:56.320 --> 44:57.040
lot of success.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.600
I think that's a clear point.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.920
Brent, you have some examples.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.280
Yeah, what came to mind right

45:03.280 --> 45:05.440
away was the Cali's and the

45:05.440 --> 45:08.080
cubes who just kind of do one

45:08.080 --> 45:09.840
thing and do it really well.

45:09.840 --> 45:11.120
And maybe, you know, that's the

45:11.120 --> 45:13.200
Unix philosophy coming in there.

45:13.200 --> 45:15.040
But we also see some really

45:15.040 --> 45:18.000
popular ones like Raspbian and

45:18.000 --> 45:19.280
the likes that are just

45:19.280 --> 45:21.760
targeting, you know, a small

45:22.320 --> 45:25.280
selection of the problems to

45:25.280 --> 45:26.640
solve. And they're seeing a lot

45:26.640 --> 45:27.140
of success.

45:27.140 --> 45:29.120
So maybe what we're going to see

45:29.840 --> 45:31.440
moving forward is just a lot of

45:31.440 --> 45:33.280
this sort of, you know, if you

45:33.280 --> 45:34.720
want to play in this specific

45:34.720 --> 45:36.000
playground, you know, is

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Raspberry Pis and such, then

45:38.000 --> 45:39.360
you have a distro of choice or

45:39.360 --> 45:42.000
two or three, but expecting them

45:42.000 --> 45:44.080
to be your daily driver.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.680
I think we've pretty much sorted

45:45.680 --> 45:47.440
those out for most people.

45:47.440 --> 45:49.120
Cali is a great example.

45:50.160 --> 45:50.800
That's for sure.

45:51.360 --> 45:52.160
Well, I don't know really where

45:52.160 --> 45:52.640
to go with this.

45:52.640 --> 45:53.600
Other than now, I kind of feel

45:53.600 --> 45:54.800
good about niche distros when I

45:54.800 --> 45:55.680
thought of the whole funnel

45:55.680 --> 45:56.720
thing, which kind of made me

45:56.720 --> 45:57.280
feel better.

45:57.280 --> 45:58.960
And I also have to say, just

45:58.960 --> 46:00.320
look at Deepin20.

46:00.320 --> 46:00.960
Yeah, you should.

46:00.960 --> 46:02.080
You really I mean, it looks like

46:02.080 --> 46:03.120
a lovely release.

46:03.120 --> 46:04.320
And I don't want to come off too

46:04.320 --> 46:06.960
harsh here in that I think that

46:06.960 --> 46:08.160
some of the wonderfulness of

46:08.160 --> 46:09.120
Linux is just this.

46:09.120 --> 46:10.320
You know, you have all this free

46:10.320 --> 46:11.360
and open source software that

46:11.360 --> 46:12.720
you can experiment with.

46:12.720 --> 46:14.960
And we have a rich ecosystem of

46:15.520 --> 46:16.720
different contributors all

46:16.720 --> 46:17.920
playing around with things.

46:17.920 --> 46:19.280
And all right, you might not use

46:19.280 --> 46:20.880
Deepin, but down the road, maybe

46:20.880 --> 46:21.840
you use their desktop

46:21.840 --> 46:22.960
environment on your favorite

46:22.960 --> 46:24.160
distro of choice.

46:24.160 --> 46:25.920
I'd also love to get the

46:25.920 --> 46:27.520
audience's perspective on the

46:27.520 --> 46:30.000
future of niche distributions and

46:30.560 --> 46:31.760
this overall topic.

46:31.760 --> 46:33.360
So go to linuxunplug.com slash

46:33.360 --> 46:35.040
contact and drop us a line of

46:35.040 --> 46:37.680
feedback and we'll cover it on a

46:37.680 --> 46:38.480
future episode.

46:38.480 --> 46:40.640
Nathan wrote in, I was listening

46:40.640 --> 46:42.720
to episode 227.

46:42.720 --> 46:45.680
OK, so this is this is 372 right

46:45.680 --> 46:46.320
now.

46:46.320 --> 46:50.000
OK, it was about the one which is

46:50.000 --> 46:51.760
how I like to say it and system

46:51.760 --> 46:53.520
D, which is how I like to say it.

46:53.520 --> 46:54.640
He says, I just wanted to add my

46:54.640 --> 46:55.680
two cents to it.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.200
I'm not as strong as some are

46:57.200 --> 46:58.080
against it.

46:58.080 --> 47:02.160
But he says, I do not want it on

47:02.160 --> 47:03.680
my system personally.

47:03.680 --> 47:06.320
Not all alternative units are

47:06.320 --> 47:08.800
dead, such as open RC, which is

47:08.800 --> 47:10.720
the closest de facto replacement.

47:10.720 --> 47:13.440
Personally, I use six, which is

47:13.440 --> 47:15.360
fast and also maintain interesting.

47:15.920 --> 47:17.200
But he goes on to say what I have

47:17.200 --> 47:18.880
against system D is that it feels

47:18.880 --> 47:20.320
like it intends to replace

47:20.320 --> 47:23.040
everything in which now they have

47:23.040 --> 47:24.800
replaced my home with it.

47:24.800 --> 47:26.400
At this rate, it wouldn't surprise

47:26.400 --> 47:27.840
me if it eventually replaces the

47:27.840 --> 47:28.960
kernel in the future.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.320
This may be a bit dramatic, but I

47:30.320 --> 47:31.440
think you get my idea.

47:31.440 --> 47:32.800
I just like simpler systems

47:32.800 --> 47:34.480
myself. You know, I can certainly

47:34.480 --> 47:35.120
appreciate that.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.400
And that's one of the reasons I

47:36.400 --> 47:37.840
might be drawn to an arch base

47:37.840 --> 47:39.600
distro just to talk about our last

47:39.600 --> 47:40.960
topic a little bit more there.

47:41.920 --> 47:43.040
But really, Nathan, I just

47:43.040 --> 47:44.880
appreciate that you're still you

47:44.880 --> 47:45.680
know, you're listening.

47:45.680 --> 47:47.120
You're giving us feedback, even if

47:47.120 --> 47:49.200
you aren't exactly caught up.

47:49.200 --> 47:51.280
Yeah, I agree with him.

47:51.280 --> 47:53.440
And I also recognize the trouble

47:53.440 --> 47:54.320
it causes.

47:54.320 --> 47:56.240
So since that episode, I think I've

47:56.240 --> 47:57.840
come to the conclusion that Dev

47:57.840 --> 48:01.600
one is it's a good outlet for that

48:01.600 --> 48:03.360
idea of a system.

48:03.360 --> 48:05.280
And what I kind of think would

48:05.280 --> 48:07.520
have been better is if that whole

48:07.520 --> 48:09.440
shenanigans had just left the

48:09.440 --> 48:11.600
Debian project with that.

48:11.600 --> 48:12.720
And that's not a disparaging

48:12.720 --> 48:14.720
remark. I just simply mean let

48:14.720 --> 48:16.400
each project have its own clear

48:16.400 --> 48:17.120
path.

48:17.120 --> 48:18.160
There was a news item we were

48:18.160 --> 48:20.640
debating coverage that is just

48:20.640 --> 48:23.600
some silly technical arguments

48:23.600 --> 48:25.920
going on once again in development

48:25.920 --> 48:28.560
in Debian land around system D.

48:28.560 --> 48:30.320
And it's it's like one of these

48:30.320 --> 48:33.440
super simple maintainer versus

48:33.440 --> 48:34.640
somebody submitting the patch

48:34.640 --> 48:36.240
thing and maintainer has a hard

48:36.240 --> 48:39.440
line position and a bunch of

48:39.440 --> 48:41.520
other people would like this

48:41.520 --> 48:42.960
thing to support both system D

48:42.960 --> 48:44.640
and on system D systems.

48:44.640 --> 48:46.240
And it's just turned into a kind

48:46.240 --> 48:47.600
of a nasty debate that's now

48:47.600 --> 48:49.360
making circulation on social

48:49.360 --> 48:51.680
media and kind of painted

48:51.680 --> 48:52.960
individuals in a bad light.

48:52.960 --> 48:54.240
And it just comes down to this

48:54.240 --> 48:56.160
core conflict around system D and

48:56.160 --> 48:56.960
Debian.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.320
Well, and the issues that, you

48:58.320 --> 48:59.440
know, the trickiness of

48:59.440 --> 49:01.360
managing the support when so

49:01.360 --> 49:03.040
much of upstream has just

49:03.040 --> 49:04.240
totally, you know, gone the

49:04.240 --> 49:05.360
system D way.

49:05.360 --> 49:07.120
And then to what extent are

49:07.120 --> 49:08.320
downstreams obligated to

49:08.320 --> 49:09.280
continue, you know, keeping

49:09.280 --> 49:11.600
support for these other systems,

49:11.600 --> 49:13.520
which to be clear, I think we

49:13.520 --> 49:14.160
should support.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.360
I mean, it's nice that we can

49:15.360 --> 49:16.960
have that diversity folks that

49:16.960 --> 49:18.160
want a simpler system or just

49:18.160 --> 49:19.360
don't buy into the whole system

49:19.360 --> 49:19.840
D mess.

49:19.840 --> 49:20.480
I'm fine with it.

49:20.480 --> 49:22.400
But if you're not, that's cool.

49:23.120 --> 49:24.560
It's interesting to watch what

49:24.560 --> 49:26.160
that means that like what what

49:26.160 --> 49:27.200
buy in do you have from your

49:27.200 --> 49:28.560
users? What is worth it from a

49:28.560 --> 49:30.240
maintainers perspective in

49:30.240 --> 49:31.360
ongoing maintenance to keep

49:31.360 --> 49:32.480
making sure that that works,

49:32.480 --> 49:34.080
especially if maybe at this

49:34.080 --> 49:35.280
point none of the systems that

49:35.280 --> 49:36.560
you actually have access to test

49:36.560 --> 49:38.720
on are using any of those old

49:38.720 --> 49:39.280
units?

49:39.280 --> 49:39.840
Yeah.

49:39.840 --> 49:41.360
And what should their burden be

49:41.360 --> 49:42.960
probably worth addressing this

49:43.760 --> 49:46.240
system D home folder stuff.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.520
Carl, you've experimented a

49:47.520 --> 49:48.240
little bit with it.

49:48.240 --> 49:49.600
My understanding is you install

49:49.600 --> 49:51.280
your distribution and it

49:51.280 --> 49:52.560
immediately takes over your home

49:52.560 --> 49:53.920
folder, removes all your data

49:53.920 --> 49:55.840
and encrypts it with a password

49:55.840 --> 49:57.040
that it doesn't share with you.

49:57.040 --> 49:58.000
Is that is that how you

49:58.000 --> 49:59.120
that is that how it works?

49:59.120 --> 49:59.600
Of course.

49:59.600 --> 50:00.640
Take over the world, right?

50:02.160 --> 50:03.280
No, that's obviously you're

50:03.280 --> 50:04.640
joking that doesn't work at all

50:04.640 --> 50:05.280
like that home.

50:05.280 --> 50:07.760
D is 100% optional and I really

50:07.760 --> 50:10.000
don't get the consternation

50:10.000 --> 50:11.040
about it in the community.

50:11.040 --> 50:12.320
It's if you don't like it,

50:12.320 --> 50:13.040
don't use it.

50:13.040 --> 50:14.400
It's just it's a thing that's

50:14.400 --> 50:15.520
there for you if you want it.

50:15.520 --> 50:16.320
Yeah, absolutely.

50:16.320 --> 50:17.280
And it's one of those things,

50:17.280 --> 50:18.720
too, where you look at it and

50:18.720 --> 50:20.080
you go, oh, yeah, OK, if we were

50:20.080 --> 50:21.600
making an operating system today,

50:21.600 --> 50:22.720
that's just absolutely how we

50:22.720 --> 50:23.680
would do home directories.

50:24.640 --> 50:26.240
So I mean, it makes total sense.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.040
We've covered it in the show

50:27.040 --> 50:28.320
before and why it's cool technology.

50:28.320 --> 50:28.960
So you could always check

50:28.960 --> 50:30.480
our back catalog, but yeah,

50:30.480 --> 50:31.920
it's still early days, too.

50:31.920 --> 50:33.040
There's a lot of integration to go

50:33.040 --> 50:34.480
with PAM and SC Linux and other

50:34.480 --> 50:36.160
things on various distros.

50:36.160 --> 50:37.520
So it's a tool if you don't want

50:37.520 --> 50:38.880
to use it, you can completely ignore

50:38.880 --> 50:39.360
it.

50:39.360 --> 50:41.680
Yeah, but I I do appreciate him

50:41.680 --> 50:44.160
sending that feedback in and I

50:44.160 --> 50:45.520
guess we're just still in this

50:45.520 --> 50:47.360
phase and there are resources

50:47.360 --> 50:48.000
out there for everybody.

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
It's a big Linux world.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.600
Steve writes in about Emacs comp

50:51.600 --> 50:53.440
speaking of a big world.

50:53.440 --> 50:54.880
Yes, Emacs comp.

50:54.880 --> 50:55.920
Have you heard about the recent

50:55.920 --> 50:58.080
announcement for Emacs comp 2020?

50:58.080 --> 51:00.320
It's a free two day online

51:00.320 --> 51:02.160
Emacs conference scheduled

51:02.160 --> 51:03.920
for the weekend of November

51:03.920 --> 51:06.800
28th and 29th, 2020.

51:06.800 --> 51:08.480
Those of us on the Pacific Coast

51:08.480 --> 51:09.680
have to get up early to catch

51:09.680 --> 51:11.360
the first few sessions, but

51:12.160 --> 51:13.280
recording should be available

51:13.280 --> 51:14.320
online. The conference is

51:14.320 --> 51:16.400
currently asking for proposals

51:16.400 --> 51:18.640
at Emacs comp dot org slash

51:18.640 --> 51:19.440
2020.

51:21.200 --> 51:22.240
That's amazing.

51:22.240 --> 51:23.840
I mean, when you're finally over

51:23.840 --> 51:25.680
nano, Chris, it might be just in

51:25.680 --> 51:27.120
time to join and attend this

51:27.120 --> 51:27.680
conference.

51:27.680 --> 51:29.120
You know, one or two things is

51:29.120 --> 51:29.840
going to happen.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.120
I'm eventually going to win you

51:31.120 --> 51:33.600
over somehow with nano or we're

51:33.600 --> 51:34.720
all just going to be using VS

51:34.720 --> 51:35.680
code on the command line.

51:36.800 --> 51:37.360
Wait for it.

51:37.920 --> 51:39.360
I think the latter is more

51:39.360 --> 51:40.160
likely.

51:40.160 --> 51:42.000
OK, so how did we end up with

51:42.000 --> 51:42.560
this huge

51:43.760 --> 51:44.720
mess of picks?

51:44.720 --> 51:45.840
I'm looking at this like in two

51:45.840 --> 51:47.120
ways, like we could save some of

51:47.120 --> 51:49.280
these and we could just coast for

51:49.280 --> 51:52.400
a while or we could like toss

51:52.400 --> 51:53.600
out a whole batch of them, which

51:53.600 --> 51:55.120
is kind of the one I'm starting

51:55.120 --> 51:56.000
to lean towards just because we

51:56.000 --> 51:57.120
have so many.

51:57.120 --> 51:59.200
But I look at this list.

51:59.200 --> 52:01.280
There's two obvious ones I think

52:01.280 --> 52:01.840
we should do.

52:02.400 --> 52:02.960
Yeah, OK.

52:02.960 --> 52:04.160
I think I know which ones you

52:04.160 --> 52:05.600
mean, but let's find out.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.120
Oh, yeah.

52:07.120 --> 52:09.120
OK, well, that's a clear clue.

52:09.120 --> 52:09.520
That's right.

52:09.520 --> 52:10.800
We got two rust picks.

52:12.240 --> 52:14.080
Now, the first ones for you

52:14.080 --> 52:15.440
server types is the cloud

52:15.440 --> 52:16.240
hypervisor.

52:16.240 --> 52:17.760
It's a rust virtual machine

52:17.760 --> 52:19.600
manager based on Intel's open

52:19.600 --> 52:21.200
source project, if I recall

52:21.200 --> 52:22.960
correctly, called cloud

52:22.960 --> 52:23.760
hypervisor.

52:23.760 --> 52:25.440
And it's a tool written in rust

52:25.440 --> 52:28.320
because, well, it's the language

52:28.320 --> 52:28.880
of choice now.

52:29.440 --> 52:30.720
Well, so I think this is kind of

52:30.720 --> 52:31.280
interesting.

52:31.280 --> 52:33.120
It's early days for the cloud

52:33.120 --> 52:34.640
hypervisor project, but, you

52:34.640 --> 52:35.680
know, we've talked a bit about

52:35.680 --> 52:36.640
firecracker.

52:37.120 --> 52:38.640
Google's got their own sorts of,

52:38.640 --> 52:40.240
you know, tiny little virtual

52:40.240 --> 52:41.520
machine monitors that are

52:41.520 --> 52:42.080
implemented.

52:42.800 --> 52:43.840
And those are really focused on

52:43.840 --> 52:44.640
running these like super

52:44.640 --> 52:45.920
lightweight, containery

52:45.920 --> 52:46.480
workloads.

52:46.480 --> 52:46.960
Right.

52:47.440 --> 52:48.800
But cloud hypervisor is a little

52:48.800 --> 52:49.840
more general.

52:49.840 --> 52:51.120
It wants to handle more of your

52:51.120 --> 52:52.400
day to day like, you know, you

52:52.400 --> 52:54.080
want to run the regular Ubuntu

52:54.080 --> 52:55.840
cloud image on this thing, but

52:55.840 --> 52:57.440
you want to host it.

52:57.440 --> 52:59.040
Cloud hypervisor might be the

52:59.040 --> 53:00.960
virtual machine monitor for you.

53:00.960 --> 53:02.320
And the point about rust is

53:02.320 --> 53:03.520
mostly that, you know,

53:03.520 --> 53:05.200
firecracker and some of the

53:05.200 --> 53:07.280
Google work, they're all powered

53:07.280 --> 53:09.440
by this rust VMM crate.

53:09.440 --> 53:11.120
So it's a shared upstream

53:11.120 --> 53:12.400
library that these are all based

53:12.400 --> 53:14.080
on contributing to.

53:14.080 --> 53:15.200
So it seems like rust is

53:15.200 --> 53:16.800
becoming something of a good

53:16.800 --> 53:18.000
place to do this kind of

53:18.000 --> 53:18.800
development.

53:18.800 --> 53:20.000
Yeah, it's KVM based.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.040
So it checks that box.

53:21.040 --> 53:22.880
They are going for minimal

53:22.880 --> 53:24.640
emulation and lowest latency

53:24.640 --> 53:26.720
possible, low complexity, small

53:26.720 --> 53:27.760
attack surface.

53:27.760 --> 53:29.280
Check, check, check.

53:29.280 --> 53:30.400
Not only are they targeting the

53:30.400 --> 53:32.400
x86 64 platform, but they're

53:32.400 --> 53:33.680
also going for the arm 64

53:33.680 --> 53:34.960
architecture as well with with

53:34.960 --> 53:36.240
obvious functionality differences,

53:36.240 --> 53:37.280
which they've documented.

53:37.840 --> 53:38.400
And you're right.

53:38.400 --> 53:39.840
It actually does look

53:39.840 --> 53:42.240
legitimately like it could be a

53:42.240 --> 53:43.840
great way to self host VMs.

53:43.840 --> 53:44.960
You know, I was mentioning

53:44.960 --> 53:46.960
Proxmox before, but, you know,

53:46.960 --> 53:48.800
there could be a future where

53:48.800 --> 53:50.000
it's something like that instead.

53:50.000 --> 53:51.600
Now, on the other end of the

53:51.600 --> 53:53.680
rust picks, we have song rec,

53:53.680 --> 53:56.400
which is an open source Shazam

53:56.400 --> 53:59.600
client for Linux, which, as you

53:59.600 --> 54:00.800
guessed, is written in rust.

54:08.800 --> 54:10.160
What's kind of notable about

54:10.160 --> 54:12.480
this particular rust app is that

54:12.480 --> 54:13.840
this is a GUI.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.200
It does have it has a command

54:15.200 --> 54:16.720
line version as well, but this

54:16.720 --> 54:19.040
is a graphical desktop rust app

54:19.040 --> 54:21.040
application. Is it like Python

54:21.040 --> 54:22.320
rust? What is this?

54:22.320 --> 54:23.840
Yeah, we were sort of debating

54:23.840 --> 54:25.920
like how common is that?

54:25.920 --> 54:26.960
Because most of the pics that

54:26.960 --> 54:28.160
we've been finding these days.

54:28.160 --> 54:30.240
Well, they're all neat, but

54:30.240 --> 54:31.920
they're all command line apps.

54:31.920 --> 54:32.800
Yeah, all right.

54:32.800 --> 54:33.680
So there you go.

54:33.680 --> 54:34.400
There's a couple now.

54:34.400 --> 54:35.440
Here's a couple more that have

54:35.440 --> 54:36.640
nothing to do with rust at all.

54:36.640 --> 54:37.840
These are pretty cool that we've

54:37.840 --> 54:38.880
been sitting on for a little bit.

54:38.880 --> 54:40.480
So now crazy Chris is giving away

54:40.480 --> 54:42.320
picks. It's more than two picks.

54:43.040 --> 54:44.080
It's going to be probably four

54:44.080 --> 54:46.320
picks. This is one I think is

54:46.320 --> 54:47.360
probably going to improve your

54:47.360 --> 54:48.160
quality of life.

54:48.160 --> 54:51.520
Temp mail, TMP mail, a temporary

54:51.520 --> 54:53.840
email right in your freaking

54:53.840 --> 54:55.680
terminal, right?

54:55.680 --> 54:58.560
I mean, the reason to use this

54:58.560 --> 55:00.320
is obvious. What else do I need

55:00.320 --> 55:01.680
to say? It's a command line

55:01.680 --> 55:02.800
utility that allows you to create

55:02.800 --> 55:03.680
temporary email address and

55:03.680 --> 55:04.800
receive emails to a temporary

55:04.800 --> 55:07.520
email address. It's using was it

55:07.520 --> 55:09.680
one sec mail then their API, I

55:09.680 --> 55:10.160
think.

55:10.160 --> 55:11.200
Oh, they've got a few they've tied

55:11.200 --> 55:12.560
in with proton mail with some of

55:12.560 --> 55:14.560
the other popular sort of just

55:14.560 --> 55:16.000
accounts that let you easily set

55:16.000 --> 55:18.880
up a pseudo anonymous mailbox.

55:18.880 --> 55:20.320
But you don't have to go log into

55:20.320 --> 55:21.920
a, you know, use a set of

55:21.920 --> 55:23.680
different guis on the web.

55:23.680 --> 55:24.960
You've just got one command line

55:24.960 --> 55:25.760
interface.

55:25.760 --> 55:28.480
That's so cool. And really minimal

55:28.480 --> 55:30.800
dependencies. W3M, curl, jq and

55:30.800 --> 55:32.640
knock and you're you're off to the

55:32.640 --> 55:35.040
temporary email races. And that's

55:35.040 --> 55:36.640
pretty neat. All right, I'm looking

55:36.640 --> 55:38.480
at the mix here, Wes. Do you want

55:38.480 --> 55:41.440
to pick our final crazy giveaway?

55:41.440 --> 55:43.680
Oh, more pigs. Let's do it. All

55:43.680 --> 55:44.480
right. Well,

55:44.480 --> 55:46.800
we have too many good options here.

55:46.800 --> 55:49.200
How how to choose?

55:53.200 --> 55:54.720
Well, how about for those self

55:54.720 --> 55:57.280
hoster fans out there? What about

55:57.280 --> 56:03.200
my pass? My PAAS or platform as a

56:03.200 --> 56:05.680
service. It's basically a system to

56:05.680 --> 56:06.720
enable you know, if you've used

56:06.720 --> 56:08.240
something like Heroku, you've

56:08.240 --> 56:09.280
already you're already running

56:09.280 --> 56:10.560
things with Docker compose and

56:10.560 --> 56:12.080
Docker tooling in your local

56:12.080 --> 56:14.320
dev environment. And you want your

56:14.320 --> 56:15.760
own self hosted cloud platform

56:15.760 --> 56:18.960
that's as easy as Docker push. Well,

56:18.960 --> 56:21.040
maybe give my pass a try. It's

56:21.040 --> 56:22.800
powered by Docker traffic, another

56:22.800 --> 56:24.800
one of our favorites. And it really

56:24.800 --> 56:26.800
espouses its excellent analytics.

56:26.800 --> 56:28.400
It's got some dashboards built in

56:28.400 --> 56:29.760
for you so you can actually see

56:29.760 --> 56:31.280
what the heck's going on on your

56:31.280 --> 56:33.360
new platform. Yeah, it does. I love

56:33.360 --> 56:35.520
these. This is really cool. So this

56:35.520 --> 56:37.120
is one this is one I did not open

56:37.120 --> 56:39.440
the tab to. And then I open it up as

56:39.440 --> 56:40.960
you're talking about it. I love

56:40.960 --> 56:42.320
it up as you're talking about it. And

56:42.320 --> 56:44.160
I had not seen these the screenshot

56:44.160 --> 56:45.920
with the all the stats and stuff.

56:46.800 --> 56:48.640
I love this stuff. That's really

56:48.640 --> 56:50.560
cool. So we basically gave people

56:50.560 --> 56:52.160
two picks to just turn their

56:52.160 --> 56:54.400
their network into like their own

56:54.960 --> 56:57.280
AWS is really what we just did. You

56:57.280 --> 56:58.640
know what? You're welcome,

56:58.640 --> 56:59.840
everybody. How about that? So yeah,

56:59.840 --> 57:00.800
this is just sitting on top of

57:00.800 --> 57:03.200
Docker and traffic. It utilizes

57:03.200 --> 57:05.440
let's encrypt to get your SSL TLS

57:05.440 --> 57:08.720
certs and my pass, which I didn't

57:08.720 --> 57:11.600
know really much about it, but looks

57:11.600 --> 57:12.880
pretty cool. Nice pick. That was a

57:12.880 --> 57:14.480
good one, Wes. That was absolutely

57:14.480 --> 57:16.880
what I'm going to say. Right. Oh, if

57:16.880 --> 57:18.080
you've got some you'd like to share

57:18.080 --> 57:19.280
with the community, head over to

57:19.280 --> 57:20.800
Linux unplugged dot com slash

57:20.800 --> 57:23.280
contact or link me up on social

57:23.280 --> 57:25.280
media. I'm at Chris last. What about

57:25.280 --> 57:27.920
you, Wes? I'm at Westpain, our

57:27.920 --> 57:30.000
sponsor, a cloud guru. You can find

57:30.000 --> 57:32.080
them at a slash cloud guru at

57:32.080 --> 57:33.920
YouTube, Twitter or Facebook. Go get

57:33.920 --> 57:35.840
them on social media. The show is

57:35.840 --> 57:37.840
at Linux unplugged. I don't think

57:37.840 --> 57:39.520
it's Linux unplugged show. Some of

57:39.520 --> 57:40.880
them are on the Twitter and then,

57:40.880 --> 57:42.080
of course, the network. That one I

57:42.080 --> 57:44.800
do know for sure at Jupiter signal

57:44.800 --> 57:46.160
links to everything we talked about

57:46.160 --> 57:48.000
today are Linux unplugged dot com

57:48.000 --> 57:50.720
slash three seven two, including

57:50.720 --> 57:53.120
links to our guests and all of that

57:53.120 --> 57:56.240
good stuff. And for our members,

57:56.880 --> 57:58.320
remember, you have special feeds,

57:58.320 --> 58:00.320
limited ad and full live stream

58:00.320 --> 58:03.680
feeds. And you also have that fedor

58:03.680 --> 58:05.360
thirty three bugathon, which is

58:05.360 --> 58:07.120
available as an exclusive download

58:07.120 --> 58:08.640
to our core contributors. The

58:08.640 --> 58:10.720
exclusive thanks to our members

58:11.280 --> 58:12.400
and also thanks to everyone for

58:12.400 --> 58:13.840
tuning this week's episode. Even

58:13.840 --> 58:15.040
if you're not a member, we

58:15.040 --> 58:17.200
sincerely appreciate you listening

58:17.200 --> 58:18.960
or taking advantage of our sponsor

58:18.960 --> 58:20.800
or sharing the show. It means a

58:20.800 --> 58:22.800
lot to us and we never forget that

58:22.800 --> 58:24.080
we talk about the live stream and

58:24.080 --> 58:25.680
we talk about about the members.

58:26.560 --> 58:29.040
But in our hearts, it's you

58:29.040 --> 58:41.840
downloaders. See you next Tuesday.

58:59.040 --> 59:12.640
So we have a complicated

59:12.640 --> 59:14.240
hardware situation we have. We

59:14.240 --> 59:16.720
have one machine that's doing

59:16.720 --> 59:18.000
great, and that's the least

59:18.000 --> 59:19.440
important machine. And then we

59:19.440 --> 59:20.560
have the recording machine that

59:20.560 --> 59:22.160
has bad blocks on the recording

59:22.160 --> 59:23.520
hard drive. And it's also just

59:23.520 --> 59:25.760
sort of shoddily put together. And

59:25.760 --> 59:28.240
now after this weekend, the

59:28.240 --> 59:29.840
Reaper machine seems to be in a

59:29.840 --> 59:31.280
bad state. We had a power outage.

59:31.280 --> 59:32.560
We lost one of our audio

59:32.560 --> 59:34.880
interfaces, and Jack audio has

59:34.880 --> 59:36.640
been wonky ever since that audio

59:36.640 --> 59:38.960
interface died. The machine has

59:40.000 --> 59:41.760
what I can only describe is like

59:41.760 --> 59:43.600
these blink out sessions where

59:43.600 --> 59:45.040
the entire system sort of locks

59:45.040 --> 59:46.560
up in the screen flashes.

59:46.560 --> 59:48.080
Initially, we thought it was

59:48.080 --> 59:49.520
Gnome Shell. So we switched to

59:49.520 --> 59:50.880
plasma and it went away for

59:50.880 --> 59:52.240
about a year. And now it's back

59:52.240 --> 59:54.160
in plasma and it just creates

59:54.160 --> 59:56.240
such a headache. So I got two

59:56.240 --> 59:57.760
machines right now that are in a

59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.240
super bad shape and no money to

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.160
replace them. I'm trying to get

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:03.600
clever. I'm trying to think if

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.120
we were to. So this this Reaper

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:06.480
machine is also the machine we

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.520
used to do mumble. It's the

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.120
machine we do remote interviews

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.880
and hosts with and recordings.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.160
How beefy are your individual

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.160
machines other than like the I

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:16.320
seven, you know, six core area,

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.840
but nothing. Nothing incredibly

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.960
powerful because we're not

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.280
doing video. How old are they?

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:23.200
Ah, that's that's the problem.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.200
It's been probably I think we

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.760
built them in twenty sixteen,

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.040
twenty seventeen. All right. I've

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.720
just got one question for you,

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:32.320
Chris. Yeah. How many pies have

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.640
you ordered? Yeah, just just a

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:36.000
fleet of pies to replace the

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.440
West. It's going to take sixty

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.840
two pies by my math, but it'll

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:56.800
be totally worth it.
