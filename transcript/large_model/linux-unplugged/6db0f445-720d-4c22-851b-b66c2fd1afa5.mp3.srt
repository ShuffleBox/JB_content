1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
So this is one of those weeks where all three of us

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,840
have kind of fallen in love with a new distro.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,240
We're all feeling that new distro energy right now.

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,360
Yeah, I'll admit it.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,320
Thanks, Chris.

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,600
I can totally tell Brent's feeling it

7
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,120
because it's been like link after link after link

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,400
this morning.

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,680
And he, well, he told us that, too.

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,360
He's actually even making songs.

11
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,360
He's made songs to honor his new distro

12
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,600
that he's fell in love with.

13
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,160
Well, when I listen to any music now,

14
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,680
I just can't stop thinking of my new love, you know?

15
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,400
You just can't stop that feeling, Brent?

16
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,260
Is that what it is?

17
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,560
I'm hooked on a feeling, Chris.

18
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,320
I'm hooked.

19
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,960
Oh, you're hooked on a feeling.

20
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,440
Ha, ha, ha.

21
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:43,360
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,640
show.

23
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,440
My name is Chris.

24
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,520
My name is Wes.

25
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,480
And my name is Brent.

26
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,680
Hello, guys.

27
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,520
Thanks for joining me on what is going to be an adventure,

28
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,880
a discovery, if you will, an emotional journey

29
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,920
into a new distro.

30
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,120
OK, maybe not quite.

31
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,560
Maybe we're oversold a little bit.

32
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,320
But we have met a new distro.

33
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,920
And it's no average Linux distribution.

34
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,800
This week, we're going to announce the Nyx challenge.

35
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,960
We'll have details on that in just a little bit.

36
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,840
And we're going to give a go at explaining why

37
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,000
we think Nyx is interesting.

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,080
And even if you never plan to use it,

39
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,600
maybe just try to give you a mental framework

40
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,160
to think about why people find it interesting.

41
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,880
And then we'll round it out with some great boost, maybe

42
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,000
some picks, maybe some more.

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,600
So before we go any further, before we

44
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,960
get into any of that, let's bring

45
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,240
the virtual lug that is packed today.

46
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,000
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,480
Hello, hello.

48
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,160
Hello, hello.

49
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,880
Hello, Brent.

50
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,400
Hello, Wes.

51
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,080
Hello.

52
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,640
Howdy.

53
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,280
Hello.

54
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,800
Hello.

55
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,760
Hello.

56
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,720
Hello, thank you in there, everybody, for joining us.

57
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,200
Can you feel it in the air?

58
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,520
It's fresh distro season.

59
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,400
GNOME 42 is officially out.

60
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,120
New things are happening.

61
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,480
It's like springtime.

62
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,000
Everybody's planting their open-source gardens right now.

63
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,800
I guess I'm in a good mood, I guess.

64
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,080
Yeah, I mean, well, you should be.

65
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,600
It's been one of those weeks where, behind the scenes,

66
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,800
we've just been really nerding out super hard.

67
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,560
So it's like, we finally get to come on air

68
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,020
and talk about the thing that we've

69
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,640
been enjoying all week long.

70
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,960
But where do we start?

71
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,680
And the other thing that we've been waiting

72
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,960
to do since last episode is give another go

73
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,480
at getting Linux on the M1 MacBook Max.

74
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,960
This is a decked-out MacBook Max.

75
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,320
And last week, we attempted to install the Asahi Linux

76
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,080
Alpha.

77
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,200
We really did.

78
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,480
But there was a file system corruption issue.

79
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,240
Yeah, I don't know what you've been doing with this thing,

80
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,200
buddy, but actually, no.

81
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,320
Apparently, at least as Hector Martin tells it,

82
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,080
this is more common than we might have thought with APFS,

83
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,400
which is too bad.

84
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, he kind of tweeted that right after the show came out,

85
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,520
that, yeah, we're hearing this from several people.

86
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,120
And we actually got that file system issue

87
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,880
resolved right after the show.

88
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,280
But we decided to hold up.

89
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,560
We just hold up right there.

90
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,580
We're not going to go any further.

91
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,400
We would wait till we were recording again to resume.

92
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,700
So Wes Payne, brace yourself, because it

93
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:03,080
is time to install Linux on the MacBook Max.

94
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,760
Here I go.

95
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,160
How are you feeling about it this week?

96
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,360
I think you're probably feeling better, aren't you?

97
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:06,680
Yeah, good.

98
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,360
I mean, I'm hopeful there won't be any booting into recovery

99
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,440
and having to learn, refresh myself on disk util

100
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,040
like last week.

101
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,560
We'll see.

102
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,360
I mean, the APFS FSEC did complete.

103
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,160
And the installer now walked in just enough

104
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,200
to see that it sees the new free space and partition

105
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,080
we were able to do.

106
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,180
So I don't know.

107
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,240
There could still be more dragons lurking here.

108
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:30,920
So how much disk space are you given the Linux install?

109
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,720
What have you decided to allocate to it, do you recall?

110
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,040
Because I think we have about 1.5 terabytes

111
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,400
free on the internal disk on that thing, which, you know,

112
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,520
there's no upgrade in that storage.

113
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,160
Yeah, we have 1.9 terabytes.

114
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,880
I gave it 80 gigs.

115
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,480
Oh, OK.

116
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,880
I was just being, I wasn't sure.

117
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,120
Yeah, no, that's fine.

118
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,160
We can always massage, too.

119
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,160
All right.

120
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,680
So we've been looking at our different options.

121
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,320
We think we're going to go with, what, maybe the minimum?

122
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,000
Or are you going to try to go all the way up to the desktop?

123
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,560
You're going to go for desktop?

124
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,240
I think you probably should.

125
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,640
We should probably go for desktop, right?

126
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:03,920
Yeah.

127
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,560
I was thinking minimum, because that's

128
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,920
how I think I'm going to be using this,

129
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,880
is like a headless setup.

130
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,320
But you might still want the desktop for troubleshooting,

131
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,000
or, you know.

132
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,560
I think we should go desktop.

133
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,320
All right.

134
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,240
OK, Wes Payne, we'll check back in with you momentarily.

135
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:22,720
So he'll have that going during the show.

136
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,040
We'll check back in to see if we manage to get Asahi Linux

137
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,800
on that sucker.

138
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,600
And it's funny, because back in the day,

139
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,760
you might go buy yourself a big ThinkPad, or Dell,

140
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,440
or maybe even a System 76, and your goal

141
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,240
would be to dual boot Windows and Linux on there

142
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,600
for those few things you still needed Windows for.

143
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,600
And now here we are in 2022, and the situation

144
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,360
is sort of flipped.

145
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,880
It's now you can dual boot Mac OS and Linux,

146
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,280
which I could see that working for a lot of people.

147
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,920
And then you also can at least have

148
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,800
the option of Apple's hardware.

149
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,320
Although I'm not convinced yet.

150
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,680
It's still the values there for Linux users, but we'll see.

151
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,800
I want to mention that we have a meetup just

152
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,160
around the corner on April 9 in Raleigh, North Carolina.

153
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,040
Details at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

154
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,160
It's just outside Raleigh.

155
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,040
There's going to be a park that we'll meet at,

156
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,280
and there is a barbecue joint and a brewery there.

157
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,960
What more could you ask for?

158
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,000
There's a lot of people.

159
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
So Brent is booked.

160
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
He's official, Wesley.

161
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,760
Now you've got to get yourself.

162
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,920
Oh, I'm booked too.

163
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,640
What?

164
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,800
Congratulations, gentlemen.

165
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,160
How exciting is that?

166
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,680
That's really fun.

167
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,400
Wow, it's going to be a good showing,

168
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,320
because I think we have already something like 70 people,

169
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,720
72 people on the meetup.

170
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,440
Yeah, I mean, it'd be rude not to go, right?

171
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,600
So we're getting to the point where

172
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,560
if you think you can make it, do sign up to the meetup.

173
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,440
I know it's a pain in the butt, but please do.

174
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,560
So that way, we can give the barbecue place a heads up,

175
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,680
because there's a lot of meat that's going to be required.

176
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,240
And Brent's going to help you out.

177
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,920
He's going to skip meat for that night just for you

178
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,800
guys out there.

179
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,080
We're still going to need better numbers.

180
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Yeah, thank you, Brent.

181
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,000
Thank you for doing that.

182
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,040
So meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

183
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,240
I'm looking forward to it, because Alex and I

184
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,560
are going to try to record a self-hosted in person.

185
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,600
Ooh, a rare treat.

186
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:14,080
And if we got the opportunity, I think

187
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,240
he has enough microphones that we could all

188
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,160
kind of sit down all the Friday stream

189
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,800
and record something too, possibly.

190
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
Oh.

191
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,600
So anything like that would probably end up on the extras,

192
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,840
extras.show, I would think.

193
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,320
So even if you can't make it, maybe

194
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,760
we'll try to get some of the content published

195
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,600
over there or something.

196
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
We don't have any specific plans at this point.

197
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,400
There's even an RSS for it.

198
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,160
If you can't make it to that meetup,

199
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,600
we do have something even sooner.

200
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,560
It's the week this episode is airing, just a couple of days.

201
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,880
March 31, I am holding a live stream at jblive.tv.

202
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,120
It's an opportunity to just sort of do an AMA

203
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,960
if you've got any questions related to the shows

204
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,400
or to the network.

205
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,240
That's a Thursday.

206
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,080
What time is it?

207
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,080
4 PM in Seattle, 7 PM in New York, 11 PM in London.

208
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,880
And I'll also be giving away some Bitcoin

209
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,320
to help people get their lightning wallet set up

210
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,400
so that way they can participate in the booths.

211
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,040
A little Bitcoin booth.

212
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,560
Yeah, so that'll be at jblive.tv on March 31.

213
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,560
I got to get that on the calendar.

214
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,640
Got to get that on the calendar.

215
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,280
After the show.

216
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,120
Yeah, right.

217
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,440
Yeah, I'll write down calendar.

218
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,000
Brent, will you write it down too so then you remember?

219
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,200
That way we can actually get it.

220
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:19,560
Oh, yeah.

221
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,440
I've already been doing that.

222
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:20,960
Yeah.

223
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,800
All right, thank you.

224
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,880
I like that you're just sort of using Brent as your memory

225
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,400
bank now.

226
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,000
That's great.

227
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,160
Because I don't know if he writes it down,

228
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,600
he'll remember, you know?

229
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,880
Chris and I actually call it his memory palace,

230
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,720
thank you very much.

231
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,220
Yeah.

232
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,720
Yeah.

233
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,220
Yeah.

234
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,320
Yeah.

235
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,360
OK, Wes, how are we doing over there?

236
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,440
Anything?

237
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,120
Stub OS installation complete.

238
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,520
We set up a pre-boot volume.

239
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,640
We set up a recovery volume.

240
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,320
We've collected some firmware now.

241
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,400
Is this all happening?

242
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,720
We're installing the OS.

243
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,360
Is this all happening in Mac OS?

244
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:50,880
Yeah.

245
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,000
Let me see the screen there.

246
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,560
Let me tilt it over here so I can.

247
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,720
So this is actually, what's kind of noteworthy about this

248
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,320
is this installer script that they've

249
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,520
built that you're running is running in a terminal window

250
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,880
right along your web browser inside Mac OS.

251
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
Yeah.

252
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,160
That is really cool.

253
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,480
It's actually running in the fish shell

254
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,760
that I installed under Nix, but that's a separate story.

255
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,000
We'll get to that, Wes.

256
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,600
All right.

257
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,840
I am feeling pretty good about this.

258
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,920
We will check back in.

259
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:23,340
So this week, we want to announce a Nix challenge

260
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,160
that we're going to run for the month of April.

261
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,800
Now, this is not a big deal.

262
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,320
It's going to be a low-key thing.

263
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,960
We may end up being, I would imagine,

264
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,680
a topic of conversation at the meetup.

265
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
But here's what we're thinking is

266
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,960
you could join at any point in the month of April.

267
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,760
We're going to have this challenge running

268
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,920
for the whole month.

269
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,620
And I hope that the goals are totally

270
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,680
achievable for anybody that's got a few hours over that month

271
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,640
period they can invest into this.

272
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,680
So one of the top goals, this is particularly personal for me,

273
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,480
is I need to study the Nix expression language

274
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,020
so I understand what I'm getting into.

275
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,520
And we're going to explain more of this, so don't worry.

276
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,920
We're going to set some of this up for you.

277
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,840
You've got to set up at least one Nix system.

278
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,360
It doesn't have to be anything super complicated.

279
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,600
You have to be able to install HTOP.

280
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:14,240
And you need to join the Nix Nerds Matrix

281
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,520
room that I set up on the Jupyter Broadcasting Matrix

282
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,200
server.

283
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,720
Just as a side note here, our Matrix community

284
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,440
is really incredible right now.

285
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,640
It's at that perfect size where there's enough people in there

286
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,360
that we get good, robust conversation,

287
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,240
but everybody's really respectful.

288
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,000
And everybody is sort of helpful to newcomers.

289
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,160
And we just set up this Nix Nerds room.

290
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,520
And I set it up Friday night before I left the studio.

291
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,880
And I just created it.

292
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,400
And I told one person.

293
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,560
I said, hey, I'm going to make this room.

294
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,920
I think maybe this is where we'll

295
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,120
talk about Nix as we start talking about on the shows

296
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,400
more.

297
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,480
I opened up Elements Saturday morning.

298
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,600
And there was already nearly a dozen people

299
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,400
in there nerding out about Nix.

300
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,640
That's how passionate people are.

301
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,920
It just exploded on its own.

302
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,080
Yeah, you were kind enough to invite me to the room.

303
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,640
And I was like, how long has it been?

304
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,120
Have I just missed that this was around?

305
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,600
No, no, it was just created.

306
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,720
It just got started.

307
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,600
And I will put a link in the show notes

308
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,520
because people in there have been so helpful answering

309
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,080
some of my newbie questions.

310
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,520
And it really helped me kind of wrap my head around a few

311
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,000
concepts that I was struggling with.

312
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,400
And they're not pushy.

313
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,080
They're not pushy.

314
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,120
So here's the goals.

315
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,480
Learn a little bit about the Nix language.

316
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,040
Set up at least one system.

317
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,280
Install HTOP.

318
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,560
Join the Nix nerds matrix room.

319
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,480
And then post a screenshot in that channel of your Nix system.

320
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,920
And if you want meaningless points

321
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,680
that won't count towards anything,

322
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,920
post a screenshot of like a full Plasma or Gnome or i3

323
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,400
or whatever floats your boat desktop.

324
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,680
I would also say maybe try setting up a server.

325
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,200
Spin up a Linoad or something and do something

326
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
you would have tried in Docker or on your CentOS

327
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,440
or a BungieBox and see if you can get that running with Nix.

328
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:01,960
Yeah.

329
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,440
It was so much fun.

330
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,280
And each one of us had a little kind of journey of, OK,

331
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,240
I'll give this a go.

332
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,680
We'll take a look at this.

333
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,560
And then as we started looking into it,

334
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,720
we really kind of just started getting super excited.

335
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,240
So I kind of want to cover why we're interested in it

336
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,000
and why we're suggesting that we all do an Arch style Nix

337
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
challenge from the old days, like bringing that forward now

338
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,480
to Nix.

339
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,280
Because in a lot of ways, Nix feels like an OS

340
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,000
that I may make my future primary distro for a lot

341
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,480
of stuff.

342
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,240
Like I feel like a big shift is happening here.

343
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,160
And I thought I'd kind of get into why a little bit.

344
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,800
So I think it's a fun challenge.

345
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,880
Join us for that.

346
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,360
And here's the sort of overview of what

347
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,680
we are loving about Nix.

348
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,560
In real simple terms, this solves a couple of big problems

349
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,520
that I have.

350
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,440
And one of those is we have a fair amount of infrastructure

351
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,960
that we need to build out, but we

352
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,600
have a very limited amount of time

353
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,560
to actually apply to that effort.

354
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,080
And then additionally, we'll deploy stuff,

355
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,600
and it will remain in production for a year to even,

356
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
I mean, in the cases of like J-Bot, a decade.

357
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,400
I don't know, 12 years.

358
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,400
I don't know how long J-Bot's still running, kind of.

359
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,960
And you come back to these projects literally

360
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,240
sometimes five, six, seven years later,

361
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,880
and there isn't appropriate documentation.

362
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,000
It's really not clear what we were attempting to do here.

363
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,800
Don't really understand why it's set up this way.

364
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
And I just got to use that.

365
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,320
I got to accept that technical debt,

366
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,800
because I don't have time to solve that,

367
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,920
and I got to move forward.

368
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,560
And then you end up building up a bunch

369
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,520
of technical debt over time.

370
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,560
So Nix, and Nix is a package manager,

371
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,160
and Nix OS is a base, real bare Linux system

372
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,520
that's built using the Nix package system.

373
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,960
It solves that problem, because it documents everything

374
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,600
via its configuration file.

375
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Everything that you put in there, you can read it,

376
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,520
and you understand how the system is set up,

377
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,480
and then it will build that exact system.

378
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,360
So if a system goes out, you reload from that config file,

379
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,320
and it reproduces the exact system as you had it.

380
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,360
And that is really compelling when you think about,

381
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,400
we could create a J-B base Nix config

382
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,400
that had a certain set of users, SSH configuration,

383
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,840
base packages that we use,

384
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,240
maybe tail scales installed by default,

385
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,560
all these kinds of base setups that we could then deploy

386
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,080
on our cloud servers and our local infrastructure,

387
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,000
and it would always be a very common setup.

388
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,840
And you can accomplish a lot of this

389
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,360
through things like Puppet or Chef or Ansible.

390
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,920
There's a lot of Kubernetes, really.

391
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,440
There's a lot of ways to solve this problem,

392
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,120
but Nix is solving it at the system level, right?

393
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,960
It's solving it deep at the base config,

394
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,960
and when you use it with Nix OS,

395
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,280
you can actually build the whole system with this.

396
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,720
But you can also install the Nix Package Manager

397
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,480
on a lot of distributions, and even Mac OS,

398
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,080
and I think maybe Windows, don't know.

399
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,640
But I tried it on CentOS Stream 9, and it was great.

400
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,560
Oh, nice.

401
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,840
It was a real nice combo.

402
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay, so I've kind of given why I find it super compelling.

403
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,840
I wonder, Wes, if you could give kind of a overview

404
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,240
of what maybe I've missed

405
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,000
or what you find compelling about Nix.

406
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,240
There's a lot to go into here,

407
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,840
so I'm sure we'll figure out the best ways

408
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,160
to talk about it as we go on.

409
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,160
But there's Nix, the sort of lazy functional language

410
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,960
that you use to describe the system and packages.

411
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,080
And then there's like Nix,

412
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,360
there's a whole bunch of Nix tooling,

413
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,720
and it's a build system that lets you

414
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,040
declaratively build packages in a reproducible fashion

415
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,000
in a way that really understands the graph structure

416
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,880
of how dependencies all relate to each other

417
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,480
in a more sophisticated way than we're kind of used to

418
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,520
from some of the traditional Linux packaging.

419
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,560
Yeah, my understanding too, like in there,

420
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,760
is when it's building software,

421
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,360
it'll actually build it in a sandbox

422
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,520
and really has a genuine map of all of the dependencies,

423
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,240
and that is in part what makes it reproducible.

424
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,440
And say, maybe this is a crazy example

425
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,360
that nobody would ever do,

426
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
but say you're a guy or a gal

427
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,000
that likes to run the Plasma desktop,

428
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,400
and you love Plasma, you're all in on Plasma, but then-

429
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,440
I know a few of those.

430
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,880
But, and you're talking about it all the time,

431
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,840
you're talking about how great it is,

432
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,240
and then like the new GNOME 42 comes out

433
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:16,240
and you're like, that looks great, I'd love to try that,

434
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,280
but I don't want to have

435
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,160
both Plasma and GNOME installed at the same time,

436
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,640
I don't want to have multiple terminal emulators

437
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,680
and file managers and libraries.

438
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,520
What a mess, right?

439
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,360
I don't want that.

440
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,160
Yeah, and I mean, in theory, you know,

441
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,640
you can strip those things.

442
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,480
Oh, sure.

443
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,600
But you kind of got to figure out all the things

444
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,240
that it actually installed, and I never do.

445
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,080
I just always-

446
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,040
It hangs around, yeah.

447
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:35,880
I just always install the other desktop.

448
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,520
And then whenever you're doing your auto-complete,

449
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,240
you get the wrong terminal, it doesn't match the desktop.

450
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,280
Or like when you're browsing through the menu,

451
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,720
it's like, I've got so many entries in there now.

452
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,000
So in a NIC system, you would go into the configuration

453
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,560
and you'd probably have like a sub-configuration file

454
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,440
just for your graphical environment.

455
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,200
And you could essentially, in there,

456
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,560
change it from a Plasma system to a GNOME system,

457
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,680
and then rebuild that box.

458
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,720
And it would build clean as if it had always been

459
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,800
a GNOME system from the very, very beginning,

460
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,200
as if you installed it straight off the ISO like that.

461
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,560
And what's great is it will test all of that,

462
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,440
it will make sure all of it builds correctly

463
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,320
and works before you actually have to accept the changes

464
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,880
and activate it, which is really powerful too.

465
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,720
All right, so I'm sorry,

466
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,240
I just wanted to make that example, Wes,

467
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,840
but I'm sure there's,

468
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,840
I probably interrupted you right in mid-thought.

469
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,800
Well, yeah, it's just that there's like a lot to NIC.

470
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,840
So you've got this, you've got a language to describe

471
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:34,400
how to build things, and in the case of NIC's OS,

472
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,880
construct a system.

473
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,280
And then you've got tooling to make that happen.

474
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,520
And then the way it all works with the NIC store,

475
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,920
and there's a lot of details that we probably won't get into

476
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,120
for this episode, but it means that you can have

477
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,400
all these packages safely co-installed

478
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
with different versions in a way

479
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,400
that you can go back and roll back at any time.

480
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,960
It also means that you can bring those packages with you.

481
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,440
A lot of the NIC's tooling is set up

482
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,120
so you can just install the NIC's package manager.

483
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,000
If you're on your Mac desktop or it's on a Linux server,

484
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,240
you can do both of those and that'll work just fine.

485
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,560
And then, so there's those things, there's the tooling,

486
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,520
and then there's NIC's packages, which is a repository.

487
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,560
Well, actually, it's really,

488
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,360
you can kind of think of it as a giant NIC's expression

489
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,960
in the NIC's language, but it's a big whole set

490
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,040
of NIC's expressions that describe how to build

491
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,560
a whole bunch of packages that you probably want already.

492
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,120
Yeah, and that could be all kinds of things

493
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,880
from VS Code to Plex, Home Assistant, NGINX.

494
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,960
HTOP, normal Linux stuff.

495
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,680
And then you can just use that to assemble.

496
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,840
It can build it from source

497
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,160
because it has a powerful build tooling built in,

498
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,240
but then there's also a whole bunch

499
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,760
of caching infrastructure that the project maintains,

500
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,740
which is awesome.

501
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,680
So it means if you're on a commonly supported architecture

502
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,360
like x86 Linux, then yeah, you're just gonna,

503
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,580
you're gonna pull down the binary stuff by default.

504
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,360
So it's all surprisingly fast,

505
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,020
which is one aspect of this I didn't really think about.

506
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,920
I talked a little bit in self-hosted this week.

507
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,680
I think it was episode 67.

508
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,800
I've had a lot of success

509
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,240
and we have a lot of applications deployed in productions

510
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:07,160
that are in containers, Docker and Podman at this point.

511
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,700
But when I look at building a system with NICs,

512
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:13,360
I actually see a future where maybe I'm not using containers

513
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,960
as much as I thought I was,

514
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,800
and that I'm actually using NICs

515
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,000
to manage most of my software,

516
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
which I think I'll get into in the future,

517
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,420
maybe next week when we actually kick the challenge off.

518
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,120
There's kind of that element of,

519
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,720
because it's also nicely separated out in the NIC store

520
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,840
and isolated from each other.

521
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,400
There is, you know, that initial excitement

522
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,280
when you first got into Linux and you were like,

523
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,200
oh, the package manager, there's all this software.

524
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,920
I can just install, but before you learned

525
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,320
about how like a box that had six dozen things on it,

526
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,400
so that sat for a year, wasn't a great pattern.

527
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,240
Some of that excitement has come back with NICs

528
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,560
where you're just like, oh, but I can do it

529
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,800
in a more maintainable, declarative way,

530
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,400
right out of the box.

531
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,480
I wanna let ETU get in here too,

532
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,000
because I know that you were a contributor

533
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,820
for many years to NICs.

534
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,420
And so maybe you could give us a little more nuance

535
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,360
on how the package manager is working.

536
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,840
It's source, but there's that binary cache, right?

537
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,960
Yeah, so the thing that NICs does

538
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,960
is that it has the NICs package tree definitions

539
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,400
on your local system.

540
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,480
And then it evaluates which packages it needs

541
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,480
and each package will have the set of instructions

542
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,400
for building a package is based upon all dependencies

543
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,880
and the build instructions for that package.

544
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,080
And then we just hash it down to a hash

545
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,600
and then you can ask the binary cache,

546
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,520
do you have this hash?

547
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,200
And then the binary cache can either send,

548
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,180
no, I don't have that hash, or send back a binary.

549
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:56,180
And then you get that exact software hash back.

550
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,560
I see, and so if it says no, then it just builds it?

551
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,400
Yes.

552
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,360
Aha, that hashing technique is really cool.

553
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,840
Yeah, this also makes it very easy

554
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,040
to patch software locally.

555
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,480
So you can, in your configuration,

556
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,600
just say, I want Mumble,

557
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,560
but with this patch applied to Mumble.

558
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,860
And then it will build Mumble every time you update

559
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,380
because some dependency changed.

560
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,480
But at the same time, if you don't want a patch,

561
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,840
then yeah, then you just get it from the binary cache.

562
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,720
So you have kind of the power of Gen2,

563
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,200
but you can choose to,

564
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,300
when to build or not to build, pretty much.

565
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,400
Yeah.

566
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,560
Brent, this is a pretty different approach

567
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,240
to how a distribution is built.

568
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,400
It's a different way of thinking

569
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,900
about even managing a system.

570
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,200
They call it a declarative configuration.

571
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,160
And I'm curious to know what your take is

572
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,520
coming at something that's probably

573
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,360
a pretty new way of looking at Linux.

574
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,960
Yeah, when you first suggested

575
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,120
that we really dive into this,

576
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,800
which we've been thinking about for months.

577
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,900
We've gotten mail from various listeners.

578
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,040
And for months now,

579
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,060
I've been slowly gathering articles

580
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:08,000
that describe why we shouldn't do this.

581
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,840
So I was super skeptical to dive in,

582
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,740
especially that this felt kind of, hmm,

583
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,240
like a perfect West way to build a system

584
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,880
and maybe not a perfect Brent way to build a system.

585
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,260
Hey, ouch.

586
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,100
I feel judged over here.

587
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,920
No, no, no, no.

588
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,760
I think it's a compliment actually.

589
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,160
That's a compliment for sure.

590
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,240
More of like a developer's approach.

591
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,000
I've looked at a few accounting softwares

592
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,960
and some of them are user-friendly

593
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,360
and some of them are really developer focused

594
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,320
and they seem really interesting.

595
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,320
And then I start getting into them.

596
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,480
I'm like, I don't have the skills for this.

597
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,360
And so Nix felt like that for me at first.

598
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,920
So I probably spent 80% of the time

599
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,920
we spent doing research,

600
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,480
just trying to understand what this all was

601
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,780
and if I could even get into it.

602
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,160
And it turns out that it takes a bunch of concepts

603
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,020
that we're used to in sort of what I'll call legacy Linux

604
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,800
ways of doing things and sort of flips them

605
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,920
and gives them a whole bunch of features

606
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:12,920
that I have secretly been trying to learn for a few years.

607
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,520
Places where I think Ansible seems interesting

608
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,600
and I know we'll talk more about that,

609
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,480
but Nix feels like, at least Nix OS feels like a way of,

610
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,680
accomplishing a lot of things all at once

611
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,540
and once you wrap your head around it,

612
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,640
is super user-friendly in a strange kind of way.

613
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,320
So that's what excites me is that the learning curve,

614
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,700
I think for the concepts was like,

615
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,200
oh, this is just a total paradigm shift,

616
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,640
which I think are important to explore

617
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,560
and are worth the time of trying to wrap your head around.

618
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,040
But then the actual implementation,

619
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,520
I found actually surprisingly easy, which is great.

620
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,920
Lino.com slash unplugged,

621
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,240
go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

622
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,260
And you go there to support this here show.

623
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,760
That is fast, reliable cloud hosting right there.

624
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,400
Go try it for yourself for a project.

625
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,880
Woo-wee, boy, I just, I slipped right into that.

626
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,640
I apologize, I just get excited about Lino.

627
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,560
You know, and then I get into like a cowboy mode.

628
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,880
Yeah, it's natural.

629
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,200
Did you know I got a CentOS box going on Linode

630
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,600
that has Nix installed on it?

631
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,440
Nice.

632
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,600
And they actually have a guide

633
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,360
if you want to do Nix OS on Linode.

634
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,600
It's a great example of why I love Linode.

635
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,560
They just let you go all the way if you want.

636
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,240
You know, also, I happen to notice that the Linode CLI,

637
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,240
that's packaged in Nix, so even better.

638
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,160
That is, that is so great.

639
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,080
I love that command line tool and they have a great API

640
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,760
and they have fantastic documentation.

641
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,240
You bring all that together, that means

642
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,440
if you get a wild hair or if you have something

643
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:51,160
you need to build, you're gonna have the support

644
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,520
in both documentation and actual customer support

645
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,440
to pull it off.

646
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,320
They have great 24-7, 365 customer support.

647
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,660
They don't do that escalation thing or none of that.

648
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,600
You just get your problem solved.

649
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,960
And they've been doing this for 19 years

650
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,800
and they've learned they need to constantly invest

651
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,560
in their infrastructure and their tooling.

652
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,400
And so they're doing it.

653
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,060
They just are relentless about that.

654
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,220
Rolling out new hardware and new features all the time.

655
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,320
They always give me something new to talk about

656
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,300
all the time.

657
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,840
You know, like right now they're rolling out

658
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,720
a beta of a database as a service and it's so slick.

659
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,880
It's all the great stuff about Linode,

660
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,280
but brought to like managing a database for you.

661
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,920
And they've just got done upgrading their fast rigs

662
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,760
to MVME PCIe storage, so that's always screaming.

663
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,760
And they took the time, they spent the effort.

664
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,040
They did the hard work to make their network connections

665
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,360
as fast as possible and they became their own ISP.

666
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,620
I mean, I could go on and on and on.

667
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,400
So just go try it yourself.

668
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,760
Go give them the unplugged boost to go say hello

669
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,600
and thanks for supporting by going to linode.com

670
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,000
slash unplugged.

671
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,960
Get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account

672
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,220
and you support the show.

673
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,040
It's linode.com slash unplugged.

674
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,680
All right, Wes Payne, let's check in over there

675
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,400
on the M1 Linux install.

676
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,240
How are we doing?

677
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,560
Oh, we're doing well so far.

678
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,240
I've proceeded through a prompt

679
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,520
where I was quite carefully warned to read carefully

680
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,040
lest I leave the system in an unbootable state.

681
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,520
So you just skip right past that.

682
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,640
Yep, skip right past that.

683
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,400
I've now shut the system down as instructed.

684
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,000
And I think we're getting ready to reboot into Asahi.

685
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,160
Yeah, things have been extracted and installed.

686
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,840
So it's off right now and you're gonna power it up.

687
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,440
Yeah, we had to wait 15 seconds

688
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,480
for the system to fully shut down.

689
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,060
It's important that the system be fully powered off

690
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,920
before this step.

691
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,600
So does that imply that when you turn a Mac off,

692
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,360
it's actually still on for 15 seconds?

693
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,560
Kind of does, yeah, doesn't it?

694
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,840
Huh, that's an interesting little discovery.

695
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,680
All right, well, let's turn it on.

696
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,280
Let's see here.

697
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
Do you have to hold down a button?

698
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,840
I do, yeah, press and hold the power button.

699
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,880
All right, then you'll get a boot menu.

700
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,960
Loading startup options.

701
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,120
Okay.

702
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,760
Once I see a spinner or it says entering startup options,

703
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,760
I'm supposed to release, okay.

704
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,880
Got some options, spinning.

705
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,840
You do, you got a spinner?

706
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,240
Yeah, here you go, take a look.

707
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,440
Oh, and hey.

708
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,000
Look at that, there's an Asahi Linux boot entry.

709
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,640
They even have their logo on there.

710
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,160
That looks good.

711
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,560
Click that, Wes, click it.

712
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,680
Let's see what we get.

713
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,800
All right, booting up.

714
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,920
But why is it the Mac OS booting?

715
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,760
It said that you might see a recovery screen for a second.

716
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,480
You will briefly see a Mac OS recovery dialogue.

717
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,320
Okay.

718
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,960
Sometimes you might be asked to select a volume to recover.

719
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,000
Choose your normal Mac OS volume.

720
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,680
Oh, yep, okay, I bet I can do this.

721
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,760
I made Wes's user avatar poo.

722
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,080
So he's the poo emoji.

723
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,520
It's appropriate.

724
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,480
I'm an adult, I'm an adult.

725
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,680
All right, should we check back in

726
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,440
or do you think it's gonna go quick?

727
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,040
We'll see, I'm just about to, the installer popped up here.

728
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
So we're running some recovery installer scripts.

729
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,720
So like we gotta fix something on the main Mac install?

730
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,440
No, I think it's just using this environment

731
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,840
to help bootstrap itself.

732
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,400
Oh, interesting.

733
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,760
So if you were gonna do Nix or Fedora,

734
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,480
you'd still have to go through this part, wouldn't you?

735
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,400
Yeah, they do have an option when you're installing it.

736
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,560
Like you could do the desktop Asahi Linux install

737
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,440
or a minimal sort of install, which is Arch Linux arm.

738
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,400
But then they also had one that just sort of bootstrap

739
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,480
the Linux environment and UEFI.

740
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,600
And I think from there you can install other stuff.

741
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,720
I think that's the base that the OpenBSD early support

742
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,920
goes off of as well.

743
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,320
Local policy update is in progress.

744
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
Oh, we're getting updates.

745
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,240
It's asking if I'm sure we wanna do something.

746
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,320
I don't really know what it says.

747
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,160
I'm gonna hit yes.

748
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,480
Go for it.

749
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,520
YOLO, Wes.

750
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,320
YOLO, mom, you only MacBook once.

751
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,880
But no, that's not quite right.

752
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,200
Yeah, this wasn't an expensive machine at all.

753
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,000
So it doesn't matter if we break it.

754
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,000
I feel like we'll have to come back.

755
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,840
Yeah.

756
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,040
Cause you know, I've kinda, I wanna,

757
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,800
I got more Nix stuff to talk about.

758
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,280
All right, come back to me.

759
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,880
All right, you give me a, give me a, boy.

760
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,800
Installation complete.

761
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,640
Press enter to reboot.

762
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,480
Okay, okay, hold on now.

763
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,280
We can't go, we can't go.

764
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,680
We gotta finish this up now.

765
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,840
Oh, boy.

766
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,400
Let's see, Wes.

767
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,760
All right, don't you have to hold down the power button

768
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,880
or else it's gonna go into macOS?

769
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,720
I don't know.

770
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,920
It just said press enter to reboot.

771
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,760
I think you gotta.

772
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,600
Oh, no.

773
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,440
Oh.

774
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,680
Asahi is the default.

775
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,880
Asahi logo, U-boot logo.

776
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,120
Oh, it's going, Wes.

777
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,880
Oh, that's a good sign.

778
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,720
Grub.

779
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,120
We got grub.

780
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,960
What are you doing?

781
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,800
Press enter.

782
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,640
Come on, let's go.

783
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,440
What's it doing?

784
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,400
What's it doing?

785
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,600
Holy shit.

786
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,960
That was fast.

787
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,280
Whoa.

788
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,800
Whoa, Wes.

789
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,360
That's a win right there though.

790
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,440
Holy crap.

791
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,840
Yeah, we got a plasma setup going on.

792
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,160
Holy crap.

793
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,280
So, so well, here's what happened in studio

794
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,880
is I was like, come on, Wes, hit enter on the grub

795
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,960
and Wes hit enter and then the next thing

796
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,320
that flashed on the screen was the plasma desktop.

797
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,120
It was that fast.

798
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,040
It was remarkable.

799
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,000
That was really great.

800
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,200
So that's fun.

801
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,080
So now we have a plasma desktop going on the M1 Max.

802
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,760
We're gonna give that a go.

803
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,520
Ha ha, look at that, Wes.

804
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,080
Nicely done.

805
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,240
Now, gentlemen, I know we've been playing with this

806
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,360
for a few days now, but I want you to go into details.

807
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,360
Chris, what did you do that got you so excited?

808
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,560
You know, we all took different routes.

809
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,760
Tell me about yours.

810
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,040
Mine started when I was thinking about my home setup.

811
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,640
I talked about this recently on the show.

812
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,960
I'm thinking about redoing everything.

813
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,040
And I was thinking about these problems I want to solve

814
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,000
about trying to understand how I put a system together

815
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,240
after I look at it a year later,

816
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,600
trying to make it really simple to recover during an outage

817
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,480
because I don't necessarily just have a few days

818
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,200
set aside to fix something

819
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,320
and trying to solve for these problems.

820
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,800
Essentially, it all started for me when Home Assistant

821
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,880
decided they needed to upgrade their Python version

822
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,440
where dropping support for my Z-Wave integration

823
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,840
and I realized I had to redo my whole setup.

824
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,520
Python version upgrades.

825
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,800
It's such a reasonable thing.

826
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
I totally understand it from a project standpoint,

827
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,280
but it causes me such a huge amount of work

828
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,120
that I just decided, well, I'm going to use this

829
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,400
as an opportunity to just rebuild my entire home network.

830
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,680
And now my thinking is,

831
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,080
depending on the status of Asahi Linux,

832
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,520
I think instead of using a couple of Raspberry Pis

833
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,560
as my home servers, I'm considering doing Asahi Linux

834
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,600
on an M1 Mac Mini.

835
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,400
Oh, consolidating down from the Pis

836
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,280
onto one beefy M1 system.

837
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,640
Running Nix.

838
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,480
Oh.

839
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,440
Yeah, yeah.

840
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,320
So that's the connection here.

841
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,360
Yeah, and I think I would run a lot of this stuff

842
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,440
natively in Nix and not in containers.

843
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,360
I'm not totally sure about Home Assistant yet,

844
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,320
but I have to test it.

845
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,600
So my journey was just that, Brent.

846
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,040
I started essentially building a parallel version

847
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,320
of my home server in a Nix VM.

848
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,640
Jup's network 2.0.

849
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,560
Yeah, yeah, and just to see

850
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,880
what are the pros and cons of doing this.

851
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,880
And that's when I realized, oh, geez,

852
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,880
this is a game changer in how I'm going to manage my systems.

853
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,280
And I don't really see me using anything else

854
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,520
because you really just have to figure out

855
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,640
that Nix language and how to structure that.

856
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,760
And then once you have that problem solved,

857
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,720
you can just read the config as documentation,

858
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,800
it self-documents, it's so simple to deploy.

859
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,560
And I can run it on an M1, I can run it on an x86 box,

860
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,200
I can run it on a Raspberry Pi, like it's flexible.

861
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,320
And it's very simple.

862
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,600
Sort of one of the things that appeals to me

863
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,800
about an Arch system is that it's a bare system

864
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:11,120
that I build up, as opposed to maybe

865
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,840
a more traditional distro that you kind of pare down,

866
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,720
perhaps secure with AppArm or SE Linux

867
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,840
and you kind of pare it down.

868
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,000
Much like Arch, Nix OS is very bare and you build up.

869
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,200
And while initially that often comes

870
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,560
with some additional setup overhead as you're getting going

871
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,440
and more things that need to be tweaked initially,

872
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,760
it has sort of been a universal truth

873
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,880
that the simpler the system, the longer it is maintainable,

874
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,240
the simpler it is to update,

875
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,480
the less problems it tends to have, et cetera, et cetera.

876
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,680
And so I find that to be really super compelling as well.

877
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,480
And it solves all these problems.

878
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,040
I was thinking like, do I go Proxmox and set up like a NUC

879
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,600
and maybe I just do everything as VM.

880
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,880
Like it just, all of that goes away, it all melts away

881
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,440
when I look at the way Nick solves it for me.

882
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,920
It too has some advice there.

883
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,560
Maybe Home Assistant stays in Docker,

884
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,120
but it's interesting that you have the option.

885
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,400
Yeah, so it sounds like that's sort of not

886
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,880
like a great experience.

887
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,320
I saw somewhere on the website,

888
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,520
I think it's like 70% supported or something like that.

889
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,200
At least they give you a number.

890
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,040
Yeah.

891
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
But Wes, I wondered,

892
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,600
I think you were playing with a few containers and such.

893
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,880
So I wondered if you had some insights in this

894
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,960
or at least tell me what avenue you went down.

895
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,800
Yeah, well, okay.

896
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,040
So to start, one thing that you pointed out

897
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,600
in the excellent NixOS manual was I mentioned that

898
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,200
because it's really easy to get Nix bootstrapped,

899
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,480
Nix the package manager bootstrapped on systems,

900
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,480
you can kind of install it in interesting ways.

901
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,880
And from the Arch side of things,

902
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,200
I've always loved that you can bootstrap Arch systems

903
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,400
from existing Linux and you can do the same thing with Nix

904
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,680
and it's so much simpler.

905
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,600
I was really impressed by that.

906
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,480
So I spun up a Alma Linux box

907
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,680
and that was working fine, got it up to date.

908
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,520
And you just install Nix like the normal way

909
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,800
and you run a couple of commands.

910
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,760
There's a command to generate the new NixOS system,

911
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,000
Nix expression config,

912
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,080
and then it can generate all the new boot stuff for you.

913
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,560
And you move your old boot out of the way and you reboot

914
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,360
and then it's smart enough to go figure out

915
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,640
all the stuff under your old root.

916
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,800
It'll just move out of the way,

917
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,360
set up the new Nix environment for you, boot into it.

918
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:24,720
And then you can preload it with SSH keys

919
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:28,480
and even like a hash of what you want the password to be.

920
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,000
So it was kind of just like run a couple of commands,

921
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
edit the config a little bit to configure the system

922
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,320
I wanted it to be, reboot,

923
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,000
and then I was able to just SSH with my SSH key

924
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,480
like into the new system and it was an Xbox.

925
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,760
That's so rad.

926
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,440
Doesn't that feel kind of magical?

927
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,640
And then you can actually roll back

928
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,240
to the old system if you want,

929
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:52,240
or you just rm, rf slash old root and it's gone.

930
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,120
That is, that's fun.

931
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,760
You've assimilated that machine, that's what you've done.

932
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,560
Whenever you go into one of these alternative systems,

933
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,120
I think some of the docs even say like random stuff

934
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,600
like reboot, download, or binaries,

935
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,160
like they're probably not going to work on Nix

936
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,920
just because of how different like the Nix OS

937
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,000
and the Nix store setup is from traditional Linux systems.

938
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,360
So you have to wonder like, okay,

939
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,000
why am I going to have all the apps that I need?

940
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,760
What kind of escape hatches do I have?

941
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,760
And so I wanted to explore a little bit like,

942
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,000
well, what would it look like?

943
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,960
We run a lot of our stuff

944
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
in kind of simple container setups right now.

945
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,440
What does that look like on Nix OS?

946
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,960
So I got traffic installed, but just in Nix,

947
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Nix OS set up in the config, you just kind of say services,

948
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,400
traffic enabled equals true,

949
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,000
and you can set everything up with let's encrypt,

950
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,360
just you specify the traffic config in your Nix right there,

951
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,200
which was really neat.

952
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,680
And then I tried a tool I'd seen mentioned

953
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,560
in some of the community called Arian,

954
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,800
which is sort of like a Nix wrapper

955
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,040
on top of Docker compose.

956
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,880
And so you can use the Nix language and you can specify,

957
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,800
and then it's a separate tool.

958
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,680
You can integrate it directly into Nix if you want,

959
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,120
or it can kind of run on its own.

960
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,040
And then that used the built-in Nix OS support

961
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,480
for running containers, either with Podman or Docker,

962
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,800
or I'm sure there's other run times too.

963
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,720
Those are the two I played with.

964
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,120
Right, right, right.

965
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,320
Well, that does sound like a blast.

966
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,760
I think it's one of those,

967
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,520
I was talking to the matrix in the matrix Nix nerds room.

968
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,560
It's like one of those things where I've been looking at it

969
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,920
almost solely as a server platform.

970
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,640
And people in there were like, oh, no, no, no,

971
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,160
it also makes for a great desktop.

972
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,480
And I just haven't made that connection yet,

973
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,040
but I could kind of see it here in like a studio environment

974
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,880
where we want really predictable, solid Linux workstations.

975
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,520
I could kind of see it, Wes.

976
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,000
So it depended on the way that this challenge goes

977
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,400
in the month of April,

978
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,120
we may end up deciding to actually use Nix OS

979
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,040
on our studio recording systems, I think.

980
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,160
I think that's gonna be the determining factor out there.

981
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,000
What do you think?

982
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,840
You down?

983
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,920
Yeah, I'm down.

984
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,160
Oh, it's exciting.

985
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,480
It feels to me like much how we use scripts to set up

986
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,200
sort of the environment on top of the OS

987
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,360
on some of the studio machines.

988
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,720
Now you're using sort of a script

989
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,760
to just define the entire system.

990
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,080
And so it's really just a progression

991
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,520
of what we've already been doing in a really beautiful way.

992
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,160
You know, when I started looking at this too,

993
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,160
I was very much in the head space of Nix versus Ansible,

994
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,160
because we were trying to solve multiple problems

995
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,000
and we were starting to think,

996
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,080
well, maybe the way to do all of this

997
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,160
would just be to manage our infrastructure with Ansible.

998
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,040
And then I started looking at Nix and I thought,

999
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,920
oh, well, no, screw Ansible.

1000
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,240
We're gonna do everything with Nix

1001
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,200
and it's just Nix for everything.

1002
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,200
And as we've talked and as we've looked at it,

1003
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,320
I don't actually think the two are mutually exclusive.

1004
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,840
And so I kind of want to encourage people

1005
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,720
not to kind of get hung up on the whole,

1006
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,320
like there's a lot of ways to manage

1007
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,800
and define a system aspect of it.

1008
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,360
I mean, it's definitely a part of the discussion,

1009
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,400
but I think there's a lot of compelling good stuff

1010
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,640
in here to look at.

1011
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,840
And I would like us not to get too hung up

1012
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,640
on that particular aspect.

1013
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,200
Yeah, and just like that those two tools

1014
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,280
and all the tools in the space,

1015
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,360
like there's a lot of overlap

1016
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,480
and then there's parts that they address entirely different

1017
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,280
or don't necessarily compete on as well,

1018
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,520
so that they can all be useful.

1019
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,400
Yeah, it's gonna be an interesting future

1020
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,320
because I tried to do it on SUSE and I ran into problems.

1021
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,760
And I don't know what this means,

1022
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,200
because I know we promised to run OpenSUSE

1023
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,960
on our server, but if we kind of are redefining everything

1024
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,240
and we end up wanting to go with Nix,

1025
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,840
I don't wanna like rule it out,

1026
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:31,000
but that's an awkward thing we're gonna have to resolve.

1027
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,040
So that's, but we have until the end of the challenge,

1028
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,360
I feel like until, because it may very well be

1029
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,200
that we get to the end of the challenge

1030
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,800
and we decide not to, I don't know.

1031
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,000
We're just really at the very beginning of this.

1032
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,240
Yeah, okay, so we both went down kind of the server route,

1033
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,840
but Brent, you braved NixOS in the desktop, right?

1034
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:52,080
You say brave, but it seemed like the thing to do.

1035
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,760
Mostly because I felt like it solves one of the problems

1036
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,320
I've been trying to solve for years too.

1037
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,200
And so it seems to me like that's what defined

1038
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,680
each direction that we went into.

1039
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,120
But I decided, yeah, the desktop feels like

1040
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,920
mostly what I use on a daily basis.

1041
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,120
And it feels like over a few years,

1042
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:15,000
any OS I've tried always gets kind of crafty

1043
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,920
and things start to like fall apart

1044
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,000
at about the like two or three year mark.

1045
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,280
And I don't know, maybe it's just a feeling,

1046
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,480
but this seemed like, oh, maybe this is a way

1047
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,360
to not ever get that, which was very interesting to me.

1048
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,720
So I booted up the NixOS Plasma ISO,

1049
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,160
of course I went Plasma.

1050
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,840
And I thought, okay, well, one of our challenge objectives,

1051
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,800
you know, one of our goals that we're putting out there

1052
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,520
is to install the desktop.

1053
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,840
And I'm surprised neither of you went that direction,

1054
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,160
but I sure did.

1055
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,360
And it was fascinating because it forced me

1056
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,880
to change the way I see a desktop system.

1057
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,880
So for instance, installing was almost exactly

1058
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,360
how Wes described, you know,

1059
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:04,320
I used the seemingly wonderful NixOS Generate Config

1060
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,920
to just kind of grab the current system

1061
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,280
and make a configuration template out of that,

1062
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,640
which I thought was really magical

1063
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,400
and made it so easy to just dive in.

1064
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,680
So I enabled a few things in there,

1065
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,240
but upon rebooting, I learned a lot of things.

1066
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,960
So I rebooted into the installed system,

1067
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,080
which was fast and great.

1068
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,640
And then I realized that none of the changes

1069
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,320
that I was making, so for instance,

1070
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,640
dark themes and like, you know, bookmarks in Firefox,

1071
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,640
or even just history, like bash history,

1072
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,520
none of that was persisting across reboots.

1073
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,120
What you'd kind of like, right?

1074
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,680
Well, I thought that was essential

1075
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,800
for being a usable desktop environment.

1076
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,920
And then I just reminded myself

1077
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,520
that the system gets sort of erased

1078
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,320
and regenerated on every reboot,

1079
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,160
which is a new concept to throw your head around,

1080
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,320
and yet one of its strengths.

1081
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:02,400
So I had to actually add a home directory

1082
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,200
to my user in the config, which seemed like the thing,

1083
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,520
because my home directory was getting recreated

1084
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,560
on every reboot, so of course nothing was persisting.

1085
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,280
So as soon as I added that, that solved the problem,

1086
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,000
but it really, that was one of the moments

1087
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,600
that really solidified to me

1088
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,280
also some of the strengths of this approach,

1089
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,480
which is that everything you want or have defined

1090
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,960
is there when you reboot every time,

1091
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,120
and the cruft kind of goes away on every reboot,

1092
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,720
which is really fascinating.

1093
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,320
And another thing, Chris, that I've only got interested in,

1094
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,440
but I know you played with was

1095
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,680
that there's some modularity to the config file,

1096
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,600
which I thought was really fascinating.

1097
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,040
Yeah, back in my day, we called them includes, right?

1098
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,640
But they're just essentially sub-configuration files.

1099
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,320
And so I have like a vpn.nix

1100
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:56,800
that I can put on all of my Nix boxes, and I have,

1101
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,520
and it just defines everything

1102
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,960
to install and connect to tail scale,

1103
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,480
right as I build the system, it's so great.

1104
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,120
And Nev, I noticed something you said in the chat room,

1105
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,040
maybe you could mention here in the Mumba room,

1106
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,680
it kind of changes the way maybe you view a Linux box,

1107
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,120
and depending on your perspective,

1108
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,000
it seems pretty practical.

1109
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,080
Yes, as like the home labber,

1110
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,560
or like the last 12, 13, 14 years,

1111
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,400
I've ultimately learned that every Linux distribution

1112
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,640
that I've ever installed on a client system,

1113
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,440
I've always just learned to treat that as install

1114
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,960
as disposable.

1115
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,760
Right, I was just saying to Wes before the show too,

1116
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,120
it's like, it's a difference between a toy and a tool.

1117
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,680
NixOS feels very much like a tool.

1118
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,600
And if you take what Linux is really great at,

1119
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,160
and you turn it up to 11,

1120
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,480
I think it really exemplifies a lot of that.

1121
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,520
And I think it would make for a really good

1122
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,440
rock solid workstation for somebody like Brent.

1123
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,520
I think Brent, you'd be,

1124
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,320
I think once you wrapped your head around it,

1125
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,480
you'd have something that's super reliable for you,

1126
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,480
and probably safe and secure too.

1127
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,080
You know, something gets weird, you just reboot.

1128
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:05,920
That's nice.

1129
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,240
Well, and the rollback features too, seem really great,

1130
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,760
cause you can try something new for a little bit,

1131
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,080
and then roll back to them.

1132
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:15,360
So it integrates, I think, some modern technologies

1133
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,560
that I've been craving.

1134
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,560
So I, you might have tempted me, Chris.

1135
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,720
No, I do think it means, you know,

1136
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,600
you're kind of committing to staying

1137
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,000
at least a little bit engaged with the,

1138
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,200
you know, the Nix language,

1139
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,240
and understanding how Nix works a little bit,

1140
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,280
if you're gonna base all your systems around it.

1141
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,120
Yeah.

1142
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,960
So that's, you know, that's one thing to,

1143
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,240
similar with other like configuration management systems,

1144
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,720
where, you know, you gotta learn the language

1145
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,760
of the system that you're using.

1146
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,040
But if you're willing to do that,

1147
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,480
and that's where I'm kind of fascinated

1148
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,000
about this challenge to see,

1149
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,640
cause for me, you know, I'm a software developer by day,

1150
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,400
so kind of used to reading new programming languages,

1151
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:51,240
but I'm curious to see, and this is a, you know,

1152
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:55,960
sort of ML inspired, functional, pure, lazy.

1153
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,760
It's probably different than languages

1154
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,840
you guys have seen before.

1155
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,160
So I'm gonna be fascinated to see

1156
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,640
how you guys get on with it.

1157
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,920
I will totally admit upfront, full disclosure here,

1158
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,240
this aspect of Nix is probably why I have put this off

1159
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,560
for as long as I have,

1160
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,640
because the audience has been asking us

1161
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,560
to talk about Nix years, since like 2004.

1162
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,560
Well, but you know, the truth of the matter was,

1163
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,720
is I just felt like,

1164
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,400
is it worth learning something so specific and unique?

1165
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,280
But what I have realized is, and this is,

1166
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,240
I'm sure a lot of you out there can relate to this

1167
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,640
because you've probably experienced this.

1168
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,320
You maybe are like aware of something

1169
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,920
and then you begin to look into it

1170
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,120
and you begin to learn more about it

1171
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,800
and you discover it is an entire world unto itself

1172
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,160
that has a ginormous community with passionate contributors.

1173
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,760
And you just kind of, sometimes you just stumble

1174
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,840
across these kinds of things every now and then.

1175
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,680
You're like, oh, there's something wonderful here.

1176
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,600
That's Nix.

1177
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,360
And you realize this is worth investing in

1178
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,400
because this community and the available packages

1179
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,320
and everything is so rich, the payoff is obvious

1180
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:10,400
once you understand the depth of it.

1181
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,520
So that is a transition for me

1182
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,400
because I didn't really wanna have to take a,

1183
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,680
I didn't wanna have to go to school

1184
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,840
to figure out how to install my software.

1185
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,760
But now that I realize it's gonna help me solve

1186
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,160
these problems that I've been recently,

1187
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,400
I've had a mind shift change.

1188
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,480
And you guys have probably noticed a lot

1189
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,200
that we've talked more about Bitcoin,

1190
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,120
we've talked more about Boost,

1191
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,120
we've talked more about decentralized services

1192
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,560
like Matrix, we've been talking more

1193
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,600
about this kind of stuff because I've kind of recently,

1194
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,480
I don't know, maybe it's because I've turned 40,

1195
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,720
maybe that, maybe it's just because I've hit

1196
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:44,160
like the 15 year mark of doing podcasts

1197
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,880
and that kind of feels like a point to reflect.

1198
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,520
And I've been thinking about how I wanna build things

1199
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,920
for JB over the next couple of years.

1200
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,880
So that way it sort of just can run itself

1201
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,240
after a certain sustainable as possible.

1202
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,560
Yeah, and so that come,

1203
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,040
and that's been a full spectrum thing

1204
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,880
like how we distribute the shows,

1205
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,200
the backend infrastructure, the front end infrastructure,

1206
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,000
how we monetize the shows, all of that, right?

1207
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,900
That's all been in here.

1208
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:16,900
And so to come across Nix kind of during this time

1209
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,880
and seeing how it can solve some of the problems

1210
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,460
that I'm facing, that's a huge deal.

1211
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,760
And it reminds me very, very much

1212
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,600
of why I even started the Linux Action Show to begin with

1213
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,640
is I was in IT and I was crazy excited

1214
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,040
about the problems I was solving with Linux.

1215
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,900
And I just felt this undeniable urge.

1216
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,360
I just couldn't stop myself.

1217
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,040
I had to talk about it.

1218
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,920
I'm still that way today.

1219
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,280
And that was really my motivation for starting the show.

1220
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,800
And it was the problems that it was solving for me

1221
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,280
that I felt like I needed to tell people

1222
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,920
you could solve these problems with Linux.

1223
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,360
And like, it was things like Samba and NFS

1224
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,160
and Squid and Apache.

1225
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,560
And I just felt like the world 15 years ago

1226
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:00,400
it needed to know you could solve problems.

1227
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,480
And I feel like we're arriving at another precipice

1228
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:08,020
where Nix is solving some serious problems.

1229
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,440
And I'm really excited about that.

1230
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,360
And value for value models and lightning network payments

1231
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,760
and boosts are solving some real problems.

1232
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,440
And I'm very excited about that.

1233
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,820
And I just wanna pull on a conversation

1234
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:23,480
that I had with my co-host Mike and Coder 458.

1235
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:28,120
So we get into it more there, but a group

1236
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:33,120
that does studies of the podcast industry, Edison Research,

1237
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,160
recently published their latest version,

1238
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,280
they do one every year,

1239
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,040
of kind of a state of the podcasting industry.

1240
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,360
And last year when they did their report,

1241
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,080
if you wanted to reach 50%

1242
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,680
of all weekly podcast listeners.

1243
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,440
So if you're a, I'm talking about you,

1244
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,420
if you're a weekly podcast listener,

1245
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:54,540
and if you wanted to reach them as an advertiser,

1246
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,540
you targeted like the top seven podcast networks

1247
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,460
and platforms.

1248
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,560
But one year later now,

1249
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,920
there has been considerable acquisitions

1250
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,060
of independent shows and in just 12 months,

1251
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,500
now to get 50% of those weekly listeners,

1252
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,620
you only need to buy advertising on four podcast networks.

1253
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,800
So in one year, we went from seven to four,

1254
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,320
Spotify, iHeartRadio, NPR, SXM Media,

1255
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,460
these are the main platforms

1256
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,220
where people are consolidating to.

1257
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:27,180
And Edison Research ends with this quote,

1258
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:30,840
they say, if indie podcasters don't find a way

1259
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:33,460
to organize and consolidate their buying power,

1260
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,100
some monetization options are just not going

1261
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:38,380
to be available for them, for you.

1262
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,440
And I think what they're saying there

1263
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,300
is there's gonna be less and less advertisers

1264
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,740
because between platforms like YouTube

1265
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:47,500
and the fact that you can go to Spotify

1266
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,980
and iHeartRadio and NPR and get 50% of all listeners,

1267
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,380
why would you spend three to six months

1268
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,900
creating an ad deal with some, you know.

1269
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,100
Smalls and twos and, right.

1270
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,380
This is a dramatic problem.

1271
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,260
And I think recently I said,

1272
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,540
I think we have three to five years.

1273
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,980
I think we probably have two years at best.

1274
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:06,500
And this is something that I've kind of thought

1275
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,460
was coming for a while.

1276
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,180
That's why we launched the membership programs.

1277
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,080
That's why we have the Unplugged Core contributors.

1278
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:12,920
Thank you so much.

1279
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,780
And we also have the Jupiter Party.

1280
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,660
Like this has been part of hedging

1281
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,260
for the direction this is going.

1282
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,100
And we knew, I could tell personally,

1283
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,100
I could tell just maybe,

1284
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,340
I don't know if it was just the economy,

1285
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,460
if it was just, I don't know, the shift from work.

1286
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,660
Something changed in the advertising business

1287
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:32,100
and I could tell that we needed more runway.

1288
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,260
We needed more flexibility.

1289
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,900
I needed to be able to say no

1290
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,260
because we get all kinds of people

1291
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:38,280
that want to sell scams on air.

1292
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,900
They really just, all kinds of scammy stuff.

1293
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:42,700
And I have to be able to say no to that kind of stuff.

1294
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,020
And the membership programs have really been key to that.

1295
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,540
But it's like it can't be the only solution.

1296
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,900
So that's why we've been talking more about boosts

1297
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,940
and the podcasting 2.0 movement and value for value.

1298
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,940
And so that's why, again, I want to mention

1299
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:02,260
I'm having a live stream on March 31st.

1300
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,580
I'm going to give away some Bitcoin

1301
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:06,340
to help you load up a lightning wallet.

1302
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,100
I like Fountain FM as an app, Cast-O-Matic is a great app,

1303
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,500
but just go to newpodcastapps.com.

1304
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,700
There's always new apps getting added there.

1305
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:17,460
Anything that supports value for value and boosts will work.

1306
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,140
And you get that set up,

1307
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,140
we'll have all the details on the live stream.

1308
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,780
I'll help everybody kind of get started on that

1309
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:26,580
because my thinking here is that

1310
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,700
if we get some of the podcast listeners on this network

1311
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,500
and then an open source project comes online,

1312
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,500
they already have a network of listeners

1313
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,980
that are just ready and willing to support.

1314
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,580
So I'm not going to go on about this every episode.

1315
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,980
I really am not.

1316
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,620
But it is sort of, there is kind of this coming together

1317
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:50,500
of all of these almost kind of movements in history.

1318
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,220
And I want to just talk for a moment about it

1319
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,460
and then this will be the episode we address it

1320
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,700
and then we don't have to keep talking about it all the time.

1321
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,820
So I want to talk a little bit briefly

1322
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,620
about value for value

1323
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,060
because I think it applies to free software

1324
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,940
and I think it applies to content creation.

1325
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,180
And I think there's a lot of reasons

1326
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:10,780
why we should pay attention to these kinds of things.

1327
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:14,300
So Boost, Lightning and value for value

1328
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,500
are not all the same thing.

1329
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,300
We talk about them all a lot together

1330
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:20,100
but they are not the same thing.

1331
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,100
Value for value is a support and content model.

1332
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,460
It was pioneered by Adam Curry and John C. Dvorak

1333
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:27,580
about 15, 14 years ago.

1334
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,380
And as time has gone on,

1335
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,780
it has sort of continued to prove out

1336
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,460
for various different reasons that that model

1337
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,460
is likely the most sustainable model

1338
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,420
for independent content.

1339
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:43,420
And the idea is very simply as the name implies,

1340
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:47,420
we, Jupiter Broadcasting, all of us here,

1341
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,740
all of us on the show,

1342
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,340
we put our value into the show,

1343
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,380
our time, our talent and our treasure.

1344
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,540
The audience gives value in return,

1345
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,780
your time, your talent or your treasure.

1346
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:00,340
Your time can be maybe helping out in the JB community

1347
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:01,980
like so many people do.

1348
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,220
Maybe you're like Cole or New West,

1349
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,220
you come up to the studio or the RV

1350
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,580
or maybe you just take your time

1351
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,700
to introduce someone to the show, right?

1352
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,580
That is a contribution,

1353
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,860
that is value given back to the show.

1354
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,980
Your talent could maybe be helping out JB

1355
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,820
with something that's social.

1356
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:23,100
Maybe it's code, maybe it's mechanical, right?

1357
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,100
It's something you're taking your unique talent

1358
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:29,860
and you're helping contribute value back using that talent.

1359
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,620
And of course, treasure is really straightforward

1360
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,900
and it's often the most available to anybody who's busy,

1361
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,620
has a lot going on.

1362
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,700
It's, you're often in a position

1363
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,580
where you don't have time to contribute your talent,

1364
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,140
your skills, you've got a lot going on.

1365
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:47,260
So value is the most straightforward way to contribute.

1366
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,780
And the Lightning Network

1367
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,460
is a free software peer-to-peer payment network

1368
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,420
that enables sending fractions of a penny

1369
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,180
for stupid cheap fees to send that value.

1370
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:02,140
Boosts are a brand new way to send messages into the show

1371
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,740
along with a contribution of value

1372
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,700
which is sent over that peer-to-peer

1373
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,300
free software Lightning Network.

1374
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,460
And to give the boosters value back,

1375
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:14,300
we try to read as many of those boosts here on the show

1376
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,820
as we can,

1377
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:17,580
because that's kind of the content aspect,

1378
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:20,540
one of the content aspects of the value for value model.

1379
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:23,660
If you send us a boost as a thank you in return for value,

1380
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,500
we try to read that on the show.

1381
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,940
This model, if you think about what I'm talking about here

1382
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,020
and you remove the technologies like Lightning or PayPal

1383
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,220
or whatever it might be,

1384
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,300
this is a platform agnostic model

1385
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,700
that can be applied to whatever model works for your business.

1386
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,260
So in our case, it's a combination of memberships,

1387
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:42,940
direct value for value, treasure contributions,

1388
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,980
and more and more limited sponsorships, right?

1389
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:49,300
It's kind of like a basket of these revenue sources.

1390
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:53,660
It is a model that can be resistant to content censorship

1391
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,020
because the advertisers are just part of that basket.

1392
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,740
We could, in theory, eliminate them.

1393
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,820
And because it is not necessarily dependent on people,

1394
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:05,420
dependent on a PayPal or a Stripe or a Patreon,

1395
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,980
it is a sustainable platform.

1396
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:10,940
So not only is it resistant to censorship,

1397
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:14,740
but it's a sustainable platform for the next 15 years of JB.

1398
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:17,740
And the way we're using it with Lightning Payments,

1399
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:21,100
the entire stack is built on free software

1400
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,140
and runs on Linux, the entire stack.

1401
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:27,660
For the first time ever in the history of my business,

1402
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,820
the payment stuff is now running on Linux.

1403
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:31,340
This is huge, right?

1404
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:33,620
Completely self-hostable.

1405
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,620
And because the actual value side of it,

1406
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:39,340
the monetary side of it in the value for value system

1407
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:41,020
comes from the audience,

1408
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,660
it's as sustainable as there is an audience.

1409
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,340
It's powered by the audience.

1410
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,860
So this is a 15-year solution.

1411
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,900
And it's a strategy that aligns completely with JB's values.

1412
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,660
Like this makes a lot of sense.

1413
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,660
It's using free software.

1414
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,900
It's orienting our primary focus towards the audience

1415
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,300
as our main customer.

1416
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,500
And I think we're figuring all of this out

1417
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,900
at a critical moment in podcasting and mark my words,

1418
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,340
this is a path that we are going down

1419
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,180
that other podcasters are going to follow.

1420
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,460
And eventually I think free software projects will follow.

1421
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,140
This I think has a lot of potential.

1422
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,140
And so that's why it's been brought up more on here

1423
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,460
because it's just,

1424
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,820
it's like a matrix of all this stuff coming together, Wes.

1425
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,660
Yeah, there's a lot going on right now.

1426
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,820
Yeah, there is a lot going on right now.

1427
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,180
And so that's just sort of the phase of the time

1428
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:29,060
that this show is in.

1429
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,820
This show has done this before.

1430
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:32,540
Like I've said before,

1431
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:34,260
you have your Star Trek The Next Generation,

1432
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,380
which is Planet Monster of the Week.

1433
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:38,740
Great show, really good show, right?

1434
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:40,540
That's Linux action news, right?

1435
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,380
That's Linux action news.

1436
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,380
And then you got your Deep Space Nine

1437
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:46,100
where you got your character development,

1438
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,860
you got your story arcs that go over a whole season.

1439
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,500
Surprising betrayals.

1440
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,700
Don't even get me started on Kai Win and Golda Khan.

1441
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:56,300
But you know, that's what this show is, right?

1442
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,380
And this is that phase.

1443
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:00,940
And you can probably feel it, I would imagine.

1444
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,460
If you've been listening for a while,

1445
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,500
you can probably tell.

1446
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,420
And if you're savvy enough in this particular area,

1447
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,940
you can probably get a sense that I might be right,

1448
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,140
but the implications are a little scary

1449
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,700
and the details seem a little difficult.

1450
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:18,420
And I acknowledge I have gotten really passionate

1451
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,740
about this.

1452
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:22,180
You know, I've jabbed ribs when I didn't really need to

1453
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:26,060
because this is my baby, right?

1454
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:30,020
These shows, podcasting, it's my life's work at this point.

1455
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,980
I've been making podcasts since listeners

1456
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,220
were burning them to CDs

1457
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:36,860
and listening to Linux action show

1458
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,980
and cast a blast on their CDs in their car.

1459
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,740
Pretty sure you've been making this kind of stuff

1460
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:43,780
before I knew what Linux was.

1461
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:47,460
And so it's really at a fragile,

1462
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:49,420
interesting inflection point.

1463
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,740
And to see research that sort of really demonstrates that,

1464
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:54,340
even though I knew it already,

1465
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,700
it kind of does make it a little more alarming.

1466
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,660
And it seems like we have an opportunity here

1467
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:00,420
to build a network.

1468
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,300
And the great thing about it is like,

1469
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,140
it's not super easy to get started today.

1470
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,980
I admit the onboarding is a pain in the ass right now.

1471
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,020
And by the way, if you're in the US,

1472
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,260
the easy way is just to get the Strike app.

1473
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,660
It's really low fees, it's a good team,

1474
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,900
it's a good simple app.

1475
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,580
You can buy just a small, tiny amount,

1476
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,700
a couple of bucks worth of Bitcoin

1477
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:24,060
and you can send it via lightning to your podcast app.

1478
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,220
The Strike app, get a little bit in there,

1479
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:28,020
you send it to your podcast app, you're done.

1480
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:28,940
It takes minutes.

1481
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,620
It's really nice.

1482
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:33,140
If you're outside the US or even in the US,

1483
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:37,380
Blue Wallet is a really good, safe, trustworthy

1484
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:40,300
mobile wallet for Android and iOS

1485
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:43,780
that has in-app purchases for Bitcoin

1486
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:47,380
that you can then send over lightning to your podcast app.

1487
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,460
And I am risking pissing off a lot of my audience

1488
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,660
by talking about this so much.

1489
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,220
That's a real problem we have.

1490
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,820
People are sick and tired of hearing about this.

1491
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,380
But what would you do?

1492
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,220
What would you do if you help pioneer a medium

1493
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,420
and you have worked your ass off for 15 years full time

1494
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,420
to make that medium possible

1495
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:09,460
and now you see something that is an existential threat to it

1496
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:14,460
and you see something that has a real possible solution,

1497
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,140
a real network effect is being built here.

1498
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,100
And the great thing is,

1499
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,540
is while onboarding is a pain in the ass today,

1500
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,500
there's a lot of companies working on that, right?

1501
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,580
This is a problem because it's an open network.

1502
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,260
It's like SMTP.

1503
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:29,060
It's like POP3.

1504
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,780
Other people are building solutions

1505
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,020
on top of this open network and they're solving problems

1506
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:35,220
and they're making it easier.

1507
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,300
So today, yeah, it's a pain in the butt

1508
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,380
and it seems kind of hard.

1509
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:41,620
You gotta, like for the podcast hosts,

1510
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:43,580
you gotta get this umbral thing

1511
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:46,060
and then you gotta go figure out what the podcast index is

1512
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,180
and then you gotta figure out how to embed a value tag.

1513
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,020
I mean, that just all sounds really complicated.

1514
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:51,740
You gotta do it on all of your feeds.

1515
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:53,780
Right, and then as the audience,

1516
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,700
you gotta figure out how to get your hands on,

1517
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,180
it doesn't have to be a lot of Bitcoin, but a few,

1518
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,660
like a few pennies worth

1519
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,140
and you gotta figure out how to then put that in a wallet

1520
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:03,380
and it's all very complicated today.

1521
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:04,300
But let me tell you,

1522
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:07,260
I've been talking about this for 12 years, Bitcoin

1523
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:12,260
and it is so much easier today than it was 12 years ago

1524
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,300
to get your hands on this safely

1525
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:18,060
and to just have a really slick experience.

1526
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,260
It's like, it's like Linux.

1527
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,460
It just keeps getting better.

1528
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,940
The experience just keeps getting better.

1529
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,580
People keep building on top of it

1530
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:27,660
and when you revisit it, you realize, wow,

1531
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:29,540
something has really changed here.

1532
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,500
It's that same kind of effect.

1533
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:33,580
So that's my end of my soapbox.

1534
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,420
It's done.

1535
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:36,620
I'm really gonna try not to talk about it anymore.

1536
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,540
In part, this comes up because the live stream

1537
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:39,820
is March 31st.

1538
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:42,140
That's sort of the apex of all of this.

1539
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,260
After we give the Bitcoin away

1540
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:46,700
and we get people loaded up with their wallets,

1541
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,940
we'll be done talking about it.

1542
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:50,420
And I do wanna mention,

1543
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,940
because I think this is noteworthy

1544
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:53,740
and I think it's really awesome,

1545
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,580
Bearded Tech, who is a listener,

1546
00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:00,580
who is working on an open source project called Fever,

1547
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:02,980
which is a Frigate event video recorder.

1548
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:06,580
It works alongside the Frigate video recording system

1549
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:07,620
that works with Home Assistant

1550
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:09,380
that you can plug your cameras into.

1551
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,580
Yeah, this just looks great.

1552
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:13,020
Yeah, it's like a free self-hosted camera viewing app.

1553
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,780
It's really nice.

1554
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,420
And he's built some really cool features in Fever

1555
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:19,700
and he's just a few days away

1556
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,620
from putting his project on the Lightning Network

1557
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:24,500
to take contributions as a value for value model

1558
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,060
and to take that value over Lightning.

1559
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:30,780
He will be one, but the next person will start a trend

1560
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:32,220
and it just kind of grows from there.

1561
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,140
And what an opportunity we have right now.

1562
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:37,540
So of course I have to talk about it.

1563
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:41,140
It's almost negligent because quite frankly,

1564
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:43,260
I think most of my peer group

1565
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,540
doesn't even understand what the hell I'm talking about.

1566
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,340
And so they're not gonna talk about it

1567
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:50,420
because it's so damn complicated

1568
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:52,660
and there's scams around every corner.

1569
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,700
They don't wanna go on air and tell you guys

1570
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:56,580
to do something that's gonna get you scammed

1571
01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:57,420
or something like that.

1572
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,100
Like they're just gonna sit this out for a bit.

1573
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,140
Let Chris figure it out.

1574
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:01,980
You know what?

1575
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,020
He figured out a lot of this stuff first, right?

1576
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,540
Let him figure this one out.

1577
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:08,860
He can burn his ass on this, piss everybody off.

1578
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,740
And then if it actually works out,

1579
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,100
then I'll sign up and we'll get it working.

1580
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:12,940
It'll be fine, right?

1581
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,700
Like that's the state of things.

1582
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,020
So that's what we're doing here right now.

1583
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,860
That's the stage we're in, but it's moving quick.

1584
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:23,420
So anyways, join me for the apex of it on March 31st.

1585
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,660
And before we get out of here,

1586
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,980
why don't we do some boosts?

1587
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:32,980
And now as the French say, it is time for the boost.

1588
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,140
Well, Jay wrote in two days ago.

1589
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:39,180
Thanks Jay.

1590
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:42,300
He says, you convinced me boosts.

1591
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,220
I'm already a fan of the brave browser

1592
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:46,180
and its model to use attention tokens

1593
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:48,380
to give back to creators.

1594
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:53,380
Longtime Linux user, first distro was MCC Linux in 1994.

1595
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,660
Once a career and now a hobby again,

1596
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,860
I've become a system admin of humans

1597
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,860
rather than machines, IES psychologist.

1598
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,780
And that's why it's fun again.

1599
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:03,820
Love your podcasts.

1600
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:05,420
A sys admin of humans.

1601
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,500
That's amazing.

1602
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:08,220
Isn't that great?

1603
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:09,140
I like brave.

1604
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:12,020
I'm still figuring out if I like the bat tokens.

1605
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,020
I think I get it, you know,

1606
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,500
but I'm still, I'd love people's input on that too.

1607
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,020
Send us a boost and let us know what you think about that.

1608
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,860
The coin lizard also wrote in with 25,000 sats.

1609
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,220
Chris, I've been listening to you

1610
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:27,460
since roughly episode 60 of Linux action show.

1611
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,300
Wow.

1612
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:29,820
Yeah, I know.

1613
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:31,900
I took my first hard look at Bitcoin

1614
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:34,300
as a result of your podcast plan B.

1615
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,860
Do you remember that?

1616
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,060
I'm happy to see you promoting the value for value model

1617
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,260
from the lightning networks.

1618
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,980
It's truly powerful to be able to support content creators

1619
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:46,540
in an uncensorable way.

1620
01:02:46,540 --> 01:02:48,100
Thank you for the amazing content

1621
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,020
that you've provided for the last 15 years.

1622
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,260
We don't have to read that part.

1623
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:52,100
Don't read, that's embarrassing.

1624
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:52,940
Well, I don't know.

1625
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,660
It seems kind of nice, but all right.

1626
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:56,700
Thank you Bitcoin lizard for sending that in.

1627
01:02:56,700 --> 01:02:58,980
I hope you made a good chunk of money.

1628
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:01,900
Cause if you've been listening since plan B,

1629
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:04,660
I looked at the last recorded episode of plan B

1630
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:08,740
and I think the price of Bitcoin at that time was $124.

1631
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,860
A different era.

1632
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:15,300
NorCalGeek boosts in with 5,000 sets.

1633
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:19,460
Commenting on Linux Unplugged 450 went real bad.

1634
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:23,220
I enjoyed the GNOME 42 review slash preview.

1635
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:25,820
Looking forward to getting it at Fedora 36.

1636
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:27,300
Yeah, us too.

1637
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:28,860
Keep up the great work.

1638
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:30,420
I appreciate your honesty.

1639
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:32,020
Ah, thank you NorCal.

1640
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:32,860
Miss you.

1641
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:34,580
It's been a while since we've been able to meet up with him.

1642
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:35,860
Yeah, no kidding.

1643
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:37,980
By the way, I saw that OpenSUSE at Tumbleweed

1644
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,660
shipped 42 this week.

1645
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:41,580
So they technically, they got it first.

1646
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,020
We got to give them credit.

1647
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,500
Also Clear Linux shipped it.

1648
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,660
So got to give a Clear Linux some credit too.

1649
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,540
Go get that GNOME 42, however you have to get it.

1650
01:03:52,540 --> 01:03:56,020
Remaking Eden wrote in three days ago with a thousand sets

1651
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:57,860
also in response to episode 450 said,

1652
01:03:57,860 --> 01:03:59,980
I really hope that the value for value movement

1653
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:01,620
gathers momentum.

1654
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:03,540
It's the first so-called web three project

1655
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,900
I felt like I can get behind and we'll do some good.

1656
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,620
I'd hate for Spotify to gobble up something as important

1657
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,540
as podcasts.

1658
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:13,500
Web three is kind of a nebulous term,

1659
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:18,500
which I guess can encompass anything that has blockchain.

1660
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:19,940
Value for value itself, again,

1661
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:23,140
that's a content and monetization model.

1662
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:26,420
Lightning is the payment network, right?

1663
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,180
And Bitcoin is the form of payment.

1664
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:30,340
Does that make sense?

1665
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,180
Yeah, right.

1666
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:32,900
And you can use those things to implement something

1667
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,660
in the value for value system.

1668
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:36,780
You got it, you got it, you got it.

1669
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:40,500
Matthew wrote in 5,000 sats four days ago.

1670
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,220
He says, hi, thanks for the show.

1671
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:46,620
Do you know when Fountain will support Apple CarPlay?

1672
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:49,700
That's the only thing that keeps me on Apple podcasts.

1673
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:52,820
Fountain, yes, does not yet support Android auto

1674
01:04:52,820 --> 01:04:57,340
or CarPlay, but I happen to have it from a reliable source

1675
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,300
that it is the number one requested feature

1676
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,380
and that it is going to be released soon.

1677
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,220
Thanks.

1678
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:04,060
Yeah.

1679
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,420
Eric Padre writes in four days ago with 2,000 sats.

1680
01:05:06,420 --> 01:05:08,100
Let's go Linux community and lightning.

1681
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:10,980
Let's bootstrap this fantastic idea.

1682
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:13,900
And that was it.

1683
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:14,740
That's it.

1684
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:15,580
That's a short one.

1685
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,420
I expected there to be more,

1686
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,220
but then I realized the other bullet points

1687
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:19,420
were just notes to ourselves.

1688
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,260
You know, there's a character maximum,

1689
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,740
not a character minimum, Chris.

1690
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:24,580
You know what?

1691
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,580
I like the short ones actually.

1692
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:26,420
Thank you everybody.

1693
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:27,740
Thank you for sending those in.

1694
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:28,940
So the way you send in a boost

1695
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:31,260
is you go to newpodcastapps.com.

1696
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:33,860
You get an app that supports boost like Fountain.

1697
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,500
You charge up that lightning wallet

1698
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,820
and then you send one in.

1699
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:37,940
Boost to grand.

1700
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:39,540
Yeah, that's great.

1701
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:40,540
That's, I don't know.

1702
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:44,340
I feel like I've officially got it out of my system

1703
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:47,060
and this live stream thing's happening this Thursday.

1704
01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:48,460
I hope you'll join us.

1705
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:50,100
We have a special guest that's gonna join us

1706
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:51,700
and do a brief interview.

1707
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:53,060
We're gonna do the Bitcoin giveaway.

1708
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:55,700
Of course, we're also gonna help you get Matrix set up.

1709
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:58,780
And last but not least, of course,

1710
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,140
somebody, a friend, maybe Wes, is gonna join me.

1711
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:01,980
We'll chat.

1712
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:02,820
I don't know.

1713
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:03,660
I feel like there's something else I'm forgetting

1714
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:04,580
that's gonna be on the live stream,

1715
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:05,620
but we have a good show planned.

1716
01:06:05,620 --> 01:06:07,580
Said special guest, right?

1717
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:09,140
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1718
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:10,180
Bitcoin giveaway.

1719
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:11,020
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1720
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:11,860
Matrix set up.

1721
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:12,700
Ask Chris anything.

1722
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,660
The AMA stuff, that's what I was forgetting.

1723
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:16,860
Oh, I thought you were gonna say Levi there for a sec.

1724
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,420
Maybe he could make a special appearance.

1725
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:20,620
I mean, he's kinda, you know, he's hard to get.

1726
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:21,780
Yeah. He's booked out.

1727
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:22,620
That's true.

1728
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,060
If you'd like to get more show,

1729
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:26,060
go check out linuxactionnews.com.

1730
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:29,100
Wes took the week off, but he'll be back this week, right?

1731
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:29,940
Yeah. Right?

1732
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:31,540
Of course. Of course.

1733
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,380
We cover the tech news, what's going on.

1734
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:37,460
Don't miss a single episode, linuxactionnews.com.

1735
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:41,580
It's like, we should probably consider a combo feed.

1736
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:43,300
Now that I think about it.

1737
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,140
Whoa.

1738
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,420
We have the all shows feed, but we should-

1739
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:46,260
Right.

1740
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,380
We should, if people be interested,

1741
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:48,700
send us a boost, tell us that.

1742
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:51,500
Yeah. Arbitrary feed remixes?

1743
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,340
Yeah.

1744
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:55,340
And also you can always join us on Sunday at jblive.tv.

1745
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:58,460
We do the show at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1746
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:00,180
We got the mumble room going.

1747
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,060
That's always a lot of fun.

1748
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,180
We got the chat room going.

1749
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:05,740
We don't have the JBLive FM stream going at the moment,

1750
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:07,460
but we will be working on that.

1751
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,460
We will.

1752
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,540
That is in the plans.

1753
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:10,380
Just went out, okay?

1754
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1755
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,020
But links to everything we talked about today

1756
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,700
are at linuxunplug.com slash 451.

1757
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,180
The show's RSS feeds are over there.

1758
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,140
If you'd like to send it to somebody,

1759
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,940
recommend your favorite episode and send them a link.

1760
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:22,780
We appreciate that a whole bunch.

1761
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:25,860
And of course, join us on our matrix.

1762
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:27,460
Details on our website.

1763
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:28,940
Thanks so much for joining this week's episode

1764
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:29,980
of the Unplugged program.

1765
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,940
See you right back here next Sunday.

1766
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,340
We'll be right back.

1767
01:07:33,340 --> 01:08:03,300
The Unplugged program is brought to you by

1768
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:13,540
All right, JBtitles.com, let's go title this thing.

1769
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,380
It's worth mentioning before we get out of here,

1770
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:17,860
we talked all about NICs this week,

1771
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:22,980
but Fedora 36 and Ubuntu 2204 have their betas coming out.

1772
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:26,140
And both these are big releases because 36 has that nice,

1773
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:29,340
beautiful upstream GNOME 42.

1774
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:34,060
And of course, 2204, it's gonna be an LTS.

1775
01:08:34,060 --> 01:08:36,340
So that's also one that really could have some value

1776
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:39,140
to get as much testing as possible,

1777
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,900
because that just has a lot of long-term benefits

1778
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:43,420
for the Ubuntu community.

1779
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,660
So that's exciting.

1780
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,740
It's a busy week.

1781
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,980
Get out there and get your beta.

1782
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:50,220
Yeah, right.

1783
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:53,540
Which, you know, I gotta get 2204 going again,

1784
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,220
because I got 36 installed right now.

1785
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,060
Same, yeah.

1786
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:59,100
Hmm, but I feel like I need to give 2204

1787
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:01,580
a couple of weeks.

1788
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:02,660
There's a lot going on.

1789
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:03,220
There's too much.

1790
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,420
And we got the NICs challenge.

1791
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:07,300
Plus then, during the middle of April,

1792
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:10,140
we're traveling, or the early part of April.

1793
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,580
So that's kind of one of the reasons

1794
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,500
why I wanted to make the NICs challenge a month long,

1795
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,860
is because I wanted to give people who are busy

1796
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:18,020
a chance to participate.

1797
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:18,820
Smart.

1798
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:21,340
Yeah, and also, since all of us are

1799
01:09:21,340 --> 01:09:25,580
traveling to North Carolina in a couple of weeks,

1800
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,900
I don't think there'll be a lot of NICs testing going on that

1801
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,220
week for the JV crew.

1802
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:32,140
So I wanted to give us a little extra time in there.

1803
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,780
We have some pretty long flight rides,

1804
01:09:33,780 --> 01:09:35,780
so I feel like there might be NICs in the air.

1805
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,380
Hadea and I are already talking, though,

1806
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:39,780
about maybe watching a new TV series during that time.

1807
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,980
So that time may already be claimed.

1808
01:09:41,980 --> 01:09:43,860
You know, that's the debate right now.

1809
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:45,380
I was thinking of Wes, really.

1810
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:45,940
Come on.

1811
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:46,820
Oh, yeah.

1812
01:09:46,820 --> 01:09:48,380
Wes will probably spend his entire time

1813
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,820
just trying to hack the in-flight Wi-Fi

1814
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:50,700
to get free internet.

1815
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:51,700
That's always so fun.

1816
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:58,060
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
