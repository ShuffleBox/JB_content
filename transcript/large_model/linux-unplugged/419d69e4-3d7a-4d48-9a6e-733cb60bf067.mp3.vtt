00:00.000 --> 00:02.760
I was gonna go on a whole Rocky Linux rant today,

00:02.760 --> 00:04.340
but I decided not to put it in the show.

00:04.340 --> 00:06.220
But my thoughts are, and I wish them all the best,

00:06.220 --> 00:07.800
and I think it's really exciting,

00:07.800 --> 00:10.860
but it feels like the community has already awarded them

00:10.860 --> 00:13.780
the crown without really them shipping yet.

00:13.780 --> 00:16.460
I mean, they just shipped their final version.

00:16.460 --> 00:18.300
They haven't become, they're not going to be

00:18.300 --> 00:22.420
a truly open, free, charitable organization.

00:22.420 --> 00:24.660
They're gonna be a for-profit organization.

00:24.660 --> 00:27.180
And they don't necessarily have the experience

00:27.180 --> 00:28.500
that Alma Linux has behind it,

00:28.500 --> 00:32.780
who's already been building a CentOS clone for a decade,

00:32.780 --> 00:34.540
and has already shipped a stable version,

00:34.540 --> 00:37.220
and has now launched additional products on top of that,

00:37.220 --> 00:39.540
and has a really easy support contract,

00:39.540 --> 00:43.020
and has a true nonprofit organization behind it.

00:43.020 --> 00:44.540
And I feel like we look at this,

00:44.540 --> 00:46.460
and I'm like, yeah, Rocky Linux looks really great.

00:46.460 --> 00:47.820
It's got a good, solid team.

00:47.820 --> 00:49.900
It's got an excited community.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.940
But when you look at the rubber meeting the road

00:51.940 --> 00:54.980
as it comes to CentOS, traditional CentOS replacements,

00:54.980 --> 00:56.760
I feel like the community's called it too soon.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.020
They've called it for Rocky Linux

00:58.020 --> 01:00.220
when Alma Linux really has all the best features

01:00.220 --> 01:02.540
and seems to be the most viable contender.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.420
Yeah, it seems like maybe there was a presumption here

01:04.420 --> 01:07.100
that Rocky seemed like it was more of the community effort

01:07.100 --> 01:09.940
at the start, perhaps because Cloud Linux was so involved

01:09.940 --> 01:11.700
in getting Alma Linux off the ground.

01:11.700 --> 01:12.540
But yeah, you're right.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.540
I mean, one, it's just crazy early days

01:14.540 --> 01:17.100
for either of these, regardless.

01:17.100 --> 01:19.180
But, you know, it takes time to actually figure out

01:19.180 --> 01:22.300
which one is gonna be more of the community-minded distro

01:22.300 --> 01:23.300
at the end of the day.

01:23.300 --> 01:27.100
How many times year after year do they hit their promises?

01:27.100 --> 01:30.380
And Alma Linux is checked every box so far.

01:30.380 --> 01:33.260
And I don't, you know, I don't have a dog in this hunt,

01:33.260 --> 01:37.740
but it seems like the cult of personality has won here.

01:37.740 --> 01:40.700
And because a former co-founder of CentOS

01:40.700 --> 01:42.420
is involved with Rocky Linux,

01:42.420 --> 01:45.060
everyone's just decided, well, that's the winner.

01:45.060 --> 01:57.100
Welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show, my name is Chris.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.180
My name is Wes.

01:58.180 --> 02:00.100
Hello, Wes.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.340
Coming up on the show today,

02:02.340 --> 02:05.580
we decided to attempt something they say can't be done.

02:05.580 --> 02:08.140
We want our beer and we want to drink it too.

02:08.140 --> 02:09.340
I'll tell you about that.

02:09.340 --> 02:11.980
But first, this episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru,

02:11.980 --> 02:13.540
the leader in hands-on learning.

02:13.540 --> 02:15.460
The only way to learn a new skill is by doing.

02:15.460 --> 02:17.380
That's why ACG provides hands-on labs,

02:17.380 --> 02:19.140
cloud Linux servers, and much more.

02:19.140 --> 02:22.620
So get your hands cloudy at acloudguru.com.

02:22.620 --> 02:26.820
Is it possible a workstation with an Ubuntu LTS base,

02:26.820 --> 02:31.220
but maybe with a few select fresh user land native apps,

02:31.220 --> 02:35.580
can you bring Arches coveted AUR to Ubuntu?

02:35.580 --> 02:37.060
Is it possible?

02:37.060 --> 02:41.860
This week I challenged Wes to get the AUR working on Ubuntu.

02:41.860 --> 02:43.380
And to my surprise, he did it.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.220
We'll explain more.

02:44.220 --> 02:47.020
We'll tell you where it falls short and where it's going.

02:47.020 --> 02:50.020
And all of the exciting things you're gonna be able to do with it and

02:50.020 --> 02:53.520
some other ideas a little outside the box that could work on all kinds of

02:53.520 --> 02:54.500
distributions.

02:54.500 --> 02:57.140
But first, before the show goes on,

02:57.140 --> 02:59.700
we've got to say time appropriate greetings to our virtual log.

02:59.700 --> 03:00.740
Hello, Mumble Room.

03:00.740 --> 03:04.220
Hello, Chris and Wes.

03:04.220 --> 03:05.380
Hello, everybody.

03:05.380 --> 03:07.100
Man, is it good to see you.

03:07.100 --> 03:10.940
I've been looking forward to chatting with you all week.

03:10.940 --> 03:16.300
And before we get into the news, there is something we have to take care of.

03:16.300 --> 03:17.300
It's been a little while.

03:17.300 --> 03:26.460
Wes Payne, are you ready for an Arch server update?

03:26.460 --> 03:29.300
Boy, am I ever ready for these fully?

03:29.300 --> 03:29.940
I don't know.

03:29.940 --> 03:33.500
We've got 206 packages today.

03:33.500 --> 03:38.940
That's like three gigs installed, but you know, it's only like a net 50 MB upgrade.

03:38.940 --> 03:39.860
I love that.

03:39.860 --> 03:43.940
So for those of you new to the show, from time to time,

03:43.940 --> 03:48.500
we upgrade our production server live on the air as part of our commitment to you

03:48.500 --> 03:52.220
to do something you should never do, and that is run Arch on your production

03:52.220 --> 03:53.060
server.

03:53.060 --> 03:58.140
And to stay accountable, as long as we run this server, we will update it.

03:58.140 --> 04:01.780
And if it breaks right here on air, we'll have to admit it to you.

04:01.780 --> 04:03.380
Wes, are you ready to pull the trigger?

04:03.380 --> 04:05.340
Standing by.

04:05.340 --> 04:06.100
OK.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.020
Do we have WireGuard in that update list?

04:08.020 --> 04:13.940
WireGuard tools, yes, we do, and a new stable kernel minor version.

04:13.940 --> 04:15.700
I feel like we always have kernel updates,

04:15.700 --> 04:17.340
even though we went with the LTS version.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.100
Yeah, I think they're just smaller updates.

04:19.100 --> 04:22.340
Hopefully that means things break less, but really, I

04:22.340 --> 04:26.300
think what we were hoping for was just like fewer package updates at that level,

04:26.300 --> 04:29.220
and I'm not sure how much we've gotten that.

04:29.220 --> 04:31.180
All right, you want to pull the trigger?

04:31.180 --> 04:33.380
Linux LTS 5.10, here we come.

04:33.380 --> 04:41.420
I swear we have all of these dang kernel updates,

04:41.420 --> 04:42.820
even though we went with the LTS.

04:42.820 --> 04:43.940
So we'll check back in.

04:43.940 --> 04:46.380
That's got to download the packages and start installing.

04:46.380 --> 04:48.380
You will holler, Wes, if anything goes sideways.

04:48.380 --> 04:48.860
Will do.

04:48.860 --> 04:50.740
Otherwise, we'll find out how it went.

04:50.740 --> 04:54.100
And Wes, I have fantastic news.

04:54.100 --> 04:59.020
I have like best news of the week news that I have been waiting to tell you

04:59.020 --> 05:00.060
until we are live on air.

05:00.060 --> 05:00.980
Are you ready for that?

05:00.980 --> 05:02.820
What do you have today?

05:02.820 --> 05:03.900
Bombshell.

05:03.900 --> 05:07.340
So you remember last week, we announced that we're going to do a road trip

05:07.340 --> 05:10.060
to Salt Lake City and to Denver, and we're going to do a meetup

05:10.060 --> 05:11.780
in both those locations.

05:11.780 --> 05:13.620
We're going to do a team reunion.

05:13.620 --> 05:15.140
That's all still going.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.980
Like nothing changes there.

05:16.980 --> 05:21.700
However, now I'm happy to say that Linode is on board

05:21.700 --> 05:26.020
to help finance the trip and make it possible from a technical standpoint.

05:26.020 --> 05:30.500
And so we're taking it up a notch, and we're going to call it Linode on the road.

05:30.500 --> 05:34.300
It's the great road trip at a scale we've never done before.

05:34.300 --> 05:39.820
Now that Linode is helping us, we're going to create new exclusive road

05:39.820 --> 05:43.780
shows, interviews with the crew, the places we visit,

05:43.780 --> 05:46.580
the stories we'll gather when we get together.

05:46.580 --> 05:50.580
We're going to have independent releases separate of this show that

05:50.580 --> 05:51.900
are made possible by Linode.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.380
We'll have details on that very soon.

05:54.380 --> 05:56.340
I'm really excited to get produced more content

05:56.340 --> 05:58.380
and have something that's unique.

05:58.380 --> 06:01.300
And we'll have some conversations on there that you won't want to miss

06:01.300 --> 06:04.420
and some old friends you haven't heard from in a little while.

06:04.420 --> 06:07.300
We're making plans right now, though, for two meetups in August.

06:07.300 --> 06:10.740
The first meetup will be in Salt Lake City on August 7th.

06:10.740 --> 06:15.220
The second meetup will be in Denver on August 20th.

06:15.220 --> 06:16.780
Not all the details are firm yet.

06:16.780 --> 06:20.060
So if you have any insights on those locations,

06:20.060 --> 06:22.940
if you're a local and you know a great spot to meet up,

06:22.940 --> 06:25.060
totally open to all that feedback right now.

06:25.060 --> 06:26.660
It's all in the planning phases.

06:26.660 --> 06:29.940
But details as we have them are in the meetup pages

06:29.940 --> 06:32.540
at meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

06:32.540 --> 06:36.220
And we'll link to each individual meetup in the show notes.

06:36.220 --> 06:38.020
Please sign up and let us know if you're thinking about going

06:38.020 --> 06:40.340
so we can plan accordingly.

06:40.340 --> 06:45.060
New, fresh content, old friends, places we're going to visit.

06:45.060 --> 06:47.740
And my intention is to have the tracker going.

06:47.740 --> 06:51.580
So that way, if we go past your place on the road and it works up,

06:51.580 --> 06:54.380
we can have a spontaneous little meetup, too.

06:54.380 --> 06:55.660
I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

06:55.660 --> 06:58.340
And I am super excited and thrilled

06:58.340 --> 07:00.180
to have Linode helping us make it possible.

07:00.180 --> 07:01.220
Thank you to Linode.

07:01.220 --> 07:02.660
I'll tell you more about all that.

07:02.660 --> 07:05.980
But that just got all figured out in the last couple of days.

07:05.980 --> 07:08.460
And we've been talking to System76

07:08.460 --> 07:10.820
about getting a factory tour while we're there, too,

07:10.820 --> 07:13.140
so we can see how the launch keyboard is made.

07:13.140 --> 07:14.180
That's in the works.

07:14.180 --> 07:16.020
And we're making dinner plans with folks.

07:16.020 --> 07:19.820
I'm very excited after the last event I went to

07:19.820 --> 07:21.300
was Texas Cyber Summit.

07:21.300 --> 07:23.780
And it just really wasn't my thing.

07:23.780 --> 07:27.780
In fact, that event made me more profoundly concerned

07:27.780 --> 07:29.900
about the state of the cybersecurity industry

07:29.900 --> 07:31.020
than anything else.

07:31.020 --> 07:33.260
And it actually sat with me in a really kind of awkward,

07:33.260 --> 07:35.020
negative way for a long time.

07:35.020 --> 07:37.260
Not a good community event to end on.

07:37.260 --> 07:38.460
No, it wasn't, Wes.

07:38.460 --> 07:40.940
And so this is, oh, man, I needed this so bad.

07:40.940 --> 07:43.300
And I think a lot of people, a team reunion,

07:43.300 --> 07:45.140
we haven't seen each other in a long time.

07:45.140 --> 07:46.540
That's going to be incredible.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.100
And then a chance to see the audience.

07:48.100 --> 07:53.180
So details are in the show notes for all of that.

07:53.180 --> 07:54.660
In the meantime, I am just trying

07:54.660 --> 07:58.900
to get Lady Joups back up and running again.

07:58.900 --> 08:01.340
In fact, I could also use anybody's input on this.

08:01.340 --> 08:05.500
So just a real quick version of the story for context purposes.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.220
Stay a while and listen.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.860
On my way to Montana about a month ago,

08:09.860 --> 08:13.660
heading out east from the Seattle area, in Idaho,

08:13.660 --> 08:14.820
my living room slide broke.

08:14.820 --> 08:18.500
So my RV's got a kitchen slide, a living room slide,

08:18.500 --> 08:20.260
and of course, it's got a bedroom slide.

08:20.260 --> 08:22.540
And for those of you that don't know what I'm talking about,

08:22.540 --> 08:25.660
there's a room on a track that stretches out

08:25.660 --> 08:26.660
from the side of the RV.

08:26.660 --> 08:27.780
And it gives you more space.

08:27.780 --> 08:31.100
And so for a family of three kids, two adults and a dog,

08:31.100 --> 08:33.460
you essentially go from having a kitchen and a living room

08:33.460 --> 08:33.940
to not.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.140
And it makes it so you can go down the road.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.020
You park, you set up, you got a lot more space.

08:38.020 --> 08:39.780
Wonderful idea.

08:39.780 --> 08:42.980
However, in the time around when, well, really,

08:42.980 --> 08:46.260
still even today, but in 2014 when Lady Joups was built,

08:46.260 --> 08:48.940
the Schwintex slide system was not properly installed.

08:48.940 --> 08:51.820
And so we've been fighting that son of a bitch for years now.

08:51.820 --> 08:54.380
Five years, it's just been a constant struggle.

08:54.380 --> 08:55.060
A money pit.

08:55.060 --> 08:56.980
And it's a real damn shame because, you know,

08:56.980 --> 08:58.380
Joups is decked out with solar.

08:58.380 --> 08:59.580
She's got lithium batteries.

08:59.580 --> 09:02.000
She's got the coolest internet setup I could ever possibly

09:02.000 --> 09:02.660
have.

09:02.660 --> 09:04.660
All these little upgrades, she's our family home

09:04.660 --> 09:06.140
with tons of memories in her.

09:06.140 --> 09:07.420
You don't want to give that up.

09:07.420 --> 09:10.380
I mean, just the work alone, let aside the attachment.

09:10.380 --> 09:12.700
So all the slides were out when we were in Idaho

09:12.700 --> 09:14.380
because we're making room for the family.

09:14.380 --> 09:17.300
I bring in the bedroom slide, I bring in the kitchen slide,

09:17.300 --> 09:18.060
everything's fine.

09:18.060 --> 09:20.540
I bring in the living room slide, it stops halfway.

09:20.540 --> 09:22.460
Of course, we're supposed to leave in two hours

09:22.460 --> 09:23.820
and I can't get my slide in and I

09:23.820 --> 09:24.980
can't go down the road with the slide out

09:24.980 --> 09:27.900
because I'll be clipping everybody going down the road.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.020
So I call a tech, he says, yeah, we're two hours out.

09:30.020 --> 09:31.740
And I'm like, yeah, but I got to leave here in two hours.

09:31.740 --> 09:33.260
So I go to the office, they say, yeah, you know what,

09:33.260 --> 09:34.500
Mr. Fisher, we understand.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.660
This stuff happens.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.060
You guys don't worry about it.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.820
You can stay all night if you need to.

09:38.820 --> 09:40.900
Wolf Lodge, by the way, in Idaho, shout out to them.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.820
They really were really great about it.

09:42.820 --> 09:44.620
The tech comes out and we determine that we

09:44.620 --> 09:46.660
can't resolve this in the field.

09:46.660 --> 09:49.740
There's just no real, no solution here.

09:49.740 --> 09:52.020
And the only option is to disengage the motors

09:52.020 --> 09:54.900
because they have a magnetic lock to prevent the slide from just

09:54.900 --> 09:56.020
arbitrarily moving in and out.

09:56.020 --> 09:56.740
Of course.

09:56.740 --> 09:59.580
Disengage the motors and we have to slam it in.

09:59.580 --> 10:01.540
And I hurt myself doing this like an idiot.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.500
I popped a rib out, hurt for weeks,

10:03.500 --> 10:07.220
made the whole trip agonizing.

10:07.220 --> 10:08.780
On our way back, we call up our shop

10:08.780 --> 10:10.500
that we've been going to for years and we say, hey, guys.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.820
And this is where I need the audience's help.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.540
We say, hey, guys, the slide that you just

10:13.540 --> 10:16.380
fixed in March is busted again.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.900
We immediately get the cold shoulder.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.780
Like, I can tell they're done fixing this problem because it's

10:20.780 --> 10:22.460
a pain in the ass to work on.

10:22.460 --> 10:24.620
And they're sick and tired of this and they're busy.

10:24.620 --> 10:25.780
They're packed.

10:25.780 --> 10:27.580
They basically say without saying,

10:27.580 --> 10:29.580
we're kind of done fixing this.

10:29.580 --> 10:32.820
So we kind of decided we got to find somewhere else.

10:32.820 --> 10:35.660
Found a local guy near the studio who's

10:35.660 --> 10:37.180
kind of known for fixing slides.

10:37.180 --> 10:38.780
So it just seems like, what a great opportunity.

10:38.780 --> 10:40.740
15 minutes from the studio, this guy's

10:40.740 --> 10:42.540
built custom slide systems.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.020
This seems like the way to go.

10:44.020 --> 10:46.860
Go to his website, even charges less than our standard shop.

10:46.860 --> 10:50.060
Oh, man, that's great because we just had this fixed in March.

10:50.060 --> 10:51.420
Bring Lady Joops in.

10:51.420 --> 10:53.300
And I pull in and I go, this is a little weird.

10:53.300 --> 10:58.340
He's using storage units as his workshop, which is fine.

10:58.340 --> 11:01.140
A little unconventional, but I used to podcast out of a garage.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.420
OK, that's fine.

11:02.420 --> 11:03.700
We get there, we're going through the work order,

11:03.700 --> 11:04.700
he says to me.

11:04.700 --> 11:10.140
Oh, by the way, our rate now, instead of $85, is $125 an hour.

11:10.140 --> 11:11.260
OK.

11:11.260 --> 11:14.180
And you have to pay in cash.

11:14.180 --> 11:21.460
OK, I don't generally carry a lot of cash on me, but OK.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.940
He starts doing the work and days go by.

11:23.940 --> 11:24.740
Days go by.

11:24.740 --> 11:26.700
He then gives us a diagnosis, kind of

11:26.700 --> 11:28.620
seems in line with what I expect.

11:28.620 --> 11:30.460
More days, five more days go by.

11:30.460 --> 11:32.940
As days go by here, I mean, that's your home, right?

11:32.940 --> 11:34.500
This is where you're most comfortable,

11:34.500 --> 11:38.380
where you've optimized for your work and enjoyment in life.

11:38.380 --> 11:40.620
Yeah, that was horrible.

11:40.620 --> 11:42.260
That 10 days was horrible.

11:42.260 --> 11:46.300
We get it back yesterday, $4,200 cash out of pocket, right?

11:46.300 --> 11:51.980
I got no cashier's check, had to be cash.

11:51.980 --> 11:53.260
And he's got the RV, right?

11:53.260 --> 11:55.100
So it's not like I can really argue with him,

11:55.100 --> 11:58.820
because he's got it in a locked storage bay behind a gate.

11:58.820 --> 12:01.220
I got to give this guy his money if I want my RV back.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.380
Buddy says he fixed the slide.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.780
Sounds like the beginning of a movie, maybe?

12:04.780 --> 12:06.420
I know, right?

12:06.420 --> 12:08.820
Get in there, slide seems like it's working.

12:08.820 --> 12:11.740
We close it all up, we drive it home, set up.

12:11.740 --> 12:15.300
First thing I do, level out the RV and go put out the slide.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.380
It immediately breaks.

12:17.380 --> 12:19.820
I wasn't even home for 10 minutes before it was broken.

12:19.820 --> 12:22.020
It just clearly wasn't fixed.

12:22.020 --> 12:23.500
$4,200 in cash, too, right?

12:23.500 --> 12:27.580
So it's not like I can just reverse the transaction.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.540
And I guess why I'm putting this out there is,

12:30.540 --> 12:32.260
A, I obviously have a timeline.

12:32.260 --> 12:34.340
I got to get this fixed before the Denver trip.

12:34.340 --> 12:35.700
That's the mission now.

12:35.700 --> 12:38.500
So I'm appealing to anyone in the audience who

12:38.500 --> 12:41.740
might know of a shop or a technician who

12:41.740 --> 12:46.980
has solved these rickety, poorly installed Schwintex slide

12:46.980 --> 12:48.580
systems before.

12:48.580 --> 12:50.220
It's a very specific kind of slide type.

12:50.220 --> 12:51.980
It has to be that particular type.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.340
And I'm just putting that out there

12:53.340 --> 12:55.780
because this is going to become an issue for this trip

12:55.780 --> 12:56.380
to Denver now.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.780
I got to get this fixed.

12:57.780 --> 12:59.540
And I don't have that kind of money.

12:59.540 --> 13:02.140
Like that, $4,200 hurt.

13:02.140 --> 13:03.140
It hurt a lot.

13:03.140 --> 13:04.980
It hurts because it was only yesterday.

13:04.980 --> 13:05.500
It still hurts.

13:05.500 --> 13:06.820
It's really got me wrecked, actually.

13:06.820 --> 13:07.940
I mean, that's other things you can't

13:07.940 --> 13:10.940
do, other upgrades, things for your kids, things for JB,

13:10.940 --> 13:12.260
all kinds of stuff.

13:12.260 --> 13:14.780
Well, the situation is a little more bleak than that even.

13:14.780 --> 13:16.380
I'd like to have my savings account

13:16.380 --> 13:18.300
for medical emergencies or some kind

13:18.300 --> 13:23.300
of other unforeseen accident because I'm self-insuring.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.540
And that's what I'm cutting into with that.

13:25.540 --> 13:27.180
And that's why it matters a lot.

13:27.180 --> 13:29.220
And I got to get it fixed again.

13:29.220 --> 13:31.020
I'm going to try to get this guy to get it right.

13:31.020 --> 13:33.020
But I'm not comfortable continuing to dump money

13:33.020 --> 13:34.740
into this hole for multiple reasons.

13:34.740 --> 13:37.500
So if anybody knows somewhere that really does a great job,

13:37.500 --> 13:39.860
I'm looking into the Vroom slide systems.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.420
But I haven't heard any testimonials

13:41.420 --> 13:43.140
of anybody who's ever tried it.

13:43.140 --> 13:45.460
And my goal is to get this fixed, get it fixed right,

13:45.460 --> 13:47.820
and then get on the road and have a hell of a road trip

13:47.820 --> 13:48.820
and meet up with people.

13:48.820 --> 13:51.060
So I'm appealing to anybody out there who might

13:51.060 --> 13:52.340
have some input or some tips.

13:52.340 --> 13:54.560
I know it's kind of off our normal beaten path here.

13:54.560 --> 13:57.340
But man, it's got me down today.

13:57.340 --> 13:58.540
I'm just in a bad way.

13:58.540 --> 14:00.540
And so it's one of those things, I've

14:00.540 --> 14:02.380
been fighting this thing for five years.

14:02.380 --> 14:04.780
And I'm beyond the point of wanting this solved.

14:04.780 --> 14:08.180
So if you could contact me, chris at jupiterbroadcasting.com,

14:08.180 --> 14:11.580
or on Telegram, chrislass, or on Twitter, chrislass,

14:11.580 --> 14:13.940
you'd be really helping us out.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.980
So thank you, and on with the show.

14:16.980 --> 14:19.980
Because we do have some fantastic community news

14:19.980 --> 14:20.820
this week.

14:20.820 --> 14:23.160
I'll give you a little more time for that arch update, Wes.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.020
This is the announcement I have been

14:25.020 --> 14:27.580
waiting to make on the show for 10 years.

14:27.580 --> 14:29.840
Well, on some show for 10 years.

14:29.840 --> 14:34.140
That is that NVIDIA's beta driver that is currently

14:34.140 --> 14:38.140
available to download, the new 470 series,

14:38.140 --> 14:43.500
has out of the box Wayland support, including xWayland.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.180
It's here.

14:45.180 --> 14:48.860
The first beta driver that makes it possible

14:48.860 --> 14:53.500
to use your full GPU and Wayland at the same time.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.100
They've released a public beta test

14:55.100 --> 14:59.260
of the proprietary driver, which supports hardware acceleration.

14:59.260 --> 15:02.220
This is being brought to us by folks

15:02.220 --> 15:05.420
that have worked with NVIDIA at Red Hat and Fedora Project.

15:05.420 --> 15:08.380
And the Fedora Project is making this announcement today.

15:08.380 --> 15:12.740
Now, you will probably need Fedora or another up-to-date distro

15:12.740 --> 15:16.460
here, because it requires some changes and fixes in xWayland.

15:16.460 --> 15:18.860
But they're already part of the current build shipped

15:18.860 --> 15:20.740
with Fedora 34, of course.

15:20.740 --> 15:22.200
Yeah, other distributions, you're

15:22.200 --> 15:23.780
just going to need to update that stuff.

15:23.780 --> 15:26.700
They're looking for people to help them test this right now.

15:26.700 --> 15:30.180
There's a lot of work that still needs to be done.

15:30.180 --> 15:33.420
So they're asking for people to participate in this.

15:33.420 --> 15:35.820
You also need to reconfigure your GDM display manager

15:35.820 --> 15:37.180
on Fedora, because right now it's

15:37.180 --> 15:39.020
set to automatically disable Wayland when

15:39.020 --> 15:40.500
the NVIDIA driver is loaded.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.980
So you'll have to solve that.

15:41.980 --> 15:43.100
There's some issues, though, Wes.

15:43.100 --> 15:43.980
We got to be honest.

15:43.980 --> 15:45.460
It's not great at this point.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.940
Yeah, if you happen to like running Chromium-based

15:47.940 --> 15:52.020
browsers, yes, including regular old Chrome,

15:52.020 --> 15:54.740
well, there's an issue with Chromium's GPU sandboxing,

15:54.740 --> 15:57.900
which means you just get a blank window,

15:57.900 --> 16:01.380
unless you tack on tech tech disable tech GPU

16:01.380 --> 16:04.060
to the command line, and you can work around that for now.

16:04.060 --> 16:04.980
Not ideal.

16:04.980 --> 16:06.980
Yeah, it's not ideal, no.

16:06.980 --> 16:08.260
And it's not just Chrome.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.180
Applications such as Blender or Steam

16:10.180 --> 16:12.060
sometimes just show a black window.

16:12.060 --> 16:14.060
That's an issue which should be addressed later.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.460
They know about that.

16:15.460 --> 16:18.220
There's also some problems with GTK4 applications just

16:18.220 --> 16:20.900
showing nothing sometimes.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.060
That's also a known issue.

16:22.060 --> 16:23.340
It's already been reported upstream,

16:23.340 --> 16:25.260
but you need to know about it before you're going to use it.

16:25.260 --> 16:26.620
And there's even some Firefox problems.

16:26.620 --> 16:28.300
Yeah, if you thought, OK, well, Chrome's not working.

16:28.300 --> 16:28.780
Great.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.140
What about Firefox?

16:30.140 --> 16:32.580
Now, it turns out there is an issue with EGL here,

16:32.580 --> 16:35.500
and I guess like an ambiguity in the specification.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.380
And Mesa went one way with their interpretation

16:38.380 --> 16:40.060
in this new NVIDIA implementation,

16:40.060 --> 16:41.860
and it goes the other way.

16:41.860 --> 16:46.020
Of course, Firefox web render, it relies on the Mesa version.

16:46.020 --> 16:49.220
So you do have to disable hardware rendering

16:49.220 --> 16:50.580
if you want this to work.

16:50.580 --> 16:52.940
Yeah, it seems like right now there's

16:52.940 --> 16:54.260
going to be a lot of that.

16:54.260 --> 16:56.300
These are just the identified issues.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.900
Yeah, there's even an issue with KDE's Wayland compositor

16:58.900 --> 17:01.980
that also has a problem with full screen GLX applications.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.700
So yeah, it's kind of all over the place.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.620
But this is still a huge improvement,

17:05.620 --> 17:07.100
and these are exactly the kind of issues

17:07.100 --> 17:09.500
that you need to go through this process to get those fixed

17:09.500 --> 17:10.860
and really get it polished.

17:10.860 --> 17:12.860
Yeah, I mean, it's funny, though,

17:12.860 --> 17:15.900
because this has been one of the most anticipated

17:15.900 --> 17:20.740
aspects of Wayland adoption for a really, really long time.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.580
But in the free software world, we

17:22.580 --> 17:25.340
don't get these big onstage splashes

17:25.340 --> 17:27.940
where there's some high-end video

17:27.940 --> 17:30.980
production of some famous executive that comes up

17:30.980 --> 17:33.180
on stage and says, and today we're

17:33.180 --> 17:35.660
enabling Wayland on NVIDIA.

17:35.660 --> 17:37.580
Boom, and a slide drops down.

17:37.580 --> 17:38.780
We don't have that.

17:38.780 --> 17:41.140
We don't have these moments that the tech press then grabs

17:41.140 --> 17:45.180
and says, a fundamental aspect of this transition

17:45.180 --> 17:48.340
has arrived, enabling the future of Wayland.

17:48.340 --> 17:50.140
We don't have that kind of hype cycle

17:50.140 --> 17:52.780
that you'll get when there's something about Windows 11

17:52.780 --> 17:54.860
or something about the Mac.

17:54.860 --> 18:00.940
But these little moments where a Fedora contributor posts

18:00.940 --> 18:05.260
on their mailing list of sorts that, hey, all.

18:05.260 --> 18:06.540
Oliver just says, hi, all.

18:06.540 --> 18:08.300
It's here today in video release.

18:08.300 --> 18:09.820
It's just like this.

18:09.820 --> 18:14.100
It's the most nonchalant, low-key milestone ever,

18:14.100 --> 18:16.540
and yet the ramifications are huge.

18:16.540 --> 18:19.340
And I really encourage people to try it.

18:19.340 --> 18:22.620
I've got an NVIDIA box in here, and if we

18:22.620 --> 18:25.220
re-base on Fedora, I'll absolutely try it at some point.

18:25.220 --> 18:26.580
I only have one NVIDIA box anymore,

18:26.580 --> 18:29.260
because I've so sort of either gone Intel or AMD.

18:29.260 --> 18:30.700
And I imagine a lot of people have

18:30.700 --> 18:32.180
made a lot of those transitions.

18:32.180 --> 18:35.380
So if you have the capability of testing this,

18:35.380 --> 18:36.940
you're kind of a few select.

18:36.940 --> 18:40.500
And so we'll link to the beta display driver.

18:40.500 --> 18:44.580
And we get to celebrate the moment here, quiet and low-key.

18:44.580 --> 18:47.580
But we acknowledge that it's happened, and it's here.

18:47.580 --> 18:51.100
Also, in that same vein, the ButterFS train

18:51.100 --> 18:51.980
chugs right along.

18:51.980 --> 18:54.820
A little steam-powered there.

18:54.820 --> 18:59.260
Fedora Cloud, another spin of Fedora, is adopting ButterFS.

18:59.260 --> 19:00.740
And they've been thinking about this.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.340
We haven't really talked about it yet,

19:02.340 --> 19:05.180
because it was just up for consideration, really.

19:05.180 --> 19:08.100
The idea is that Fedora Cloud installs

19:08.100 --> 19:11.180
will provide ButterFS by default. And then you

19:11.180 --> 19:13.180
could take advantage of transparent compression

19:13.180 --> 19:16.460
on VPSs and other places where you might run Fedora Cloud.

19:16.460 --> 19:18.100
And get snapshots, of course.

19:18.100 --> 19:22.500
Well, today, the code to actually make that transition

19:22.500 --> 19:23.540
was committed.

19:23.540 --> 19:24.500
So it is real.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.820
It's actually happening.

19:25.820 --> 19:29.380
Another spin of Fedora is switching to ButterFS.

19:29.380 --> 19:31.140
In some sense, maybe it seems inevitable.

19:31.140 --> 19:32.060
But I don't know.

19:32.060 --> 19:35.100
This must mean the rollout's going pretty darn well, right?

19:35.100 --> 19:38.980
Yeah, I wouldn't expect it to go much further, though.

19:38.980 --> 19:41.860
And I don't think people should take that as any kind of statement

19:41.860 --> 19:45.700
on the ButterFS traction or results.

19:45.700 --> 19:49.500
Fedora Server and Fedora Core OS are not

19:49.500 --> 19:52.500
built like Fedora Cloud and Fedora Workstation.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.180
And are they kind of off on their own thing?

19:55.180 --> 19:56.980
And I think Fedora Server, probably there's

19:56.980 --> 19:59.420
probably a lot more politically around that with Red Hat.

19:59.420 --> 20:01.220
And Red Hat doesn't necessarily have

20:01.220 --> 20:04.300
customers knocking on their door demanding ButterFS.

20:04.300 --> 20:07.300
And that's kind of what I want to talk about here is, what's

20:07.300 --> 20:09.180
the line, people?

20:09.180 --> 20:11.580
I'm talking to you ButterFS skeptics right now.

20:11.580 --> 20:14.780
I'm sure so many of you actually use ButterFS in production, too.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.980
So you actually have informed opinions.

20:16.980 --> 20:18.100
What's the line?

20:18.100 --> 20:20.900
20,000 Facebook servers running ButterFS?

20:20.900 --> 20:24.340
Very popular distributions using ButterFS by default?

20:24.340 --> 20:28.180
Synology shipping ButterFS on their NASes for a decade?

20:28.180 --> 20:33.980
What's the line when you stop becoming a ButterFS skeptic and you go, oh,

20:33.980 --> 20:35.660
maybe there is something here.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.620
Maybe I should re-evaluate my opinion.

20:37.620 --> 20:40.580
Maybe things in the technology space change.

20:40.580 --> 20:44.300
And when you get developers who have an invested interest to improve a file

20:44.300 --> 20:47.300
system for their production environment, it gets better.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.020
Where's that line at?

20:49.020 --> 20:52.860
Because what I saw a lot of was people scoffing at the story.

20:52.860 --> 20:53.900
Well, I bet they'll switch back.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.940
They're going to regret that.

20:55.940 --> 20:57.420
Lol, ButterFS.

20:57.420 --> 20:58.620
Boy, what a joke.

20:58.620 --> 21:02.580
And I don't care what file system you use.

21:02.580 --> 21:06.020
I use XFS and ButterFS and ZFS interchangeably, really.

21:06.020 --> 21:08.260
Well, not interchangeably, but for different jobs.

21:08.260 --> 21:09.300
I don't care.

21:09.300 --> 21:11.620
I'm not getting paid every time I plug ButterFS or something.

21:11.620 --> 21:12.980
I don't have a stake in it.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.100
But I just intellectually am curious for you.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.380
Where's your damn line?

21:17.380 --> 21:21.660
Because how much success does something have before you're

21:21.660 --> 21:23.060
willing to re-evaluate?

21:23.060 --> 21:26.700
And if you don't have an answer for that, maybe you should consider the fact

21:26.700 --> 21:28.860
that you're being a bit of a jackass about this.

21:28.860 --> 21:34.700
And I'm sick and tired of when we have something great in our community,

21:34.700 --> 21:38.940
the bias against it, for whatever reason, like canonical experiences

21:38.940 --> 21:39.900
constantly as well.

21:39.900 --> 21:43.060
It's like it doesn't matter how great a technology is, like MIR,

21:43.060 --> 21:44.980
which is still around and kicking.

21:44.980 --> 21:48.340
It just never has a shot because of the canonical bias.

21:48.340 --> 21:51.940
And ButterFS is kind of experiencing that same kind of branding.

21:51.940 --> 21:55.580
It's like they've been typecast as a bad file system.

21:55.580 --> 21:58.220
And they'll never be able to play any other role than that because people

21:58.220 --> 21:59.540
have made up their minds.

21:59.540 --> 22:04.260
And I find that so frustrating in a technology community,

22:04.260 --> 22:09.580
in a community specifically of Linux where things are always changing.

22:09.580 --> 22:11.860
Assumptions are always being reversed.

22:11.860 --> 22:16.060
New code and new people with new reasons and new products are always coming

22:16.060 --> 22:18.460
into the free software community and contributing code and

22:18.460 --> 22:20.140
changing the direction of things.

22:20.140 --> 22:22.580
We watch it happen over and over again.

22:22.580 --> 22:25.420
And yet, even when it's happening right in front of us,

22:25.420 --> 22:27.460
some of us can't recognize it.

22:27.460 --> 22:28.660
I find that frustrating.

22:28.660 --> 22:31.580
And I don't mean to get up on a soapbox, but I honestly would like to open up

22:31.580 --> 22:33.420
that conversation a little bit with some of you out there and go,

22:33.420 --> 22:34.820
so where is that line at?

22:34.820 --> 22:36.260
Where's the I'll reconsider?

22:36.260 --> 22:42.780
Lino.com slash unplugged, go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on your new account.

22:42.780 --> 22:44.460
And you support this here show.

22:44.460 --> 22:48.620
It's a way of saying, hey, I heard about that ad there on the unplugged podcast.

22:48.620 --> 22:50.580
And I want those guys to keep doing shows.

22:50.580 --> 22:53.740
Lino.com slash unplugged, our hosting provider, full stop.

22:53.740 --> 22:56.860
I know there's a lot out there every time I go with Linode.

22:56.860 --> 22:59.380
It is in part due to the performance, no doubt about it.

22:59.380 --> 23:00.740
That is always a factor for me.

23:00.740 --> 23:02.660
Linode is screaming fast.

23:02.660 --> 23:05.100
And I like that they have 11 data centers that I can choose from so

23:05.100 --> 23:06.660
I can put something close to you guys.

23:06.660 --> 23:09.260
Or I could put something close to me depending on if an internal thing or

23:09.260 --> 23:10.340
an external thing.

23:10.340 --> 23:12.140
That's obvious, that's great.

23:12.140 --> 23:15.180
But I think when you look at all the different options out there,

23:15.180 --> 23:19.540
I can't just tell you it's the one thing about Linode that has really made me stick.

23:19.540 --> 23:24.100
My transformation with Linode was just curiosity.

23:24.100 --> 23:26.700
Almost two and a half years ago, I just wanted to try them.

23:26.700 --> 23:31.340
Cuz I tried just about everybody else, but I had seen Linode at Linux Fest.

23:31.340 --> 23:33.980
Every year, I had seen Linode at a bunch of events.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.180
They always had a great booth.

23:35.180 --> 23:36.860
They always seemed like really great people.

23:36.860 --> 23:38.660
They always had a smile on their face.

23:38.660 --> 23:42.460
And they were doing this kind of stuff way before anybody else.

23:42.460 --> 23:44.980
They just turned 18 years old this month.

23:44.980 --> 23:47.180
They've been doing this for 18 years.

23:47.180 --> 23:48.300
That's amazing.

23:48.300 --> 23:52.140
And they have used that time to really build the best in virtualized cloud

23:52.140 --> 23:52.900
computing.

23:52.900 --> 23:57.700
And that's why it's not just like, it's like the speed or it's the UI or

23:57.700 --> 23:59.380
the API or the command line client.

23:59.380 --> 24:00.940
It's like everything.

24:00.940 --> 24:05.740
Because when you've been doing something for 18 years, and you focused on that.

24:05.740 --> 24:08.420
They didn't launch all these crazy side businesses and go out and

24:08.420 --> 24:11.220
get a bunch of VC funding and just start dumping on the market.

24:11.220 --> 24:12.940
They built a competitive product.

24:12.940 --> 24:18.540
And then, years into doing it, a decade into doing it, Linode had to pivot and

24:18.540 --> 24:22.940
start competing with every DNS provider that wanted to give hosting.

24:22.940 --> 24:26.420
With every VC backed company that wanted to go out there and

24:26.420 --> 24:30.420
get you to buy their servers at pennies on the cost.

24:30.420 --> 24:34.540
Linode had to pivot and compete with that, but stay independent.

24:34.540 --> 24:39.540
They managed to step up to the plate and exceed what everybody else is doing.

24:39.540 --> 24:43.020
And I can tell you as a long timer now, one of the things I really like about

24:43.020 --> 24:47.460
Linode is just that constant, smooth, improved iteration.

24:47.460 --> 24:51.380
Like in this last year, they rolled out cloud firewalls to everybody.

24:51.380 --> 24:56.700
They have deployed Terraform support, Ansible module support, Kubernetes.

24:56.700 --> 25:01.140
They just have stayed current along the way, without screwing up my workflow.

25:01.140 --> 25:04.780
If I don't wanna use any of that stuff, it's not all in my face.

25:04.780 --> 25:07.580
They've managed to keep the UI clean and usable.

25:07.580 --> 25:10.980
They have a ton of great options from $5 a month rigs,

25:10.980 --> 25:13.300
which are totally, totally screamers.

25:13.300 --> 25:16.500
I mean, for 30 to 50% less than what you get at AWS,

25:16.500 --> 25:18.980
you're gonna get something faster and cheaper, right?

25:18.980 --> 25:22.500
I mean, that's a big deal because it's an ongoing cost.

25:22.500 --> 25:25.860
And so if you can get something 30 or 50% cheaper, and

25:25.860 --> 25:30.780
it's 30 or 50% cheaper every month, plus you get $100 credit just by supporting

25:30.780 --> 25:33.460
this show, there's a lot of value in that.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.100
And then, yeah, it happens to be super great.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.620
The UI happens to be fantastic.

25:36.620 --> 25:41.260
They have fantastic S3 compatible object storage too, check, check, check, check.

25:41.260 --> 25:44.780
This is why we use Linode every single time for our back end stuff, and

25:44.780 --> 25:46.660
for my personal stuff too.

25:46.660 --> 25:48.940
It's a practical thing, and I think you'd really like it.

25:48.940 --> 25:51.780
So go over to linode.com slash unplugged.

25:51.780 --> 25:54.460
Get $100 for your new account and try this stuff out.

25:54.460 --> 25:57.820
Build something, learn something, deploy something.

25:57.820 --> 25:59.460
There are a lot of ways to host things.

25:59.460 --> 26:01.180
There's a lot of various companies, but

26:01.180 --> 26:03.340
none of them are the complete package like Linode.

26:03.340 --> 26:08.300
That's why we choose Linode every single time, linode.com slash unplugged.

26:08.300 --> 26:16.860
Okay, Wes, I bought you some time.

26:16.860 --> 26:18.500
Let's check on that arch update.

26:18.500 --> 26:19.620
How's it going over there?

26:19.620 --> 26:22.380
Well, it's going pretty well so far.

26:22.380 --> 26:26.940
We've made it through the regular packages, and we're on to the AUR updates,

26:26.940 --> 26:33.860
which not only includes updates for the AUR helpers we've got, but also CFSDKMS,

26:33.860 --> 26:35.500
which is building right now.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.580
And this is where it sometimes gets a bit squirrely for us.

26:38.580 --> 26:41.020
You gotta make sure DKMS figures things out right, and

26:41.020 --> 26:43.980
not only builds the modules for the current kernel, but

26:43.980 --> 26:47.900
also that new kernel we're gonna be rebooting into, hopefully.

26:47.900 --> 26:50.540
Okay, all right, so we're not done yet.

26:50.540 --> 26:52.340
I'll check back in with you.

26:52.340 --> 26:53.420
That is always the thing.

26:53.420 --> 26:58.620
So I know it will boot back up, because our root partition is ButterFS, and

26:58.620 --> 27:02.140
then our big data storage with all of our disks is ZFS.

27:02.140 --> 27:05.420
This is an example, by the way, of how you can use the two technologies together.

27:05.420 --> 27:07.500
It doesn't have to be mutually exclusive.

27:07.500 --> 27:12.220
And we know that ButterFS root partition will mount, so it will boot.

27:12.220 --> 27:15.420
We just might not have all of our data, and all of our applications may fail.

27:15.420 --> 27:16.060
That's all.

27:16.060 --> 27:18.900
It's just a partial degradation, that's what we'll call it,

27:18.900 --> 27:21.100
once we get one of those status pages anyway.

27:21.100 --> 27:22.500
We will check back in.

27:22.500 --> 27:29.580
You're fighting the good fight there, Wes.

27:29.580 --> 27:31.420
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up.

27:31.420 --> 27:35.980
In the meantime, a little spot of housekeeping here.

27:35.980 --> 27:39.420
Just a reminder, you can go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting to get all of

27:39.420 --> 27:43.540
our meetups that we may do in the future, including the Salt Lake City and Denver 1.

27:43.540 --> 27:45.260
We love your emails and feedback.

27:45.260 --> 27:48.860
Send us those at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

27:48.860 --> 27:54.300
And don't forget about the Love Blog this Sunday, and every Sunday, at noon Pacific,

27:54.300 --> 27:57.340
or whatever that converts to in your local time, we have it on our calendar,

27:57.340 --> 27:59.580
in our Mumble Room, right there in the lobby.

27:59.580 --> 28:03.260
Hang out with like-minded folks, talk Linux, ask questions.

28:03.260 --> 28:06.100
If you've got a project you're working on you'd love to share with the class,

28:06.100 --> 28:07.540
they love that kind of stuff.

28:07.540 --> 28:12.540
You can find out details for our Mumble server at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

28:12.540 --> 28:16.100
You go there, you get it all configured, you join the Love Blog and just hang out.

28:16.100 --> 28:18.940
You participate as much or as little as you choose.

28:18.940 --> 28:20.540
And then, gosh darn it, you know what?

28:20.540 --> 28:22.060
You got your Mumble client set up.

28:22.060 --> 28:24.660
You could join us on a Tuesday if you had a Tuesday off or something.

28:24.660 --> 28:26.860
You wanna come out and hang out with your buddies during the show?

28:26.860 --> 28:31.660
We've got a quiet listening spot where you just get the absolute lowest latency,

28:31.660 --> 28:33.780
high-quality audio feed right there in our Mumble Room,

28:33.780 --> 28:35.780
using a whole free software stack.

28:35.780 --> 28:39.020
Cuz we're on Linux here, Mumble's free software.

28:39.020 --> 28:41.940
You can listen to the show live with almost no latency,

28:41.940 --> 28:45.740
as close as technically possible, in our Mumble Room in the quiet listening.

28:45.740 --> 28:48.180
And then if something piques your interest,

28:48.180 --> 28:51.500
you can pop into the On Air channel and chat with us in the show.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.100
We open it up to anyone in our community as long as you pass the mic check and

28:54.100 --> 28:55.340
stuff like that.

28:55.340 --> 28:58.900
Details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble for that.

28:58.900 --> 29:01.100
And join that Love Blog, it is a great group and

29:01.100 --> 29:04.100
it's every single Sunday, talking Linux.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.060
People just love that kind of stuff.

29:06.060 --> 29:09.860
And I need that personal connection from time to time.

29:09.860 --> 29:13.100
And whenever we can, we pop in there on a Sunday as well.

29:13.100 --> 29:17.580
Linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

29:17.580 --> 29:21.500
Arch update, we've finished our AUR packages.

29:21.500 --> 29:25.140
DKMS modules compiled, I think we're ready to reboot.

29:25.140 --> 29:26.580
Let's do it, Wes.

29:26.580 --> 29:29.500
Let's do it, here, while you do that, I'll bring up the ping.

29:29.500 --> 29:33.660
And then when I see that it's come back up or you see it's come back up,

29:33.660 --> 29:37.100
we can check in and see what the status is.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.300
You get your ping going now so you can see it fail.

29:39.300 --> 29:43.140
In the meantime, can you get the AUR on Ubuntu?

29:43.140 --> 29:44.460
And why would you want that?

29:44.460 --> 29:50.220
And just really briefly, the idea would be some sort of long term stable LTS base.

29:50.220 --> 29:53.740
You have, and maybe this could work on your Ubuntu, your Kubuntu,

29:53.740 --> 29:55.220
maybe even elementary.

29:55.220 --> 29:59.500
Something where you could get a nice, clean, highly compatible,

29:59.500 --> 30:04.460
well supported base, but then get those nice fresh native packages from the AUR.

30:04.460 --> 30:07.340
Telegram and those kinds of things that you just want.

30:07.340 --> 30:11.820
And it could be, perhaps for some, the perfect setup.

30:11.820 --> 30:17.700
We looked out there and found a couple of options for doing this on Ubuntu.

30:17.700 --> 30:20.940
And some of them are actually pretty compelling.

30:20.940 --> 30:25.260
Let's start with Paxtol, Wes, which has maybe got a lot of potential.

30:25.260 --> 30:26.140
It's new, though.

30:26.140 --> 30:27.340
Yeah, it's very new.

30:27.340 --> 30:29.900
This is kind of what started our little journey here,

30:29.900 --> 30:31.700
because it comes with a bold claim.

30:31.700 --> 30:34.900
Paxtol, the AUR for Ubuntu.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.420
And yeah, really, that sounds pretty nice.

30:36.420 --> 30:39.140
Okay, we all love the Ubuntu LTS, super stable.

30:39.140 --> 30:40.340
You know what you're getting.

30:40.340 --> 30:43.340
But sometimes the applications, well, they're not up to date.

30:43.340 --> 30:44.380
Or they're not the latest ones.

30:44.380 --> 30:48.020
Or you have to do something else, like get containers involved, or

30:48.020 --> 30:51.020
virtual machines, or compile stuff yourself.

30:51.020 --> 30:54.100
That's where Paxtol might be something you're interested in.

30:54.100 --> 30:56.860
It's very simple, pretty easy to get started with.

30:56.860 --> 31:01.700
And it's written by a very intrepid 15-year-old specializing in Bash.

31:01.700 --> 31:03.700
Yes, this is just written in Bash.

31:03.700 --> 31:05.660
Yeah, Bash can do the job.

31:05.660 --> 31:07.700
You can do the job with Bash.

31:07.700 --> 31:10.140
And it's got a pretty nice user experience.

31:10.140 --> 31:11.700
It's simple.

31:11.700 --> 31:14.540
And it's kind of limited at the moment,

31:14.540 --> 31:19.100
because they're essentially recreating their own AUR repository.

31:19.100 --> 31:22.140
Yeah, I think the thing we were hoping for when we first started playing with this

31:22.140 --> 31:25.340
was direct access to the existing AUR.

31:25.340 --> 31:29.380
Because look, the AUR is great, but it's not exactly sophisticated, right?

31:29.380 --> 31:31.180
I mean, it's a user repository.

31:31.180 --> 31:33.220
They're all independently maintained.

31:33.220 --> 31:36.580
Make package is pretty cool, but it's not crazy sophisticated.

31:36.580 --> 31:41.620
This is a whole lot simpler to just some bash scripts that kind of help you out,

31:41.620 --> 31:44.700
install some dependencies through apt for you, and that's why it's for Ubuntu.

31:44.700 --> 31:47.620
And then it's got some steps to figure out and run make for you,

31:47.620 --> 31:49.300
whatever compilation steps.

31:49.300 --> 31:52.940
In that way, I think it is very much inspired by the spirit of make package in

31:52.940 --> 31:53.860
the AUR.

31:53.860 --> 31:56.900
It's just a lot less far along right now.

31:56.900 --> 31:59.620
There's only like 50 packages available.

31:59.620 --> 32:01.060
It's not really mature or tested.

32:01.060 --> 32:03.260
I mean, it's just early days.

32:03.260 --> 32:07.020
I think it was started just by the initial author.

32:07.020 --> 32:08.980
But it does seem like there's a small community forming.

32:08.980 --> 32:11.260
You're already seeing more reviews happening, poll requests,

32:11.260 --> 32:12.780
people keeping packages up to date.

32:12.780 --> 32:14.460
So that part's exciting, but

32:14.460 --> 32:17.900
it's a long way from anything you'd ever want to use in production.

32:17.900 --> 32:21.740
And maybe there could be a way to mirror the actual AUR or

32:21.740 --> 32:26.700
say like the top 1,000 packages or top 100 packages from the actual AUR to

32:26.700 --> 32:28.380
their own independent AUR.

32:28.380 --> 32:32.340
And maybe they could do that automatically somehow.

32:32.340 --> 32:35.660
And I would love to see them match their syntax to Pacman syntax.

32:35.660 --> 32:39.460
So it's like the same flags to do package operations and things like that.

32:39.460 --> 32:43.580
But it seems like it's really early, and it's not quite what we were looking for.

32:43.580 --> 32:46.300
But it could have potential for Ubuntu users at some point,

32:46.300 --> 32:48.900
especially if they can shore up some of their security stuff and whatnot.

32:48.900 --> 32:52.340
But we wanted something that is truly using the AUR.

32:52.340 --> 32:57.500
Because the damn beautiful thing about the AUR is that it's just so

32:57.500 --> 32:59.940
well supported by the community around it.

32:59.940 --> 33:04.900
Any wild ass idea you could have for installing some random package,

33:04.900 --> 33:06.220
it's probably on there.

33:06.220 --> 33:11.100
From Windows applications and games that haven't been around in forever,

33:11.100 --> 33:15.340
to your daily drivers like your telegrams and your discords and

33:15.340 --> 33:17.980
your element chats, all in there.

33:17.980 --> 33:22.460
All one package manager, all updated centrally, all native,

33:22.460 --> 33:26.500
no weird loopback mounts and theme issues.

33:26.500 --> 33:30.780
All just beautiful packages that sometimes get built right on your system.

33:30.780 --> 33:33.140
Right, and when they do, that means you're getting them built on top of Arch,

33:33.140 --> 33:35.540
which provides you all the latest stuff.

33:35.540 --> 33:37.020
So you get the fanciest options,

33:37.020 --> 33:40.380
you can enable all the flags at compilation time that you might need to.

33:40.380 --> 33:43.180
It's really quite slick once you've got it all set up.

33:43.180 --> 33:46.700
Which is how we got to MakeDev and MPM and

33:46.700 --> 33:51.660
another set of tools that actually use the real AUR.

33:51.660 --> 33:54.580
And we had mixed results with this, I would say.

33:54.580 --> 33:56.260
You actually did have some success.

33:56.260 --> 34:01.340
Yeah, I got Tilder, which is a Rust implementation of TLDR,

34:01.340 --> 34:05.740
which is a handy program from giving you easy examples that maybe you don't quite

34:05.740 --> 34:09.540
find in the man page, but with a similar spirit.

34:09.540 --> 34:10.980
This was a Rust application,

34:10.980 --> 34:13.940
cuz Chris makes me install Rust applications all the time.

34:13.940 --> 34:15.700
I'm not allowed to install Go apps.

34:15.700 --> 34:19.660
Yeah, that's in your contract, no Go apps, Wes.

34:19.660 --> 34:22.420
It's tough, but I try to work around it.

34:22.420 --> 34:24.420
And okay, so it did work.

34:24.420 --> 34:27.620
I was able to use MakeDev to get this going.

34:27.620 --> 34:28.620
Here's the idea.

34:28.620 --> 34:31.820
Takes those package builds, yes, the real ones from the AUR.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.180
It's even got some nice command line stuff to go search and

34:34.180 --> 34:36.820
find them for you, which is pretty slick.

34:36.820 --> 34:38.100
Downloads them.

34:38.100 --> 34:42.380
And then the idea is they've got this component, MakeDevDB,

34:42.380 --> 34:46.020
that's like a dependency translation layer to go figure out like, all right,

34:46.020 --> 34:48.620
well the package build has these depths listed.

34:48.620 --> 34:52.100
But we need to go get apt dependencies on the Ubuntu system, and

34:52.100 --> 34:52.900
that's gonna be different.

34:52.900 --> 34:55.820
And that's kind of the key here that I think is really early days and

34:55.820 --> 34:57.140
isn't quite totally fleshed out.

34:57.140 --> 35:00.660
Because to get Tldr to actually quite compile completely and

35:00.660 --> 35:05.340
get a deb that worked nicely, I basically had to do dependency resolution myself,

35:05.340 --> 35:08.620
install the stuff it needed, delete the dependencies from the package build, and

35:08.620 --> 35:09.860
then run MakeDev.

35:09.860 --> 35:12.580
Yeah. But after that, it did work.

35:12.580 --> 35:17.860
So I think that means like, in theory, if you could get that mapping from

35:17.860 --> 35:20.500
arch to Ubuntu dependencies actually maintained.

35:20.500 --> 35:23.860
You had a community effort to make that work and test out some packages.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.020
This might just work.

35:25.020 --> 35:29.180
Yeah, what I liked about it too is you could just check out the packages,

35:29.180 --> 35:33.140
pull them down on your local system and build them there, old school style too,

35:33.140 --> 35:34.340
if you wanted to.

35:34.340 --> 35:38.620
Where I could see this working is if you had a fleet of Ubuntu systems, but

35:38.620 --> 35:41.580
you needed access to a couple of specific apps or

35:41.580 --> 35:46.020
versions that are only in something like the AUR, you could use this and

35:46.020 --> 35:48.620
you could support it and maintain it yourself, and you could run that.

35:48.620 --> 35:52.700
So like for us, we could potentially switch to Fedora, as an example,

35:52.700 --> 35:55.740
if you could do this, switch to Fedora or Ubuntu base here in the studio,

35:55.740 --> 35:56.260
something like that.

35:56.260 --> 35:58.980
And then you put this on top of it, theoretically, and

35:58.980 --> 36:00.980
just get those one or two applications you need.

36:00.980 --> 36:05.060
And you don't have to run Arch on the system itself, on the host system.

36:05.060 --> 36:06.900
However, both of those are early days.

36:06.900 --> 36:10.140
So we thought maybe we could look at something a little more universal

36:10.140 --> 36:12.140
that wasn't just targeted at one distribution.

36:12.140 --> 36:15.140
And you can crack this nut with containers.

36:15.140 --> 36:19.060
There are people out there that get X applications running inside a container

36:19.060 --> 36:20.220
and go that route.

36:20.220 --> 36:23.820
And by containers here, we mean like your server side, your docker,

36:23.820 --> 36:24.660
stuff like that.

36:24.660 --> 36:29.700
Yeah, and of course, this would be pretty much a non-existent problem if the world

36:29.700 --> 36:33.580
could just agree on a universal packaging format like app images, flat pack, or

36:33.580 --> 36:35.660
snaps, and then everybody just shipped as that,

36:35.660 --> 36:37.980
because that would actually solve this problem.

36:37.980 --> 36:39.860
But I could also wish that it rains quarters.

36:39.860 --> 36:43.580
Right, like if there was a flat pack for every package in the AUR, like, yeah,

36:43.580 --> 36:44.940
okay, we wouldn't be so concerned.

36:44.940 --> 36:46.300
This wouldn't really be the question cuz, of course,

36:46.300 --> 36:49.020
you just go get the flat pack, that would work.

36:49.020 --> 36:54.420
But right now, I think the AUR still has got the flat hub beat by a mile.

36:54.420 --> 36:58.380
What I do like about the flat pack and container route is that it's not spewing

36:58.380 --> 36:59.780
stuff all over your file system.

36:59.780 --> 37:02.980
Your host box stays nice and clean and fresh.

37:02.980 --> 37:06.540
And that's when we started thinking about, what about Fedora's toolbox,

37:06.540 --> 37:10.180
which spins up these disposable pet containers with just a command?

37:10.180 --> 37:12.260
You don't even really know it's happening.

37:12.260 --> 37:14.920
You just run toolbox and you get a command line.

37:14.920 --> 37:17.100
And it brings all of your user accounts and

37:17.100 --> 37:20.540
your permission settings from your host system into that environment.

37:20.540 --> 37:21.900
And it's totally transparent.

37:21.900 --> 37:24.900
You don't even realize that you're making a mess in a container instead of on your

37:24.900 --> 37:26.020
file system.

37:26.020 --> 37:29.900
But would it be possible to use Fedora's toolbox tool

37:29.900 --> 37:33.340
with another distro besides a RHEL or Fedora distro?

37:33.340 --> 37:37.060
Could you use toolbox with Debian or maybe Arch?

37:37.060 --> 37:38.140
A bold question.

37:38.140 --> 37:41.660
I mean, I played with toolbox a little bit and it really is pretty neat,

37:41.660 --> 37:43.820
especially if you're trying to build some dependencies.

37:43.820 --> 37:46.500
Maybe you're working on packaging something up or playing with container tech.

37:46.500 --> 37:47.860
And yeah, exactly like you say, Chris,

37:47.860 --> 37:51.860
you just don't wanna pollute your actual main desktop system.

37:51.860 --> 37:55.260
But it really is quite optimized for Fedora.

37:55.260 --> 37:57.620
That's all the images that they build for themselves.

37:57.620 --> 38:01.260
That's what it asks you if you wanna go download that image when you first set it

38:01.260 --> 38:03.300
up and get going with it.

38:03.300 --> 38:07.380
But of course, turns out it's powered by OCI images and

38:07.380 --> 38:11.580
Podman under the hood, so you can do basically whatever you want.

38:11.580 --> 38:17.220
Yeah, including building an Arch or Debian image and using that inside toolbox and

38:17.220 --> 38:21.020
just spin up a Debian environment on Fedora or an Arch environment on Fedora.

38:22.140 --> 38:24.500
In just, well, as simple as running a single command.

38:24.500 --> 38:25.540
Did you give it a shot?

38:25.540 --> 38:27.220
Yes, I did.

38:27.220 --> 38:31.260
Now actually, they've added some stuff to the toolbox docs over on GitHub,

38:31.260 --> 38:34.420
detailing what needs to exist in the image.

38:34.420 --> 38:37.340
And for most common things, those are basically just taken care of.

38:37.340 --> 38:41.100
Which Arch, it's a little bit different because it's Arch, it's super minimal.

38:41.100 --> 38:43.420
It doesn't have everything filled out and installed for

38:43.420 --> 38:46.100
you automatically or configured necessarily in Etsy.

38:46.100 --> 38:48.180
So in the past, I know there's been some bugs around like, well,

38:48.180 --> 38:52.580
you needed the local time stuff set up and that's not in the base Arch Docker image.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.420
And there's a few issues like that.

38:54.420 --> 38:56.580
But actually, a lot of that's been resolved.

38:56.580 --> 39:01.420
The one thing I had to do was manually touch Etsy machine ID,

39:01.420 --> 39:05.580
just to get that in because toolbox is gonna mount that in from the host.

39:05.580 --> 39:09.260
But after I did that, I was able to just sort of install the Pacman base packages.

39:09.260 --> 39:11.540
I installed a couple other apps, including Nano,

39:11.540 --> 39:14.940
cuz I wanted to get that fresh, hot Nano 5.8.

39:14.940 --> 39:15.820
Who doesn't, right?

39:15.820 --> 39:16.940
Just gotta have it.

39:16.940 --> 39:21.860
Built it up with a Docker file, or if you're in the Podman world, a container file.

39:22.900 --> 39:28.260
And then yeah, toolbox, when you do toolbox create, it's got a dash image option.

39:28.260 --> 39:32.180
And then you just give it the tag of the name that you built for that image.

39:32.180 --> 39:37.260
It'll create it, and then you run toolbox enter that name, and you're in.

39:37.260 --> 39:38.020
It totally worked.

39:38.020 --> 39:41.500
Now, I haven't gone all the way and tried out complicated stuff with audio and

39:41.500 --> 39:42.220
graphics yet.

39:42.220 --> 39:46.580
This is still early days, but boy, having an easy little Arch toolbox.

39:46.580 --> 39:47.300
Sure.

39:47.300 --> 39:50.740
Anywhere that you can get toolbox running, which is not just Fedora, by the way.

39:50.740 --> 39:52.980
It's packaged in Arch, for instance.

39:52.980 --> 39:54.340
I mean, that sounds great.

39:54.340 --> 39:56.660
Yeah, I love this idea.

39:56.660 --> 39:59.900
You have this fresh, clean Fedora base, or whatever it might be.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.820
Maybe it's CentOS Stream.

40:01.820 --> 40:03.540
I mean, I'm not totally kidding either.

40:03.540 --> 40:07.940
I'm thinking CentOS Stream 9 might make a decent workstation OS.

40:07.940 --> 40:10.260
We'll see, maybe not, but it might.

40:10.260 --> 40:13.160
And then you take something like toolbox, and you have Arch and

40:13.160 --> 40:15.740
Debian user lands that are just in a terminal.

40:15.740 --> 40:18.980
And what you've done is you've kind of created the WSL experience.

40:18.980 --> 40:23.580
The one thing that struck me as a nice thing about WSL

40:23.580 --> 40:27.140
is I could have a distro per terminal tab.

40:27.140 --> 40:31.780
I had Ubuntu, Debian, and OpenSUSE all running simultaneously,

40:31.780 --> 40:33.380
each with their own tab.

40:33.380 --> 40:36.260
And you could replicate that with toolbox.

40:36.260 --> 40:39.380
And it's all in its own container, so you mess it all up and

40:39.380 --> 40:41.260
your host system stays clean.

40:41.260 --> 40:44.860
I freaking love this little toolbox tool.

40:44.860 --> 40:48.060
I bring it up as often as I can because I think it's such a neat idea and

40:48.060 --> 40:53.020
such a nice, practical use of containers in a way that's nearly transparent to

40:53.020 --> 40:54.220
the end user.

40:54.220 --> 40:57.940
And it's a great example of what Linux does that Windows and Mac can't.

40:57.940 --> 40:59.780
And I freaking love that too.

40:59.780 --> 41:02.460
And the fact that it's using Podman underneath is neat cuz that's just cool

41:02.460 --> 41:04.140
technology and all that kind of stuff.

41:04.140 --> 41:06.900
Yeah, that's what's neat about toolbox is really is like we've had all these

41:06.900 --> 41:08.820
primitives kind of like with containers in general, right?

41:08.820 --> 41:10.700
Like we've got all these low flung things, but

41:10.700 --> 41:14.580
especially in the Linux open source world, what really makes it shine is that

41:14.580 --> 41:17.780
folks have put in the work to make the UI and the UX appealing.

41:17.780 --> 41:20.500
I could do all this stuff by hand with Docker or Podman, but

41:20.500 --> 41:23.300
to get it actually adopted and be more useful day to day,

41:23.300 --> 41:25.700
it takes that extra layer of polish, I think.

41:25.700 --> 41:29.700
I'd love to see the Fedora project get to the point where maybe they could

41:29.700 --> 41:33.340
integrate toolbox even further into the desktop and work on those kinds of things.

41:33.340 --> 41:38.380
And maybe even start maintaining a couple of compatibility images like that.

41:38.380 --> 41:42.460
Because it sure is a neat idea and it's a great example of how we can use this

41:42.460 --> 41:45.820
technology if we just connect a few more of these primitives like you're saying.

41:45.820 --> 41:48.740
And yeah, you could wish for everything to get packaged up as a flat pack or

41:48.740 --> 41:51.620
an app image or a snap, but it's never gonna happen.

41:51.620 --> 41:54.780
I mean, that's one of the brilliant things about the AUR is there's just junk

41:54.780 --> 41:57.100
in there that is not gonna get touched by anybody else.

41:57.100 --> 42:00.380
It's some diehard who loves that freaking piece of software and

42:00.380 --> 42:01.580
wants it available.

42:01.580 --> 42:05.660
So he or she is just doing the hard grunt work to get it in the AUR.

42:05.660 --> 42:06.740
And that's why it's there.

42:06.740 --> 42:08.700
Well, and I think it's hit that right balance too, right?

42:08.700 --> 42:11.020
Where you're right, there's a lot of users who are passionate and

42:11.020 --> 42:12.660
have the time and skill to maintain them.

42:12.660 --> 42:15.860
That shouldn't be taken for granted, but it's also simple enough.

42:15.860 --> 42:20.220
There's not a lot of bureaucracy or CLAs to sign or

42:20.220 --> 42:22.660
other hoops to jump through to get it actually packaged and done.

42:22.660 --> 42:24.020
So I think it makes it pretty easy.

42:24.020 --> 42:26.780
There's a low barrier to entry if you actually wanna throw something up in there.

42:26.780 --> 42:29.380
Can be bad, of course, but I think it also makes it really easy for

42:29.380 --> 42:31.660
folks to get started and put whatever they want in there.

42:31.660 --> 42:34.500
Yep, and you could mix and match and have it to your preference.

42:34.500 --> 42:37.100
And I think this could be a, forgive the pun, but

42:37.100 --> 42:39.260
I think it could be a go-to tool for us.

42:39.260 --> 42:41.620
I could see using this frequently.

42:41.620 --> 42:45.940
It could make it possible to have just one base fedora and

42:45.940 --> 42:48.020
then these pets right there in my terminal.

42:48.020 --> 42:54.460
Okay, Wes, I see it's replying to pings.

42:54.460 --> 42:57.420
So the server and the network stack are back up.

42:57.420 --> 43:02.900
The question is, did everything mount and are applications running?

43:02.900 --> 43:06.540
We are 100% back online.

43:06.540 --> 43:07.420
Look at you.

43:07.420 --> 43:12.100
Nicely done, Wes.

43:12.100 --> 43:13.900
You know, I think, I'm not positive.

43:13.900 --> 43:15.460
We should have been keeping track from the beginning, but

43:15.460 --> 43:18.460
I think our success rate is higher than our failure rate.

43:18.460 --> 43:19.740
I think you're right about that.

43:19.740 --> 43:22.740
Maybe we'll have to go back and review the episode sometime.

43:22.740 --> 43:24.340
Now, I will say we did have some issues and

43:24.340 --> 43:28.380
there's still some work we want to do around our existing wire guard stack.

43:28.380 --> 43:30.260
Cuz we're still using subspace.

43:30.260 --> 43:33.300
And last upgrade, two upgrades ago, that kind of bit us.

43:33.300 --> 43:38.260
Because the existing subspace was set up to rely on tools on the host file system.

43:38.260 --> 43:41.660
And it just gets a little weird when you've got one OS kind of borrowing tools.

43:41.660 --> 43:45.100
And of course, the arch one got updated on the host and didn't play nicely.

43:45.100 --> 43:48.500
We were able to update that and kind of better containerize that setup.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.940
But you never know, something might break again.

43:50.940 --> 43:52.100
Yeah, we've got some ideas.

43:52.100 --> 43:56.380
We've been kicking around kind of an update to our wire guard infrastructure and

43:56.380 --> 43:59.660
then kind of capturing the work we do there and relaying that back to you guys.

43:59.660 --> 44:03.340
Because I think there's some cool tools that we could share with the class.

44:03.340 --> 44:05.140
So we'll probably do that soon, I think.

44:05.140 --> 44:07.820
I've got a couple of VPN ideas I'd like to do on the show soon,

44:07.820 --> 44:09.100
as a matter of fact.

44:09.100 --> 44:11.020
So stay tuned, that'll be coming up.

44:11.020 --> 44:14.620
Thank you to our core contributors at unpluggedcore.com.

44:14.620 --> 44:17.380
This episode, the last couple of episodes,

44:17.380 --> 44:19.220
there's not been a sponsor in this spot right now.

44:19.220 --> 44:22.020
This is traditionally where I might mention a previous sponsor we've had right

44:22.020 --> 44:22.540
here.

44:22.540 --> 44:23.300
But there isn't one.

44:23.300 --> 44:26.180
Our members are still making it possible for us to do this show though.

44:26.180 --> 44:27.980
So thank you, I really appreciate it.

44:27.980 --> 44:30.420
And if you would like to become a member and you haven't yet,

44:30.420 --> 44:34.300

us to keep going when we don't have an advertiser in this spot right here.

44:49.260 --> 44:54.860
And it's slow growing, but I could see a day where we are just this.

44:54.860 --> 44:56.620
This is always just the spot of the show.

44:56.620 --> 44:58.500
This half of the show has always been brought to you by our members or

44:58.500 --> 45:00.180
always is brought to you by our members.

45:00.180 --> 45:01.820
We're not there yet, but we're building that way and

45:01.820 --> 45:04.660
we'd love your support at unpluggedcore.com.

Get $1 off the membership and get access to the full live stream, no edits,

45:09.860 --> 45:13.540
all our mistakes and plus the pre and post show, which is like a whole other podcast.

45:13.540 --> 45:18.820
More access to the limited ad feeds, nice, tight, punchy,

45:18.820 --> 45:21.780
and still all the great production quality.

45:21.780 --> 45:24.700
Unpluggedcore.com, thank you to everybody who does that.

45:24.700 --> 45:26.940
We really do appreciate your support, especially right now.

45:26.940 --> 45:31.100
A couple of emails to get to, maybe actually three emails to get to.

45:31.100 --> 45:32.860
Frank writes in with our first one.

45:32.860 --> 45:33.700
Yes, he does.

45:33.700 --> 45:37.540
Frank's been trying Red Hat 6.2, he writes, hi folks.

45:37.540 --> 45:42.740
For nostalgic reasons, I also try to run Red Hat 6.2 in VirtualBox.

45:42.740 --> 45:46.860
Although I managed to install it, I couldn't get X11 to work.

45:46.860 --> 45:50.460
Just kind of the essential part of the experience I was looking for.

45:50.460 --> 45:51.660
How did you actually do it?

45:51.660 --> 45:54.420
You mentioned both bare metal and virtualization.

45:54.420 --> 45:56.820
Was there any magic trick involved?

45:56.820 --> 45:58.140
Thanks, Frank.

45:58.140 --> 45:59.420
Good question, Frank.

45:59.420 --> 46:01.980
You know, it's tricky when you go further back.

46:01.980 --> 46:06.300
6.2 is further back than any of the distros Wes and I tried, and

46:06.300 --> 46:07.540
it's gonna be harder.

46:07.540 --> 46:11.820
But I'm pretty sure I was using just the Visa driver.

46:11.820 --> 46:13.660
It's gonna depend on your virtualization software and

46:13.660 --> 46:16.660
what it presents to the guest.

46:16.660 --> 46:18.620
So there's that combo you gotta get right.

46:18.620 --> 46:20.900
But I'm pretty sure during my setup, I didn't push it.

46:20.900 --> 46:27.180
I recall doing like 1024 by 768 and the Visa driver for each machine.

46:27.180 --> 46:30.580
Whatever, I remember that I had to fiddle with it a little bit.

46:30.580 --> 46:34.820
And then once I got it working on one of them, I just used that same exact

46:34.820 --> 46:39.700
setup for each one of the distros, and that worked for me.

46:39.700 --> 46:42.540
Yeah, you might try, I don't know, I do like VirtualBox, but

46:42.540 --> 46:44.580
it's been a while since I really used it day to day.

46:44.580 --> 46:47.460
So maybe you also give KVM and QEMU a shot.

46:47.460 --> 46:49.020
Maybe you'll have different results.

46:49.020 --> 46:52.340
Joe writes in, and he says, it's always great hearing about the latest

46:52.340 --> 46:55.220
developments on Wayland and Plasma and PipeWire and so on.

46:55.220 --> 46:59.860
However, I think maybe there is a lack of AMD on the show.

46:59.860 --> 47:02.060
I've tried KDE, GNOME, MATE, and XFC, and

47:02.060 --> 47:05.380
all have issues on AMD Ryzen 5 3500U devices.

47:05.380 --> 47:09.620
Hmm, GNOME under X11 has been the most stable thus far, though recently,

47:09.620 --> 47:13.220
a lot of AMD GPU DRM issues have been causing me grief.

47:13.220 --> 47:15.740
I've submitted bug reports to Red Hat's Bugzilla and

47:15.740 --> 47:17.540
GNOME and KDE's different trackers.

47:17.540 --> 47:21.500
And MATE and XFCE issues have also been plaguing me,

47:21.500 --> 47:24.780
including tearing on the XFCE compositor.

47:24.780 --> 47:28.460
Overall, I think it's worth highlighting that while a lot of updates are forward

47:28.460 --> 47:33.100
looking and they're great, maybe a deeper look at AMD hardware could be needed.

47:33.100 --> 47:34.700
Love the show, thanks again, Joe.

47:34.700 --> 47:38.580
That's true, Joe, we don't do a lot of AMD hardware just because of,

47:38.580 --> 47:40.300
we'd have to buy it and costs.

47:40.300 --> 47:44.620
We don't really have a lot of great options either when it comes to laptops.

47:44.620 --> 47:50.740
I did for a good period of time, recently try out the ASUS ROG 14-inch laptop

47:50.740 --> 47:55.940
that has a Ryzen CPU and an AMD GPU and also an NVIDIA RTX in it.

47:55.940 --> 47:58.140
That's quite the setup.

47:58.140 --> 48:02.780
And I have AMD graphics cards in my workstations upstairs and

48:02.780 --> 48:04.940
in some in my machine at home.

48:04.940 --> 48:08.380
So I do have some exposure to it and I actually generally find they work

48:08.380 --> 48:08.940
fantastic.

48:08.940 --> 48:14.620
In fact, it's sort of my baseline, any future system I buy at this point,

48:14.620 --> 48:16.980
although perhaps today's news changes things, but

48:16.980 --> 48:20.420
any future system I buy is gonna have AMD graphics.

48:20.420 --> 48:23.540
I just don't really have an opportunity to buy a lot of Ryzen systems, but

48:23.540 --> 48:26.580
I always keep an eye out and if there is a system we can get in and

48:26.580 --> 48:31.020
do compatibility testing and whatnot, I will jump at that opportunity.

48:31.020 --> 48:34.500
And then in the meantime, I guess we just have to wait for

48:34.500 --> 48:36.660
West to build his huge Ryzen box.

48:36.660 --> 48:40.940
Yeah, maybe as the prices team down, eventually I have been wanting to try

48:40.940 --> 48:45.660
that out because, right, I mean, AMD GPU, we've got this great open source story.

48:45.660 --> 48:49.060
But I think in that it's still kind of early, there's a lot evolving and

48:49.060 --> 48:52.700
of course, as Joe points out, it evolves with the kernel versions too.

48:52.700 --> 48:55.860
So I'd be kind of curious to know a little more about Joe's setup,

48:55.860 --> 48:58.340
if there were any tweaks that he did.

48:58.340 --> 49:00.340
And thank you, Joe, for filing those bugs.

49:00.340 --> 49:01.620
We need those.

49:01.620 --> 49:05.100
I'd also be curious if anyone else out there has either AMD issues or

49:05.100 --> 49:06.820
AMD success stories to share.

49:06.820 --> 49:09.180
Neil, it sounds like you might have a note about AMD issues.

49:09.180 --> 49:13.260
It sounded like the person in question had AMD Ryzen 5000 series,

49:13.260 --> 49:15.940
which is, wow, you're really lucky.

49:15.940 --> 49:19.340
Yep. Because it's been pretty hard to get those, but

49:19.340 --> 49:22.980
it's actually been so hard that none of the distros had access to it.

49:22.980 --> 49:25.620
Red Hat desktop engineering didn't have it,

49:25.620 --> 49:28.260
SUSE engineering didn't have it, nobody had it.

49:28.260 --> 49:32.340
Nobody for Ryzen 5000, nobody for Radeon RX 6000.

49:32.340 --> 49:37.260
Consequently, the drivers are in much worse shape than they would be normally,

49:37.260 --> 49:41.260
because they did not get driver engineering sign off first.

49:41.260 --> 49:46.260
It was a bit of a botched release compared to the previous generations of Ryzen and

49:46.260 --> 49:52.420
Radeon for Linux, where AMD typically sends out hardware samples and

49:52.420 --> 49:55.580
offers engineering resources to Red Hat and

49:55.580 --> 49:59.820
SUSE to make sure that these are all in good shape upstream,

49:59.820 --> 50:02.780
before they're pulled into the respective distributions.

50:02.780 --> 50:04.580
That didn't happen this last cycle, so

50:04.580 --> 50:07.420
the latest hardware has a lot more teething problems,

50:07.420 --> 50:11.140
which is probably going to afflict everyone for a few more months.

50:11.140 --> 50:13.500
I think that's gonna kind of wind down and

50:13.500 --> 50:18.660
stop being an issue with the kernels coming out towards the end of this year.

50:18.660 --> 50:22.060
I mean, I've certainly heard from other folks in the Fedora community that things

50:22.060 --> 50:25.700
have started settling down with the latest kernels that we pushed out.

50:25.700 --> 50:29.580
So take it for what it's worth, but sorry.

50:29.580 --> 50:36.500
Blame AMD for not actually following the normal process this last cycle.

50:36.500 --> 50:39.300
I don't know what their reasoning was, but it wasn't good.

50:39.300 --> 50:40.700
And good to know.

50:40.700 --> 50:41.900
Thank you, Neil.

50:41.900 --> 50:46.580
Moving right along, Austin wrote in, hey guys, love the show and all the work you do.

50:47.580 --> 50:50.220
Day to day, I work in a Windows environment, but

50:50.220 --> 50:54.780
I am able to use Linux from time to time for certain tasks.

50:54.780 --> 50:59.780
One task is safely exploring phishing and malicious links that hit our company.

50:59.780 --> 51:04.580
Now, to safely do this, I've created a Docker container, installed Firefox, and

51:04.580 --> 51:07.660
pasted the links into this Docker Firefox browser.

51:07.660 --> 51:11.700
What are your thoughts on this type of security containerization?

51:11.700 --> 51:15.300
And am I actually as safe as I think I am by doing it this way?

51:15.300 --> 51:17.900
Have you ever tried something like this before?

51:17.900 --> 51:19.500
Thanks in advance.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.540
You're probably fine here, Austin.

51:21.540 --> 51:26.180
I am curious though, this seems like, by default, the job for a VM here.

51:26.180 --> 51:28.700
I mean, then you really know you've got true isolation there.

51:28.700 --> 51:30.500
Yeah, I think that's the way I would do it too.

51:30.500 --> 51:32.860
I mean, there's container security has come a long way.

51:32.860 --> 51:36.700
But I also think the state of the art means you need to be a little more

51:36.700 --> 51:38.420
involved, using some more tools.

51:38.420 --> 51:40.980
Do you have stuff like SC Linux or App Armor?

51:40.980 --> 51:44.100
Do you have sec comp style filtering enabled?

51:44.100 --> 51:47.580
Just using a virtual machine, I think, gets you in a lot better default place.

51:47.580 --> 51:50.660
And it gives you more easy options for trying different kernels and

51:50.660 --> 51:53.500
operating systems if you need to get into that level of detail.

51:53.500 --> 51:56.740
Or maybe you wanna spin up some Windows VMs to see how the links perform over

51:56.740 --> 51:57.940
there.

51:57.940 --> 52:00.580
That's a great point, is if you're using virtual machines,

52:00.580 --> 52:02.540
you could just go destroy a couple of Windows installs and

52:02.540 --> 52:04.180
find out what happens and document it.

52:04.180 --> 52:05.740
Yeah, and you feel better afterwards.

52:05.740 --> 52:07.220
It's like bashing a printer.

52:07.220 --> 52:08.900
Just make sure you don't connect it to your main network.

52:08.900 --> 52:12.260
Maybe have it on its own private network once you get the malware package

52:12.260 --> 52:13.180
downloaded.

52:13.180 --> 52:15.180
I think you're probably fine, but Wes makes a good point.

52:15.180 --> 52:18.340
What Wes is really saying here is, for this type of setup, Austin,

52:18.340 --> 52:20.380
it's not just one thing.

52:20.380 --> 52:23.100
It's not just you're using Firefox in a container.

52:23.100 --> 52:26.380
In that case, it's gonna be you're actually securing the entire system.

52:26.380 --> 52:28.500
You're taking a holistic approach to security on that box,

52:28.500 --> 52:31.140
including some sort of mandatory access control.

52:31.140 --> 52:33.060
And you're doing proper permissions provisioning, and

52:33.060 --> 52:36.580
you're not running things like the Docker instances as root.

52:36.580 --> 52:41.820
And you're doing things at a higher level to protect the overall system.

52:41.820 --> 52:44.500
You're likely gonna be totally fine in that scenario.

52:44.500 --> 52:47.660
I think you could feel a lot more confident if you used virtualization.

52:47.660 --> 52:51.060
And I'm just gonna mention, this is maybe a great opportunity to play around with

52:51.060 --> 52:55.580
something like cubes and see if cubes could help even more.

52:55.580 --> 52:58.780
Could be like a tool set for doing this kind of testing.

52:58.780 --> 53:00.460
Maybe not, it might be too much.

53:00.460 --> 53:03.020
But I definitely recommend, it's a great Linux distribution.

53:03.020 --> 53:06.500
Check out cubes to see if maybe that could take your game to the next level.

53:06.500 --> 53:09.060
And in the meantime, keep doing what you're doing, but

53:09.060 --> 53:10.900
just make sure you're secure all around.

53:10.900 --> 53:14.620
I think there's probably not nearly the kind of risk as, say,

53:14.620 --> 53:19.020
installing Windows on a physical host and using that as a burner.

53:19.020 --> 53:22.980
Because my main concern there would be something jumps to the network.

53:22.980 --> 53:24.620
And that could get dangerous.

53:24.620 --> 53:28.220
Exactly, yeah, regardless of how you do this, you're gonna wanna isolate it.

53:28.220 --> 53:30.380
Yep, yep, very good, very good.

53:30.380 --> 53:34.660
If you'd like to send us an email, we'd love it, linuxunplugged.com contact.

53:34.660 --> 53:38.860
You could also do the Twitter thing, if that's your jam, at linuxunplugged.

53:38.860 --> 53:43.060
The network is at jupitersignal, and the entire network of fantastic podcasts,

53:43.060 --> 53:47.620
cuz there's a whole lot more, over at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

53:47.620 --> 53:52.020
That self-hosted podcast is sneaking up on its 50th episode,

53:52.020 --> 53:55.460
which is a nice milestone, nice and round milestone.

53:55.460 --> 53:56.180
Hey. I'm trying to think,

53:56.180 --> 53:59.940
maybe if I wanna do a swag item, I haven't really decided yet.

53:59.940 --> 54:03.060
So I may do that, so check out the self-hosted podcast,

54:03.060 --> 54:04.860
if you haven't in a while, that's a great podcast.

54:04.860 --> 54:07.700
And of course, if you're not getting your Linux action news fix,

54:07.700 --> 54:10.380
then you're missing out on the things going on in the open source world.

54:10.380 --> 54:12.940
So check out linuxactionnews.com.

54:12.940 --> 54:15.460
And then we'd love to have you back here on a Tuesday, if you'd like to join us for

54:15.460 --> 54:20.060
a live show, we do it every Tuesday at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

54:20.060 --> 54:24.060
See you next week, same bat time, same bat station.

54:24.060 --> 54:27.220
Go say hi to Wes Payne, he's on Twitter, at Wes Payne.

54:27.220 --> 54:28.220
Darn right.

54:28.220 --> 54:31.220
I'm on there, it's true, at Chris Lass.

54:31.220 --> 54:35.540
At Jupiter Signal is the whole network, and the podcast is at Linux Unplugged.

54:35.540 --> 54:39.500
Links to everything we talked about today are in the show notes at linuxunplugged.com

54:39.500 --> 54:42.020
slash 411.

54:42.020 --> 54:45.460
And check out our meetups, we wanna know if you're gonna meet up with us.

54:45.460 --> 54:51.260
It's hot right now, but picture a nice cool beverage hanging out with your Linux buddies.

54:51.260 --> 54:53.660
Go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

54:53.660 --> 54:57.620
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of Your Unplugged Program.

54:57.620 --> 55:26.580
And we will see you right back here next Tuesday!

55:27.620 --> 55:43.900
JBtitles.com, let's go boat.

55:43.900 --> 55:48.180
Bypen, I know you wanted to mention something on the GPU discussion, but we had to move

55:48.180 --> 55:51.020
on, so I wanted to just give you a chance to follow up before we wrap up.

55:51.020 --> 55:56.340
Yeah, so maybe you heard about China cracking down on the Bitcoin farms and other crypto

55:56.340 --> 55:57.340
farms.

55:57.340 --> 56:02.660
So, what will happen when all those farms shut down and dump their cards on the market?

56:02.660 --> 56:03.660
I was wondering that too.

56:03.660 --> 56:06.760
Are we gonna see like the prices drop on the used market?

56:06.760 --> 56:12.880
Because if those prices drop enough, even if they're used, the scalpers also need to

56:12.880 --> 56:16.300
drop their prices and eventually even shops.

56:16.300 --> 56:20.380
And also, I saw an AMD card already drop prices.

56:20.380 --> 56:24.060
It was also mentioned in the news that some cards are dropping prices.

56:24.060 --> 56:26.160
Oh, that is really good news.

56:26.160 --> 56:30.580
My only concern there would be that the miners in China were using ASICs or dedicated, but

56:30.580 --> 56:32.260
I'm sure there's some GPU usage.

56:32.260 --> 56:33.940
I'm ready for those prices to drop.

56:33.940 --> 56:37.900
The fact that the Yakuza was smuggling GPUs says enough.

56:37.900 --> 56:41.080
Oh my god, really the Yakuza?

56:41.080 --> 56:43.100
Some of their shipments were caught with boats.

56:43.100 --> 56:44.100
Wow.

56:44.100 --> 56:56.940
I bet they're big gamers over there.
