This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 15, for November 19th, 2013.

00:30.000 --> 00:40.600
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's applying

00:40.600 --> 00:46.000
all its updates before we do our online banking every single week. My name is Chris.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Matt.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Hey Matt, welcome to Episode 15, buddy.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
Thanks for having me.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.000
Now, I might not be, um, I might not be giving the whole situation enough of its due, but

00:55.000 --> 00:59.480
I felt like that line right there was all we needed to say about this whole mint canonical

00:59.480 --> 01:02.000
controversy that erupted over the last couple of days.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
No kidding.

01:03.000 --> 01:08.920
You and I, here we go. We put out a nice Linux action show talking about OpenSUSE 13.1. Meanwhile,

01:08.920 --> 01:13.600
the whole interwebs blows up because somebody three weeks ago on a mailing list said something

01:13.600 --> 01:16.920
and then some other blog picks that up and then Slashdot picks it up and then it goes

01:16.920 --> 01:17.920
crazy, Matt.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.040
Well, it's almost like someone peed someone's Cheerios. I mean, really, it's like, come

01:21.040 --> 01:22.040
on people.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.040
That actually would have been more newsworthy.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.320
It would have been, right.

01:24.320 --> 01:28.720
That would have been a more interesting topic. Uh, so, you know, this week, this week, it's

01:28.720 --> 01:32.880
interesting. I, every now and then I'm a bit of a slow man and it takes me a while to realize

01:32.880 --> 01:36.920
that there's trends that happen in my inbox. We get lots of email from the Linux action

01:36.920 --> 01:42.560
show and now this show as well. And a lot of new users that are looking to switch over

01:42.560 --> 01:46.080
to Linux and trying to, trying to do their investigation, right? Trying to suss out the

01:46.080 --> 01:50.800
situation before they move over, they'll tune into the Linux action show, watch our how

01:50.800 --> 01:55.600
tos, watch, watch the news, just kind of get a feel for it, which totally makes sense because

01:55.600 --> 02:01.240
if I was switching to Linux back in the day when podcasts, there weren't any podcasts

02:01.240 --> 02:05.800
really. I mean, I think there was some podcasts, but there wasn't really any major Linux podcasts

02:05.800 --> 02:09.600
and I would have totally loved that. So it totally makes sense. But what I, what I failed

02:09.600 --> 02:15.640
to really notice is we've been getting a lot of emails about people switching from Windows

02:15.640 --> 02:20.820
to Linux and for a lot of the reasons you might suspect, but there's a catch. The switching

02:20.820 --> 02:22.320
is not going very well.

02:22.320 --> 02:26.720
No, no. There's definitely some bumps in the road, some hurdles along the way and whatnot.

02:26.720 --> 02:31.180
Yeah. And, and some people are, are, um, I think sometimes they're sold a bit of, a bit

02:31.180 --> 02:35.520
of bag of goods as it were. And they're kind of told all switch one-to-one replacements

02:35.520 --> 02:39.600
for your applications, stability, security, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then they

02:39.600 --> 02:45.100
switch over and they're in, they ended up maybe a little disappointed or something doesn't

02:45.100 --> 02:49.080
work the way they want. They end up in the end disenfranchised and they go back to their

02:49.080 --> 02:52.360
Windows and they huddle down and they stay there even longer. And they say, well, I'll

02:52.360 --> 02:56.240
just live it out. I'll just make it work over here on Windows. And so this week we're going

02:56.240 --> 02:59.760
to pull in our mumble room. That's our online Linux users group. Matt and I are going to

02:59.760 --> 03:03.680
kick around as long time Linux users and people who've, you know, run multiple OSs and helped

03:03.680 --> 03:05.360
lots of people switch over to Linux.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.360
Oh yeah.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.200
I want to just, you know, we're just going to have a frank discussion about the legitimate

03:09.200 --> 03:13.280
downsides. If you are a full fledged alternative operating system user and you're going to

03:13.280 --> 03:17.240
move over to Linux, there's some things that might not go very smooth. And I don't feel

03:17.240 --> 03:20.960
like there's enough places out there that are talking about that stuff, frankly.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.680
That's true. Actually, you know, I think you nailed the nailed it on the head there because

03:23.680 --> 03:27.920
I think the big piece of it with any distribution out there, especially the ones targeting newbies

03:27.920 --> 03:31.760
because they're the worst offenders and that they have this great experience waiting for

03:31.760 --> 03:37.800
people. But there's things that folks need to be aware of and it's not always attractive

03:37.800 --> 03:41.560
from a visual standpoint or even from an experience standpoint to spend a lot of time talking

03:41.560 --> 03:45.520
about it because then you're detracting from the value of that particular decision. And

03:45.520 --> 03:48.080
that's where it gets funky for. And I can see where they're coming from, but still.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.040
It is hard. It is hard. You know what? Essentially what you're saying is that sometimes it's

03:51.040 --> 03:52.840
hard to talk about this kind of stuff.

03:52.840 --> 03:53.840
It is.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.720
Because, I don't know, you know, you got a little skin in the game.

03:56.720 --> 04:00.000
I mean, we can talk about it, but at the same time, I think if I'm running, you know, Jim

04:00.000 --> 04:05.000
Bob's, you know, virtual Linux thing or whatever it is and they're trying to switch to my distro,

04:05.000 --> 04:08.360
I'm a little gun shy about saying, oh, hey, by the way, here's a list of things that might

04:08.360 --> 04:10.880
stop you. That's a funky spot to be.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.840
Well, and I'll be honest, I'm a Linux advocate, right? So I like talking about all of the

04:14.840 --> 04:18.760
stuff Linux does really well, right? And all the stuff that's really cool in Linux. I don't

04:18.760 --> 04:22.480
like to so much talk. I don't even like to focus on the stuff it does really bad. So

04:22.480 --> 04:27.560
I've brought a third co-host to the show this week. His name is Woodinville Whiskey Bourbon.

04:27.560 --> 04:37.280
And actually, I figured I picked up this bourbon whiskey from, you know, the alcohol store,

04:37.280 --> 04:42.040
whatever you call it. And it is a local brew. Micro Barreled, they call it, Matt. Have you

04:42.040 --> 04:43.040
ever heard of that?

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
Micro Barreled.

04:44.040 --> 04:48.600
This is batch number eight and bottle 115 handwritten on the bottle too, I might add.

04:48.600 --> 04:52.240
I mean, I lived in a state with drive through liquor stores once, but I've not experienced

04:52.240 --> 04:53.240
a Micro Barreled.

04:53.240 --> 04:54.240
So, wow.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.040
I mean, you know, for when you're too drunk to get out of your car.

04:57.040 --> 05:01.640
Yeah, right. Yeah. This is crafted entirely by hand in a small batches and aged to maturity

05:01.640 --> 05:06.880
in a new charred American oak barrel. The demanding process results in extremely rich

05:06.880 --> 05:11.000
and full bodied bourbon whiskey. So I'm going to be drinking that today to help bring out

05:11.000 --> 05:13.920
the honesty. That'll be my, that's my honesty gateway this week.

05:13.920 --> 05:14.920
That works. That works.

05:14.920 --> 05:18.800
Still fighting through some of the tech issues we talked about last week on the show. I feel

05:18.800 --> 05:24.920
like I actually haven't really solved any of them, but I've learned like the new way

05:24.920 --> 05:30.680
to mitigate them to just create a new normal, which is a lot more work, takes about 45 minutes

05:30.680 --> 05:34.880
more, which I've whittled down from two hours. It takes about 45 minutes per show. I'm going

05:34.880 --> 05:38.240
to do some more work tonight. So there's not going to be a live side by tonight, but it'll

05:38.240 --> 05:42.440
be on her, she's going to do a hangout on her Google Plus page if you search for Heather

05:42.440 --> 05:43.600
on Google Plus.

05:43.600 --> 05:48.680
So you know, still going through a lot of, a lot of troubleshooting there. Had some great

05:48.680 --> 05:52.120
suggestions from folks that have heard of different solutions to try it on Linux. You

05:52.120 --> 05:57.160
know, all of them I've heard of so far, but I still love getting those because you know,

05:57.160 --> 06:00.640
if I could do, if I could do the bulk of this on Linux, man, even if I had to do a bunch

06:00.640 --> 06:02.400
of work at this point, I'm already doing a whole bunch of work.

06:02.400 --> 06:07.320
So exactly. There may be that eventual update to where, you know, blurb comes out and you're

06:07.320 --> 06:08.680
like, oh hey, that wasn't there before.

06:08.680 --> 06:11.800
You know what, they just released an update today. I haven't tried it obviously cause

06:11.800 --> 06:14.360
I didn't want to mess with the show, but I'm going to install it tonight. So we'll see

06:14.360 --> 06:15.360
how it goes.

06:15.360 --> 06:19.640
All right. Well I wanted to, I wanted to get to some emails. We like to do the, we like

06:19.640 --> 06:22.760
to do some followup emails that are sort of continuing threads that we've had in previous

06:22.760 --> 06:26.820
shows here at the top of Unplugged. That way every show is, we're not like Star Trek here

06:26.820 --> 06:31.120
on Unplugged and I love me some Star Trek, but Star Trek did the monster of the week

06:31.120 --> 06:35.280
and that way they could syndicate. We don't have, we don't have those pressures here on

06:35.280 --> 06:39.820
the Unplugged show. We like to do a continuing thread. So the Unplugged show is an evolving

06:39.820 --> 06:43.960
storyline that takes place across a whole series of episodes. That way we make you listen

06:43.960 --> 06:50.360
to all of them. And so going back a ways in our threads is OwnCloud. We talked about OwnCloud

06:50.360 --> 06:55.280
a lot. Big OwnCloud fan. I don't actually have an OwnCloud installation in production

06:55.280 --> 06:57.840
cause I'm kind of waiting for a few things to kind of work themselves out, waiting for

06:57.840 --> 07:02.400
the next version. However, I know a lot of you out there have it and we also have the

07:02.400 --> 07:07.800
JB Cloud that people are experimenting with. So Richard wrote in and this one was a little

07:07.800 --> 07:12.240
bit of a warning to any of you running your OwnCloud installation on an SSD with Trim

07:12.240 --> 07:16.040
enabled. He said, I had an existing home server running an established OwnCloud setup with

07:16.040 --> 07:22.640
a laptop running an OwnCloud client on my SSD. I upgraded my home server to Mint 15,

07:22.640 --> 07:28.240
reformatted my drives and did a full reinstall of everything including OwnCloud. No issues.

07:28.240 --> 07:32.280
On my laptop client, I tried to reestablish the OwnCloud sync and push my files back up

07:32.280 --> 07:36.120
to the server. It briefly showed a screen with two options, which I seem to remember

07:36.120 --> 07:40.920
asking which way to sync. It defaulted to the one where the local files would push to

07:40.920 --> 07:44.840
the server. The other option had a warning about data loss. Since I defaulted to the

07:44.840 --> 07:51.120
right value, I clicked next. I sat back with a smile thinking that was easy until I got

07:51.120 --> 07:52.120
a notification.

07:52.120 --> 07:57.480
That's your first mistake right there is you sat back, you got all cocky, your big old

07:57.480 --> 07:58.960
smile and you thought that was easy.

07:58.960 --> 08:04.760
Pulled the staples right there. All right. Until I got a notification that it was unable

08:04.760 --> 08:10.000
to delete a file that I was editing. What the F, he said. I quickly looked at my document

08:10.000 --> 08:16.840
structure and it was gone. It synced my laptop to match the empty OwnCloud installation.

08:16.840 --> 08:20.880
Even if I did pick the wrong option, would a are you sure you want to do this prompt

08:20.880 --> 08:25.280
have been that hard? He's a little burned there. He said, I killed the power and booted

08:25.280 --> 08:29.680
up on a live disk and proceeded to try to get the data back. I had all my favorite go

08:29.680 --> 08:34.800
tos for the data recovery, such as test disk said it was unrecoverable. Then as I dug deeper

08:34.800 --> 08:40.080
with Google's researching, undelete on extended for became clear. SSD with trim support means

08:40.080 --> 08:42.920
deleted files are unrecoverable.

08:42.920 --> 08:46.660
While this isn't a little side effect ever talked about and why isn't this ever talked

08:46.660 --> 08:51.560
about in SSD conversations. I've never heard of this fact stated in last or text out discussions

08:51.560 --> 08:55.520
with SSDs either. I would have have been a little more careful had I known this when

08:55.520 --> 08:59.400
I switched to SSDs. I was using OwnCloud with its versioning as a backup strategy for

08:59.400 --> 09:04.600
documents not safe for Dropbox, consulting documents, uh-huh, and accepted some short

09:04.600 --> 09:08.440
term risk to rebuild the server knowing that I had another copy on the laptop. This is

09:08.440 --> 09:13.240
exactly why the data must reside in three locations or else it doesn't exist. Two is

09:13.240 --> 09:17.420
not enough. I had an older outdated backup on a Windows home server share, but about

09:17.420 --> 09:22.000
two months of documents that were not safe to sync to Dropbox were lost. Please remind

09:22.000 --> 09:27.440
users that switching SSD means you lose the option of data recovery undelete with them.

09:27.440 --> 09:32.680
And you know, Richard, I've also heard the opposite side of that where because the way

09:32.680 --> 09:37.800
an SSD can kind of randomize the way it writes to a file, to a disk, in some cases when you

09:37.800 --> 09:42.380
try to do like an overwrite, sometimes it doesn't necessarily overwrite all the files.

09:42.380 --> 09:45.960
So we're still kind of learning really some of the challenges of SSDs because not everybody

09:45.960 --> 09:50.160
switched over yet. So they don't have the mass adoption that, you know, a spinning disk

09:50.160 --> 09:51.160
does.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.160
That's true.

09:52.160 --> 09:58.480
But this is a hard thing because like you want to have the master authority generally

09:58.480 --> 10:03.540
be the central server. That's generally how you avoid all these sync conflicts.

10:03.540 --> 10:07.800
But at the same time, and this of course there's exceptions to this rule, large media files,

10:07.800 --> 10:11.920
things like that obviously are in limit. But for the most part, you know, they were talking

10:11.920 --> 10:16.400
about backing up in three locations. One of those three locations needs to be offsite,

10:16.400 --> 10:20.720
whether that's physically in a physical drive in another location or in the cloud or whatever

10:20.720 --> 10:24.000
you're comfortable with. But, you know, for something like this to happen, that's kind

10:24.000 --> 10:25.120
of the whole thing of it.

10:25.120 --> 10:30.600
As far as something like this happening, yeah, I think that we need more SSD action taking

10:30.600 --> 10:33.520
place out there so we can kind of gauge what other little surprises are out there.

10:33.520 --> 10:38.360
Yeah, and this is stuff we'll hit. You know, I'm pretty much all SSDs these days as I can.

10:38.360 --> 10:42.400
And so I'll experiment more with this. You know, his point is well taken. And this is

10:42.400 --> 10:45.980
why I've – so here's – we had an email this week. So Chris, you know, you talked

10:45.980 --> 10:49.520
about your backups but you'd never really said what you've landed on.

10:49.520 --> 10:54.520
And I really haven't landed on a good one except for anything that's important I store

10:54.520 --> 10:58.560
in either BitTorrent Sync or directly on my Synology. Now, if I put it in BitTorrent Sync,

10:58.560 --> 11:02.680
it syncs to my Synology. And then everything that's in this important data area on my

11:02.680 --> 11:08.400
Synology NAS goes to Spyderoak. And that's how I'm doing my back – I'm not doing

11:08.400 --> 11:14.120
like nightly backups on my laptop, right? I just don't – I don't have time. And

11:14.120 --> 11:17.740
to be completely honest, setting up a new installation is kind of like playing a video

11:17.740 --> 11:21.700
game for me. So, you know, if I got to set aside an evening and stay up super late and

11:21.700 --> 11:26.240
have a few too many drinks to get my KDE configuration rocking, that's a sacrifice I'm willing

11:26.240 --> 11:31.320
to take. So then it's just a matter of moving my data back in. And, you know, to his point,

11:31.320 --> 11:33.480
you got to have multiple copies.

11:33.480 --> 11:42.560
And I want to go back to one point in his email. Mint on a server, that's a bad time.

11:42.560 --> 11:47.260
I can't even fathom that. I'm not sure I understand what the – what the advantage

11:47.260 --> 11:48.260
would be.

11:48.260 --> 11:49.260
I'm not sure either.

11:49.260 --> 11:50.260
On the desktop, okay, arguably that's fine.

11:50.260 --> 11:51.260
Maybe it's also a desktop?

11:51.260 --> 11:52.260
Yeah, that could be.

11:52.260 --> 11:57.280
Maybe it's doing dual duty or something? Because otherwise, go Ubuntu LTS, if you like

11:57.280 --> 12:05.480
the Ubuntu underlying system, go Debian, go Cent, whatever. I like Mint, but, you know,

12:05.480 --> 12:08.840
the inherent disadvantage that Mint's always going to have – and Lunteli changed this

12:08.840 --> 12:12.160
– is you need to reinstall to go to the next version. And eventually, if you want

12:12.160 --> 12:15.040
to get security updates, you're going to have to reinstall. And this is the problem

12:15.040 --> 12:20.920
with reloading servers. You know, my approach to a server installation is I'm really hands

12:20.920 --> 12:25.600
off as much as I can be. And that kind of plays into the whole stability thing.

12:25.600 --> 12:28.680
But sorry to hear about that, Richard. I wanted to pass that along to folks out there. You

12:28.680 --> 12:31.520
know, just be careful when you're doing that kind of stuff. It's –

12:31.520 --> 12:34.880
And I agree with him, though, on the whole being prompted. I mean, I totally am on board

12:34.880 --> 12:37.840
with that, that you should be prompted for something like that. I mean, it's kind of

12:37.840 --> 12:38.840
a –

12:38.840 --> 12:42.840
Yeah. I feel like the old cloud desktop program is still early days a little bit. And it just

12:42.840 --> 12:47.920
doesn't have the deployment level that Dropbox does. So it – you know, things like that

12:47.920 --> 12:52.720
just don't get quite as – identified as much, I guess. So yeah. Bummer, Richard.

12:52.720 --> 12:57.000
All right. Well, next email comes in from Tim. And he's positive in the pragmatic dimension.

12:57.000 --> 13:02.000
Pulling off of last week's title, he said, I hear you guys. I believe in support free

13:02.000 --> 13:06.420
software. However, there is a lot in my life I have to get done and a lot of people who

13:06.420 --> 13:09.920
depend on me and I will use whatever tools available to get it done.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.440
And I remember last week we were saying, even as Linux advocates, we can understand how

13:13.440 --> 13:17.000
sometimes there's reasons not to use Linux if an application you just got to have –

13:17.000 --> 13:18.000
Right.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.960
You got to have it. So he says, I'm beholden to Windows for work. Proprietary software

13:21.960 --> 13:26.360
enterprise applications I have to access and use from home. Yet, I have a free NAS box,

13:26.360 --> 13:31.960
an Ubuntu server, a Roku and a digital ocean droplet for a VPN as well as an Android tablet.

13:31.960 --> 13:35.800
Not to mention a laptop with whatever distro I'm currently learning about. But again,

13:35.800 --> 13:40.760
I have an iPhone from work and I use Windows for my sCrypt miners. It's an economic decision.

13:40.760 --> 13:44.420
I could get better hash rates in plain and simple. And I've noticed this too, sCrypt

13:44.420 --> 13:50.920
and also mining Bitcoin, it is much easier to get up and running under Windows. I actually

13:50.920 --> 13:54.000
haven't noticed better hash rates under Windows, but it is easier to get running under

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Windows.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.920
He said, I may get bashed by free software proponents, but this is the world I live in

13:57.920 --> 14:01.200
and I got to get it done every day. Cheers, Tim.

14:01.200 --> 14:05.200
I think he's basically looking at this as there's effective behavior and then there's

14:05.200 --> 14:09.000
ineffective behavior. And that really removes the argument of, well, you can't do it because

14:09.000 --> 14:12.120
that's just not supporting blankety blank. At the end of the day, you have to decide

14:12.120 --> 14:15.680
what's going to provide the most effective outcome that you're seeking. And for him,

14:15.680 --> 14:16.680
that's what's working.

14:16.680 --> 14:26.040
Yeah, I think so. I think so. We got an email about switching over to Linux and we got a

14:26.040 --> 14:32.340
lot of these and one of them was quite long. And so I want to read his email to set us

14:32.340 --> 14:38.000
up and kind of set the tone of the discussion because we've talked before about switching

14:38.000 --> 14:41.480
to Linux from primarily Windows. I think maybe now we should start talking about switching

14:41.480 --> 14:46.620
from Mac too, because I think there's more and more Macs out there. And I think a lot

14:46.620 --> 14:49.280
of times the way we've kind of just come out and say, yeah, it's going to be great. It's

14:49.280 --> 14:50.280
going to be awesome.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.360
Sure. It's awesome. Yeah. Just load it up. You'll figure it out.

14:53.360 --> 14:58.200
Yeah. Yeah. So we have an email as a great example of what somebody runs into when they

14:58.200 --> 15:02.560
take that advice. So that'll be a good spot I think for us to kind of frame this conversation

15:02.560 --> 15:10.400
plus or you just did a great piece over on Datamation about Linux desktop's missed opportunities.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.160
So we might even just want to start there. So before we dig into that, I want to thank

15:14.160 --> 15:19.640
our first sponsor this week and that my friends is Ting.com. Now Ting is mobile that makes

15:19.640 --> 15:23.360
sense. My service provider and Matt's service provider for mobile. You can get started by

15:23.360 --> 15:28.920
going to linux.ting.com. That'll take $25 off your first month of service or $25 off

15:28.920 --> 15:33.640
your first device if you don't already have a device. Now, one of the things that really

15:33.640 --> 15:36.720
makes Ting stand out is to pay for what you use system. And I want to talk about this

15:36.720 --> 15:40.560
for a little bit. Actually, I'd say there's a few things that really make Ting stand out,

15:40.560 --> 15:43.760
but the pay for what you use system is pretty unique. I don't really know anybody else that's

15:43.760 --> 15:47.600
doing that. So they take your messages, your megabytes and your minutes, and they add it

15:47.600 --> 15:51.420
all up at the end of the month, whatever bucket you fall into. That's all you got to pay.

15:51.420 --> 15:54.400
It's pretty reasonable pricing. It's not like it's going to surprise you because they've

15:54.400 --> 15:59.360
got a very active dashboard. This is where I want to change gears. This dashboard is

15:59.360 --> 16:02.880
really something. So not only do you get a snapshot of where you're at, what your usage

16:02.880 --> 16:06.080
is, what your bills have been, you can manage all of that. You can activate and deactivate

16:06.080 --> 16:10.160
devices. You can manage your voicemail settings. You can manage your call forwarding settings.

16:10.160 --> 16:14.420
You can manage what happens when you get X amount of calls. You can manage all of this

16:14.420 --> 16:19.960
from the most intuitive dashboard I have ever seen to do any of this. And as a long-term

16:19.960 --> 16:24.080
Ting customer, this is the kind of stuff that down the road, other than the amazing savings

16:24.080 --> 16:28.960
you're going to get because each device is just $6 per month. Yeah, $6 per month for

16:28.960 --> 16:32.680
a phone. That's it you guys. That's all you have to pay. And then you just pay for your

16:32.680 --> 16:36.440
usage fairly on top of that. When you combine that with the awesome management of their

16:36.440 --> 16:41.200
dashboard, it really has a long-term solution. It really is awesome. And if you go over to

16:41.200 --> 16:43.880
Ting.com and you're kind of checking things out, you're not quite sure if it's going to

16:43.880 --> 16:46.760
work for you, they have a savings calculator. You can get an idea of what kind of money

16:46.760 --> 16:49.900
savings you're going to see. And if you're worried about your contract with your current

16:49.900 --> 16:54.600
mobile provider, they also have an early termination relief program. Up to 75 bones per line. It's

16:54.600 --> 16:59.480
super easy. You get your phone from Ting. You port your number to Ting. And then you

16:59.480 --> 17:03.640
submit your early termination relief claim to Ting. Now the other great thing about Ting

17:03.640 --> 17:08.120
is they are riding the wave of the investment the Sprint Network is making in LTE right

17:08.120 --> 17:13.580
now. They are trying to roll out LTE. They are on a mad dash right now to roll LTE out

17:13.580 --> 17:19.640
to all major nations, all major areas in the United States. So you're going to see a lot

17:19.640 --> 17:23.800
more areas turn up. I happen to be particularly lucky and you might be as well. You can go

17:23.800 --> 17:28.920
check out their coverage map on their website. I live in an area where I get great 3G. I

17:28.920 --> 17:34.640
get great LTE and I also get awesome WiMAX. So I'm sort of benefiting from like all the

17:34.640 --> 17:39.960
major available types of connectivity and that for me is great because I'm a heavy ways

17:39.960 --> 17:43.960
user. So every moment I spend in the car I have a data connection. It's up. It's pulling

17:43.960 --> 17:49.480
down information. The state troopers on our Interstate 5 here are absolutely maniacs.

17:49.480 --> 17:57.000
I went up to the, seriously, I went up to the meat store today up in Arlington and four

17:57.000 --> 18:03.200
or five cops on just that between three exits. Waze flags all that stuff for me. So Waze

18:03.200 --> 18:07.000
is an absolute must. And I don't want to have to sit there and worry about am I going to

18:07.000 --> 18:11.560
reach my two gigabyte cap or am I going to, you know, or if I, do I need to, do I need

18:11.560 --> 18:16.680
to make a slightly less phone calls this month? That, all of that honestly feels like a scam.

18:16.680 --> 18:21.240
It all feels like a scam to get my money when I'm just using the service the way I want

18:21.240 --> 18:26.480
to use it and Ting just nukes all of it. They give you control and they give you the tools

18:26.480 --> 18:30.540
to keep control and monitor all of it. Plus they have fantastic Android apps that really

18:30.540 --> 18:33.680
work in concert with all of this stuff. If you're in a small business or if you're in

18:33.680 --> 18:37.560
a family, that six dollars per line from the pooled minutes and you just pay for what you

18:37.560 --> 18:43.080
use really works amazingly well. And then to top it all off, Ting has incredible support.

18:43.080 --> 18:46.400
You can call them and somebody answers. You can go to their support forums. They've got

18:46.400 --> 18:49.880
people there discussing stuff. You know, as they're working through the Nexus 5, there's

18:49.880 --> 18:53.760
some awesome threads in there right now about getting Nexus 5 working on Ting. And to see

18:53.760 --> 18:58.640
that just, not only just to see the community kind of take on that, but to see Ting embrace

18:58.640 --> 19:02.560
it, right? Not to try to stamp it down, no, no, don't, don't try to port some unauthorized

19:02.560 --> 19:06.400
device onto our network. Oh, no, they're not about that at all. They embrace the community.

19:06.400 --> 19:10.740
They work with them. And by working with their community, they've come up to have a working

19:10.740 --> 19:16.120
solution to get the Nexus 5 on Ting. You can go buy the Nexus 5 from the Google Play Store.

19:16.120 --> 19:19.960
Like you should be able to just buy a computing device directly from the manufacturer and

19:19.960 --> 19:24.040
you can put it on a network where you only pay for what you use and you're in no contract.

19:24.040 --> 19:27.600
There's no early termination fee. That's exactly how it should be. We're finally starting to

19:27.600 --> 19:32.400
see the smartphone market shape into the version of the future we want and we can all make

19:32.400 --> 19:36.720
that happen. So go over to linux.ting.com, sign up, you'll get $25 off your first month

19:36.720 --> 19:40.160
of service and I think you're going to be pretty happy. So a huge thanks to Ting for

19:40.160 --> 19:42.120
sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.880
Thank you. That's awesome.

19:43.880 --> 19:48.460
All right, Matt. So you wrote a good piece over at DataMation that said Linux desktops

19:48.460 --> 19:52.280
missed opportunities. And you said if Windows users consider migrating, or this was the

19:52.280 --> 19:56.560
sub headline I guess, does the Linux desktop offer a clear and easy choice? And one of

19:56.560 --> 20:00.880
the areas you said, well, right now Linux definitely has a leg up and some people might

20:00.880 --> 20:04.820
be surprised by this, but it hasn't a leg up on old peripherals.

20:04.820 --> 20:08.920
This is something that's a misnomer with most people. You ask even experienced Linux people,

20:08.920 --> 20:12.640
I've actually had some of them actually be misinformed on this, you know, what's the

20:12.640 --> 20:18.880
hardware support look between Windows and Linux? With peripherals dating back to even

20:18.880 --> 20:20.840
some modern ones, but especially with older ones.

20:20.840 --> 20:21.840
Like scanners and printers?

20:21.840 --> 20:26.040
Scanners and printers are the big ones. But even other stuff, Bluetooth dongles, certain

20:26.040 --> 20:30.360
headsets, you'd be surprised. In certain, depending on the age, in certain instances

20:30.360 --> 20:35.080
you will find that the support is crap under Windows. Even if you try and find a driver.

20:35.080 --> 20:38.320
I remember when Windows 7 came out, it had been out for, I don't know, a year at the

20:38.320 --> 20:42.600
time, and I was setting my mom up with her printer. Okay, I'll go get a driver for

20:42.600 --> 20:44.800
it. HP has no reason to do a driver for that.

20:44.800 --> 20:45.800
Oh, what a nightmare.

20:45.800 --> 20:46.800
This is an old printer.

20:46.800 --> 20:47.800
Yeah.

20:47.800 --> 20:48.800
What a nightmare.

20:48.800 --> 20:49.800
I mean, no, granted, I managed to hack it together, I think, with something later on

20:49.800 --> 20:53.760
and then eventually switched her anyway over to Linux. But at the time it was just like

20:53.760 --> 20:57.080
it was really appalling. Okay, same thing with Bluetooth. Try the Bluetooth dongle.

20:57.080 --> 21:00.280
No love. Okay, maybe there's drivers for it. Nope, Bluetooth dongle is too old.

21:00.280 --> 21:04.280
You know what, I found this is, this is kind of my enterprise background coming through,

21:04.280 --> 21:09.160
but Ethernet adapters, which is such a linchpin because if you don't have network connectivity,

21:09.160 --> 21:13.360
you can't get drivers for all the other stuff, right? And Linux, you know, because the stuff's

21:13.360 --> 21:17.880
at the kernel level, man, you just, you plug it in and you turn it on and it just works.

21:17.880 --> 21:22.780
And the experience there, if you really want to personify it, is you take a mouse on a

21:22.780 --> 21:27.520
Windows box, it's never seen that mouse before, and you plug it in. And then you do that wait,

21:27.520 --> 21:32.480
call it, and it goes out, it downloads the updates, it installs the driver. And then

21:32.480 --> 21:37.760
the case, well, ironically, the worst offender are the actual Microsoft mouse and keyboard

21:37.760 --> 21:40.760
where then they download an installer and a wizard you have to run through.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.960
Is there some extra software you didn't ask for?

21:42.960 --> 21:47.040
Right, and same with scanners, right? But on Linux, you plug it in and the software

21:47.040 --> 21:51.600
detects it or it doesn't. It's very one or zero, right, for most basic users. And I think

21:51.600 --> 21:56.940
this is a good point as Linux has sort of got a bad rap from the past because vendors

21:56.940 --> 22:00.600
couldn't give a crap about supporting it, but that really has started to change. But

22:00.600 --> 22:04.740
the other point you make for switchers is the security issues, right? Windows historically

22:04.740 --> 22:08.280
and to this day remains massively targeted by hackers.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.280
It's horrible.

22:09.280 --> 22:14.520
Windows XP, obviously worst offender, and you look at the end of Windows XP, seems like

22:14.520 --> 22:17.160
an opportunity to make a case here.

22:17.160 --> 22:21.280
It's absolutely, and the big picture here is that, and of course Windows XP actually

22:21.280 --> 22:25.160
ties into my peripheral argument earlier because a lot of people running XP are still running

22:25.160 --> 22:28.600
those peripherals that were working with XP. So then you have the peripheral argument and

22:28.600 --> 22:33.440
then on top of that, from the security standpoint, you had a Swiss cheese operating system that

22:33.440 --> 22:38.240
now what little basic security you had is going to be yanked out from underneath you.

22:38.240 --> 22:42.200
And people are going to run it blind. They have no idea. They have no clue. They don't

22:42.200 --> 22:47.280
know that what they're running is essentially like riding a motorcycle down a bobsled track

22:47.280 --> 22:50.720
in ice and snow. I mean, they have no idea. It's just incredibly dangerous and they don't

22:50.720 --> 22:53.200
realize they're doing it because of the marketing problem.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.880
Yeah. Yeah, you're right. And I recommend people go read Matt's piece here, but you

22:55.880 --> 22:59.880
also made, and on this one, I kind of want to push on you a little bit here because you

22:59.880 --> 23:05.960
say, well, you know, vendor lock-in is totally not a problem under Linux, but I wonder if

23:05.960 --> 23:10.600
that really resonates with Windows users. I don't know if they recognize the fact they're

23:10.600 --> 23:11.600
in vendor lock-in.

23:11.600 --> 23:18.680
It's application specific. In most instances, it's maybe some random thing they created,

23:18.680 --> 23:24.120
maybe let's say a greeting card maker or some random, you know, Podunk-y piece of software

23:24.120 --> 23:25.120
they don't really think twice about.

23:25.120 --> 23:28.320
Gosh, or yeah, like the holiday card maker. That's such a great example. That's totally

23:28.320 --> 23:29.320
what I've seen happen too.

23:29.320 --> 23:32.460
And it's the consumer stuff. It's usually some Podunk software consumer thing they bought

23:32.460 --> 23:35.280
at Best Buy at one point or whatever it is. And they don't really think twice about it

23:35.280 --> 23:38.640
until they go to, I don't know, maybe they're trying to upgrade to the next version of Windows

23:38.640 --> 23:43.000
and they realize, okay, it's no longer compatible or there's even compatibility modes not working

23:43.000 --> 23:47.440
for them or go to Windows 8 or whatever it may be. And then of course, going to Linux

23:47.440 --> 23:50.840
though, it's not always a straight shot. I mean, there are tools that make it easier.

23:50.840 --> 23:55.340
Scribus, for example, has worked on their publisher support, but it's not quite a hundred

23:55.340 --> 23:59.240
percent yet. But it's one to watch and that helps. But that's the danger of vendor lock-in

23:59.240 --> 24:02.800
even at a consumer level. It does exist. It's a problem.

24:02.800 --> 24:11.880
So do you think there is an option here that average, you know, I'm thinking, you know,

24:11.880 --> 24:16.080
the people that would want to make a greeting card software that want to buy that to make

24:16.080 --> 24:20.160
a card, they put their kids on it and they send that out to the family as the family

24:20.160 --> 24:27.700
holiday card. Do you think there is a solution for that type of user under Linux or is that

24:27.700 --> 24:31.700
type of user going to be better served by the Mac?

24:31.700 --> 24:35.540
If I was in PC repair still, first thing I'd do is I'd get up to an affiliate program to

24:35.540 --> 24:39.160
want it for one of the cloud-based alternatives for that same program. And there's lots of

24:39.160 --> 24:44.040
them. Then you're not only saying, oh, by the way, you know, your app is no longer compatible

24:44.040 --> 24:47.040
with my upgrade, you know, they're upgrading them to Windows 8 or whatever it is, but you

24:47.040 --> 24:48.920
can go this route. Same thing if you're moving into Linux.

24:48.920 --> 24:54.080
Yeah, I think that's a huge part of the conversation we're about to have is like the cloud, I hate

24:54.080 --> 24:57.720
calling it the cloud. I wish I could. Should we just call it the butt solutions? I don't

24:57.720 --> 24:58.720
know what we should call it.

24:58.720 --> 25:02.160
You can call it the butt solutions. I mean, I was in Best Buy here recently and I remember

25:02.160 --> 25:06.000
some woman asking the Geek Squad person, I want to make sure I get the computer with

25:06.000 --> 25:07.000
cloud.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Oh, no.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Not the cloud, but just cloud.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
I want cloud. I want cloud.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
I got to get some cloud.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
Well, yeah.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.000
This is the people you're dealing with.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.360
Well, and look at Microsoft. Well, we've integrated SkyDrive into the Windows operating system.

25:16.360 --> 25:19.000
That way you have cloud storage built in.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.040
Because they get marketing. I mean, as much as I hate to say it, I'm not a fan of saying

25:23.040 --> 25:24.040
that, but it's true, you know.

25:24.040 --> 25:30.840
I look at this and I think this conversation, even two years ago, would be more like, yeah,

25:30.840 --> 25:33.900
if you kind of want that, you kind of have to go to the Mac. But now we're looking at

25:33.900 --> 25:39.800
a new generation, really, of web apps that do a lot. A great example is that greeting

25:39.800 --> 25:44.880
card thing could probably completely be done on some greeting card maker's website. They

25:44.880 --> 25:49.600
probably have an HTML5 or, God forbid, Flash-based wizard you run through, and then they just

25:49.600 --> 25:51.120
submit it and print it right there.

25:51.120 --> 25:56.920
So the cloud now offers a whole new set of apps, because it's itself an application.

25:56.920 --> 26:00.320
Let's just call them web apps. We won't call them cloud apps. Web apps. They're web applications.

26:00.320 --> 26:05.280
They run on an NGINX or Apache server. They have a SQL backend or something, right?

26:05.280 --> 26:10.040
And so this sort of relieves some of that pressure. Now, as we talk about this, it brings

26:10.040 --> 26:17.560
me to an email we got. And I really felt for this guy, because the subject was, please,

26:17.560 --> 26:22.240
help me switch from Windows. And his name is Milan. And he says, hello, good people.

26:22.240 --> 26:26.600
I've been watching you for a bit, about less than two years, and you're the only nudgers

26:26.600 --> 26:31.000
I have helping me switch from the glory whose symbol is inspired by a carpenter's design.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.520
Yes, I am struggling to switch to Linux, simply because of the non-existing Linux community

26:35.520 --> 26:41.240
in my area. Out of laziness or comfort, one seems to want more and better. So here's my

26:41.240 --> 26:42.240
frustrations.

26:42.240 --> 26:46.760
Also, my parents have a lot of issues with Windows. Getting them on the Mint world would

26:46.760 --> 26:51.760
never happen. But I've decided to get Mint with Cinnamon 2, as it seems to be stable.

26:51.760 --> 26:55.960
I've settled on Mint 13 for now, Cinnamon Edition, eight months ago, on my old 80-gigabyte

26:55.960 --> 27:00.160
hard drive. I used Matt's guide to do it. Big thank you, Matt. And it was a breeze.

27:00.160 --> 27:04.440
The reasons I didn't use it now. So here's what happened. He ended up reinstalling Windows

27:04.440 --> 27:11.280
7. That process removed the boot choice as an option when he booted up, so he could no

27:11.280 --> 27:17.600
longer boot into Mint. Obviously, Windows overwrote the boot motor. Now I have a drive.

27:17.600 --> 27:22.360
Now I have to dive inside the cable world and unplug my main hard drive to power up

27:22.360 --> 27:26.880
Mint, and that annoys me. So I'm going to have Linux on its own machine all by itself

27:26.880 --> 27:28.880
and be Windows-free.

27:28.880 --> 27:34.200
Second problem I have. No power programs I like to use on Mint. Things like Photoshop,

27:34.200 --> 27:41.440
Premiere. There's also a lack of audio players, such as Awesome or AMP. And yes, one can run

27:41.440 --> 27:45.560
some of these things under Wine, but I do not see that as a viable option. Everyone

27:45.560 --> 27:50.680
praises Clementine. I haven't tried it, but it seems fine. It just seems a little bloated.

27:50.680 --> 27:55.040
I noticed a couple episodes ago that you set up a service for monitoring resources. He

27:55.040 --> 28:01.520
says, I went and found a parallel. I can set that up, but he says, I don't like the way

28:01.520 --> 28:05.400
it works. There's some things that lack compared to the commercial versions. He says, some

28:05.400 --> 28:09.400
of these things seem like silly stuff, but you had a little quarrel a couple episodes

28:09.400 --> 28:12.680
ago in the IRC on the same topic, and he says, I share your same point of view. Windows is

28:12.680 --> 28:17.400
just too comfortable. Everything works for me in Windows. I spent a lot of resources

28:17.400 --> 28:22.840
to get under people's skin. It's made us weak and comfortable seeking fools, thinking that

28:22.840 --> 28:26.880
data security is an issue that is nonexistent and unimportant. He says, I'm also a bit fed

28:26.880 --> 28:31.000
up with Google, mainly about mail safety, but also forcing the way it uses some of their

28:31.000 --> 28:35.880
products onto us. So he says, here's the essentials I need in order for Linux to get

28:35.880 --> 28:41.280
some traction. In a nutshell, I need Photoshop, Premiere, a good audio player, and system

28:41.280 --> 28:44.960
resource monitoring, and a mail service.

28:44.960 --> 28:48.480
So the long and short of this is right off the bat. The first mistake he's making is

28:48.480 --> 28:54.120
this is someone who obviously is using computers in his professional life, and so a one-size-fits-all

28:54.120 --> 28:59.760
tool is probably a bit naive. He probably does need to consider a multi-platform experience

28:59.760 --> 29:03.960
because that sounds like he's got a lot of stuff. Music player thing, I definitely argue

29:03.960 --> 29:06.600
with that. I think there's minimalist music players. You just got to spend a little time

29:06.600 --> 29:09.080
at SourceForge or whatnot.

29:09.080 --> 29:15.320
As far as the other part of it, I today actually had to do a multi-Skype thing for work, and

29:15.320 --> 29:19.400
I plugged in my headset with Skype open, and boy, you betcha, it went ahead and just froze

29:19.400 --> 29:24.580
the entire desktop for me because that's a feature. So I reboot with the device detected.

29:24.580 --> 29:30.280
It sees the device, but I can't get any sound to happen. So this belief that one operating

29:30.280 --> 29:34.880
system is somehow easier to use, honestly, I think it proves to me it's really what

29:34.880 --> 29:35.880
you spend the most time in.

29:35.880 --> 29:40.200
So because I spend so much time in Linux, I pull my hair out trying to do the most basic

29:40.200 --> 29:44.840
stuff in Windows. I can't. I spend all my time in the device manager going, okay, no,

29:44.840 --> 29:45.840
it's not working.

29:45.840 --> 29:51.480
Yeah, I think you're right, too. So another email we got this week was somebody who tried

29:51.480 --> 29:55.800
to switch to Linux and just was not happy with any CAD solutions.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.640
And that's a fair point, actually.

29:57.640 --> 30:01.240
I guess, too, part of me feels like you've got to do a little research before you make

30:01.240 --> 30:02.240
the switch.

30:02.240 --> 30:05.600
You would think, yeah. There are a number of program areas where-

30:05.600 --> 30:07.400
Is that asking too much?

30:07.400 --> 30:12.000
The research, no, but at the same time, the expectation has been set. See, Microsoft and

30:12.000 --> 30:17.960
even to a certain extent Apple has made people complacent in whatever you do, don't think.

30:17.960 --> 30:22.080
We're going to do, especially Apple, we're going to do the thinking for you and we're

30:22.080 --> 30:23.080
going to-

30:23.080 --> 30:27.360
But look at Windows, right? Windows is so popular that you're guaranteed to probably

30:27.360 --> 30:29.880
find an application that'll do what you expect.

30:29.880 --> 30:32.520
Just based on market share, it's a given. The market has spoken in that space.

30:32.520 --> 30:33.520
Could be a shit app.

30:33.520 --> 30:38.760
It could be completely crap. You have to be off some shareware site. But yeah, it's interesting.

30:38.760 --> 30:43.960
I think with Linux, that's again, going back to what I was saying as far as Joe Bob's distro.

30:43.960 --> 30:48.520
When they're promoting these distributions, they need a section that is painfully clear.

30:48.520 --> 30:52.440
Your experience is going to be completely different than anything you've had before.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.760
This is not a Windows experience.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.560
Yeah. And I think you're kind of getting to-

30:55.560 --> 30:59.880
Honestly, I think when it comes to that, Ubuntu does a great job. It says right up front,

30:59.880 --> 31:03.200
this is not Windows. Do not expect it to be Windows.

31:03.200 --> 31:04.640
I've yet to find that page.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.360
It's in the download page.

31:07.360 --> 31:08.360
Is it? Okay.

31:08.360 --> 31:12.000
I've not experienced that because everybody I've ever talked to that frustrates with it,

31:12.000 --> 31:16.560
it's like, well, I don't understand why it's little. And I think also that you're also,

31:16.560 --> 31:20.520
even if it's a paragraph or even a whole page, you're expecting people to unlearn a lot of

31:20.520 --> 31:25.520
that too. Again, Windows made people lazy and complacent.

31:25.520 --> 31:30.240
I think it's not that Ubuntu is trying to say it's, we're not Windows. They're trying

31:30.240 --> 31:31.240
to say we're OS X.

31:31.240 --> 31:41.080
That was a slam. But yeah, no, I think Ubuntu does a good job, but I mean, their documentation

31:41.080 --> 31:45.960
is a great example. Horribly, horribly out of date. I can point to example after example

31:45.960 --> 31:49.720
of just, and again, it's all volunteers and I get that. I understand that. But compared

31:49.720 --> 31:55.400
to say like large or some of these other distros, it's like, obviously it's not impossible.

31:55.400 --> 31:58.480
Well Don Thornton Jr. in the chat room says, why switch? Why does it have to be all or

31:58.480 --> 31:59.480
nothing?

31:59.480 --> 32:02.680
That's what I was saying. There's different tools for different jobs. That's why I live

32:02.680 --> 32:03.960
in a multi-platform universe.

32:03.960 --> 32:08.840
Yeah. I mean, even here, I've got a couple of Macs. I don't have any Windows anymore,

32:08.840 --> 32:11.240
but I did for a long time.

32:11.240 --> 32:15.840
I've got to be honest on my end, my desktop, my main entertainment machine runs Windows,

32:15.840 --> 32:18.840
but my laptop is 100% Linux.

32:18.840 --> 32:20.560
Is that that Netflix?

32:20.560 --> 32:22.560
That's how I started out actually back in the day.

32:22.560 --> 32:28.880
My suggestion is to just use something like Mint that has already a good base of applications

32:28.880 --> 32:36.080
installed and just use the IRC. Don't be afraid to ask questions in the IRC because, I mean,

32:36.080 --> 32:40.880
the problem with the Ubuntu IRC is there's a ton of people in there and oftentimes I

32:40.880 --> 32:46.280
want to see it squatted like after like two or three seconds and then Mint IRC is a little

32:46.280 --> 32:51.960
bit more stable in that regard too. Plus they'll help you most of the time in there too.

32:51.960 --> 32:57.760
But people don't know about IRC, right? I mean, see here's what we are going to be encountering

32:57.760 --> 33:04.040
is the Steam generation. The Call of Duty players or whatever it's going to be who,

33:04.040 --> 33:10.480
you know, I'm trying not to be stereotypical here, but let's just go worst case scenario.

33:10.480 --> 33:14.440
Mom and Dad won't pay for a new version of Windows. I need Steam OS, so I load it on

33:14.440 --> 33:18.040
a box. I have no idea what I'm getting into or I try out Ubuntu. I have no idea what I'm

33:18.040 --> 33:23.200
getting into, but I know it can play Steam games. I know it can browse the web. So I'm

33:23.200 --> 33:26.560
just going to jump whole hog into it because here's what I'm noticing, you guys, and this

33:26.560 --> 33:32.400
is not, I'm not, I don't mean to like shame anybody who's emailed in because, you know,

33:32.400 --> 33:37.960
because you emailed in, we have this topic, but a lot of, a lot of people don't even,

33:37.960 --> 33:42.420
don't even look beyond their nose. They just jump, man. They just, they just, they have

33:42.420 --> 33:47.000
a certain expectation of sort of appliance like functionality because their previous

33:47.000 --> 33:52.320
operating system provided them appliance like functionality in a sense and they just switch

33:52.320 --> 33:56.720
like whole hog like I got to open up an AutoCAD file tomorrow. I'm going to switch to Linux

33:56.720 --> 34:02.940
today and they just do it and I, I feel like I want to, I want to, I want to put up a red

34:02.940 --> 34:07.720
flag here and say if you're listening to our content and, and you think that's possible,

34:07.720 --> 34:12.100
it is not. It is, you know, you are switching, you are switching to a different philosophy

34:12.100 --> 34:16.640
of computing and one that I argue is better. It is worth that switch. It is worth that

34:16.640 --> 34:21.320
effort, but it is a transition, my friends. It is. It'd be a good chunk of time to get

34:21.320 --> 34:26.680
rid of my Windows partition, but I still have Windows programs I have to run, so I run them

34:26.680 --> 34:27.680
in a virtual machine.

34:27.680 --> 34:28.680
Yeah.

34:28.680 --> 34:29.680
Yeah.

34:29.680 --> 34:34.920
Another thought, you know, is this next couple of days, I'm actually going to play with open

34:34.920 --> 34:39.960
SUSE 13.1 and try to get pipeline working on that and I might try to spend some full

34:39.960 --> 34:43.880
time Linux experience on my desktop again for the first time in a while and see how

34:43.880 --> 34:44.880
that runs.

34:44.880 --> 34:45.880
That should be fun.

34:45.880 --> 34:49.960
Chris, I think that, I think you're talking about awareness here, really. There's not

34:49.960 --> 34:57.000
enough awareness of what Linux is all about and that's why some people, they fire up,

34:57.000 --> 35:02.880
we always pick on Ubuntu because it's the easiest one to install or mint a variation,

35:02.880 --> 35:08.680
although Debian soon. So, they fire it up and they think it's going to work out of the

35:08.680 --> 35:13.960
box. It does, more or less, until you start installing proprietary drivers and there's

35:13.960 --> 35:17.080
a kernel update, for example, and things like that.

35:17.080 --> 35:21.000
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that can be really tricky. You know, we were just talking on the pre-show

35:21.000 --> 35:26.400
on the live stream about the need to sometimes update your kernel to get some piece of hardware

35:26.400 --> 35:27.400
working correctly.

35:27.400 --> 35:32.040
Well, not only that, but with new computers as well, there's a new hurdle that, you know,

35:32.040 --> 35:34.520
with traditional BIOS, really wasn't that big of a deal as far as...

35:34.520 --> 35:35.520
UEFI?

35:35.520 --> 35:39.280
Yeah. I mean, you know, that new hurdle there is really, for us, it's like, okay, whatever,

35:39.280 --> 35:40.760
you just find stuff in a different place.

35:40.760 --> 35:43.440
No, you nailed it. People have been emailing in and they've been talking about it.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.440
Every one of them is different.

35:44.440 --> 35:45.440
Yeah, they've been talking about it. It's a problem.

35:45.440 --> 35:50.560
You know, if I can bring something up about the codecs, on Windows and OS X, people expect

35:50.560 --> 35:55.960
those codecs to be there out of the box these days. The idea of having to install codecs

35:55.960 --> 35:58.960
is in the last decade.

35:58.960 --> 36:03.200
It seems like a deficiency in the functionality of my desktop operating system to them. And

36:03.200 --> 36:05.560
I think that's why a lot of them are going mint.

36:05.560 --> 36:09.760
The old-school mindset is when someone buys a computer, it's an appliance, like a toaster.

36:09.760 --> 36:14.680
And that is what they've been growing up in, when they actually switch the internals of

36:14.680 --> 36:19.880
the toaster. Our system is dynamic. It's more dynamic.

36:19.880 --> 36:20.880
Well, yeah.

36:20.880 --> 36:26.640
Yeah, it's not static, like they bought, when they bought the appliance.

36:26.640 --> 36:33.120
My biggest suggestion is you have to search about these things. Google is your best friend

36:33.120 --> 36:35.200
in these situations.

36:35.200 --> 36:44.240
What if we just said Linux is computing without the training wheels, and it's just not for

36:44.240 --> 36:51.280
the absolute beginner user. It is, Linux is for somebody who is comfortable with Googling

36:51.280 --> 36:55.360
things. Linux is for somebody who's comfortable with, you know, having to maybe set a few

36:55.360 --> 36:58.160
settings that they wouldn't normally have to set under these up there. Is that really

36:58.160 --> 36:59.760
that bad to say?

36:59.760 --> 37:01.560
I wouldn't even agree with that, though.

37:01.560 --> 37:02.560
I think yes, it does.

37:02.560 --> 37:04.920
Because they're not too old of a dog to learn a new trick.

37:04.920 --> 37:07.400
Well, I disagree, too.

37:07.400 --> 37:11.920
I don't agree with that, just because, for example, my mom is a person who doesn't want

37:11.920 --> 37:16.480
to learn how to do anything like that, and I have a neighbor who has no intention of

37:16.480 --> 37:21.680
ever learning how to install anything. They don't even know what an EXE file is on Windows.

37:21.680 --> 37:27.200
So what I would suggest is if there's people like that that you want to have try Linux,

37:27.200 --> 37:31.560
don't just tell them to try Linux. Give them an out-of-the-box situation where you take

37:31.560 --> 37:35.960
their computer, put everything up, set it exactly how they're going to use their computer,

37:35.960 --> 37:38.400
and then let them go at it, and they will never have a problem.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.400
Exactly.

37:39.400 --> 37:40.960
I consider it's a little bit harder than that.

37:40.960 --> 37:45.600
My wife is running Linux on her computer. It's an Arch install that I made for her,

37:45.600 --> 37:48.880
because I know what she's going to use it for. I know that she's not going to tinker

37:48.880 --> 37:52.560
around with it and muck it up at all. She's not even going to touch the command line.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.840
She's just going to do word processing and web browsing for school. That's all she's

37:55.840 --> 37:56.840
going to do.

37:56.840 --> 37:57.840
So why Arch?

37:57.840 --> 38:00.800
Why Arch? Because I can custom make it for her.

38:00.800 --> 38:01.800
Because you're managing it.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.200
But you have to manage it. You have to manage it for her.

38:04.200 --> 38:08.400
But it's different, though, too, because you know that you can update it and never have

38:08.400 --> 38:13.400
to worry about reinstalling. You're only doing those things if you're not trying to add five

38:13.400 --> 38:15.880
different desktops doing stuff like that.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.440
And that was the major motivating factor, to be honest.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.440
Exactly.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.480
For many people, their operating system is like a religion. You're not going to be able

38:22.480 --> 38:28.640
to change their way of thought. There's some cases which cannot be fixed. They cannot change.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.640
They're stuck.

38:29.640 --> 38:33.360
It's true, because you're trying to retrain the brain. You're trying to retrain how people

38:33.360 --> 38:38.260
think. And I go back to what I said about the Ubuntu page. I've looked back and forth

38:38.260 --> 38:44.360
both on slash download and slash download slash desktop. You couldn't be, you know,

38:44.360 --> 38:45.360
it says nothing.

38:45.360 --> 38:48.560
Yeah, you almost wonder, you almost think like there should be a legal disclaimer warning.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.880
Your Windows applications will not work under Ubuntu.

38:50.880 --> 38:55.960
Honestly, it has a lot of great details here, but it's missing that core, hey, by the way,

38:55.960 --> 38:59.560
we have a great operating system experience for you, but understand it's different.

38:59.560 --> 39:00.560
Yeah.

39:00.560 --> 39:06.640
Honestly, I think this is why this whole discussion is why Canonical is partnering up with these

39:06.640 --> 39:12.400
manufacturers to push out computers in markets where people don't have that established bias.

39:12.400 --> 39:13.400
Yeah, it doesn't look like it's in Africa.

39:13.400 --> 39:14.400
And that's actually from Firefox OS.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.400
Yeah, I actually have a great wallpaper for that, too. It's a little hitchhiker's guide,

39:15.400 --> 39:16.400
a little robot thing, and it says, don't panic, it's not Windows.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.400
Yeah, right, exactly.

39:17.400 --> 39:30.800
All right, well, I tell you, you got to send that, like put it in the room or something.

39:30.800 --> 39:39.240
I think Microsoft has built this regime where we have all learned to ride the bike, and

39:39.240 --> 39:44.880
we all know to ride the bike, we pedal forwards, and we start moving forwards.

39:44.880 --> 39:49.520
And for somebody to say, hold on, you can start pedaling with your arms, they're like,

39:49.520 --> 39:54.000
no, that's not what Microsoft taught us to do. Do you see what I mean?

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Not at all.

39:55.000 --> 40:03.040
Well, no, I think it goes deeper than Microsoft. I think it goes deeper into how many people

40:03.040 --> 40:07.600
will actually truly cook a meal versus do whatever is quick and easy. How many people

40:07.600 --> 40:11.800
truly change their own oil versus go to the Quicky Lube. How many people truly go and

40:11.800 --> 40:16.360
go to their own cow. So Microsoft catered to an audience of people that wanted that

40:16.360 --> 40:17.360
anyway.

40:17.360 --> 40:23.240
Yeah, I mean, the Windows environment is just as much of a sandbox as the Mac is. It's just

40:23.240 --> 40:25.800
a way bigger sandbox. And to me...

40:25.800 --> 40:28.000
It's becoming more closed and closed as it keeps going.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.320
Oh, yeah. The advantages of the Windows desktop are diminishing, and the advantages of the

40:32.320 --> 40:37.280
Linux desktop are increasing, especially as we get to HTML5-based applications, especially

40:37.280 --> 40:43.560
as Qt comes around and we get a lot more cross-platform applications. As all of these things mature,

40:43.560 --> 40:50.680
the advantage is that Linux inherently advantages from cross-platform development, from web

40:50.680 --> 40:55.440
standards, from all of this stuff, and Windows inherently is disadvantaged by those things

40:55.440 --> 41:00.040
because they take away the Windows advantage, right? They take away the monopoly.

41:00.040 --> 41:07.500
So it's almost like this problem we are struggling with today, we are heading... I truly believe

41:07.500 --> 41:12.760
we are heading... And I couldn't put a time and date on it. We are heading to a point

41:12.760 --> 41:21.920
where just like Linux has completely dominated every area of computing, the desktop eventually,

41:21.920 --> 41:27.520
like Steve Ballmer said, almost like a cancer, will be consumed by Linux because as these

41:27.520 --> 41:34.360
top-tier vendors begin to focus on their new areas of revenue, mobile, they will recede

41:34.360 --> 41:41.080
and they will offer less and less advantages to running on those platforms, and as Linux

41:41.080 --> 41:47.120
will continue to just grow as it has, it will benefit from standardization, it will benefit

41:47.120 --> 41:50.500
from all of these things that weaken these other guys, and it will become the dominant

41:50.500 --> 41:54.360
desktop platform. I don't know what that's going to look like or what form factor it's

41:54.360 --> 41:57.840
going to take place in, but I got to believe these problems we are talking about right

41:57.840 --> 42:04.020
now, these are solvable problems, and I do not believe the problems that Windows faces

42:04.020 --> 42:11.520
are solvable. I believe they are the eventual outcome of a maturing market.

42:11.520 --> 42:16.840
Well, Windows is also killing Windows intentionally.

42:16.840 --> 42:24.200
I think that people when changing from Windows because they don't like it or whatever the

42:24.200 --> 42:29.960
reason, they have to know that in Linux, you don't use the same program as in Windows because

42:29.960 --> 42:37.480
you don't have them, and you use alternatives like LibreOffice. You don't use Winamp, you

42:37.480 --> 42:44.520
use WrittenBox or Clementine. You use different programs, and you need to know that before

42:44.520 --> 42:45.520
you switch.

42:45.520 --> 42:51.320
I guess I feel like we've always hung our hat on games are the barrier to desktop Linux,

42:51.320 --> 42:54.960
and man, if we just had games, dude, if we just had games, people would be switching

42:54.960 --> 42:58.720
to Linux, and now I feel like we're starting to get games and I'm realizing actually it's

42:58.720 --> 43:00.440
more than that.

43:00.440 --> 43:06.080
And another thing I kind of want to mention is the whole thing about the word Linux sometimes

43:06.080 --> 43:11.280
being dirty in people's mind. You ever wonder, like back in 2010 when Canonical changed their

43:11.280 --> 43:15.920
branding of Ubuntu, they started removing a lot of references to the word Linux.

43:15.920 --> 43:22.120
Yeah, I mean, I think that's kind of understandable. Cars aren't manufactured as gasoline anymore.

43:22.120 --> 43:25.200
This is a gasoline engine. Everybody just kind of assumes it's a gasoline engine.

43:25.200 --> 43:30.800
Yeah, people think too that, Linus has said this before, people do not install OSes. They

43:30.800 --> 43:31.800
just don't.

43:31.800 --> 43:32.800
Right.

43:32.800 --> 43:33.800
Yeah, that's right.

43:33.800 --> 43:37.680
So, like, you're having Joe is not going to download like an ISO of the Bluetooth and

43:37.680 --> 43:40.880
put it on a flash drive and install it. That's just not going to happen. It's got to be somebody

43:40.880 --> 43:42.880
like us to show him that.

43:42.880 --> 43:43.880
Or it's mobile.

43:43.880 --> 43:50.200
I think that most people don't even know what is Linux. When my mom came to my room and

43:50.200 --> 43:52.480
said, what's that Ubuntu thing? What's that?

43:52.480 --> 43:58.240
Yeah, I think the Linux branding right now. So here's what it is. It's a deficient brand.

43:58.240 --> 44:03.880
There isn't enough there to bank on it. Brands are like a commodity that could literally

44:03.880 --> 44:08.800
be traded on the stock market. And they are so much amazing amount of value. You guys

44:08.800 --> 44:13.040
don't even realize how manipulated you are by brands, but brands are everything. And

44:13.040 --> 44:18.080
Linux right now doesn't have a super strong brand. Windows actually has the opposite problem.

44:18.080 --> 44:22.040
It had a great brand. It had a very strong brand. Shit, you bought something because

44:22.040 --> 44:26.040
it supported Windows or because Windows ran on that. And that's why you bought it. But

44:26.040 --> 44:30.840
now it is a debt. It is a problem. Things that are in the marketplace do not succeed

44:30.840 --> 44:34.680
when they are branded with Windows. So they have crossed that lexicon. They have moved

44:34.680 --> 44:40.040
into a territory where Windows now is a problem.

44:40.040 --> 44:44.880
The branding of Linux is not yet like, oh shit, that's Linux. Oh, I'm going to buy that.

44:44.880 --> 44:45.880
But it could get there.

44:45.880 --> 44:52.760
I think it suffers from a lot of old stereotypes where it was the, quote, hacker's OS where

44:52.760 --> 44:56.240
you required more knowledge to use it.

44:56.240 --> 45:00.120
You could have made that same argument. If you take it, so one of the things that I think

45:00.120 --> 45:04.980
you can draw parallels to, to watch what happens in a compressed timeframe. The commercial

45:04.980 --> 45:09.760
industry, in my opinion, operates in a much more compressed timeframe than the open source

45:09.760 --> 45:14.720
organic evolved market, which is the Linux market. If you look at the Apple branding,

45:14.720 --> 45:20.800
Apple was a joke in the late 90s. I don't know how old you guys are, but in the 90s

45:20.800 --> 45:21.800
they were terrible.

45:21.800 --> 45:22.800
It was awful.

45:22.800 --> 45:29.280
Right? Yeah. Now they're almost like at a, you know, their brand is like the number one

45:29.280 --> 45:33.840
brand in the world or some crap. Like they're competing with Coke. It's ridiculous, right?

45:33.840 --> 45:40.600
And so you can see how you, as long as, I feel like the brand can cross from, I feel

45:40.600 --> 45:44.680
like you can have a brand that people understand isn't there yet. And then down the road, they'll

45:44.680 --> 45:48.280
acknowledge, okay, it's reached that point where it's refined enough that now it's good.

45:48.280 --> 45:52.360
It's a good thing. And I know about this and it's good. Whereas a brand like windows can

45:52.360 --> 45:57.560
also be, can, can travel that whole lifespan and then enter that period that it's in now.

45:57.560 --> 46:00.720
I don't feel like Linux has crossed that. What's that?

46:00.720 --> 46:06.080
I wonder, you know, how close we're going to achieve that when distributions like Ubuntu

46:06.080 --> 46:10.560
would rather focus on the Ubuntu brand rather than saying, Oh, Hey, we're Linux.

46:10.560 --> 46:11.560
But aren't you glad?

46:11.560 --> 46:15.240
It will never be that brand. It will never be that brand because it's an, it's impossible

46:15.240 --> 46:20.200
for the quiz. The people who own the brand of Linux and own the trademark won't do that

46:20.200 --> 46:25.360
themselves and a company won't want to put money behind it to advertise someone else.

46:25.360 --> 46:26.360
It doesn't make sense.

46:26.360 --> 46:32.120
It is more empowering to the user. And in this case, the user could be the manufacturer

46:32.120 --> 46:35.280
that they don't have to live on that brand that they can build their own. The fact that

46:35.280 --> 46:40.880
Ubuntu can build a respected brand by using Linux makes Linux more important. Like I go

46:40.880 --> 46:46.960
back to my gasoline comparison, like GM doesn't say this is the gasoline powered Chevy Volt

46:46.960 --> 46:51.160
or whatever. Volt's probably a bad example. Chevy truck or whatever, right? They don't,

46:51.160 --> 46:53.960
they don't advertise the fact that it's powered by gasoline. I mean, everybody just knows

46:53.960 --> 46:54.960
it.

46:54.960 --> 47:00.600
Well, I guess an electric car would have different advertising and branding. I mean, the same

47:00.600 --> 47:04.920
thing goes for like Chrome OS or Android. You don't, it's more about the Android focus

47:04.920 --> 47:09.400
or the Chrome OS focus and not so much on the Linux aspect, which I definitely understand.

47:09.400 --> 47:13.200
Well, I kind of like to say like the Chevy Lithium.

47:13.200 --> 47:17.640
Chevy Lithium is one. A big piece of what we've got to remember is what makes or breaks

47:17.640 --> 47:22.280
a brand is the experience that they are selling and or otherwise offering. If they're selling

47:22.280 --> 47:25.760
an experience that you want to participate in or emulate in some fashion, whether it

47:25.760 --> 47:29.560
be Apple or whatever it may be, it's like, wow, I like what they're doing. I want to

47:29.560 --> 47:33.160
do that or I want to try that or I want to experience that. That's what will make a brand

47:33.160 --> 47:35.520
successful. Even if it's past, even if you're watching something.

47:35.520 --> 47:39.880
When it comes to the business side of things or the Quicken or the, you know, it's always

47:39.880 --> 47:40.880
the business apps.

47:40.880 --> 47:46.760
And I think that's why Ubuntu focus on changing, I'm sorry. I think that's why Ubuntu focus

47:46.760 --> 47:51.920
on changing their branding three, four years ago because rather than being Linux for human

47:51.920 --> 47:54.680
beings, they were just Ubuntu.

47:54.680 --> 47:58.840
Yeah, it is. That is a good point. And so I guess the way to kind of bring this back

47:58.840 --> 48:04.800
to the switching conversation is people will be, people definitely, I mean, based on my

48:04.800 --> 48:10.120
inbox. So here's the trend I've noticed when I started doing the Linux action show is Fedora

48:10.120 --> 48:14.000
that people were finding because they were finding the link from Red Hat and then they

48:14.000 --> 48:17.120
would follow that down to Fedora and then they would try out Fedora and then they'd

48:17.120 --> 48:18.120
be burned.

48:18.120 --> 48:21.680
And you would see it, you would see that reflected in my reviews. Like I'd be like, why the F

48:21.680 --> 48:24.720
are they doing this? Don't they understand they're making, I mean, literally you go back

48:24.720 --> 48:27.680
to my early Fedora reviews, I'd be like, don't they understand they're making the Linux community

48:27.680 --> 48:33.200
look bad by shipping a volume app that doesn't actually change the volume. Like I, but now,

48:33.200 --> 48:39.480
I would say the vast majority, the vast majority of emails are people that are trying Mint

48:39.480 --> 48:40.480
or Ubuntu.

48:40.480 --> 48:41.480
Yeah.

48:41.480 --> 48:44.360
Mint or Ubuntu. What's interesting, it seems to be older versions of Mint too. I don't,

48:44.360 --> 48:47.320
where's that coming from? Magazines? I don't know what that's about.

48:47.320 --> 48:53.160
I found Ubuntu back in 2006. That was my first experience with Linux. And now when I use

48:53.160 --> 48:57.600
Linux, I go right for OpenSUSE. So just because of the tools it offers.

48:57.600 --> 49:01.960
I think this is part of the problem is like to understand what makes a successful long-term

49:01.960 --> 49:06.520
viable desktop. And it's based on like, well, what do you need? For me, I want community

49:06.520 --> 49:11.120
and I want modern software. So that's art, right? But for a lot of folks, it's, I want

49:11.120 --> 49:14.680
to know this is going to be around forever. I want to, I want to know it's enticing to

49:14.680 --> 49:20.960
commercial software creators. And in that definition, Fedora, Ubuntu and OpenSUSE fit

49:20.960 --> 49:24.720
that definition a lot better. But how is a Windows user supposed to know that?

49:24.720 --> 49:29.120
Exactly. And if you go back to early days of Lin Spire, Xandros and some of the other

49:29.120 --> 49:35.080
guys, we've seen people try and take this concept without any disclaimer, disclosure

49:35.080 --> 49:39.480
or what their people are getting into, put it into storefronts or in some cases, online

49:39.480 --> 49:44.640
shopping. People will buy these machines not realizing what they're actually getting.

49:44.640 --> 49:47.680
So they get it home and they say, great, I'm going to go ahead and install my, let's

49:47.680 --> 49:50.560
say, you know, the greeting card maker software. They put the CD in the tray, they close the

49:50.560 --> 49:54.160
tray, they go to install it, nothing happens. Okay, what's going on? Well, okay, I'm

49:54.160 --> 49:57.120
going to, I got to get Microsoft Office on here. I got Microsoft this. Okay, that's

49:57.120 --> 50:00.240
fine. Got my, I got my product key. I had to, you know, dig it out from under in the

50:00.240 --> 50:04.880
drawer, got it, good to go, entered it in, nothing. And so it's like, okay, well, especially

50:04.880 --> 50:08.440
with Xandros, which actually, believe it or not, for a while required a product key, which

50:08.440 --> 50:13.240
was weird, but you know, which really sent a mixed message. But these guys, you know,

50:13.240 --> 50:17.040
this was the early days. And what was worse is if you look back at the time, they were,

50:17.040 --> 50:21.040
I won't use the brand names, but they were using very low end hardware. So you had a

50:21.040 --> 50:26.680
double pronged sword of misinformation, really bad experience, a misunderstanding on OS and

50:26.680 --> 50:32.280
bad to make it more confusing, at least under Xandros business edition, business edition

50:32.280 --> 50:36.680
came bundled with crossover, which I like, I like crossover was fine, but they didn't

50:36.680 --> 50:43.520
really explain what you'd put. If you put the office CD in your CD drive, like it would

50:43.520 --> 50:48.920
auto mount it and it would actually start the office installation process like right

50:48.920 --> 50:54.400
there. It's very confusing because like some applications, so what you got was some applications

50:54.400 --> 50:57.880
automatically installed when I put in the disk and some don't do anything. I don't understand

50:57.880 --> 50:58.880
what's going on, right?

50:58.880 --> 51:04.200
And then you had Lenspire, which on the consumer side of it, automatically worked with DVDs,

51:04.200 --> 51:08.240
encrypted or otherwise. It actually even went so far as to allow you to purchase weird stuff

51:08.240 --> 51:13.440
like hang on to your hats kids, parental controls. We don't have that now, but we had that back

51:13.440 --> 51:16.360
then and they did a really good job with it actually. And then of course you had a variety

51:16.360 --> 51:20.560
of other tools, but even with all that stuff, because of the legacy concerns and questions

51:20.560 --> 51:24.120
and things that people would have and no real support system, they didn't really understand

51:24.120 --> 51:25.120
what they were getting into.

51:25.120 --> 51:30.720
But I would say, I guess our tips to new switchers to kind of put a bow on this whole thing is

51:30.720 --> 51:36.760
just spend some weekends, spend some late nights doing your research, find all of the

51:36.760 --> 51:41.240
programs you think you would use for the stuff you need before you switch. So you know going

51:41.240 --> 51:42.920
in what programs you're going to try, right?

51:42.920 --> 51:44.640
I would also suggest dual booting.

51:44.640 --> 51:46.640
Oh yeah, or virtualization.

51:46.640 --> 51:47.640
USB.

51:47.640 --> 51:54.000
Yeah, I would say USB is one. Dual booting at one time I was a big proponent of at one

51:54.000 --> 51:58.880
time. I used to think it was great. These days I'm absolutely shaking my head, jumping

51:58.880 --> 51:59.880
up and down no.

51:59.880 --> 52:03.320
Yeah, with the UEFI it seems to be kind of hit and miss. One of the things I've been

52:03.320 --> 52:07.760
noticing in the emails is UEFI sometimes people booting up their machines and they're just

52:07.760 --> 52:09.560
getting different results even.

52:09.560 --> 52:13.680
So who's to say a Microsoft update won't break something, you know, MBR wise? You don't know.

52:13.680 --> 52:16.200
I mean you're putting a lot of trust in that.

52:16.200 --> 52:20.600
Is when I dual boot, you know, I find one week I'll spend 90% of my time in one of us

52:20.600 --> 52:26.360
and then put it together and feel alien so I go spend a week in that and then vice versa.

52:26.360 --> 52:31.120
Absolutely a depressing conversation because a lot of times if you're willing to learn

52:31.120 --> 52:35.720
and try something new Linux is a good option. If you're not willing to learn and try something

52:35.720 --> 52:39.960
new you have to stay with Windows. It's unfortunate and sad.

52:39.960 --> 52:46.360
Well Windows 7, which is the last good version of Windows, hear ye, this is the last version

52:46.360 --> 52:49.220
of Windows that will ever be acceptable as far as I'm concerned.

52:49.220 --> 52:54.200
It really wasn't terrible. To me Windows is actually going to die. Microsoft themselves

52:54.200 --> 52:55.840
are going to kill Windows.

52:55.840 --> 52:59.360
So you have time though. I mean they're not going to pull the plug on it next year. It's

52:59.360 --> 53:03.240
got years of support left. So it's not like somebody can't find the time to try this stuff

53:03.240 --> 53:08.600
out eventually. Buy a new machine, set up your new machine, so then see how it works.

53:08.600 --> 53:11.160
And if it doesn't work with Linux then put Windows on it. You know there's a lot of different

53:11.160 --> 53:14.520
ways to approach it. Virtualization, dual boot, whatever works for you.

53:14.520 --> 53:18.760
Usually whatever they buy they're going to use. They don't care to change it. It comes

53:18.760 --> 53:19.760
as it is.

53:19.760 --> 53:24.440
I feel like if you're going to take this on yourself, wait until you're going to buy

53:24.440 --> 53:28.760
a new computer. And when you buy that new computer put Linux on it. And just try it

53:28.760 --> 53:31.640
like that for a little bit because then you have your old computer if something should

53:31.640 --> 53:32.640
go wrong.

53:32.640 --> 53:37.020
Here's what I don't like about the dual boot. The dual boot, the problem with that is you

53:37.020 --> 53:42.200
immediately will reboot your computer after 30 seconds of not being able to do whatever

53:42.200 --> 53:46.480
it is you know you could do within 10 seconds on the other operating system. So the problem

53:46.480 --> 53:50.360
is that temptation to hit that restart button and now you've got an SSD so it's going to

53:50.360 --> 53:53.200
reboot into Windows super fast. It's not like you've got to wait that long. You're going

53:53.200 --> 53:56.120
to reboot back into Windows and you're just going to get the job done under Windows. And

53:56.120 --> 53:59.880
the problem is lesson will never be learned. You'll never have learned how to do that.

53:59.880 --> 54:03.800
If you have it on its own machine it's just that much more of a barrier where you're going

54:03.800 --> 54:07.640
to stick with it and try it for a little bit and you know you've got plan B. You can go

54:07.640 --> 54:11.560
over to the other computer if you can't get it working on that new computer. And I'm envisioning

54:11.560 --> 54:16.440
like you've got a desktop for years and you buy a new laptop. Maybe you try that new laptop

54:16.440 --> 54:20.100
with Linux and you keep Windows on that desktop for a month or two until you've decided you

54:20.100 --> 54:24.520
can switch over right. I mean and other things like Dropbox and BitTorrent Sync by the way

54:24.520 --> 54:28.900
make this a lot easier. Set up a synchronization between your two machines. Open the same files

54:28.900 --> 54:33.640
on both machines and if you're working on a GIMP file and you just can't get it to work

54:33.640 --> 54:38.560
the way you want after you've tried it enough go open up on Photoshop right and do it there.

54:38.560 --> 54:41.560
But you can avoid the dual boot. There are solutions where you can avoid the dual boot

54:41.560 --> 54:47.400
now. With UEFI I think it might be time to start considering at least for a little while

54:47.400 --> 54:51.680
not doing the dual boot solution. And that Chris is kind of why I have a different machine

54:51.680 --> 54:55.920
for different purposes and run a different OS on different machines. Yeah. Yeah totally.

54:55.920 --> 54:59.300
Yeah I think you really nailed it there because I think at the end of the day I generally

54:59.300 --> 55:02.200
recommend to people that if you have an older computer and you're wanting to try Linux and

55:02.200 --> 55:05.920
you're going to buy a new computer anyway whatever your new computer is I generally

55:05.920 --> 55:11.200
recommend using the operating system it comes with. If you're not sure get it with whatever

55:11.200 --> 55:14.280
you're going to do whatever you're at. But with older computers you have a little more

55:14.280 --> 55:18.000
flexibility in that you know the compatibility is going to be more likely especially with

55:18.000 --> 55:21.680
people that tend to buy a brand new Windows machine and then they go I'm going to go put

55:21.680 --> 55:25.640
Ubuntu on it and then five minutes later they're in the forums whining about how Ubuntu sucks

55:25.640 --> 55:29.300
because it doesn't work with this thing that has a Microsoft sticker on it I might add.

55:29.300 --> 55:34.400
So that's my pick. That's one of my pick describes. Well said. And also maybe a little bit is

55:34.400 --> 55:39.660
be willing to be your own teacher like Bullet Freak is saying in the chat room is like we

55:39.660 --> 55:43.520
are living in a time where information is so abundantly available to us it's kind of

55:43.520 --> 55:48.560
ridiculous like to not take advantage of that is almost negligence on our part so be willing

55:48.560 --> 55:53.840
to be your own teacher do the investigation that you need to do. So yeah I think that's

55:53.840 --> 55:56.840
remember trying to learn stuff pre-internet. I was having this conversation with my nephew

55:56.840 --> 56:00.560
earlier you know what we used to do. It's kind of fun when I you know in the enterprise

56:00.560 --> 56:05.600
what we would do is about once every quarter we would a couple of guys a couple guys would

56:05.600 --> 56:10.520
jump in the car and we could take a super long lunch and we go down to the most closest

56:10.520 --> 56:15.640
Barnes and Noble and we would just buy a crap ton of books. We would just buy a bunch of

56:15.640 --> 56:19.520
books right because we didn't have Google. We didn't have Google. I mean come on. I mean

56:19.520 --> 56:24.080
maybe we had Alta Vista back then maybe but that sucked. Well that was a joke. Yeah. So

56:24.080 --> 56:28.960
we bought books. Now you just Google. I mean everybody knows HotBot won right. I mean you

56:28.960 --> 56:33.240
know. Yeah good times. I kind of miss some of that a little bit. I miss HotBot. I don't

56:33.240 --> 56:37.320
know why. Maybe it's the logo. I don't know what it was. Yeah. All right. Well I want

56:37.320 --> 56:41.000
to shift gears and kind of bring us into the end of this week's show but first I had an

56:41.000 --> 56:45.440
email I wanted to get to and that was from No Need to Pronounce My Name Correctly. Hey that's

56:45.440 --> 56:49.160
one I think I can get. I think I can manage that one. They just won the internet. What

56:49.160 --> 56:53.200
do you think? You think I can. I think you nailed it. But before we do I want to talk

56:53.200 --> 56:57.360
about our sponsor this week. Now Matt did you know that DigitalOcean is sponsoring

56:57.360 --> 57:02.100
this week's episode of Linux Unplugged. Oh that's awesome. Yeah DigitalOcean is cloud

57:02.100 --> 57:07.560
hosting made simple. Now cloud hosting like somebody like Ray Ramey and our audience pointed

57:07.560 --> 57:11.720
out cloud hosting might not be the best way to put it. Think of it as hosting you completely

57:11.720 --> 57:17.800
control on your own. It is a brand new way of getting your own server under 55 seconds

57:17.800 --> 57:21.540
and pricing starts at just five dollars per month. DigitalOcean has data centers in New

57:21.540 --> 57:27.520
York San Francisco and Amsterdam. Interface is super simple. It's intuitive with the control

57:27.520 --> 57:32.240
panel. They call it intuitive. I would say the control panel is inspired. It is so easy

57:32.240 --> 57:35.080
to deploy a new machine whether you want a lamp stack, you want something that supports

57:35.080 --> 57:39.340
Docker or you want to go cray cray like I did and deploy a Linux machine you can. It's

57:39.340 --> 57:44.960
all click click and you've got it. 55 seconds if you're slow. Here's what you can get in

57:44.960 --> 57:48.960
under 55 seconds for only five dollars per month. 512 megabytes of RAM, 20 gigabytes

57:48.960 --> 57:55.960
of SSD storage, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer. Now you might think oh SSD that's

57:55.960 --> 57:59.840
interesting. You know what? It is interesting and when you combine it with their super fast

57:59.840 --> 58:04.720
network speeds, oh boy does that sucker sing let me tell you. So here's what I want you

58:04.720 --> 58:09.720
to do. Go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code Linux13. That's going to get

58:09.720 --> 58:13.840
you a ten dollar credit. Now if you buy their lower end machine for five bucks, their beginning

58:13.840 --> 58:17.880
machine, that's the machine, I've been using it now. Five dollars a month when you combine

58:17.880 --> 58:23.300
SSD storage with their crazy awesome network performance and the fact that Linux has amazing

58:23.300 --> 58:28.180
memory management so 512 megs of RAM is plenty for what I'm using it for. I have been so

58:28.180 --> 58:32.460
happy and I got the first two months for free because I used the code Linux13. They'll give

58:32.460 --> 58:36.640
you a ten dollar credit. Five dollar machine means you get it for two months. They've also

58:36.640 --> 58:40.980
got servers by the hour. If you want to toss up a machine, now here's what's great is they

58:40.980 --> 58:46.440
have droplets and these can be the pre-configured droplets like I was talking about, LAMP, Docker

58:46.440 --> 58:50.780
or you can make your own image like I've done of my Arch installation and then if I want

58:50.780 --> 58:55.580
to test something and I don't want to spend a couple of hours setting up Arch, I just

58:55.580 --> 59:00.200
deploy that image, I do an update and then I've got a fully current Arch machine with

59:00.200 --> 59:04.080
all the installations I need and I can pay by the hour if I like. I think it's really

59:04.080 --> 59:07.100
nice too because you can also resize on demand so if I want to really throw something at

59:07.100 --> 59:11.240
it, I can add more memory, more CPU. I can get web console access if I don't want to

59:11.240 --> 59:14.860
fire up SSH. You can also SSH into it later. You get backups, you get snapshots, you get

59:14.860 --> 59:20.640
one click application installs. It is really awesome. Plus they have a 99.99 percent uptime

59:20.640 --> 59:25.860
SLA. So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code LINUX13 and oh by the way DigitalOcean

59:25.860 --> 59:29.660
offers a vast collection of tutorials for their community. Yeah, they're big on community.

59:29.660 --> 59:33.260
You know I'm a fan of that too. Here's the great part though. If you want to contribute

59:33.260 --> 59:36.420
to the articles that community has, you know reference stuff, if they decide something

59:36.420 --> 59:41.420
they want to publish to the community, you can get $50 per published piece. That is awesome.

59:41.420 --> 59:45.740
We'll have a link to that in the show notes too as well as a link to get this deal. Use

59:45.740 --> 59:50.060
the promo code LINUX13 when you're checking out over at DigitalOcean. You're going to

59:50.060 --> 59:53.660
love it. I've been using it for all kinds of things. It's a fixed cost so I know what

59:53.660 --> 59:57.580
it's going to be every single month, not like some of the other stuff where it varies depending

59:57.580 --> 01:00:02.740
on CPU and bandwidth and you get a surprise. It's got a great, amazing, awesome interface.

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:07.500
I get root access to my box and the performance is incredible and on the back end I love the

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:11.680
technology they're using. They're using Linux. They're using KVM. They're using industry

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.940
standard security technologies and I love it. So go over to DigitalOcean.com and use

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:21.180
the promo code LINUX13 to get a $10 credit on your account and thanks to DigitalOcean

01:00:21.180 --> 01:00:26.540
for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. You know what's awesome about that? You got the promo. You

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:30.300
walk in, right? You get started essentially for free really and then by the time you're

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:34.100
done and you want to continue with it, it's like a Starbucks coffee. I mean that's crazy.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:38.060
Yeah, it's no bigs, right? Right? Yeah, it's great. I love it. All right, no need to pronounce

01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:41.660
my name sis. First off, thanks for lasting all the shows on Jupiter Broadcasting. I've

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:48.140
been an avid listener ever since installing Ubuntu 9.10 and experienced Linux for the

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:53.540
first time back then. Oh man, oh man, did I freaking fall in love. Now after all these

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:58.060
long years, I have been mainly staying in Ubuntu. In particular, 1204 LTS has been treating

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:01.620
me well. I'm not much worried about having the bleeding edge like an Arch, but with all

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:06.380
these news and all of these recent privacy issues in Ubuntu, I have thought about switching

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:10.580
to a different distro. I know Chris, you use Linux Mint. Actually, I use Arch these days,

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:16.500
but I do like Cinnamon quite a bit and it caught his eye as well. He said, I've used

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:21.580
Unity starting in 1204 and I'm looking at the next LTS release and I really feel like

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:25.420
maybe after looking at what their plans are for the next LTS, maybe I should try Linux

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:30.180
Mint. But at the same time, I kind of want to know how Manjaro works. It's rolling release

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:34.940
instead of LTS, so I kind of want to test it out. I know Matt likes Manjaro. I do. So

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:41.460
here's the long and short of it. I would say, is it as easy as Ubuntu? Not exactly.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:46.260
It's close, but there's a couple of little snags that you might run into along the way.

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:49.420
The good news is that their forums probably have already covered it. So if you're willing

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:53.580
to check that out, you're probably fine. Like setting just little things. On the bonus

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:56.980
side of it, yeah, most of the stuff you expect to be set up like in Ubuntu will be set up

01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.060
for you automatically and you want to fool with it. That is nice. If you're wanting

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:05.300
to actually step out a little further and try something a little more hands-on, you

01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:10.580
can actually go full-on Arch with what we're using now, Integros. Integros has kind of

01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:18.260
been a hit in the JB community. It has. Totally based on straight up Arch. So one of the things

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:23.900
I'm not totally sold on with Manjaro is their approach to stability is having a repo that

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:27.100
they just kind of held back for a little bit. But I do not believe, and I could be wrong

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:31.660
and maybe time will fix this, but I do not believe their testing base, it's not big enough

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:35.860
to really suss out problems. So what you really just get is delayed packages. Now that's a

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:39.940
bit of a, that's a, I'm sure Manjaro camp hates hearing that criticism, but the reality

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:43.300
is that's, that's how I see it. They're not Debian, right? They don't have a Debian deployed

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:47.860
base where they literally have thousands and thousands of people running the testing branch.

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.740
That is true. They probably have hundreds of people using the testing branch, maybe

01:02:50.740 --> 01:02:55.820
500, who knows, right? Whereas with Integros, you stayed more married to the mainline Arch.

01:02:55.820 --> 01:02:58.940
So when Arch pushes out that security fix, you get it right away.

01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:02.140
But I would also point out that, and that's true, and you know, I definitely would agree

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:06.020
with that, but I would also say the difference between setup is, oh, there's no question

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:10.000
Manjaro is easier. I mean, it's, it's not, it's, oh yeah, it's not, it's not hard for

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.940
Integros just because I mean, I've done Arch. So for me doing Arch, it was no big deal.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:16.780
I mean, Integros has a very Ubuntu like installation.

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:21.100
It's real, the install is fine, but as far as like getting some of the niceties set up,

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:24.620
first of all, if you don't know what Pac-Man is from Space Invaders and you're coming into

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:28.860
this, okay, then what are you doing? That, you know, the tool they provide is a little,

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.580
you know, you might want to actually, you'll either want to study up ahead of time and

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:35.740
learn what the hell it is, or if you go with, you go with Manjaro, they provide an app where

01:03:35.740 --> 01:03:36.740
you don't really care.

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:39.420
Do you think maybe, do you think maybe he should go Mint?

01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:43.180
Ah, you know, because he's kind of coming from a, you know, an Ubuntu Debian kind of

01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:46.500
space and he's kind of doing the whole app scene, you know,

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.500
Elementary OS?

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:51.140
Yeah, I'd say probably Elementary OS over Mint. Mint is making me kind of nervous lately.

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:54.660
So Elementary OS is probably a good choice. Manjaro's cool if you want to try something

01:03:54.660 --> 01:04:00.640
cool or new. And Tegros is awesome as well. But if you want something you can just slide

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.980
in directly, probably Elementary. Mint, I don't know. I just lately, they're just, not

01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:09.140
because of all the other stuff that's been going on as far as the back and forth, but

01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:13.060
more just from stability. I'm not really feeling it. I've always had, I've always had nothing

01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:14.580
but problems getting it to work right.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.580
Oh snap. You talking about Cinnamon?

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:20.260
Yeah, or no, not just Cinnamon, but just the later versions of Mint. It's like, there's

01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:24.500
always some little thing that pops up that, yeah, I can work with it, but it's just kind

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.780
of like, look, if I want to work with it, I'll use a more advanced operating system.

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:31.940
He also asked, how would you compare rolling releases to LTS? And I would say apples and

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:37.420
oranges, right? So the LTS is you get all of your updates in one big go. And I mean,

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:42.340
one really big go, like you moved to a whole new OS. Whereas rolling is a lot of little

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:43.820
changes frequently.

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:47.820
Absolutely. And no matter what distro you choose to go with, first and foremost, say

01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:53.860
it with me, a dedicated home. You'll thank me later because you will forget to back something

01:04:53.860 --> 01:04:57.460
up and kick yourself. But by having dedicated home, your life's going to suck a whole lot

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.460
less.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:02.140
Hey, hey, hey, hey, maybe we should be recommending OpenSUSE 13.1. It's got, it's never been

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:07.260
released, three years of support. It automatically recommends a home partition for software availability.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:11.900
You've got software.opensuse.org. I mean, seriously, maybe this is an opportunity for

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:12.900
no need.

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:13.900
I think I agree.

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:17.300
Yeah, no need to pronounce my name correctly. Go check out OpenSUSE 13.1. I actually think

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:18.580
this is your perfect solution.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.860
I think I'm going to agree with that because it's kind of a balance of both, the best of

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:25.420
both worlds. You can actually try something new and cool, but at the same time, it's really,

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.420
really easy to use.

01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:30.380
Yeah. And Yast is a pleasure if you're not super comfortable with Linux.

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:32.900
You're going to discover things you didn't even know you could do.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:37.100
Just go check out the one click installs for the software you need, and I think you'll

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:41.420
be pretty happy. And because they got three years support, I think that's just right.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.740
For somebody who doesn't want something that changes that often, but you don't want to

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.240
get too stale, I think that's the sweet spot.

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.460
And you got your package access, which you got to love that.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:51.660
And you got your sugar daddy who's keeping the project alive long term.

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:52.660
That's right.

01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:53.660
So there's advantages there too.

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:54.660
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:55.660
So very good.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:56.660
Yes.

01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:58.480
All right, Matt. Well, I think that'll bring us to the end of this week's Linux Unplugged.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.100
Now you know, sir, of course, we love to get people's feedback.

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.100
Yes.
