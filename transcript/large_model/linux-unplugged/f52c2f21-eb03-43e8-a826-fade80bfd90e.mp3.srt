1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,380
okay so mr. West that is me mr. West should you choose to accept it I have a

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,020
challenge for you to take place during this episode what now for a little

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,980
episode yep and in episode now you can say no feel free to say no in this

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,000
episode I thought it would be particularly cool if we set up a server

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,500
for starbound now I have linked instructions it appears to be a pretty

6
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,900
straightforward process to install on an Ubuntu server the only tricky thing is

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,420
and this might be the hard part is it requires a Steam login to download the

8
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,060
binary on the account that's already purchased it now I could provide my

9
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:42,300
credentials uh-huh because I bought oh but I didn't buy it on Steam I got it on

10
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,800
GOG hmm this is like much as a custom team it's like 15 bucks this is this is

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,300
minecraft but way cooler it's space travel you go to a planet there's

12
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,780
multiplayer co-op you collect resources you build tunnels that sounds awesome

13
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,460
caves and we could set up a Jupiter broadcasting server on the Jupiter

14
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,140
broadcasting org domain and we could all play I mean be awesome this is a

15
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:13,260
time sucker that makes minecraft look like child's play and it just came out

16
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,300
for Linux starbound it was actually a Kickstarter for a while so I don't know

17
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,900
maybe that's where it sounds familiar from yeah so take a look at the link and

18
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,700
let me know if you want to take the challenge we'll find out at the other

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:33,740
end of the intro this is Linux Unplugged episode 155 for June 26, 2016

20
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,100
Oh welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's making sure to

21
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,980
drink all of its water and still leave room for beer my name is Chris my name is

22
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,660
Wes hey there Wes hey Chris boy these look like some great brews you brought in on

23
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,540
the show today with a fun name no yeah well how the narrows brewing that's not

24
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,180
it that's not the fun part what's the fun part the fun part is it's the

25
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,780
galloping Gertie golden ale it's great that's not what we're here to talk about

26
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,800
though coming up on this week's episode of the unplugged program we're gonna go

27
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,260
a little bit down history lane talk a little bit with mr. wimpy about his

28
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,420
travels to the snappy sprint event later on in the show we're gonna talk

29
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:22,720
about a very important open source project getting audited and ask the

30
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,420
mumble room if you could audit any open source using a set amount of money we

31
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,220
saw there's certain limitations which projects would you audit to see how

32
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,980
secure they really are we'll ask them when we get to there well I'm curious

33
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,400
got some really interesting new code open source this week from a company you

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,360
probably wouldn't think is open sourcing code open BSD says they're even more

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,320
secure than ever now because they're getting rid of Linux compatibility aka

36
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,900
the Linux vulnerability as they say yeah we'll talk about that coming up in the

37
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,980
show a friend of the podcast here's got a new release we'll talk about that and

38
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:04,800
last but not least at some point we're gonna find out if Wes can complete the

39
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,220
star bound challenge now he's already begun ladies and gentlemen so Wes you

40
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,500
have accepted the challenge challenge except I think it's gonna be great now I

41
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,460
haven't played the game a lot because I as soon as I saw the multiplayer thing

42
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,940
well how do you do this and there's just not a lot of servers out there yet so

43
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,380
we'll see if it's possible Wes is working what right away over there on his

44
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,740
spotnik laptop you know with a nice unplug sticker too yeah I like that

45
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:31,180
looking good that's looking really good all right well let's bring in our

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,740
virtual love so we can get into the stories time appropriate greetings

47
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:41,460
mumble room hi there well it's good to see you it is good to see you so I have

48
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,700
I have like some good news I want to start with because it's good news from

49
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,500
the least likely source and it happens to be right on the heels of us talking

50
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,180
about this last week which is always a lot of fun West spotted this particular

51
00:03:53,180 --> 00:04:00,100
story it's called surround 360 it's a project by Facebook to make software

52
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:06,500
pipeline an entire rendering pipeline to do VR 360 images and they also they have

53
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,780
in here they have the code up on github but also in here they have some really

54
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,220
cool specs it looks really cool and a super cool video of the camera that you

55
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,300
need to do this with and I that is all very fine and you can watch the video

56
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,940
it's got a great soundtrack yeah yeah super inspirational and they are they're

57
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,820
building the camera and they're putting it all together and it does look really

58
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,140
cool it's like a dome with a whole bunch of image sensors on there their

59
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,380
stitching software takes the images captured by 17 cameras in the surround

60
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,660
360 and transforms them into a stereoscopic 360 panorama suitable for

61
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,900
viewing in VR the software vastly reduces the typical 3d 60 3d 360 degree

62
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,100
processing time while maintaining 8k per eye quality which they think is optimal

63
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,860
for VR they say the rendering stereo 360 video is a hard problem for a variety of

64
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,660
reasons it takes a tone of RAM roughly 120 gigabytes of data per minute of

65
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:06,300
video so that's even double when you go to 60 frames per second there's little

66
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,500
room for error because any inconsistencies in the stitching really

67
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,980
look bad and stand out in order to create VR video practically we need to

68
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,620
be able to process all this data as fast as possible which is often an exact

69
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,340
opposition to maximum quality so this thing the software it is it's really

70
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:27,860
amazing they talk about the acquire tangular how do you know how you say

71
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,020
this equity or equity I can't even say equatorial equatorial triangular

72
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,060
equatorial triangular basically you know the earth turns out as a globe and it's

73
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,620
that when you start they have a diet I'd ever die I can't even bother to get

74
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,940
into it because I would just fail horribly I'm already beginning to but

75
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,180
that's not the important part what's the important part is yeah they can figure

76
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,260
all that you know spatial stuff out for the camera but check out some of the

77
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:57,220
interesting details the cameras output raw pattern images right on to like a

78
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,940
Linux box then the image signal processor which is part of the surround

79
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:05,460
360 rendering code converts the raw sensor data into a standard RGB PNG

80
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,020
image oh cool it applies gamma and color correction then the rendering system

81
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,340
reads the camera images and builds the projections from each the projections

82
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,780
cover a whole sphere with a rectangular structure and texture each camera

83
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,420
captures only a portion of the full sphere but this can then be

84
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,340
represented on the projection they put it all together equal rectangular

85
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,340
equal equal rectangular okay thank you I don't know why I can't I can't I just

86
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:34,500
simply can't but I like this and also remember we just recently talked about

87
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,980
how G streamer is building in stuff to support so the timing on this is rather

88
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,860
perfect because G streamer just put on a whole bunch of infrastructure stuff and

89
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,100
is beginning to work on more and then Facebook comes along and specs out the

90
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,740
camera and releases a whole rendering pipeline yeah exactly good guy Facebook

91
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,380
I don't get to say that very often I don't really we were getting into a

92
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,620
pre-show topic I can't even remember exactly what it was that wouldn't be

93
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,020
said that made me think of it but it essentially came down to my time is very

94
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,700
valuable and I have to be selective about how I spend it oh that's what it

95
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,180
was it was about setting up more servicing thing yeah we'll put that in

96
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:17,900
the in the post show hopefully boy that boy have I if I said that maybe a

97
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,300
million times how many times I can't even think even in this show I've said

98
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:28,700
that and that's that's why Joshua Drake's post over at command prompt inks blog

99
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:35,180
really made me think now he's part of the Postgres equal community and he's

100
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:42,500
talking he's writing a post that he titled the fall of open source once upon

101
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,860
a time he says Foss was born about was born it was about freedom it was about

102
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,020
exposing quality within source code allowed everyone equal rights and equal

103
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,620
access technique to the technology they were using the idea was if you were

104
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,540
capable you could fix code you could or you could pay someone to fix it an

105
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,580
ideology that there was something greater than yourself and there were an

106
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:04,660
inherent right to build what was human I sat in a bar slowly nursing beers with

107
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,460
other community members over a period of hours we spoke of many things we spoke

108
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,700
of never ever doing a new post sequel website we spoke of my disdain for

109
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,740
Amazon Web Services since reformed with the exception of s3 we spoke of life we

110
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:22,380
argued we had honest discourse and that's excellent there was nobody

111
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,780
complaining of political correctness there was nobody claiming to be

112
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,100
offended there was nobody leaving because feelings were hurt there was a

113
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,820
community member who passed out in his chair and dropped his phone we walked

114
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,420
him back to his room to make sure he was safe and all was good this retrospective

115
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,740
has been digging around in my gray matter since that night six months ago

116
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:44,220
that is until I began to itch and like any good community member I think I'm

117
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:51,060
gonna be scratching that itch that itch was my time is precious to me it seems

118
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,580
like a harmless thing to say of course your time is precious to you I would say

119
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:59,180
that's probably true of most people I know that my time is precious to me I

120
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,700
make a point of working part-time from May to September so I can take time for

121
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,180
my family the problem within the statement is context the statement came

122
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,740
from a well-known contributor and a very smart guy the guy the reference was in

123
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:16,340
relation to why someone would use software as a service and the general

124
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,740
idea was software as a service is awesome because it allows me to have

125
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:27,140
more time for me then he says the great compromise a lot of companies have come

126
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,140
up with through the ranks to become dominant players in the open source

127
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,220
industry meetup.com for user groups github for development heroku for

128
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:39,900
software as a service and slack for communications when when considered

129
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,540
independently there's nothing wrong with these services they offer a great value

130
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,020
they increase productivity and more code gets developed the problem is that not

131
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:52,060
one single of these services are open the use of these services creates an

132
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:56,180
intrinsic advocate position for closed source software in turn you see you will

133
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,660
see the use of these services increase whilst the use of open source

134
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,300
alternatives decreases consider slack which widely is considered the hot new

135
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:06,900
collaboration tool yet it doesn't adhere to open standards its network is closed

136
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,420
as is its software and he goes to argue the worst part is is that we had jabber

137
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,420
which is open source yes similar environment as slack supports voice

138
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,500
video plugins external protocols bridges image embedding video sharing file

139
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,820
sharing and yes chat it also supports Federation and allows communities

140
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,740
communicate between each other using XMPP he says the Postgres community

141
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,020
hosts their own code repositories websites and mailing lists we

142
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,820
collaborate in a true version and vision of open source and actively reject

143
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,820
moving our project and externally hosted facilities controlled by services which

144
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:46,060
are not open source the community puts forth the effort for the community the

145
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,900
moment that open source becomes primarily about my time is the moment

146
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,300
that open source is no longer a movement it's no longer an ideology it's no longer

147
00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:03,900
about fairness freedom equality rights or the greater good damn Wow Nemo I'll

148
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,540
let you jump in first I see you tagging me and then I'll let wimpy jump in there

149
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:14,860
go ahead new right I mean okay so what I say is the value of open source is not

150
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:22,260
you know your time is no longer wasted by or you can no longer trade money for

151
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:31,140
time it's that no one has a monopoly on support so if if someone else can't

152
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,740
support it you can and which then you're definitely using your time as is valuable

153
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,740
to you yeah that's definitely a value of open source I completely agree good

154
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:46,860
point wimpy you think maybe this is a little clickbait your thoughts sir yeah

155
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,460
a little bit I mean this there's a point there but all of the projects that he

156
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:57,020
cites so slack and github for example there are open source alternatives to

157
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,340
those manner most and rocket chat for slack for example yeah and get lab

158
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:07,540
instead of github yeah and well Gatorius has sadly died gone into bit rot but

159
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,380
yeah I mean the code there somewhere if somebody wants to resurrect it which of

160
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:16,940
course is what open source is great for right and you know matter most and get

161
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:24,260
lab integrate very nicely now so it is convenient you know we were just talking

162
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,660
about this earlier on the show you know having to do more of the thing you do is

163
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,660
your job in your spare time is not very appealing so I'm reluctant to do service

164
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:40,860
stuff in my spare time because what I do all day say that to say that these

165
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,060
closed services are the death knell for open source I think is a little bit off

166
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:52,020
the mark because the development platform the development infrastructure

167
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:57,140
is all open source so all of the tools and platforms that are used to deliver

168
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,380
those proprietary services are all open source so consequently while you have

169
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:08,020
the likes of slack and github creating their proprietary software they're also

170
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,100
inevitably going to be contributing back to a number of open source projects

171
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:19,180
along the way and if you are you know very much of the mindset that you don't

172
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,780
want to run proprietary services and one of the alternative you know one of the

173
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,940
alternatives like matter most or get lab he's out there and not quite doing it

174
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:33,340
for you then you can contribute to those projects so I felt I felt the title was

175
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,780
a bit click baiting and I also felt that the pros was a bit sort of flowery and

176
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,940
meandering in that point could have got to the point in about four sentences

177
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,780
rather than four pages yeah I do see what you're saying and I think it once

178
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,860
you've started it's just so hard to stop I think oh I think what a part of

179
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:55,940
partially it is it is a failure to recognize a division like so for myself

180
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,740
there are moments where I would opt to go with a hosted solution slack might be

181
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,300
an example of that where there's other moments where I'll opt to host and roll

182
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,220
of my own like we were just having a sink thing conversation a little bit ago

183
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:12,060
yeah and those are just different priorities and sometimes it's there's

184
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,620
it's for it's for ideology and sometimes it's simply for practical reasons and I

185
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:22,700
feel like we sometimes in this conversation forget that there is room

186
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,340
for both there is actually we can have both sets of users and it doesn't mean

187
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,220
one thing is dying or one group is defeating the other group both sets of

188
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,300
groups exist and coexist and use the software for different reasons and

189
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,620
that's what I that's how I look at it so I carry software is an ethical there's

190
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,340
that well then you can choose any other camp but that proprietary software can

191
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,820
also spin off open source software so for example I was looking for a tool

192
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,100
like slack for the Ubuntu mate team and in the end we went with hip chat because

193
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,300
I don't have to host it myself you know there's we use big bucket for pretty

194
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:03,500
much all of our source control so there's a lot of good overlaps there now

195
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,180
as it happens I've ended up taking some existing open source code and

196
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:14,040
improving it because I've created some IRC bridges from IRC channels into hip

197
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,440
chat rooms so that we can see what goes on in IRC within hip chat so

198
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,860
consequently I've taken something old and busted and made it work and that's

199
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:27,580
now some open source that's out there that wouldn't have been had I not been

200
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:33,660
using you know hip chat admittedly it supports hip chat so it ties into their

201
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:39,780
API's but open API's are better than closed API's yeah and you could make the

202
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:43,220
same argument for a lot of services there that's interesting so I wouldn't

203
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,740
be just totally side sidebar did you try out matter most and rocket chat and just

204
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,500
I thought or was it just sort of the I don't really want to spin up another

205
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,700
server it was that the barrier it's I'm perfectly capable of running the server

206
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:03,020
infrastructure sure but my time is limited in what I do in my spare time on

207
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:07,300
open source projects and I would rather that that time was focused on

208
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:13,060
development and pushing the project forward and that's why it's not the

209
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,220
death of open source right there that's just such a good point and you know why

210
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,020
don't we take a moment and I want to thank digital ocean because when it

211
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,980
comes to spinning up systems in record time nobody beats digital ocean with in

212
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,900
55 seconds you can have a rig deployed and you can ready to go and if you're

213
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,980
if you're gonna work with something like Docker there's so many things that

214
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,220
are Docker eyes now container eyes I guess they have such a nice stack they

215
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,060
have a good they have an Ubuntu LTS with the Docker with the Docker software

216
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,820
installed with the repos added and you can you know there's also one with

217
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,820
nginx for me and I think I've told you guys the story but for me I was working

218
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:54,100
on evaluating rocket chat and matter most and evaluating how they stood up to

219
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,660
different like you know different testing like how do I use it from the

220
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,700
mobile how do I use it with the IRC bridge yeah they're gonna ask once you

221
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:08,700
make them use exactly and you know what it's funny we we almost went with one

222
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,020
system I put in production at one point and the thing that I the thing that was

223
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,380
really nice to know was that I could revert back to a core system and reset

224
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,660
it up within seconds to make sure it was done right I didn't have to put together

225
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,700
some sort of hack solution ultimately Sean set up a matter most server for us

226
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,460
on digital ocean that's available right now to patrons and that has been running

227
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:32,620
really great it's a really good system it's super straightforward to set up and

228
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:37,020
so far it's scaled brilliantly so if you use our promo code over digital ocean

229
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,260
you get a $10 credit the promo code is snap ocean it's one word lowercase you

230
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,940
put that in your account control panel it'll apply $10 to your account yeah

231
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:48,740
their pricing is really really straightforward and the value is crazy

232
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,940
high so that $10 will get you quite a ways and they got data centers in New

233
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:57,420
York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam London Toronto Germany and India they

234
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,300
have a really nice interface the back so if you have really no experience or if

235
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,580
you're an expert you're gonna actually be pretty satisfied also their API is

236
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,540
really nice to work with we integrate it in with our workflow a lot of people do

237
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,020
there's some good open source code already written like an applet where you

238
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,020
can add it right to your menu bar and get the status of your drop nice I love

239
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,380
that lots of nice mobile apps to that make rebooting like on the go nice and

240
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,020
easy and straightforward calling other things down actually I've just used it

241
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,860
to like my causal server locked up on me one time and yeah and I just open it up

242
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:30,220
on my Android app and just reboot the top it's also nice if you're like well

243
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,300
is it a problem on my end okay yeah yeah and then the other things really cool

244
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:40,500
and gives you a lot of power if you know how to use it is their HTML 5 console

245
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,940
that watches it from post login yeah it's it's how you get certain real

246
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,860
certain things done that are really cool and advanced at digital ocean I just

247
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,340
think it's a great service use the promo code snap ocean let you do it that's

248
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,300
it's not like a advanced feature you have to admit it's right there and it's

249
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,180
just part of the service part of it is they're just really really really smart

250
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,740
about when they implement a feature they do it right and they just what they

251
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,620
focus on like they just rolling out right now block storage you can get up

252
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,660
to 16 terabytes of SSD storage they do SSDs for everything and man when you

253
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,180
know and then when they roll it out they roll it out with just really good

254
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:15,460
documentation check out their community section look at their dog they have

255
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,820
speaking of Postgres they have the article on segment Postgres here's

256
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,540
Docker composer or Docker compose I guess doctor so it's fun that you can

257
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,540
just deploy it so easily look at this how to protect your server against the

258
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,980
HTTP proxy vulnerability boom right there man that's good timing check it out

259
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,580
digital ocean.com just use the promo code snap ocean and a big thank you to

260
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,340
digital ocean for sponsoring the unplugged program snap ocean gives you

261
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,340
that $10 credit arch strike has an ISO that's all I really had to say on this

262
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,060
just you know we've talked to these guys back when they were arch assault I

263
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,460
think Sammy assured which is pretty cool and for those not familiar strike was

264
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:57,540
arch assault it's still based on arch Linux which is totally as Morris's here

265
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:01,340
renowned and lightweight and highly customizable distribution however the

266
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,020
goal of the project is be a security layer on top of arch has 1200 security

267
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:08,380
oriented tools for ethical hackers and security researchers but the thing

268
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,340
that's newsworthy here is they've actually released their first ISO it's

269
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:16,500
available for download today it's 64 bit and 32 bits as the first of its kind so

270
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,860
congratulations to the arch strike team for getting your first ISO out the door

271
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,340
Wes you you knew this is probably gonna give me a riled up when you link this

272
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,220
one in our chat thread earlier today I do like to rile you up oh man that's the

273
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:37,500
open bsd 6.0 tightens its security by losing Linux that's that's the pitch

274
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,300
most significantly amongst the latest security related changes for open bsd is

275
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,900
the removal of the Linux emulation support prior versions open bsd made it

276
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:48,540
possible to run Linux applications via a compatibility layer but the release

277
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,900
notes that open bsd 6.0 indicates the Linux up system was removed as a

278
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,340
security improvement as a call from our friends over bsd now I think it wasn't

279
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,340
much used and hadn't been actively maintained yeah yeah yeah make sense for

280
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,700
them to cut it but the you don't have to do all the poking though they would

281
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,100
make us a fun on Twitter yeah open bsd also has ditched the systrace system

282
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,740
policy enforcement tool for the second security and the removal of the user

283
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,820
mount option which have enabled allowed non privileged users to mount file

284
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,300
systems it's yet another security enhancement open bsd project lead Theo

285
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:27,300
Durant say that the user mount option allows any non privileged program to

286
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,780
call them mounted unmount system calls meaning there is no way any user can be

287
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:36,780
expected to keep their system safe or reliable with this feature no user mount

288
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:41,740
for you my theory is that since Windows started doing Linux emulation open bsd

289
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,380
is like no we can't we can't be in the same campus this and they're out that's

290
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,980
a good theory that's actually pretty solid I like that a lot all right I I

291
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,260
don't I don't really have a lot to say about this but I did actually feel like

292
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,780
it was a little tiny teensy bit antagonizing with the harassing on

293
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:04,020
Twitter and and then they and then they tweeted out and said the distros what

294
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,980
they say operating systems that now have the Linux vulnerability and they listed

295
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,740
free bsd Linux and Windows or something like that

296
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,260
nice yeah haha I just made my computer more secure you know how how I moved

297
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:21,380
wine yeah haha it's kind of like that yeah not quite though because it's

298
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,860
something that's required by the kernel as opposed to wine user space under your

299
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,100
own user account so implementing user space you know how bsd loves

300
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,180
re-implementing things in user space right is it though but is it not

301
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:35,780
installed by default is it installed by default on open bsd and why the hell

302
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,620
would that be I don't know if that's true because it's not installed by

303
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,620
default in their free bsd so I mean I don't understand how those BS you know

304
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,260
what I got to watch the bsd now program because they'd probably set me straight

305
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,700
I'm sure like sounds like they've already been covering the story for a

306
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,980
little bit they've you know they see that stuff come sure do but I did feel a

307
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,100
little like haha we gotcha we gotcha there's been a lot of interesting

308
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,460
security use today there's a security vulnerability that supposedly bypasses

309
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:05,940
HTTPS on Mac Windows and Linux you see that yeah so security is you know makes

310
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,180
me glad the tech snap exists makes me glad that I've got my Linux mint updates

311
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,980
installed that way I know I'm secure there you go off topic does Alan allow

312
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:18,460
you to set up no no I don't think he does he should offer that is this hosted

313
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,260
streaming solution so something happened and I feel like I should probably

314
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:26,780
mention it on this show because it's relevant to the audience's interest you

315
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:32,060
guys want to know I six months after it happened I finally I have finally gone

316
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:36,880
off my butt I finally have spent hours putting together a new episode of the

317
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,460
rover log of my trip to scale yes yeah and you can see some highlights of Mark

318
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,460
shoulder worse keynote where he's talked about he this was back in January where

319
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,380
he was talking about snap packages and also Cory Doctorow's keynote kind of

320
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,220
made me rethink my stance on DRM and I talked about that's that's rover log 16

321
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,300
just came out and you know I was I was watching this man that's that scale

322
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,460
thing is a huge looking back at art my classroom that is a huge event it is it

323
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:07,780
is a monster wimpy are you are you by any chance gonna make it to scale next

324
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:14,100
year I don't know he's hoping yeah yeah I would love to I mean I haven't made it

325
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,180
by my but I think I'm gonna go anyways if you guys want to see that's just a

326
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,700
little taste of it you can check out rover log 16 which went up recently and

327
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,140
rover log 17 is already posted for our patrons at patreon.com slash today which

328
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:29,740
is the one where I drove into the tornado which was a lot of fun so yeah

329
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:35,380
so we'd be willing I would check that one out so speaking of snap packages mr.

330
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:41,740
wimpy is here and he was not here last week no no he was not because he was at

331
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:47,320
a sprint event held by canonical to bring people together to talk about snap

332
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,400
packages so why don't we let's tell you what let's open up the next block I'm

333
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:56,900
gonna mention real briefly here ting go to linux.ting.com to get the discount

334
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,300
for the Linux unplugged show and support the show plus you'll have Linux in your

335
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,140
URL history so that way when somebody starts typing L in your browser instead

336
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,740
of your dirty porn habits showing up Linux shows up so linux.ting.com go

337
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:13,180
there to support this show ting is mobile that makes sense as my mobile

338
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,500
service provider has been for over two years because I just pay for what I use

339
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,500
and six dollars for each line my minutes my messages my megabytes which means if

340
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,780
I'm smart and I do stuff over Wi-Fi like I pre-download my podcast and I listen

341
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,100
to downloaded and like my favorite Spotify playlist catch those local

342
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,860
suckers over Wi-Fi I do extreme quality too which is and I'm like guilt-free

343
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:36,140
extreme quality oh it's nice and then I just basically pay for the little bits

344
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,420
of backup data that I use when I do go on the cellular network they have two

345
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,300
networks to GSM and CDMA you get to pick from what you want all their devices are

346
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,380
unlocked they have really great fanatical customer service they're

347
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,060
backed by two cows which is an internet company that's been around since before

348
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,100
the dot-com boom I mean a forever they're really in it for the long haul

349
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,380
which is super nice especially when you want a mobile provider that's gonna be

350
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,140
around for a while when the deals like this they have a savings calculator you

351
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:01,860
can try go over there and check them out you know I was just mentioning the

352
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,540
rover log that entire rover trip I did down to scale was off a ting Wi-Fi it's

353
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,700
really nice and when you're when you are traveling it's nice to jump around from

354
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,940
GSM and CDMA it's a little tricky because we you end up having two numbers

355
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:19,180
and it but it's only six dollars for the line it's not it's it's really I mean

356
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:23,380
plus you get I don't want to put a sip number in front give that to everyone or

357
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,780
what I do is I do Google voice yeah but actually I would prefer I would prefer

358
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:31,580
the sip thing I think these days so check them out at Linux dot ting dot-com

359
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,420
thanks ting so I wanted to go and do the ting spot right there so we could just

360
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,220
sort of open up because I have so many questions for wimpy that I didn't want

361
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,260
to have to interrupt him so prepare yourself wimpy I I guess I want to start

362
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,380
with head what what the hell is a sprint event and how come I didn't hear

363
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,620
about this and we're only certain like Linux elites invited to this thing what

364
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:55,060
is a snappy sprint and how did you find out about it and why didn't I hear about

365
00:26:55,060 --> 00:27:03,460
it right it was publicized so it was publicized through the Ubuntu insights

366
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:08,580
and a couple of the yeah I think soft picked it up right yeah so a couple of

367
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:17,020
others picked it up as well so I was aware of it from that but then shortly

368
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:24,220
afterwards the Ubuntu community team contacted me and asked me if I would be

369
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,500
interested in taking up a place at the sprint as a community contributor I

370
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,580
guess what I was kind of getting at is I kind of had the sense that this thing

371
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,260
came together pretty quick you know there was there was a brief announcement

372
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:39,620
about it but all of a sudden it's boom let's do this and it seems like they

373
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:42,320
were pretty proactive about reaching out to certain people to make sure they they

374
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,820
could make it yeah I think I I think I heard about it about a month before it

375
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:53,940
happened okay yeah so I think it's probably best if you have questions you

376
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,500
ask because obviously I was there I went to a lot of stuff my head is full of

377
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:03,500
things to do with snaps I could fire off in all directions well it's probably

378
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:07,740
best if you've got questions you focus the the conversation I have in front of

379
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:12,380
me I have a Trello board with the snappy sprint topics on it so I have plenty of

380
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:16,940
things to get into with you but if you don't mind and you can only you share as

381
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,100
much as you feel like sharing but probably 99% of the people listening

382
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:27,220
have never been to something like this before and so I mean could you could you

383
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,840
just kind of paint a picture you had you flew somewhere you had that you know

384
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,380
there had to be like a ticket purchase there was hotel space and what what is

385
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,300
sort of the setting like and the experience like going to an event like

386
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,020
this okay so the very first thing that happened is I was asked if I wanted to

387
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:48,500
attend I talked to my wife and daughter and said can I take a week off work not

388
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:57,660
with you and go to this thing and they said yeah all right then so then I let

389
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,080
the community team know that yes I wanted to attend and then I was contacted by

390
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:07,100
canonicals travel organizers and they basically sorted out flights and

391
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,140
accommodations in the room so I didn't have to I didn't have to pay for

392
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:15,060
anything in that respect so I had my ticket sent to me and a couple of days

393
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:20,700
before the event of full itinerary of you know what was going on you know

394
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,820
everything you needed to know the one the one thing is that all of these

395
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:32,780
events canonical have a policy of room-sharing so I was sharing with poppy

396
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:40,740
so yeah that was nice so yeah flew out there on the Sunday Sunday morning I

397
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:47,180
left the UK got to the event hotel mid afternoon Sunday the first evening that

398
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,220
Sunday evening there was a drinks reception in one of the rooms the people

399
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,100
attending had drinks and snacks get a chance to mingle a bit yeah yeah get to

400
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,900
meet people the first thing that struck me is I knew there was going to be about

401
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:08,780
60 to 70 people at this thing and I reckon about mmm about 18 or so were

402
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,020
from outside of canonical so that was quite surprising you know and that

403
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,140
weren't just flavors they were you know from other distributions and projects

404
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:23,740
completely outside of canonical so that first evening was nice and I got to you

405
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,900
know obviously over the course of the last couple of years working on Ubuntu

406
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,660
mate I've got to know a lot of the Ubuntu devs through IRC but I've never

407
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,180
met them and the only drawback of attending this event is you know as that

408
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:41,260
as they do you favors and help you out you idly say you know if we ever meet I

409
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:47,460
will buy you a beer yes well I was but I ended up buying a lot of beer last week

410
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:56,700
which is absolutely fine yeah yeah so so yeah my my investment in the trip was to

411
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,500
make sure I paid down my debt of beers to all of the people I owe beers to good

412
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,220
man would be yeah and so in terms of how the event works so you're in it's a

413
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,580
large hotel I think there was five or six rooms in total there was one very

414
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:15,860
large room which could accommodate everybody and then four or five smaller

415
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:21,020
rooms which could take between I think about 20 people or so in each room this

416
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:26,620
is legitimately a mini conference yeah yeah it really was every morning starts

417
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:31,340
with an opening session that says what we're going to do this day so you've got

418
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,580
the Trello board there they basically explain where the rooms are what's going

419
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:41,060
to happen and throughout the day there are three tracks running and each

420
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:48,380
session runs for about 45 minutes to an hour so it's very fast-paced and it's

421
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,660
sort of an introduction to a topic and some discussion around a topic and

422
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:58,340
actions and proposals are taken at the end of each of those sessions there's a

423
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,060
mid-morning break and canonical provided drinks and refreshments and snacks

424
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:07,380
mid-morning break and the mid-afternoon break and they provided lunch as well

425
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:17,380
and breakfast so yeah they looked after everybody and then mid-afternoon there

426
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,380
was the option to go into the larger room and participate in a two-hour

427
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,780
hacking session so if you'd learned something or taken an action or wanted

428
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,340
to progress something you had a couple of hours each day where you could

429
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,180
collaborate and you know and work on that stuff was this one of the times

430
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,620
Frank showed up and talked to people about next cloud and Frank actually

431
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,220
turned up sort of at the end of one of the days so I just happened to see him

432
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,460
sort of wandering around the hotel looking slightly lost and I just

433
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,620
overheard somebody say oh no Frank from own cloud should be from next cloud

434
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:56,060
should be turning up in a minute and I bumped into him so I said I I said I

435
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:00,380
introduced myself and then said I know where you need to be art so I escorted

436
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,300
him to the right room and introduced him to whoever he needs to talk to did he

437
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,180
have a camera with him not that I noticed you don't have a bag over his

438
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:13,860
shoulder I imagine that could have held the camera so a very interesting so it

439
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:18,300
sounds like a pretty pretty high rated event in terms of a nice room nice

440
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:22,820
accommodations room sharing but drinks and all kept can't be ignored I look at

441
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:27,820
the list here of travel stuff which is nice that it's public and I'm not getting

442
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:33,420
a set a central theme or a central sense of this was with a big focus towards

443
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:39,340
unity 8 and mobile or a big focus on cloud I'm getting kind of a lot of

444
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,660
different priorities here from individual Internet of Things type

445
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,580
devices to full desktop applications did you walk away with the sense having

446
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:54,300
attended that there was like a core theme there wasn't a core theme because

447
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,380
as you can see from the Trello there were lots of different topics you know

448
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,820
the things that are marketing red that's the community and cross distro stuff and

449
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:09,740
that tended to have a desktop focus so that was more desktop focus the plan for

450
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:15,700
a runtime to desktop snap issues interesting okay and and gnome runtime

451
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:21,060
was part of that session and arch Linux and the open suzer OBS snap integration

452
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:25,820
was in there as well and in the yellow sessions those were more specifically

453
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:33,580
about the evolution of snap D itself and snap craft so the sort of the

454
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:38,220
fundamental tools and there was a lot of interesting discussions there and then

455
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,660
there were some new tools announced I don't know if these exist pre-existed

456
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:52,140
but there's a thing called snap web now so that is a a web UI that talks to the

457
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:59,100
Unix domain socket of snap D and presents a complete UI of your snap

458
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:04,300
environment so that you can very handy install snap wonderful access the store

459
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:09,320
see featured apps and it even does clever stuff like if this is on a

460
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:17,260
device it will show you the components that are specific to that device so

461
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:22,940
there was some examples of router switches and stuff like that that look

462
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,140
very interesting Wow so that there was a few things that

463
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,080
did come out that surprised me you touched on it there just for a moment

464
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,400
you said gnome runtime I thought that was a flat I thought that was a flat

465
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,980
pack thing so the thing about so runtime I think is this the the flat pack

466
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:46,540
terminology I think the terminology that's going to come out of snaps is

467
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:52,340
these will be called platform snaps but you asked if there was sort of a general

468
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:58,180
theme no but one of the key concepts that cropped up all the way through the

469
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:04,340
week is what they called content sharing or the content interface so that's a

470
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:12,380
new feature and that is the mechanism by which shared runtimes or platforms or

471
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:19,820
things like artwork snaps can be created so that if you are creating

472
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:27,380
application snaps for the gnome desktop you can now use the gnome 320 platform

473
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:34,300
snap as a dependency and through bind mounting in the way that snaps you know

474
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:40,100
integrate that will be a common platform available to all of the things that

475
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:46,740
require it so an end user implementation would I have a gnome 320 runtime mounted

476
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,420
file system squash fs file system and whatever the application squash fs file

477
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:55,580
system mounted at the same time two different mounts for one application it

478
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:01,060
would appear as one but underneath yes it'd be two oh yeah yeah so it handles

479
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,100
the magic behind the scenes and also things like taking the artwork out so

480
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:10,460
taking the themes and the icon sets out of the applications and even out of the

481
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,300
platform snaps and making those separately available and then there are

482
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:22,780
mechanisms to then create trust relationships between those snaps so if

483
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:28,580
they need to move in lockstep you can use assertions to actually say these

484
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:33,940
things have to move at the same versions if that's if that's the requirement

485
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:40,060
yeah yeah not just in desktop but also in server deployment it was it was a

486
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:43,980
particular that the particular conversation around is called gating in

487
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:51,500
snap speak but that was particularly for devices where you may have a kernel

488
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:56,060
component and an application component that requires another and then the

489
00:37:56,060 --> 00:38:00,700
interaction between those three and to make sure you can't accidentally have a

490
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,700
snap upgrade in that chain that is not compatible mm-hmm I hadn't really thought

491
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,660
of that particular problem that's that is interesting so did you get a sense of

492
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:16,220
what is the application that can't be snapped is it or what is the piece of

493
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,740
software delivered for Linux and like I'm thinking of things like Nvidia

494
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:25,380
drivers or oh yeah what are the limits what where where do snaps stop and you

495
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,380
have to use something else well there's there's two sides to this so there is

496
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:38,780
the classic system that can install snaps for example and you obviously have

497
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:44,820
some host requirements and the host can be a combination of the classic system

498
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:52,260
and the core snap and then you have a fully snapped environment where the

499
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:58,180
whole device is a series of snaps that build the complete environment so you

500
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:04,860
only have snaps I don't think that anything was discussed that was an

501
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:09,580
outright it can't be done there are things that can't be done now but but

502
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:15,140
all of those all of the things that were discussed were this is the plan and we

503
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,460
will you know cross that bridge when we get to it sort of thing so there's

504
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:24,140
there's some more complex interactions to consider when like full desktop

505
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:29,140
environments are snapped in their entirety and how things like display

506
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:33,140
managers and session managers and setting demons interact with one another

507
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:40,240
yeah you know so that's a little ways out but in general I didn't know that

508
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,780
requires like a kernel module at boot you know like a like a ZFS snap or Nvidia

509
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:49,980
driver snap or a VMware snap that has a you know the VM DK kernel module yeah so

510
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,380
on on devices at the moment you can have kernel snaps and gadget snaps so I think

511
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:59,860
that you know in that fully snapped device platform that's that's a

512
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:03,620
possibility that's that's something that's been you know solved so I want to

513
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,140
I just want to throw just as an example a question at you that might illustrate

514
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:12,540
maybe the variety of people in attendance I see a card here for

515
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:16,980
integrating snap support into the openSUSE of build service is that

516
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,820
actually going to happen or was it just theoretical code that is never going to

517
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:24,660
be integrated upstream to the build service no it was demonstrated it's

518
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:30,100
there already and in fact that work the the one of the screenshots I sure saw

519
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,660
was a build log for from three weeks previous so they'd actually done some

520
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:40,940
work prior to turning up wow okay all right so then the other thing that seems

521
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:46,060
to be perhaps an olive branch to the fedora camp is I see entries in here for

522
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,780
getting SC Linux confinement now just recap for the audience one of the ideals

523
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,460
behind snap packages is that they are confined to their own space and that

524
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,580
they're not only they're a little safer for the end-user but maybe isolated from

525
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:04,740
security vulnerabilities a bit more and that confinement is currently I guess

526
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,340
you would say created or done by app armor I don't know exactly what they

527
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:12,140
with a term is the app armor is used to create that confined environment which

528
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:17,220
is not really the paradigm that fedora uses red hat is really behind SC Linux

529
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:21,420
and so is fedora and SC Linux is also capable of delivering confinement like

530
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,900
that but I you know it's it's not losing I don't think snap was created with that

531
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,380
intention so how how how likely is that do you think that maybe they could get

532
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,020
SC Linux support and did you get a sense from people that were there from fedora

533
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,820
that this is something the project might actually adopt I got the strong

534
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,980
impression that support is coming and there was some discussion around how

535
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:50,780
that can be implemented and one of the lead developers from canonical had done

536
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,260
the initial discovery work and was confident that it could be implemented

537
00:41:54,260 --> 00:42:00,740
and I don't know what the schedule that will be but it was definitely considered

538
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:06,820
doable and something that will be done at some point the the speed at which the

539
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:11,620
snap package I don't even know you can't even call it one thing but the whole

540
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:16,620
ecosystem snap ecosystem is evolving seems to be really fast faster than app

541
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,860
image and flat pack and it already seems to be more feature complete

542
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,060
especially when you take in some of the additional stuff that's coming out when

543
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,860
when you when you arrive there was there anything that changed your in your

544
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:33,820
mindset after you left for example is there going to be perhaps a shift in how

545
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:38,580
Ubuntu Mate implement snaps is it going to be a maybe a greater snap investment

546
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:41,220
is it going to be still only certain applications like is anything in that

547
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:47,940
regard changing so when I went out there I'd got like three or four things that

548
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,780
I want to understand so that I could better you know think about how Ubuntu

549
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:58,060
Mate could benefit all of those questions were answered on day one hmm

550
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:01,740
so I was thinking well this is a good start because everything I came here for

551
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,620
is now being you know I know what the road ahead is so I've now got four more

552
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:09,700
days to find out all this other stuff so to give you an idea one of the things I

553
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:18,260
want to do is integrate snap support into the software boutique and I wrote a

554
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:25,660
prototype Python client that enables you to install and remove packages using you

555
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:33,060
know the snap D API but whilst I was there I was talking to Robert Ansell one

556
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:37,940
of the Ubuntu developers and he's talking about actually making a lib snap

557
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:44,180
DC library and then exposing that via object and QT object so that all of the

558
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:49,700
other projects can wrap it and use it so you know things like that are just

559
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:54,900
terrific because that's a way that anyone can then exploit the facilities

560
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,900
of the snap API within their applications pretty much irrespective of

561
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,780
what language you're you're implementing in right everything's got got an

562
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:11,060
interface to see yeah exactly and other things that I wanted to understand was

563
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:17,220
particularly this concept of runtime or platform snaps yeah and you can see that

564
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:22,580
was the first session on day one so after one hour it was like oh right

565
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:27,580
that's how we're doing it fine so then the rest of the week was was starting on

566
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:34,860
some of that work hmm and can you help me understand a little bit of the the

567
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:41,300
security paradigm around snap packages so they have to be granted access to

568
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:45,340
things on the file system and it looks like from the docs that I was reading

569
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,860
from the elementary team when they're looking at how to integrate snaps with

570
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,660
elementary OS is there could be certain some of their programs that they make

571
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,700
in-house for their desktop might need special access in ways that maybe snaps

572
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,380
don't facilitate now I only I only briefly skim the documentation but it

573
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,860
sounds like there's a limited ways snap software can access the system currently

574
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:12,900
and some of those might be limiting am I tracking at all yeah so they're called

575
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:19,020
interfaces so when you use snap craft to create your package you tell your

576
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:25,980
software what interfaces it can connect to so one example is the home interface

577
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:31,940
which exposes some of your home directory and I'll maybe we'll talk

578
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:36,820
about what that means in some expect some respects and that interface is

579
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:42,500
auto-connected so what that means is when you install a snap package that

580
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:48,540
uses the home interface it automatically connects that up and that snap has

581
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,620
access to those areas of your home directory that are available to snap

582
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:59,900
packages there are other interfaces that do not auto connect so you can install

583
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:05,700
the snap package you can look at the status of the snap package and see that

584
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:11,180
is requesting that it has this facility and it's down to you to actually

585
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:15,820
establish that connection manually that's how it is right now there are

586
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,860
there quite a lot of interfaces and that's where a lot of the focus has been

587
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:23,340
if you look at the change logs on snap D and snap draft it's really been about

588
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:28,940
interfaces and they're being added a lightning rate and will continue to be

589
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:35,900
added to support the various use cases but the end goal is to have mediation so

590
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:41,860
if you've used Ubuntu for devices on a phone or a tablet when that has

591
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:47,620
permissions that it requires it actually tells you oh this application wants to

592
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:53,260
connect to your camera do you want to allow that and you say yes or no there's

593
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:57,300
an interface to facilitate that question not at the moment but that's what's

594
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:03,060
going to come so so you will tell your snap what it can request and then it's

595
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:07,180
down to the user whether or I don't know if there's an override because for

596
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,260
example some things you just absolutely have to be able to tell your snap it can

597
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:16,540
have this thing otherwise it won't work at all so I'm not you know I didn't see

598
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,340
I didn't sit in on all of these sessions so I don't know all of the nuances but

599
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,420
the idea is that there will be prompts to actually guide the user that snap is

600
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,140
requesting this thing do you want to approve that so hardware aside it sounds

601
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,820
like it has it automatically has connection to your home directories like

602
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:38,860
any user space application might so yes and no okay okay when you install a snap

603
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:43,980
that has access to the home interface it actually has access to a directory which

604
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:50,020
is slash snap slash the name of the snap slash the revision of that snap and

605
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:55,260
that's where the the data and the dot files and things like that so that's the

606
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:01,140
equivalent of dollar home as far as that snap which is concerned but it can

607
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,420
actually see all of the other directories in your home directory with

608
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:12,660
the exception of any dot directories or dot files so snaps can't see any dot

609
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:17,340
files or dot directories except for those that exist within their own data

610
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:24,700
directory okay so that okay that actually answers most of the questions I

611
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,300
had around the security of it and I'm you know I'm sure I'll play with it more

612
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:32,860
is it as it comes along so I don't I use any other any other thoughts you want to

613
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:38,580
share about the trip or about the event itself it seems like one of the things

614
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:44,540
that I always experience when I go to something like this is the unexpected

615
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:48,940
collaboration that happens sort of in the hallways getting to meet people like

616
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:53,220
you mentioned earlier and paying off beer debts I'm just kind of just kind of

617
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,620
picking your brain as far as any other experiences you want to share on the

618
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:58,740
trip and sort of any elements about that about rubbing shoulders anybody you got

619
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:02,180
to meet or anything you want to share in that regard yeah I mean obviously the

620
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:08,500
social track is just as important as the getting stuff done track during it really

621
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:14,500
was and so a group of people that I got to meet and spent the week with most of

622
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,300
the week actually because we were in the same room a lot of the time was three of

623
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:26,100
the guys from elementary so Daniel for a Cody Garver and Cortana sorry I've

624
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,660
forgotten your surname so those three guys from elementary were there all week

625
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:37,500
and yeah Daniel and I exchanged some notes on you know stuff he's doing on

626
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:42,140
with elementary and low-key coming up and I had a look through what they've

627
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:46,140
been working on and I showed him some of the new stuff I've been working on so

628
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:51,300
here's a little tip for you Chris you are talking about the nice high DPI

629
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:58,180
support in Linux mint 18 you really want to have a look at low-key okay because

630
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:04,460
their high DPI support actually knows that it's on a high DPI capable machine

631
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:10,860
that was my complaint automatic yeah and although Daniel showed me the bits

632
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:15,860
where it needs you know there's a few icons that aren't scaled correctly in

633
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:21,060
spots yet but by and large it's there and it's looking very polished and very

634
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:28,420
complete now so and because all of their applications are all you know use that

635
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:32,380
same design language and they've been through the process of making sure that

636
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,060
you know it's all high DPI they're out-of-the-box default applications that

637
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:43,060
are all high DPI and it looks looks the business you know I completely agree

638
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:48,980
with that rei code in the rei code in the chat room elementary OS with those

639
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:53,200
potential nice touches to detail combined with snapped applications

640
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,900
could make elementary OS a much more viable platform for me so I'm gonna be

641
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,940
really interested to try that out good for them so so three different reps I'm

642
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,540
sure you probably I'm sure probably just too busy to talk to Clem I'm sure he was

643
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:09,380
yeah it seems like there was an intention to reach out to like open wrt

644
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:14,340
that's really interesting yeah yeah so so I think that I think it's fair to say

645
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,940
that you know I've talked about the content interface sharing and you're

646
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:21,780
asking for a theme definitely on Wednesday Wednesday night there was a

647
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:27,620
meal everyone that was there was in the big room together we had this fantastic

648
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:33,460
outdoor barbecue and then did lightning talks and most of the people doing

649
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:39,180
lightning talks were from the community contributors that had been invited and

650
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:46,640
it was very clear that that community participation and involvement was

651
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:54,820
important to developing snaps and making snaps work for everyone so you know it

652
00:51:54,820 --> 00:52:02,020
was it was very much a bring this to the wider ecosystem don't just focus on a

653
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:06,180
bun too it was that was clearly a strong message that came through this last week

654
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:13,140
that's really great when we thank you for for sharing your trip with us it

655
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:17,380
sounds like the exact kind of event that needed to happen and it sounds like a

656
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:21,300
lot of great people are invited and it wasn't just a big Ubuntu echo chamber

657
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,260
which is brilliant and I think one of the metrics that I use to measure that

658
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:30,420
is reading the blogs of people from arch and fedora who came back and said this

659
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:34,140
is really something and that's pretty cool and it's exciting to see that kind

660
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:38,220
of on the verge and from an end-users perspective you know eventually this is

661
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:42,660
gonna work our way into our into our desktops and when developers and others

662
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,180
and packagers are excited to use something yes get software to us yeah

663
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:51,260
that's awesome I know and it's gonna give it a clear path for people who want

664
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:54,620
to bring software over to Linux something to tell Mike finally yeah I

665
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:59,380
will and so on on that point one of the last things that was discussed on the

666
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:04,020
last day was talking about proprietary software and the actual discussion was

667
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:09,180
if I've made a snap for a thing I can't redistribute what do I do about it but

668
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:13,580
then the conversation evolved into there are these companies that are basically

669
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:18,540
dodging packaging their software in the appropriate way for the various Linux

670
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:22,860
distributions because it's hard and there's too many things to target so you

671
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,740
get these dot run files or you get a deb file for one architecture that maybe

672
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,860
only works for one particular version of Ubuntu and there was this whole

673
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:35,540
discussion about how we could potentially create snaps for those

674
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:39,620
proprietary applications and then send them to those organizations and say you

675
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:46,780
could do it this way yeah really and you know that seems like that it's too hard

676
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:50,500
excuse with things like the shared platforms and snap craft going cross

677
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:55,740
distribution is going to be a weaker and weaker argument and then on the end user

678
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:02,540
side gnome software version 3.21.4 will have support for installations of flat

679
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:08,100
pack repository files in the flat pack repo format and installation of snaps

680
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:12,380
and then yeah and this is going to be this is going to make the end user

681
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:16,860
perspective at least on the gnome desktop and anybody using gnome software this is

682
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,300
gonna make this really straightforward also which is kind of neat and now a

683
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:24,700
relevant thing sandboxing information will be shown for the certain apps along

684
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,740
with the origin information when the apps are available for more than one

685
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:34,260
source in gnome software which is I mean I can't wait to see that I can I'm

686
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:37,700
getting really excited about the direction this is going and I don't

687
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,940
even I don't even I'm still like I'm still happy if we end up with flat packs

688
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,300
and snaps like I'm not necessarily pulling for one but I think it's really

689
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:49,420
brilliant where what canonical has been doing with snaps and I think it's really

690
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:53,100
great that the momentum they're building behind it is likely to lead to success

691
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:56,340
it feels like they're really on a good trajectory right now so that makes me

692
00:54:56,340 --> 00:55:00,180
excited we're gonna check thank you wimpy thank you very much that was that

693
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:03,300
was a great that was that was actually painted a great picture I know I'm

694
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,340
excited we were there mm-hmm you know you're welcome thank you we are going to

695
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:12,780
find out if Wes was successful in the starbound server challenge which he was

696
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:16,300
just I like that you were down for it because I didn't warn you at all that's

697
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:21,100
gonna be throwing this at you and you know before we reveal if Wes was

698
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,060
successful and get to our next topic this would be a great spot to mention

699
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:27,140
Linux Academy where you could go to get the mad skills to learn how to set up a

700
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,820
server when you are thrust into a situation to do so Linux Academy comm

701
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:36,340
slash unplugs where you go to support this show Linux Azure AWS open stack

702
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:39,180
dev ops they have great courseware on all of it

703
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:43,300
Linux Academy is constantly improving their courseware the existing library

704
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:48,100
library and all the new stuff super fast they have a great staff now working on

705
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,580
all of this a great community full of Jupiter broadcasting members and

706
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:56,980
instructor mentoring when you need it they got on-demand servers that spin up

707
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:00,100
with the courseware that match the distribution you've chosen from they

708
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:04,340
have availability availability planners that are just the perfect touch when

709
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:09,300
you're super busy and last but not least one of my favorite things about Linux

710
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:13,820
Academy is they put you in a hands-on real-world scenario so you get actual

711
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:18,340
experience which there's nothing nothing that gives you more confidence when you

712
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:22,100
go to take the test or when you're just trying to improve your skill set check

713
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,060
out all the different features go to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged also

714
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:31,380
did you know they have a blog they have one of their new content creators Terry

715
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:36,620
Cox is sharing his experience working at Linux Academy yeah which is very

716
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:40,060
interesting and you kind of see some of the passion behind it Linux Academy

717
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:44,460
comm slash unplugged go there to learn more and to level up your skill set

718
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,740
Linux Linux Academy thanks guys for sponsoring the unplugged program and

719
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:51,860
that's the Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

720
00:56:51,860 --> 00:57:04,340
okay all right Wes were you or were you not successful in setting up the star

721
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:11,780
bound server I believe so I've only just got the client installed and I'm a

722
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:14,780
little confused on how to point it at the dedicated service so I there's that

723
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:18,800
problem you have it as well I do I have starbound installed I yeah I think so I

724
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:23,100
think I have it on this machine yes I do oh so there's a home I see I see

725
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:25,820
there's a separate server they got installed when I download this from good

726
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:31,220
old games let's see here Wes checking in now well do I just join a game maybe you

727
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,700
know I'm well I was trying to start one as well so I have a character oh yeah

728
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,380
it's got a server address you have to create a character first okay I see so

729
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:44,780
maybe what you need to do yeah so create a character hmm cuz do we do we want to

730
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:47,140
give out that address because once we give it out people gonna be playing on

731
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:50,620
it that's fine you think I mean we can always tear it down when we and move it

732
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,700
yeah okay so chat room if you want to test it I'm gonna give out the server

733
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:59,100
info with okay so how do I where do I where'd you get that server info well so

734
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,580
I already have a character so I'm a different okay so I went to join game at

735
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,460
the front at the front page okay and then I checked Stark bold or star ball

736
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,820
or star K bolt whatever it is and then it just brings up the server info after

737
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:15,780
I select my character oh yeah okay all right so the server is starbound dot

738
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:21,100
noble pain calm and it's port two one zero two five I'm gonna paste that in

739
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,220
the chat room to noble pain but you have to have accounts I don't know how does

740
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,260
that work oh well we'll have the chat room tested for us so I'll put it I'll

741
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,700
drop it in there because I want to play with some folks I think that I do too

742
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:38,140
what yeah yeah I mean it's the binaries totally running okay so good job West I

743
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:40,860
mean if you got the binary running you're probably pretty close so nicely

744
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:45,420
done sir well done under pressure too I think that's pretty great I'm pasting it

745
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:50,260
now in the chat room so I had a topic while people are trying that out that I

746
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,260
wanted to throw at you guys I'm so excited I just want to play the game now

747
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:59,940
I was noticing that the EU is gonna be auditing a couple of open source

748
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:05,060
projects that some of us may be familiar with the key pass project is one of them

749
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:12,060
and I think also I think also the Apache web server is gonna be audited and when

750
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:17,460
SCPs being audited and I think I think VLC I think there's a somewhat there's

751
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:21,780
some other projects are getting audited in all of this here's the background the

752
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,060
European Union just announced that it will give the source code of the

753
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,700
password manager key pass and the Apache web server a security audit the idea is

754
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,620
to audit the open source code and then it started around December of 2014 when

755
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:35,940
two members of the European Parliament suggest an audit for free software used

756
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:40,500
by EU institutions all right that seems like you know anytime we want to audit

757
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,980
something we rely on I'm all I'm all aboard that train put me on there and

758
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:49,780
take me to out of town so I started thinking what if the EU came to us

759
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:59,780
Linux unplugged show okay guys sat down with us and it said to us no no it said

760
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:04,260
to us we're gonna give you a million dollars and you can spend this on

761
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:08,740
auditing an open source project or two of your choice so we have a limited

762
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:14,140
budget to work with and we have to be responsible and how we spend it how and

763
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:17,900
what projects I guess is the better question which projects would we choose

764
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:22,100
how would we spend it and I wanted to kick it off so I was kicking this or

765
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:26,700
ww all right ww I'll answer my I'll go less ww what was your idea how would you

766
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:30,460
audit what would you audit how would you spend the money I would spend the money

767
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:39,580
to audit I see Linux oh to see if the NSA put a backdoor in there if you're a

768
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:44,980
security district you need to be audited you need to be known is this secure or

769
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:51,900
not and then maybe you know publish that information or use part of the money to

770
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:57,820
to audit it and make sure it's done right and throw and just and then just

771
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:02,780
publish information this is what we found or we didn't find you know so this

772
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:09,980
can be trusted for now because it could all something can always change so yeah

773
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:13,100
I was trying to think too would I wanted when I want to audit something like

774
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:16,860
telegram or something like Firefox and I don't think so I think I'd want to go

775
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:20,860
myself I want to go more infrastructure I think if I was gonna pick a project it

776
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:24,900
would be something that I rely on and think of as secure something like open

777
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:31,020
VPN or open SSH right I would love to get a real good so although open SSH has a

778
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:36,100
lot of eyes on it and maybe open VPN does too but the other thing that would

779
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:41,500
sort of crop up on my radar and I don't know how feasible this would be and it's

780
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:44,700
not like it hasn't it's not getting looked at all the time but I am just not

781
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:48,060
a hundred percent solid on tour and they've been a lot of changes in a lot

782
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:52,020
of news recently mm-hmm mm-hmm there's been a lot of attacks against or there's

783
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:55,980
been a lot of changes in the board just like true crypt I would love to have

784
01:01:55,980 --> 01:02:00,060
more eyes on tour yes from a from a third-party auditing a lot of a wire

785
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:05,060
guard yeah that would be good to get done right away yeah yeah wire garden

786
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:10,300
tink too really that would be good yeah that is such great performance though

787
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,860
it's awesome oh wimpy you have a great one which one

788
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:20,460
gnu g yeah yeah yeah yeah that's one we all rely upon we've been we've been told

789
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:25,300
by folks like Snowden that it's solid but I mean who know really knows you I

790
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:30,500
not to be paranoid but there are if you listen to text now I mean it's we talk

791
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,500
about it quite a bit there are entire industries now around finding these

792
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,340
problems and selling them and they have they have like Silk Road type markets

793
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:43,020
where a vulnerabilities go for certain prices in Bitcoin and whatnot in Bitcoin

794
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:47,420
and what's not it really well yeah it really is it really is a growing market

795
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:50,260
where people are finding these things and holding on to it and and then there's

796
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:54,700
people out there that know about vulnerabilities and then sell them and so

797
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,300
it these kinds of things I don't know they just freaked me out doesn't have to

798
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:00,420
be an NSA conspiracy theory where the NSA is hacking you it could just

799
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:03,860
literally be some jerk hacker who figured something out and like you know

800
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:07,940
yeah and like part of the benefit of it being open and you know it's it's kind

801
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,900
of everyone and so like if we can all take responsibility get things audited

802
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:15,380
and have a really solid base to build from you think it's worth auditing like

803
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:20,100
desktop environments like the gnome desktop or plasma desktop you think it's

804
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,980
worth that or is it just really rely on the enterprise case yeah and but you'd

805
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:27,300
have to be careful about versions right you have to pick like a fixed point and

806
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:33,580
yeah yeah and then somebody in the chat room suggested snaps and snap D it's

807
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:37,900
probably not bad I maybe app armor too yeah good one

808
01:03:37,900 --> 01:03:41,060
Rekai yeah app armor is not bad anybody else in the mom room having suggestions

809
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:44,900
before we wrap up yeah if we're gonna be her line not more and more here right

810
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:50,380
yeah yeah yeah x11 well I think that'd be depressing Wayland way to be bad way

811
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:53,820
with Waylander mirror yeah that wouldn't be bad yeah I'd say go for the

812
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:57,140
infrastructure stuff and Wayland would know not jb titles don't look there

813
01:03:57,140 --> 01:04:01,220
don't look there it makes j-bot grumpy continuing the audit of let's encrypt I

814
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:06,940
think is happening or veracrypt yeah that's a good one wimpy free BSD oh oh

815
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:14,860
oh yeah you know they had to remove the Linux subsystem that was open

816
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:21,020
BSD yeah so open BSD then yeah okay good let's do that one yeah there they they

817
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:25,420
they talk a big game let's see how they do open SSL I think that's happening all

818
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:28,740
the time these days arch Linux I think that's happy you know Google has a

819
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:31,540
project called project zero where they're literally going in investigating

820
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:34,000
different projects recently though they've been really beating up on

821
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,620
antivirus companies it's been it's been really fun to watch yeah okay well if

822
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:41,020
you have any suggestions I'd like to hear your thoughts Linux action show at

823
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:44,140
reddit.com or leave a YouTube comment if you're watching on YouTube what open

824
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:47,140
source project would you audit because I have a sense we're probably forgetting

825
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:51,740
of some because we just kind of came up it's not everybody yeah but on the spot

826
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:55,780
my my attack would be infrastructure and then go out from there wouldn't it be

827
01:04:55,780 --> 01:05:02,220
amazing I honestly if there was some sort of perpetual crowdfunding platform

828
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:06,980
for security auditing and not I don't think patreon will be and I don't think

829
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:09,540
Kickstarter or gofundme or anything like that there's some sort of different

830
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:13,300
something different where I could kick into from time to time and say I want to

831
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:17,100
help and then do you remember the infrastructure project that the Linux

832
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:21,500
Foundation set up if so if they if they ran something like that if it came from

833
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:26,220
it if it came from a from a foundation like that or a group of people that were

834
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:28,740
organizing and hiring the right professionals for the right tools and

835
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:31,480
the right jobs and being very transparent about how they spend the

836
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,740
money and the reported man that'd be such a perfect companion to open source

837
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:38,060
security is to have a Linux Foundation or somebody like that organized

838
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:41,380
something like that and I would love to contribute to something like that I

839
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:45,940
wouldn't be able to contribute a lot but I absolutely would love to you know I

840
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:48,700
don't know if you guys have ideas let us know you can also go to the contact page

841
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:52,580
at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash contact that's where we get that

842
01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:55,540
business done that's our official contact page although really to be

843
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:58,660
honest with you for this show I it is more of a community experience well

844
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:01,780
that's kind of where the subreddit comes in probably a little more and also we

845
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:06,820
have the mumble room and the IRC don't forget them no I can I'm looking at them

846
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:09,980
right now we always stare right at their face you can find out when we do all

847
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:13,100
those things at Jupiter broadcasting comm slash counter it'll convert that

848
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:17,140
lifetime to your local time zone then you go to jblive.tv you plug that into

849
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:20,700
your machine of choice and join the IRC and then from there bang mumble you get

850
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:25,020
our mumble secrets you hang out in our community our virtual lugs always

851
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:28,260
willing and accepting as long as your microphone works and you don't got echo

852
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:33,180
yeah oh yeah knock that off no it's action shot at reddit.com is where you go

853
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:37,140
to leave feedback and topic ideas thanks so much for tuning this week's

854
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:42,620
episode of the unplugged program we'll see you right back here next week

855
01:06:42,620 --> 01:07:09,500
you did it Wes you did it I'm impressed hello everybody I didn't know if you

856
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,980
better get going now do we have anybody connected though yeah I mean I see Rekai

857
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:17,300
right here he's on there are you in the game oh yeah I'm right I'm in the game

858
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:26,500
where are you Chris that's the question starbound doctor during the show I like

859
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,140
your I like that you got your name I well you got your online name I should

860
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:37,900
do I have Wes Payne too I wonder if I could get my name let's just say I have

861
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:41,020
a little too many variants of my own so do I have it do I just put anything in

862
01:07:41,020 --> 01:07:44,460
there for the server just leave it blank oh man I was supposed to put the port in

863
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:47,020
the actual they have a specified port box I didn't see that because I was

864
01:07:47,020 --> 01:07:51,580
just putting it in there yeah JB titles calm JB titles calm if you guys want to

865
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,140
you if you don't want to buy this on steam to you can get on good old games

866
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:58,580
which is pretty cool I would love to mess around with this all right so

867
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:03,820
assets mismatch between client and server and the override option is not

868
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:07,460
set oh I thought I did what does that mean what does that even mean is that

869
01:08:07,460 --> 01:08:11,180
because I don't have the steam version oh is yours allow him can you edit your

870
01:08:11,180 --> 01:08:15,300
character how do I do that I think there was like an allow mismatch oh but maybe

871
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:20,180
that was the start game yeah cuz that just puts me back in my world this is no

872
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:24,740
good Wes this is no good well okay JB titles calm I boy I'm starting to

873
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:28,880
escape you need to update it is that why the assets are mismatched I have you

874
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,220
updated we're going to steam oh you have great games I could just go

875
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:35,660
redownload it I guess but that feels pretty old they need to snap this up

876
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:40,300
that's what they have to do snap it up okay guys well I want to say thank you

877
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,380
everybody for making it I really appreciate it that was really fun

878
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:46,000
wimpy to pick your brain all that stuff I find it fascinating and it's good to

879
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,900
hear a story you know from somebody who was there so that way it's not just our

880
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:54,660
speculation you're welcome thanks for inviting me on wimpy get snappy and so

881
01:08:54,660 --> 01:09:00,660
that's the top title right now oh geez oh man okay I have a question for you

882
01:09:00,660 --> 01:09:05,980
guys I I would really like to consult with some folks that have some

883
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:13,940
multi-month long experience with sync thing mm-hmm I do what are some of the

884
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:19,000
key tricks to getting like your discovery between sync thing nodes or

885
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,020
whatever it's called working and what are key things to know if you if you're

886
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:26,940
frequently reloading machines or setting up new machines and also if you want to

887
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:30,260
have a pretty sophisticated sync setup like I want to think a lot of things

888
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:34,260
between some machines but a couple of bits but some of those same machines I

889
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:37,740
want to sync with other computers only a couple of things like so complicated

890
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:43,700
setups like that what are like tips to make because I feel like here's every

891
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,940
here's my problem and I don't even know where I've gone wrong because I have

892
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:51,140
it's been about six months or so but I I set up a sync thing instance I get two

893
01:09:51,140 --> 01:09:56,020
or three systems going usually it's this machine here in studio my machine up in

894
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:59,740
my office and a digital ocean droplet and I get those three things working and

895
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:04,420
then at some point I reload one of them and I can never get that third that

896
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:08,260
reloaded machine to rejoin up or something like sometimes it can see them

897
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:13,460
but they can't see it we have fully working totally fine DNS here in the

898
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:19,260
studio yeah I don't really understand what keeps going wrong and so because

899
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:22,620
because I'm always doing it when I'm super busy and trying to solve a problem

900
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:26,180
and just get something working I never really spend a lot of time trying to

901
01:10:26,180 --> 01:10:30,220
really figure out what I've gone what I've done wrong and it just it makes

902
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:34,340
there's there really that much of a difference between the 64-bit version and

903
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:42,020
the 32-bit oh file wise or something you mean like how many files it can do so

904
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:46,420
yeah okay I don't know arch that's a good question you're asking about a

905
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:51,620
array storage array right well no now I'm just asking about syncing best

906
01:10:51,620 --> 01:10:55,300
practices in general to keep a good sync thing like to keep something that's

907
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:58,820
sustainable for me using sync thing I want to be able to I want to be able to

908
01:10:58,820 --> 01:11:02,540
have confidence that I can blow machines away and re-add them to whatever my was

909
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:05,660
it called a syncing syncing swarm what's that what is that called I don't know

910
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:14,900
network yeah nobody has any advice for me I've got one running on my phone it

911
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:17,700
sinks all my photos down and anything I do on my phone that I want to you know

912
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:20,740
be saved in my computers and backed up yeah that'd be good that'd be a perfect

913
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:24,220
use case like a box thinking that I've got a Linux box thinking that and I've

914
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:27,860
got a server in my data center sinking that and so when you want to when you

915
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:32,220
want to add your phone what steps did you follow um I just opened all the web

916
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:36,100
you eyes and all the machines plugged in actually on the phone I did the QR code

917
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:39,740
thing so like I'd share the QR code from the other machines snap the QR code it

918
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:42,260
got all the information so I didn't type it all out so when you add a new

919
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:47,180
computer to an existing sync setup you go to both computers administrative

920
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:50,460
interface and you add each that you add each other to it right you have to add

921
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:55,420
each other yeah because they both have to recognize your public key yeah

922
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:59,140
sometimes you can just add it one way and then the other will start trying to

923
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:02,940
talk to your new node and it will say like do you want to add this guy who's

924
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:06,380
trying to talk to you like yeah based on this I have seen that sometimes yeah

925
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:09,420
okay but I would say yeah it does like but I would just add them on both yeah

926
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,740
add them especially for the links that you really care about okay okay yep I

927
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:17,060
will also say I've that's what I usually have done but sometimes like I want to

928
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:19,820
add them on each end like one of them will connect but the other one won't or

929
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:22,660
something typically what I do is I have it they all connect to the server but

930
01:12:22,660 --> 01:12:26,460
none connect to each other in between how do you define which ones the server

931
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:30,540
down you just don't allow them to discover each other there's like an

932
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:35,780
option that advertises neighbor nodes or something oh I try using that thing you

933
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:40,100
maybe it'll help okay no it might help you it should be fine but just the way I

934
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:43,940
do it is I have one server that they all connect to and they don't interconnect

935
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:47,740
between each other okay that seems to work for me I'm not saying that's the

936
01:12:47,740 --> 01:12:51,100
only solution it just seems to work well because the server has ports open that

937
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:55,780
are guaranteed and the IP address is static yeah I'll say in the kind of in

938
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:58,900
the same vein I've enjoyed using it when I was with tank for an overlay network

939
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:01,620
but you could use whatever really network just like you don't have to

940
01:13:01,620 --> 01:13:05,140
worry about anything I was thinking it was tank would be a good use for that

941
01:13:05,140 --> 01:13:08,060
or if you have a VPN set up already that'll add it to your home or the

942
01:13:08,060 --> 01:13:16,060
studio network or you know well I feel that doesn't really make me feel much

943
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,460
better because you guys really haven't given me anything I haven't already done

944
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:22,220
yeah it does sound like maybe doing a little bit more manually not relying on

945
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:27,060
the it'd be nice if you could centrally manage the sinking of all those nodes if

946
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:30,780
you have so many yeah that would be having to set them up on each node is

947
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:34,180
really frustrating and time-consuming and tedious yeah really the one thing it

948
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:39,580
really right now needs the tool to yeah that does burn yeah that does burn me

949
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:44,860
okay so Ben Ben Fitzpatrick is in the mumble room Ben was our feedback

950
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:48,420
question who was also our aborted runs Linux for the Linux action show this

951
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:54,940
Sunday what's the what's the update there been well last night my friend

952
01:13:54,940 --> 01:14:02,860
Jamie came by and we I did manage to get arch running on my pro book that I was

953
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:10,360
showing you guys and I tell you what the problem was was I believe it or not had

954
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:15,140
a triple boot setup going on and what happened was I had forgotten to write

955
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:22,620
grub into the EFI boot so oh my god so the whole time was rub was not writing

956
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:27,740
to the EFI partition probably so I found the command on the arch wiki and then

957
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:34,500
bang it just started booting after I ran it from the from the EFI boot menu and

958
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:40,660
then voila I was in and I got XFC loading awesome everything and it's all sorted

959
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:44,940
so yeah and then my friend Jamie came by and fixed awesome up for me and

960
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:49,900
everything's all good so yeah and it looks really killer and congrats man

961
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:53,060
that's awesome so did you go straight up arch or did you go with an arch

962
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:57,900
derivative or what was your approach there was normal arch via architect and

963
01:14:57,900 --> 01:15:02,780
I gotta tell you okay architect is not being maintained anymore yeah it still

964
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:09,300
works and I tell you it's it's really very simple even if you're a new user

965
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:13,580
and you haven't used arch before it really simplifies things down to the

966
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:18,920
minimum and I've done stock arch before and architect makes it a walk in the

967
01:15:18,920 --> 01:15:23,300
frickin park so cool that's the way to stick with it man good for you I plan to

968
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:28,900
and I tell you this thing really saved my neck are you enjoying any of the

969
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,860
process I mean I know there's like ups and downs with it but have you found it

970
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:36,660
just like intellectually enjoyable yes and I tell you I've actually wiped my

971
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:47,460
windows I'm actually considering dumping OS X on my macbook even and throwing

972
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:51,060
archon highly recommended well I don't know about on the macbook but go give it

973
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:54,740
a go and let it report back and let us know how it goes I will thank you oh

974
01:15:54,740 --> 01:15:59,660
man so okay this made my heart sink I just saw this go by the chat room wimpy

975
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:05,340
says that he abandoned his sink thing set up uh-huh well okay wimpy I feel

976
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:10,540
like this is gonna be I feel like this is gonna be what convinces me not to use

977
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:14,260
sink thing because I think a wimpy and I have seen I die on this stuff before so

978
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:17,780
do you want to tell us what happened you know all those things you just explained

979
01:16:17,780 --> 01:16:24,700
you were trying to get fixed yeah I couldn't fix it oh so it runs along just

980
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:29,380
fine until you need to change something right is that what kind of your yeah that

981
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:34,580
the problem I had is that even though there are mechanisms to support key

982
01:16:34,580 --> 01:16:39,640
exchange with multiple devices that just wasn't happening seamlessly and for the

983
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:44,080
number of machines I have that was a real showstopper so I did things to

984
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:50,620
tweak the speed at which it would pick up changes but yeah just it just wasn't

985
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:55,260
working for me and I was bored with keep on trying to poke it and make it go so I

986
01:16:55,260 --> 01:17:04,140
just gave up are you using something else in place or well not really I mean

987
01:17:04,140 --> 01:17:09,500
I had this one use case left which was my dot five talked to get in the past

988
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:14,020
about roaming profiles and how I was using that just keep all of those dot

989
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:17,100
files and everything that was in my profile sync across of the machines

990
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:21,420
which is why I use it on so many machines because I was using it on all

991
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:25,180
the servers that I you you know my own personal servers and my workstations and

992
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:31,380
laptops and what have you so I've I use the same tool to manage the dot file sim

993
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:35,700
linking which is a tool called makeup but now I've just got it hooked into a

994
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:39,660
get back end because I can't be doing with sync thing messing me about you

995
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:44,300
know it almost makes me want to throw next cloud on something with just a ton

996
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:48,460
of desk because really where my own cloud sync issues have gone wrong is

997
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:53,700
when own cloud has tried to do something clever like keep a duplicate copy so I

998
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:57,460
could undelete and then runs out of storage because the undelete bin takes

999
01:17:57,460 --> 01:18:01,380
up all my space and when I'm working with unfiltered clips and it's you know

1000
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,500
multi gigs per episode that happens within a couple of months even with

1001
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:08,460
tons and tons of storage but if I really you know if I had a lot of storage

1002
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:12,820
sitting behind it what I really like about the next cloud syncing paradigm is

1003
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:19,900
it very is very close to the Dropbox one where I install a client I log in to the

1004
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,020
client now in the case of next cloud I pointed to my server I don't do that

1005
01:18:23,020 --> 01:18:27,700
with Dropbox but I log in and it begins sinking and it begins just

1006
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:31,340
participating in the sink swarm without having to discover servers that having

1007
01:18:31,340 --> 01:18:36,300
to exchange keys and the thing is that's pretty nice for me because any given

1008
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:40,060
week I've reloaded a machine for a show and I have to sync several hundred

1009
01:18:40,060 --> 01:18:43,700
assets to that machine and so I'm not always in the same place when I'm

1010
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:48,220
setting them up yeah so maybe next cloud will solve this for me but in the

1011
01:18:48,220 --> 01:18:56,260
meantime dropbox enterprise is like super crazy expensive so I'm ready to

1012
01:18:56,260 --> 01:19:03,700
just dump it as soon as possible but yeah yeah last time I used own cloud was

1013
01:19:03,700 --> 01:19:10,620
own cloud 8 and I'm gonna have a go with next cloud and the other one that I had

1014
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:17,140
some good success with was C file which is what next cloud is using isn't it

1015
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:24,420
under or is it CC I think no yeah that CCC file is right SSEA file right see

1016
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:29,980
yes right and the only thing that puts me off that is um I really don't want to

1017
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:46,820
be adminning loads of servers in my spare time because yeah
