WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.480
Now that you and I are ThinkPad users,

00:01.480 --> 00:02.920
I'm always on the lookout for like

00:02.920 --> 00:04.520
the ultimate portable ThinkPad.

00:04.520 --> 00:05.920
Of course.

00:05.920 --> 00:08.360
I love our T480s, but you just gotta keep an eye out.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.780
Well, how about the ThinkTiny?

00:10.780 --> 00:15.780
It's a miniature laptop with a 0.96 inch display

00:16.680 --> 00:19.240
and a design that's heavily inspired by the ThinkPad.

00:19.240 --> 00:22.300
It even has a track point in the little middle

00:22.300 --> 00:23.840
kind of fake keyboard area.

00:23.840 --> 00:27.140
Yeah, it's exactly as cute as you think.

00:27.140 --> 00:30.380
Now, to make it, Paul Klinger, the guy behind this,

00:30.380 --> 00:32.600
created a 3D printed case custom

00:32.600 --> 00:37.600
and then crammed a 128 by 64 pixel OLED display

00:37.800 --> 00:38.960
inside there.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.720
As long as an 80 tiny 1614 microcontroller

00:41.720 --> 00:44.860
and a 300 milliamp battery.

00:44.860 --> 00:47.080
Now, despite choosing all those small components,

00:47.080 --> 00:49.360
he still had to make some modifications

00:49.360 --> 00:51.480
because even with the tiny screen,

00:51.480 --> 00:53.000
the circuit board was still too big,

00:53.000 --> 00:54.640
had to saw that right off.

00:54.640 --> 00:55.760
Sure.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.400
You can find instructions, code,

00:57.400 --> 00:59.480
and all the design on his GitHub.

00:59.480 --> 01:02.480
This is actually also his second tiny PC.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.720
The first was a miniature desktop PC replica

01:04.720 --> 01:08.040
with full RGB lighting, of course.

01:08.040 --> 01:09.720
This is really pretty impressive.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.480
Now, I don't know that I could get very much done

01:11.480 --> 01:13.360
on something that small.

01:13.360 --> 01:14.680
Maybe meet in the middle.

01:14.680 --> 01:15.520
Yeah.

01:15.520 --> 01:16.360
Yeah.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.180
Yeah.

01:17.180 --> 01:18.020
Yeah.

01:18.020 --> 01:18.860
Yeah.

01:18.860 --> 01:19.680
Yeah.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.520
Yeah.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.360
Yeah.

01:21.360 --> 01:22.180
Yeah.

01:22.180 --> 01:23.020
Yeah.

01:23.020 --> 01:23.860
Yeah.

01:23.860 --> 01:25.440
Hello, friends, and welcome into Linux Unplugged.

01:25.440 --> 01:26.320
My name is Chris.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.200
My name is Wes.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.040
Hello, Wes.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.000
I didn't mean to catch you mid-sip.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.040
I mean, I'm a thirsty guy sometimes, Chris.

01:32.040 --> 01:35.160
We're working hard today because we have a huge episode.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.840
Yeah, you're not lying.

01:36.840 --> 01:39.480
Wes and I got a real early crack at it today

01:39.480 --> 01:40.880
because there's a lot to get into.

01:40.880 --> 01:42.680
We've got some new hardware in-house.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.520
We have a very special guest joining us

01:44.520 --> 01:49.000
and lots of news to get into, as well as a look at Fedora

01:49.000 --> 01:51.400
Core OS and Ubuntu Core.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.520
And maybe we'll try to differentiate

01:53.520 --> 01:54.700
what those real products are.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.440
Sometimes we've made the mistake here on the old show

01:57.440 --> 01:59.560
of conflating, Wes.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.960
Oh, yeah, but Drew's here to help us set it straight.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.460
He's going to help us un-configurate

02:03.460 --> 02:04.440
our conflations.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.100
Finally.

02:05.100 --> 02:08.520
And we'll be able to more appreciate how these two

02:08.520 --> 02:10.120
products differentiate.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.200
You said it, not me.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.840
So I mentioned we have a special guest this week.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.760
Phil, one of the original founders of the Mangero

02:16.760 --> 02:19.000
project, is joining us in the virtual log today.

02:19.000 --> 02:19.500
Hello, Phil.

02:19.500 --> 02:20.680
Hello, everyone.

02:20.680 --> 02:21.180
Hello.

02:21.180 --> 02:22.660
Thank you for joining us.

02:22.660 --> 02:25.000
And also, big time appropriate greetings

02:25.000 --> 02:26.240
to the rest of that virtual log.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.120
Hello, everybody.

02:27.120 --> 02:27.620
Hello.

02:27.620 --> 02:28.120
Hello.

02:28.120 --> 02:28.620
Hello.

02:28.620 --> 02:29.120
Hello.

02:29.120 --> 02:29.620
Hello.

02:29.620 --> 02:30.600
Greetings.

02:30.600 --> 02:31.360
Well, wow.

02:31.360 --> 02:31.860
Impressive.

02:31.860 --> 02:32.360
Impressive.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.040
Well, wow.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.080
We've got Brent and Byte and Niels in there,

02:35.080 --> 02:39.520
CubicleNate, MiniMech, of course, Phil, CM, and Wimpy.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.800
But joining us here on the studio line, as well,

02:42.800 --> 02:46.120
to help us break all this down, is Alex, Cheese, and Drew.

02:46.120 --> 02:47.040
It's a huge show today.

02:47.040 --> 02:47.600
Hey, guys.

02:47.600 --> 02:48.360
Hey, what's up, dudes?

02:48.360 --> 02:48.640
Hello.

02:48.640 --> 02:49.580
It's a big show.

02:49.580 --> 02:50.960
This is going to be a lot to pull off,

02:50.960 --> 02:52.200
but we're going to try to do it.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.800
And with everyone's help, I think we can.

02:53.800 --> 02:55.640
So let's start with a warm-up story, just

02:55.640 --> 02:58.080
to help us ease into this thing.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.440
The Darling Project has picked up new contributors

03:01.440 --> 03:05.000
and is seeing new code contributed to the project.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
You might remember this.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.520
It's a longstanding, although it's

03:07.520 --> 03:11.540
been idle for years, effort to allow Mac OS binaries

03:11.540 --> 03:13.080
to run on Linux.

03:13.080 --> 03:16.520
Think wine, but for Mac OS applications.

03:16.520 --> 03:20.280
Well, this summer, there's been a lot of progress moving along,

03:20.280 --> 03:22.560
including some new developers.

03:22.560 --> 03:23.360
Yeah, that's right.

03:23.360 --> 03:25.820
They just published their quarter two highlights.

03:25.820 --> 03:28.240
And some of those highlights are things like new contributors

03:28.240 --> 03:32.160
coming on board and making progress all over the stack.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.960
They've been stubbing out more frameworks, like AGL, Carbon,

03:34.960 --> 03:38.540
Address Book, Core Services, and Application Services,

03:38.540 --> 03:41.340
and improving AppKit support, including

03:41.340 --> 03:43.540
stuff like nested frameworks.

03:43.540 --> 03:46.220
There's also a fix for 32-bit application support

03:46.220 --> 03:49.120
and a bunch of other low-level bug fixes.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.740
And maybe that doesn't sound exciting,

03:50.740 --> 03:53.120
but you need all of that if you want any of this to work.

03:53.120 --> 03:56.680
Well, and you probably maybe were a little surprised

03:56.680 --> 03:58.280
your 32-bit support in there.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.080
Yeah.

03:59.080 --> 04:00.580
Yeah, that's actually what they think

04:00.580 --> 04:02.460
is going to be one of their secret sauces, one

04:02.460 --> 04:03.520
of their selling points.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.180
It will be for people that want to continue

04:06.180 --> 04:09.320
to run 32-bit Mac software after Apple

04:09.320 --> 04:11.160
goes all 64-bit with Mac OS.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.320
OK, hang on.

04:12.320 --> 04:16.880
Right, roll back a second there.

04:16.880 --> 04:21.160
So the 32-bit support in Mac OS, is that not

04:21.160 --> 04:23.840
a constraint on the kernel?

04:23.840 --> 04:26.880
It's purely a constraint on user space.

04:26.880 --> 04:32.560
Yeah, Apple has not shipped a 32-bit Mac OS environment

04:32.560 --> 04:33.840
for several years now.

04:33.840 --> 04:38.200
They dropped all the 32-bit Mac hardware support back

04:38.200 --> 04:43.640
in Lion, I think, so 10.5, which was five or so years ago,

04:43.640 --> 04:44.600
I think.

04:44.600 --> 04:45.920
It was when I was in college.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.360
So they dropped it quite a long time ago.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.720
And the version that's about to come out

04:51.720 --> 04:54.520
drops the ability to even execute 32-bit applications,

04:54.520 --> 04:55.040
correct?

04:55.040 --> 04:57.660
Right, they're dropping all the user libraries, all the user

04:57.660 --> 05:01.760
applications, all of the remaining shims that

05:01.760 --> 05:06.120
are in the kernel for supporting 32-bit Mac OS ABI.

05:06.120 --> 05:09.860
The binary loader for 32-bit Mac OS objects is getting removed.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.640
All that goes away in Catalina 10.15.

05:11.640 --> 05:12.640
Yeah, right.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.320
OK, OK, right, so let me get this straight.

05:16.320 --> 05:21.680
At a kernel level, executing 32-bit binaries is going away.

05:21.680 --> 05:24.600
Right, on a major commercial platform, correct?

05:24.600 --> 05:25.400
That's fine.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.360
That's their choice.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.880
But I'm just trying to understand

05:27.880 --> 05:30.580
how the heck this Darling project then

05:30.580 --> 05:33.600
executes 32-bit applications when there's

05:33.600 --> 05:35.080
no kernel support for it.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.040
Darling runs on Linux.

05:36.040 --> 05:37.360
It's akin to Wine.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.960
Oh, OK, there we go.

05:39.960 --> 05:41.280
There's my misunderstanding.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.460
So their bet is that people will move to Linux

05:43.460 --> 05:45.960
as well, which is implicit in the statement

05:45.960 --> 05:49.200
that it is going to be their selling factor.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.120
It's that they'll also get people to switch.

05:51.120 --> 05:54.600
Does this mean that it opens up the avenue for possibly having

05:54.600 --> 05:56.400
my Adobe suite on Linux?

05:56.400 --> 05:57.680
I mean, that's the goal, right?

05:57.680 --> 06:02.920
I mean, when you hear this, you think graphical applications.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.640
As I recall, with the Darling project,

06:04.640 --> 06:06.840
initially it's just been command line applications.

06:06.840 --> 06:10.060
But there are AppKit implementations happening,

06:10.060 --> 06:12.720
and they are working on moving things

06:12.720 --> 06:15.680
like carbon core services and support for AGL.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.760
So actually, it does seem to be that the end goal is

06:18.760 --> 06:20.360
the full graphical stack.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.000
I don't think it's possible.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.280
There's just a lot to do there.

06:23.280 --> 06:23.960
Yeah.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.320
The second line on their GitHub page

06:26.320 --> 06:29.480
says, please note that no GUI applications are supported

06:29.480 --> 06:30.300
at the moment.

06:30.300 --> 06:30.800
Right.

06:30.800 --> 06:34.920
And you can appreciate that Wine was successful to a degree

06:34.920 --> 06:37.840
because Windows was stagnant for so many years.

06:37.840 --> 06:41.400
And Mac OS doesn't really have that same characteristic.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.280
It's a much more forward-moving operating system,

06:44.280 --> 06:45.760
and they quickly deprecate support

06:45.760 --> 06:48.240
for things that Microsoft is much slower

06:48.240 --> 06:49.440
to deprecate support for.

06:49.440 --> 06:52.200
And Wine has been successful to a degree because of that.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.960
And they built up the expectation, right?

06:53.960 --> 06:55.760
They're just going to do it, and you have to live with it.

06:55.760 --> 06:56.260
Yeah.

06:56.260 --> 06:57.720
It's a whole other ballgame.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.320
As a former Mac developer, one of the big things

07:00.320 --> 07:03.480
you kind of get educated on as you do software development

07:03.480 --> 07:08.040
for Mac OS is that you expect Apple to break you.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.320
And so over time, you just learn to adapt

07:11.320 --> 07:14.040
to keep rebuilding things, and changing things,

07:14.040 --> 07:15.280
and updating things.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.880
It's very similar to the Linux world,

07:16.880 --> 07:21.160
which is why I get very confused when people are like, well,

07:21.160 --> 07:24.360
Linux is changing so much, and it breaks me all the time.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.840
And as a Mac developer, it's like,

07:26.840 --> 07:28.960
but this is the same experience.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.520
Similar on mobile as well, isn't it?

07:30.520 --> 07:33.760
Less so, actually, because of the versioned SDK stuff.

07:33.760 --> 07:40.320
So the versioned SDK stuff tends to hide that churn

07:40.320 --> 07:42.200
to a lesser extent.

07:42.200 --> 07:46.680
Also, that SDK story on Android is fascinating, right?

07:46.680 --> 07:50.000
Do you know what version of the SDK,

07:50.000 --> 07:53.920
or rather, what version of Android

07:53.920 --> 07:59.880
shipped the SDK that 99% of developers target is?

07:59.880 --> 08:01.520
Is it a 5 series?

08:01.520 --> 08:05.480
You would be wishing it's Android 4.4

08:05.480 --> 08:08.280
is the recommended target to reach

08:08.280 --> 08:12.200
99% of Android devices right now,

08:12.200 --> 08:15.360
as prescribed via Android Studio if you

08:15.360 --> 08:17.620
start creating a new app today.

08:17.620 --> 08:22.080
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

08:22.080 --> 08:23.080
That's really awful.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.640
That's pretty awful.

08:24.640 --> 08:28.720
All right, well, the ARM platform is, well,

08:28.720 --> 08:30.240
is maybe the future.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.560
I don't know, actually.

08:31.560 --> 08:32.980
That's remained to be seen.

08:32.980 --> 08:37.960
But I have in Studio right now the Raspberry Pi 4 desktop kit.

08:37.960 --> 08:41.000
I picked this up right when it was announced.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.320
It comes with a Raspberry Pi 4, 4 gigabytes of RAM,

08:45.320 --> 08:47.720
a keyboard and a mouse, the Raspberry Pi edition.

08:47.720 --> 08:48.520
And they are cute.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.480
And they are actually pretty great.

08:50.480 --> 08:52.960
It comes with an official Raspberry Pi beginner guide

08:52.960 --> 08:54.280
book, which is a nice book.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.240
I don't know if you got a chance to see it out there.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.400
Yeah, I was coming through there.

08:56.400 --> 08:57.200
I'm impressed.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.280
And it comes with Raspbian on a micro SD 16 gig card.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.400
It's pretty tight.

09:02.400 --> 09:06.020
And it comes with two HDMI cables, micro to regular size,

09:06.020 --> 09:07.960
as well as the USB-C power brick.

09:07.960 --> 09:11.520
And the whole kit is $120 US, I think.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.200
And it arrived a couple of days ago.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.000
And we set it up this morning in the studio.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.240
So we've been testing it all morning.

09:17.240 --> 09:21.120
And it's running a series of punishing Ferronix benchmarks

09:21.120 --> 09:21.640
right now.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.400
Oh, yeah.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.560
We are doing all the different compiling.

09:24.560 --> 09:26.240
And we're going to test the disk IEO.

09:26.240 --> 09:29.680
You did do some early wireless testing.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.520
Yeah, we just had it set up on the wireless here

09:31.520 --> 09:32.240
in the studio.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.100
So we did some basic Iperf tests.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.360
And they weren't too bad.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.000
Now, obviously, this is all taking place

09:37.000 --> 09:38.440
in our environment.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.200
As a comparison, I also ran those tests

09:40.200 --> 09:43.440
on my ThinkPad, which had about double the throughput.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.120
Yeah.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.440
And we were seeing around 80 megabits

09:46.440 --> 09:49.600
over the Wi-Fi, which is a pretty nice upgrade

09:49.600 --> 09:50.600
from the previous.

09:50.600 --> 09:54.640
And I found it sufficient to browse a large remote directory

09:54.640 --> 09:56.720
and copy over a movie file and things like that.

09:56.720 --> 09:56.920
Right.

09:56.920 --> 09:58.760
It may not be the fastest thing in the world,

09:58.760 --> 10:01.040
but it was definitely workable as a desktop.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.220
So I'm going to give it a go for a week.

10:02.220 --> 10:03.640
Starting after this show, I'm going

10:03.640 --> 10:05.960
to run it as my workstation for a week.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.680
And then I'll report back next week with how things went.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.600
Because right now, it's just really early days,

10:10.600 --> 10:12.080
super early impression.

10:12.080 --> 10:16.960
One thing that I guess I just maybe didn't expect,

10:16.960 --> 10:19.280
but perhaps should have known, is

10:19.280 --> 10:22.400
that the Raspbian install that ships on that thing is 32-bit.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.280
So that one of the selling points, obviously,

10:24.280 --> 10:25.880
of the Raspberry Pi 4 is that it's

10:25.880 --> 10:29.760
got that sweet 64-bit four-core processor.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.200
But Raspbian itself is 32-bit.

10:32.200 --> 10:34.760
And I went through my land notes when the story was announced,

10:34.760 --> 10:38.280
and I did have it noted in there that the OS was 32-bit.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.080
But I'd forgotten.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.360
So when it arrived and I booted it up,

10:41.360 --> 10:43.000
I thought I'd be running 64-bit Linux,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.760
because the selling point, it's a 64-bit processor.

10:45.760 --> 10:46.720
That is not the case.

10:46.720 --> 10:49.280
And I think you might have figured out why.

10:49.280 --> 10:51.560
Yeah, well, I found a great blog post

10:51.560 --> 10:52.960
by James Chambers going through how

10:52.960 --> 10:56.240
to get Ubuntu server up and running on the Pi 4

10:56.240 --> 10:58.920
while support is still improving, let's say.

10:58.920 --> 11:02.000
And I guess there's a problem with the SD card driver.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.840
So the RAM is limited to 1 gig in the 64-bit version.

11:05.840 --> 11:07.560
It does otherwise work all right.

11:07.560 --> 11:08.880
You can get it up and booting.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.720
But if you paid for 4 gigs, you probably want 4 gigs.

11:11.720 --> 11:15.520
And of course, 32-bit OSes can address 4 gigs of RAM.

11:15.520 --> 11:16.240
So you're fine.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.320
I mean, it's functionally fine.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.440
There's no real major downside, as far as I can see.

11:20.440 --> 11:22.800
It just wasn't what I expected, because it

11:22.800 --> 11:25.280
was advertised as a 64-bit product.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.080
And it might be something I experiment with,

11:27.080 --> 11:28.400
is trying other OSes on there.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.940
Wimpy, have you done any experiments

11:29.940 --> 11:31.920
with Ubuntu MATE on the Pi 4?

11:31.920 --> 11:35.760
Not enough to qualify a reasonable debate

11:35.760 --> 11:36.880
at the moment, no.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.760
I'm looking forward to running that on there.

11:38.760 --> 11:41.200
I think, ultimately, that'll be my desktop for that system.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.480
But right now, I'll try Raspbian.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.560
So I've had a number of projects going on at the moment.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.680
We spoke about them last week, which was mostly

11:46.680 --> 11:49.280
around the UMPC devices.

11:49.280 --> 11:52.320
And we've got some news about another one of those tomorrow.

11:52.320 --> 11:56.280
And I'm about to head off on two weeks of vacation.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.480
And I'll be taking the Pi 4 with me.

11:59.480 --> 12:03.960
So in the evenings, when I've tucked everyone in bed,

12:03.960 --> 12:05.680
I'll have a bit of a tinker.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.040
And hopefully, I'll have something

12:08.040 --> 12:09.920
when I get back in a few weeks' time.

12:09.920 --> 12:10.600
Great.

12:10.600 --> 12:13.280
Well, in the meantime, I'm going to enjoy Raspbian.

12:13.280 --> 12:14.760
And we'll have a link to the guide

12:14.760 --> 12:17.680
to get 18.04.2 installed on there,

12:17.680 --> 12:20.280
including information about that.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.240
I guess you said it's a SATA driver bug?

12:22.240 --> 12:23.400
SD card driver.

12:23.400 --> 12:24.200
Ah, OK.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.160
You wouldn't be using one of those, would you?

12:25.160 --> 12:25.960
No, you're right.

12:25.960 --> 12:26.760
No, of course not.

12:26.760 --> 12:27.560
No, how would I?

12:27.560 --> 12:28.560
No, of course not.

12:28.560 --> 12:32.080
I do love SD cards on the Raspberry Pi,

12:32.080 --> 12:34.720
because it is 100% floppy disk.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.480
It's so floppy.

12:35.480 --> 12:36.440
It feels like it, yeah.

12:36.440 --> 12:38.600
And the way you eject it from your computer and load it in,

12:38.600 --> 12:39.720
it's just kind of fun.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.000
That takes me back.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.320
It takes me back.

12:42.320 --> 12:46.880
Since the certain models of the Pi 2 and the Pi 3

12:46.880 --> 12:51.120
have had USB booting, I've kind of been persuaded by that.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.240
I use USB devices now.

12:53.240 --> 12:53.880
Yeah.

12:53.880 --> 12:59.040
You were seeing that folks are using eSATA to USB devices

12:59.040 --> 13:00.840
to get large storage.

13:00.840 --> 13:04.000
USB 3 to SATA, and then adding solid state drives.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.760
At least that's what James Chambers suggests, in fact.

13:06.760 --> 13:07.280
OK.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.840
And then they're using that on the Pi 4

13:08.840 --> 13:10.040
to get decent large storage.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.720
That's fast.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.000
There's some options there.

13:13.000 --> 13:13.680
It's fun.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.160
Yeah, it'd be interesting to see just how far you can push

13:16.160 --> 13:17.680
this new, beefier Pi.

13:17.680 --> 13:18.200
Yeah.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.120
But also, I wonder if I could get the thing on wired

13:21.120 --> 13:23.080
ethernet, would it maybe be faster

13:23.080 --> 13:26.760
to use iSCSI or something of that nature?

13:26.760 --> 13:28.720
That's an interesting benchmark, isn't it?

13:28.720 --> 13:29.440
Yeah.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.800
Right now, I'm running just the standard Ferronix test suite

13:31.800 --> 13:32.320
benchmarks.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.200
Love that tool.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.160
You know, we're going to have to do some audio testing

13:35.160 --> 13:35.720
on there, too.

13:35.720 --> 13:36.560
Oh, yeah.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.520
Oh, yeah, because really, that's what

13:38.520 --> 13:40.440
we're going to be using these things for is solving

13:40.440 --> 13:42.680
different problems all around the studio.

13:42.680 --> 13:45.720
Well, so let's chat with Phil, because today,

13:45.720 --> 13:47.960
as we record, there's a pretty big story that's

13:47.960 --> 13:49.760
circulating around the Manjaro community

13:49.760 --> 13:51.560
and the rest of the web.

13:51.560 --> 13:53.160
And that is Manjaro's announcement

13:53.160 --> 13:55.040
that they have struck a partnership

13:55.040 --> 13:59.080
to ship the closed-sourced free office suite by default

13:59.080 --> 14:01.200
in Manjaro Linux.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.080
And I had a chance to take a look at it,

14:03.080 --> 14:04.600
because I'd never really messed around with it.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.740
So I'll share some thoughts on there.

14:05.740 --> 14:07.720
But I thought, let's get Phil on to just get

14:07.720 --> 14:10.360
an idea of what's going on from the top of the project on this.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.560
So Phil, thanks again for coming on the show.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.920
And welcome for your first time on Linux Unplugged.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.080
No problem.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.360
So in your own words, characterize

14:18.360 --> 14:19.360
today's announcement.

14:19.360 --> 14:22.880
Well, it was announced that we have a partnership

14:22.880 --> 14:26.400
with SoftMaker, who is the producer of a free office

14:26.400 --> 14:30.240
and a bunch of other open-source products,

14:30.240 --> 14:33.680
or in the case, also proprietary products.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.120
They ship out in several systems,

14:37.120 --> 14:40.080
like Mac OS, Windows, and also on Linux.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.480
And it features pretty, at least from what I can tell,

14:43.480 --> 14:47.560
pretty sweet compatibility with Microsoft Office

14:47.560 --> 14:49.080
and other commercial office products.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.680
And it has a similar look and feel

14:50.680 --> 14:52.920
to commercial Microsoft desktop office.

14:52.920 --> 14:55.560
That's exactly because they started with Windows,

14:55.560 --> 14:59.760
then moved over to Mac OS, and finally got also to Linux.

14:59.760 --> 15:03.360
And we got approached a couple of weeks ago from them

15:03.360 --> 15:07.000
directly to see how we can include

15:07.000 --> 15:08.980
free office in our distribution.

15:08.980 --> 15:09.900
What appealed to you?

15:09.900 --> 15:11.200
I mean, what was the big motivating factor?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.360
Was part of it the better compatibility?

15:13.360 --> 15:15.640
Similarity to what users migrating to Manjaro

15:15.640 --> 15:17.200
might already be familiar with?

15:17.200 --> 15:19.920
Well, it's a German company, for instance.

15:19.920 --> 15:22.320
And most of us are also from Germany.

15:22.320 --> 15:26.520
So it's just a smaller hub to go to them directly.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.480
And with the talks we had with them,

15:29.480 --> 15:33.800
they offered to adjust the free office software and even

15:33.800 --> 15:37.960
the other products they might sell for our Linux distribution

15:37.960 --> 15:40.120
to make it more compatible.

15:40.120 --> 15:42.520
And if we have some issues with that,

15:42.520 --> 15:46.000
we can present to them directly and have a direct line

15:46.000 --> 15:50.280
to their developers to fix issues if we find something.

15:50.280 --> 15:55.080
Also, they are open to change whatever we might need.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.880
So essentially, there is a business relationship,

15:58.880 --> 16:02.760
or a real actual partnership, between you

16:02.760 --> 16:06.040
and the makers of free office in such

16:06.040 --> 16:09.160
that you have a channel to give feedback and whatnot?

16:09.160 --> 16:10.000
Yes, exactly.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.320
So we start with a free office, and then we

16:13.320 --> 16:14.360
see how that works.

16:14.360 --> 16:18.000
And it was a test balloon with the release candidate five

16:18.000 --> 16:20.960
and six to see, A, how does it work?

16:20.960 --> 16:21.720
How does it look?

16:21.720 --> 16:24.640
So Softmaker also checked it from their side

16:24.640 --> 16:27.200
if it's fit their needs as well.

16:27.200 --> 16:31.520
And then I announced it with RC6 to the public as well.

16:31.520 --> 16:35.320
And now we are in a situation that we have, A, people

16:35.320 --> 16:38.160
who like it, and, B, people who doesn't dislike it.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.400
That's to be expected, I suppose.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.680
Was there a monetary exchange between the Mangero project

16:43.680 --> 16:46.120
and Softmaker for this partnership?

16:46.120 --> 16:47.600
No, it's just the beginning.

16:47.600 --> 16:51.240
So they also have the Softmaker office,

16:51.240 --> 16:54.800
which might be then in consideration

16:54.800 --> 16:56.800
to see what we can do with that.

16:56.800 --> 17:00.360
But for the beginning, it's just the partnership

17:00.360 --> 17:05.000
of we can say what is wrong or what we can improve.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.040
And they will fix it.

17:07.040 --> 17:11.120
And such and based on that, we can build on top of it.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.120
That's really great that they are

17:13.120 --> 17:15.840
willing to work with you at that level.

17:15.840 --> 17:18.700
Because your shipping, Mangero has always

17:18.700 --> 17:20.080
been a very practical distribution

17:20.080 --> 17:22.560
solving problems for the end users

17:22.560 --> 17:24.680
that other distributions don't necessarily solve.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.280
And this is yet another one, making

17:26.280 --> 17:27.920
that a smoother experience.

17:27.920 --> 17:31.080
And the type of user that needs office software

17:31.080 --> 17:33.440
isn't necessarily generally the type of user

17:33.440 --> 17:37.680
that is going to be particularly savvy at solving

17:37.680 --> 17:39.240
compatibility issues and whatnot.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.240
So this seems like a very practical choice

17:41.240 --> 17:43.240
for the end users.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.600
And at the same time, you get a channel.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.800
You get a partnership with this company

17:47.800 --> 17:50.760
to help guide feedback, which seems

17:50.760 --> 17:53.640
like a very, very good opportunity for the project

17:53.640 --> 17:54.360
overall.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.220
So I have to probably address what the big criticism has

17:57.220 --> 18:00.960
been so far, which is, well, why do this when Libre Office is

18:00.960 --> 18:04.600
perfectly capable and it's free software, so therefore,

18:04.600 --> 18:08.000
by default, that's what we all should be supporting?

18:08.000 --> 18:10.460
Well, it's a default. And either way,

18:10.460 --> 18:15.240
we will step out of this stack and say, hey, we will be bold

18:15.240 --> 18:17.360
and try something different as to rest.

18:17.360 --> 18:19.640
So we will be noticed.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.800
This is one of the considerations we did.

18:21.800 --> 18:27.200
And also, the company is 30 years in the business.

18:27.200 --> 18:31.640
And they make a living out of the office sellings.

18:31.640 --> 18:35.680
And they're willing to make it happen for several platforms

18:35.680 --> 18:40.040
and willing to include external considerations

18:40.040 --> 18:41.560
to their products.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.440
And that is one of the considerations

18:43.440 --> 18:45.920
we also made in our decision making,

18:45.920 --> 18:47.840
that the world is changing.

18:47.840 --> 18:52.000
And if a company sees Linux as a platform, it's a plus.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.320
Right, it's a recognition of desktop Linux in a sense,

18:55.320 --> 18:55.960
isn't it?

18:55.960 --> 18:59.400
Exactly, and it shows also to us that the Manchara is

18:59.400 --> 19:02.080
on the map somehow and widely used.

19:02.080 --> 19:06.360
And we were really humbled that a German company is approaching

19:06.360 --> 19:08.720
us, since we're still a hobby project.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.440
So not everybody achieved that.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.040
Wimpy, as a distro maintainer yourself,

19:13.040 --> 19:16.240
I'm curious on your thoughts about the inclusion of Libre

19:16.240 --> 19:20.640
Office as the default, because it's the free version.

19:20.640 --> 19:24.280
I'm somewhat surprised and a little bit dismayed

19:24.280 --> 19:27.400
at the community reaction to this,

19:27.400 --> 19:32.040
because there are many Linux distributions that

19:32.040 --> 19:36.960
ship by default, for example, Google Chrome and Steam.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.120
Nvidia drivers.

19:38.120 --> 19:40.120
Or Nvidia drivers.

19:40.120 --> 19:43.840
That one, I'm not prepared to put in the same category,

19:43.840 --> 19:45.960
to be honest with you, because that's

19:45.960 --> 19:50.560
all about enabling absolute functionality in the device

19:50.560 --> 19:51.440
that you own.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.080
All right, that's fair, actually.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.320
I think that's a really good point.

19:54.320 --> 19:54.960
That is a good distinction.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.280
It's about fundamentally enabling the hardware

19:57.280 --> 19:58.560
that you paid good money for.

19:58.560 --> 19:59.200
Right.

19:59.200 --> 20:04.960
Whereas if you've got Firefox available, why Google Chrome?

20:04.960 --> 20:10.040
And if you've got SuperTuxCart available, why Steam?

20:10.040 --> 20:13.800
Or why not itch.io, also proprietary?

20:13.800 --> 20:17.480
Or why not games from Humble Bundle?

20:17.480 --> 20:24.160
So I think there's a little bit of hypocrisy going on here,

20:24.160 --> 20:29.280
because there seems to be an application class which I'm not

20:29.280 --> 20:32.120
prepared to accept that this is proprietary,

20:32.120 --> 20:35.280
but then there are other applications which is, oh,

20:35.280 --> 20:38.800
that's obviously going to be proprietary, or that's fine.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.560
I want the functionality that that thing gives me.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.600
And you get a free pass on that.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.720
So I can understand where Phil's coming from.

20:47.720 --> 20:50.800
Phil is trying to build the future for Manjaro

20:50.800 --> 20:52.760
and try out new things.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.920
And we should all be trying out new things

20:54.920 --> 20:58.440
and feel that we're in a safe place to do that.

20:58.440 --> 21:02.160
And we shouldn't be lambasted for experimenting or trying

21:02.160 --> 21:03.920
to improve the Linux landscape.

21:03.920 --> 21:07.440
Because after all, since 1994, what

21:07.440 --> 21:11.880
I've been seeking to achieve is computing parity

21:11.880 --> 21:14.000
on my Linux desktop.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.120
And we're very close to getting there these days.

21:17.120 --> 21:21.160
And why stand in the way of achieving that?

21:21.160 --> 21:21.960
Yeah, well said.

21:21.960 --> 21:22.840
I completely agree.

21:22.840 --> 21:23.360
You're right.

21:23.360 --> 21:23.920
It has been.

21:23.920 --> 21:27.360
And in the case of an office suite, a word processor,

21:27.360 --> 21:29.720
spreadsheet, whatever, that seems

21:29.720 --> 21:32.440
like the quintessential get-your-job-done tool.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.440
The quintessential, I don't really care.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.200
You know it opens those for fun, right?

21:36.200 --> 21:37.960
Right.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.680
For me, what I really want to be free

21:40.680 --> 21:45.880
is my core libraries, my kernel, my desktop environment.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.600
I always want to have a free browser option forever.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.480
I always want to have something on my system

21:50.480 --> 21:51.940
that's a free browser, that's always

21:51.940 --> 21:54.440
a big requirement of mine.

21:54.440 --> 22:00.160
I start to get less picky at the more like a layer 7

22:00.160 --> 22:05.720
type basic applications, like an office suite application

22:05.720 --> 22:07.720
or a VLC type video player.

22:07.720 --> 22:11.000
I just don't really care if that's not open source,

22:11.000 --> 22:12.680
as long as the core system, as long

22:12.680 --> 22:14.280
as the fundamentals are free.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.120
But we even have it better than that, right?

22:16.120 --> 22:19.120
Because we do already have great open source implementations.

22:19.120 --> 22:21.240
This move's not really going to, is it going to,

22:21.240 --> 22:23.440
are they arguing that LibreOffice is going

22:23.440 --> 22:24.880
to be really hurt by this?

22:24.880 --> 22:25.600
I don't think so.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.760
I think the development's going to continue

22:27.760 --> 22:29.440
to be active and healthy over there.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.280
And it's still a great choice if you

22:31.280 --> 22:32.720
want to use an office suite.

22:32.720 --> 22:35.360
Phil, this has to be a tight line to walk,

22:35.360 --> 22:38.260
because you've got two sort of conflicting positions here.

22:38.260 --> 22:40.440
You've got folks that want to see you move

22:40.440 --> 22:41.400
the distribution forward.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.800
And you said something there that really caught my attention.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.120
It's a standout feature now, too.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.080
It's a differentiator.

22:46.080 --> 22:49.280
So it could be really good long term for Manjaro,

22:49.280 --> 22:51.080
just because it could get more recognition.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.640
It's going to be something that's

22:52.640 --> 22:56.000
standout different in every single review of Manjaro now.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.320
It's going to call that out.

22:57.320 --> 23:00.600
When people are talking about moving over to Linux,

23:00.600 --> 23:03.020
and they ask, well, what distribution supports my Office

23:03.020 --> 23:05.680
system that's the best, which is legitimately a workflow

23:05.680 --> 23:08.480
for people, Manjaro's name may get mentioned now

23:08.480 --> 23:09.840
at the top of that list.

23:09.840 --> 23:12.480
It could open the distribution up to new categories

23:12.480 --> 23:13.960
and types of users.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.300
So it clearly could be potentially good long term

23:16.300 --> 23:17.520
for the distribution.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.340
At the same time, you've got people

23:19.340 --> 23:21.760
that say don't bite the hand that feeds you.

23:21.760 --> 23:25.980
And it could upset long time members of your community.

23:25.980 --> 23:31.220
I'm curious how you handle that from a creator standpoint.

23:31.220 --> 23:32.960
How do you deal with that?

23:32.960 --> 23:35.280
How do you not get sort of demotivated

23:35.280 --> 23:37.160
when these kind of conflicts arise?

23:37.160 --> 23:39.400
Well, I'm highly motivated with everything.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.360
And the team is strong behind us.

23:42.360 --> 23:45.440
The decision was not made singly by me.

23:45.440 --> 23:48.560
It's also discussed with some of the team members, which

23:48.560 --> 23:52.160
were included in the discussions made with a soft maker.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.360
Can you expand on that a bit?

23:53.360 --> 23:56.480
How does that kind of process work inside the project?

23:56.480 --> 23:59.360
Well, we are currently on the leap

23:59.360 --> 24:01.280
that Manjaro is recognized.

24:01.280 --> 24:06.640
And that's why we will change the structure of Manjaro

24:06.640 --> 24:11.780
itself, because a lot of projects are hobby projects.

24:11.780 --> 24:14.360
Most of us work on the side.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.840
So everybody has a day-to-day job.

24:16.840 --> 24:19.320
And on top, when we come home, we

24:19.320 --> 24:21.160
have to work for Manjaro as well.

24:21.160 --> 24:26.960
So some of those aspects will change in a real manner

24:26.960 --> 24:28.040
real soon.

24:28.040 --> 24:30.000
And based on that, we have more time

24:30.000 --> 24:34.200
to discuss with companies like SoftMaker and others

24:34.200 --> 24:38.560
approaching to make Manjaro as a distribution

24:38.560 --> 24:39.960
secure for the future.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.900
I would love for you to come back and tell me

24:41.900 --> 24:43.520
more about that when you can.

24:43.520 --> 24:44.520
Sure, we'll do that.

24:44.520 --> 24:46.680
So it's no problem for that.

24:46.680 --> 24:51.000
The main reason we made the move with the SoftMaker in general

24:51.000 --> 24:54.080
or general with snaps we did in the past

24:54.080 --> 24:58.920
was canonical at the SnapCraft summit this year

24:58.920 --> 25:03.320
is that commercial products have the problem

25:03.320 --> 25:06.440
to implement their software on the Linux basis,

25:06.440 --> 25:09.760
because we are so differentiated and splittered up.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.320
And snaps, for example, is a baseline

25:12.320 --> 25:16.720
to make the publishers available to say, hey,

25:16.720 --> 25:18.960
this is the standard library.

25:18.960 --> 25:22.220
If you go on that, your product will work out.

25:22.220 --> 25:26.520
And snapd is not only for canonical and Ubuntu anymore.

25:26.520 --> 25:27.920
It will work on other distros.

25:27.920 --> 25:30.240
And we are humbled as Manjaro that we

25:30.240 --> 25:34.200
work with them to make all of those things happen.

25:34.200 --> 25:36.800
Sure, there's Flatpak and AppImages as well.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.320
But the industry needs a standard.

25:39.320 --> 25:42.200
And maybe this is one of the moves.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.560
As a project, do you see the most desktop opportunity

25:44.560 --> 25:46.040
with snaps?

25:46.040 --> 25:47.040
It depends.

25:47.040 --> 25:49.560
In our team and the discussion so far,

25:49.560 --> 25:53.960
snaps has a little bit more features than Flatpaks.

25:53.960 --> 25:57.040
Flatpaks are more from the Red Hat section.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.120
Snaps more from canonical.

25:59.120 --> 26:03.240
So we are currently somehow in the middle of it.

26:03.240 --> 26:06.520
And we have to see which side we go.

26:06.520 --> 26:09.920
It's like in the matrix, the blue or the red pill.

26:09.920 --> 26:11.600
Any pill might be there.

26:11.600 --> 26:14.100
Or we don't take a pill at all, because we don't like drugs.

26:14.100 --> 26:17.280
So it's always your choice.

26:17.280 --> 26:20.180
Yeah, I mean, there is a lot of great applications

26:20.180 --> 26:22.720
now shipping in both.

26:22.720 --> 26:25.720
It is like where we're at now with this whole thing Wimpy

26:25.720 --> 26:28.400
feels a bit like a whirlwind.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.560
And there's more and more opportunity out there.

26:30.560 --> 26:34.440
So Wimpy, I'm curious from your perspective,

26:34.440 --> 26:36.800
where you think snaps could fit in with Manjaro?

26:36.800 --> 26:39.520
Obviously, as Phil has just alluded to,

26:39.520 --> 26:42.560
he joined us at the SnapCraft Summit earlier this year.

26:42.560 --> 26:46.840
And personally, I spent a lot of time working with Phil.

26:46.840 --> 26:53.800
And probably my defense of Phil and Manjaro earlier

26:53.800 --> 26:58.160
betray my true feelings in that I feel I've made a friend

26:58.160 --> 27:04.240
for life having met Phil in Montreal earlier this year.

27:04.240 --> 27:08.340
And that's what happens when you get a bunch of free software

27:08.340 --> 27:11.400
developers in a room together working on stuff.

27:11.400 --> 27:16.080
You do establish relationships and friendships.

27:16.080 --> 27:21.000
And so I want to see Phil and Manjaro succeed.

27:21.000 --> 27:27.120
And I would like to think that what we can bring through snaps

27:27.120 --> 27:33.360
and the relationships we have with significant ISVs

27:33.360 --> 27:38.280
will benefit Manjaro and other Linux distributions as well,

27:38.280 --> 27:39.520
not just Ubuntu.

27:39.520 --> 27:43.880
Because I'm in a weird position at Canonical

27:43.880 --> 27:48.800
in that I work in probably one of only two departments

27:48.800 --> 27:52.200
where we don't actually care just about Ubuntu.

27:52.200 --> 27:56.760
We care about the Linux ecosystem at large.

27:56.760 --> 27:59.000
So I'm in an awkward place.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.720
I really want to see Phil succeed.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.520
I want to see Manjaro succeed.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.760
And I hope that snaps can bring something

28:04.760 --> 28:06.720
to that story for them.

28:06.720 --> 28:07.600
Yeah.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.560
I think that's really neat to see you guys working together.

28:10.560 --> 28:11.080
Yeah, it is.

28:11.080 --> 28:14.080
It is a great example of the groundwork laid by Canonical

28:14.080 --> 28:17.760
that could, in some scenarios, only be used to benefit them.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.640
But really, it does benefit all Linux users

28:20.640 --> 28:22.320
who want diverse platforms.

28:22.320 --> 28:24.680
Well, thank you for helping just clear it up

28:24.680 --> 28:26.160
and coming on the show and talking about it

28:26.160 --> 28:26.880
straight from the source.

28:26.880 --> 28:29.760
I think that helps when there's a lot of different conversations

28:29.760 --> 28:30.280
going on.

28:30.280 --> 28:32.400
I think it's good to get it directly from the project.

28:32.400 --> 28:33.840
As things develop in the future, Phil,

28:33.840 --> 28:35.840
you are welcome to come back on here and share

28:35.840 --> 28:38.720
how things go or other project news that comes up.

28:38.720 --> 28:41.560
We'd love to keep the hailing frequencies open,

28:41.560 --> 28:43.000
as Wes always says.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.120
Sure, why not?

28:44.120 --> 28:45.080
And you're welcome to stick around

28:45.080 --> 28:46.240
for the rest of the show too.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.760
We will also, by the way, have a link to information about Phil

28:49.760 --> 28:51.920
and as well as this release, which

28:51.920 --> 28:53.440
is available for testing right now.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.000
We'll have the link in the show notes

28:55.000 --> 28:57.080
over there, which you can check out.

28:57.080 --> 29:00.600
RockinXSCE4.14pre3.

29:00.600 --> 29:03.040
Ooh, don't tell Joe.

29:03.040 --> 29:05.120
Don't tell Joe, he might have to go check it out.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.480
Well, thank you, Phil, very much.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.600
That was very insightful.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.600
And I think I'm very hopeful that it works out,

29:10.600 --> 29:12.160
because it's a nice differentiator.

29:12.160 --> 29:14.560
I like to see people changing it up a little bit.

29:14.560 --> 29:18.040
And it's neat to see differentiating in a way that's

29:18.040 --> 29:19.880
kind of new, kind of new.

29:19.880 --> 29:24.560
I will say too that as a Manjaro user personally, Phil,

29:24.560 --> 29:25.480
thanks for coming on.

29:25.480 --> 29:28.400
First of all, thanks for starting the project.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.160
And personally, I don't care what

29:31.160 --> 29:33.720
Office software is on my machine,

29:33.720 --> 29:36.120
as long as it gets the job done.

29:36.120 --> 29:38.000
After this news, I gave it a download.

29:38.000 --> 29:38.760
And I like it.

29:38.760 --> 29:39.960
It's quicker than LibreOffice.

29:39.960 --> 29:41.160
It feels lighter.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.680
And it does, you know, it has a ribbon.

29:42.680 --> 29:43.680
It looks a lot like Office.

29:43.680 --> 29:44.800
It looks good, yeah.

29:44.800 --> 29:45.840
And so then we did a little digging

29:45.840 --> 29:47.080
into their revenue model.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.560
It seems pretty safe.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.520
It's not like creepy or anything.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.360
They sell SoftMaker Office directly

29:52.360 --> 29:54.360
if you want to buy the commercial version, which

29:54.360 --> 29:55.840
adds a few features.

29:55.840 --> 29:59.280
And they also have a special like fonts division

29:59.280 --> 30:03.360
that does a special typeface stuff that makes money.

30:03.360 --> 30:04.980
And then they use the free Office

30:04.980 --> 30:06.680
to help people find out about the product

30:06.680 --> 30:08.480
and whatnot in a very competitive space.

30:08.480 --> 30:10.160
It actually makes a lot of sense.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.960
So I think I'm going to leave it installed.

30:12.960 --> 30:16.880
And if I have to use a doc or docx or something, well,

30:16.880 --> 30:18.680
I'll use this instead of Google Docs now.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.120
You know, the funny part about all of this

30:20.120 --> 30:22.120
is I almost never have an Office suite installed

30:22.120 --> 30:23.120
on my machine anyway.

30:23.120 --> 30:26.440
No, I mean, I would legitimately just use Google Docs.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.240
And now I won't.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.160
So in a way, it's sort of, I think,

30:29.160 --> 30:31.080
it's at least an upgrade in privacy.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.480
You're back on desktop Linux.

30:32.480 --> 30:32.980
Ha ha.

30:32.980 --> 30:47.400
So just a couple of items of note, as it were, in the housekeeping this week, I want to get the word out there for UbiCon Europe, which is going to be in Portugal in 71 days as we record.

30:47.400 --> 30:49.240
Yeah, the October.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.040
The October was.

30:50.040 --> 30:50.960
Sounds like fun.

30:50.960 --> 30:54.120
10th through the 13th, 2019.

30:54.120 --> 30:58.040
We'll have a link in the show notes if you want to go to UbiCon Europe.

30:58.040 --> 30:59.480
I don't suppose you're going, Wimpy.

30:59.480 --> 31:01.200
UbiCon Europe, absolutely.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.120
No.

31:02.120 --> 31:03.040
No.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.800
I've got two talks accepted.

31:04.800 --> 31:07.000
Yeah, I'm fully signed up.

31:07.000 --> 31:07.680
Shocker.

31:07.680 --> 31:08.340
Shocker that.

31:08.340 --> 31:08.840
Shocker.

31:08.840 --> 31:11.680
Well, I haven't missed a UbiCon for four years.

31:11.680 --> 31:12.320
Amazing.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.680
Well, go say hi to Wimpy.

31:13.680 --> 31:14.480
Go say hi to Wimpy.

31:14.480 --> 31:17.920
We'll have a link in the show notes if you want to check it out.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.720
Because you've got some time to book your trip, as it were.

31:20.720 --> 31:30.620
Now, what you don't have time for, as you've got to just go right now as you're listening to this, if you've got it on the day of, we, very, very soon, July 31, 11 AM Pacific,

31:30.620 --> 31:34.120
are launching the next generation of free study groups.

31:34.120 --> 31:38.240
This one is the AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam Study Group.

31:38.240 --> 31:39.080
It's a multi-part.

31:39.080 --> 31:41.480
By the time you're done, you can go take the test.

31:41.480 --> 31:42.360
Wow.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.240
For free.

31:43.240 --> 31:44.000
Amazing.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.760
Yeah, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting for deets on that.

31:47.760 --> 31:53.440
And if you want some stickers and you're going to be at DEFCON, there is a sticker swap going on.

31:53.440 --> 31:58.240
And rumor has it Elle will be at DEFCON with stickers.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.540
Have you heard this rumor?

31:59.540 --> 32:02.760
So not only do you get to hang out with Elle, you also get some swag.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.520
Some stickers.

32:04.520 --> 32:10.160
And there's a good chance, there's a good chance, addendum to this rumor, it'll be show stickers.

32:10.160 --> 32:10.760
I love those.

32:10.760 --> 32:11.880
Yeah, those are pretty good, too.

32:11.880 --> 32:12.320
Check that out.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.560
We'll have information about that sticker swap.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.360
In the show notes, if you're going to DEFCON, you're like, what'd they just say?

32:17.360 --> 32:18.360
What about DEFCON?

32:18.360 --> 32:19.280
We've got the link in the show notes.

32:19.280 --> 32:24.840
I happen to know that the Linux Unplugged sticker fits very nicely on the back of a Pixel 3.

32:24.840 --> 32:26.680
So just pro tip there, pro tip.

32:26.680 --> 32:32.160
You know what we've been finding out is people love the User Air sticker because it has a double meaning.

32:32.160 --> 32:35.720
I mean, it's the podcast, but also it's kind of a funny, kind of a funny saying.

32:35.720 --> 32:38.520
It's a great looking sticker because of Mr. Bacon.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.680
So go get one of those bacon made stickers.

32:40.680 --> 32:45.000
Yeah, we've got some new ones coming out too that we will definitely have for the fest

32:45.000 --> 32:46.880
coming up next year.

32:46.880 --> 32:50.000
And some pretty cool stuff on the way, actually.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.400
And we should mention, if you are in our Telegram channel, or if you're on Telegram, Cheese

32:54.400 --> 32:57.440
has been making some unofficial, well, they're official, but they're like not real stickers

32:57.440 --> 32:58.440
or Telegram stickers.

32:58.440 --> 32:59.480
They could be real stickers.

32:59.480 --> 33:01.120
They may be real stickers in the future.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.120
They're almost more fun somehow.

33:02.120 --> 33:05.060
But they're Telegram stickers and they're awesome.

33:05.060 --> 33:06.840
And there's some really great ones.

33:06.840 --> 33:08.240
So go get that sticker pack too.

33:08.240 --> 33:11.880
Cheese is a, he's just like low key updating it every now and then too.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.120
Like he just like all of a sudden will notice like a new one will pop in there.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.080
You're like, where did this come from?

33:16.080 --> 33:18.620
Suddenly you can communicate all that much better.

33:18.620 --> 33:21.640
Is there like a URL we can, how the hell do people get that?

33:21.640 --> 33:25.520
There it is, a sticker URL that I will drop into the show notes for everybody to grab

33:25.520 --> 33:26.520
them.

33:26.520 --> 33:27.520
Yeah.

33:27.520 --> 33:28.520
Boom.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.520
There we go.

33:29.520 --> 33:30.520
Solves that problem.

33:30.520 --> 33:31.520
Thank you, sir.

33:31.520 --> 33:32.520
Appreciate that.

33:32.520 --> 33:33.520
All right.

33:33.520 --> 33:34.520
Well that, my friends, that is the housekeeping.

33:34.520 --> 33:37.740
And now we're going to talk about something that's ripped right out of the headlines,

33:37.740 --> 33:39.720
as they say, Mr. Wes.

33:39.720 --> 33:45.460
Our very own Drew has been cramming for this segment now for a couple of weeks.

33:45.460 --> 33:50.400
You may have seen the news that Fedora has announced Fedor Core OS, which is the merger

33:50.400 --> 33:52.060
of- What does that even mean?

33:52.060 --> 33:53.640
It's kind of a confusing name.

33:53.640 --> 33:54.640
I love it actually.

33:54.640 --> 33:59.800
I love it just because it brings back Fedora Core, which I'm a nerd.

33:59.800 --> 34:05.280
So it's a new edition built specifically for running containerized workloads at scale.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.900
That is right.

34:06.900 --> 34:12.520
And not to be confused with Silverblue, this is not a desktop operating system.

34:12.520 --> 34:13.520
Not at all.

34:13.520 --> 34:14.840
And it's not meant to be.

34:14.840 --> 34:20.380
Red Hat bought Core OS back in early 2018, and we've all been kind of waiting around

34:20.380 --> 34:26.840
to see what that merger is going to look like as they've been deprecating Project Atomic.

34:26.840 --> 34:28.800
And they're getting close.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.040
It's now in a preview.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.040
It's a functional preview.

34:31.040 --> 34:33.280
You can download it and run it.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.660
And essentially it's exactly what we thought it was going to be.

34:36.660 --> 34:45.040
It is Core OS, which used to be Container OS, but Fedorified with RPM OS tree on the

34:45.040 --> 34:55.580
base and immutable file system, automatic updating, integration with etcd, which isn't

34:55.580 --> 34:56.680
shipped by default.

34:56.680 --> 34:58.320
You have to run it in a container.

34:58.320 --> 35:04.880
But it's built for orchestration platforms, just like Container OS and Core OS after it

35:04.880 --> 35:05.880
were.

35:05.880 --> 35:09.600
So Alex, I want to bring you in just for a moment to help us appreciate where this sort

35:09.600 --> 35:11.560
of fits in in the product line.

35:11.560 --> 35:15.680
Alex's day job is working with OpenShift at Red Hat, so you probably have some good insights

35:15.680 --> 35:19.360
in where we can kind of fit this into the product line.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.360
The operating system matters less than ever.

35:22.360 --> 35:27.480
So with the world of containers, you're treating your infrastructure as cattle rather than

35:27.480 --> 35:28.480
pets.

35:28.480 --> 35:34.100
And if you're not familiar with that phrase, it's to do with immutable infrastructure.

35:34.100 --> 35:39.600
And essentially what that means is everything in your infrastructure environment is treated

35:39.600 --> 35:45.800
as it can just be destroyed at any moment's notice, like a cow, I guess.

35:45.800 --> 35:49.880
It's a bit, when you say it out loud, it sucks a bit, but rather than falling in love with

35:49.880 --> 35:54.040
your server and creating a special little snowflake like you would a pet, you treat

35:54.040 --> 35:57.600
it like a cattle and get rid of it.

35:57.600 --> 36:05.440
So that ethos translates through to the whole ethos behind CoreOS and Project Atomic, which

36:05.440 --> 36:10.700
is what this kind of new version of Fedora is born out of.

36:10.700 --> 36:18.840
So it fits in very, very closely with OpenShift, which is Red Hat's enterprise distro of Kubernetes.

36:18.840 --> 36:27.700
And that allows administrators of Kubernetes clusters, OpenShift in this case, to have

36:27.700 --> 36:34.400
to basically have a turnkey version of Linux that they can just deploy and not really have

36:34.400 --> 36:35.400
to worry.

36:35.400 --> 36:38.240
So it has a lot of automation in it.

36:38.240 --> 36:43.400
And essentially it's just taking the best bits of CoreOS and the best bits of Project

36:43.400 --> 36:49.960
Atomic, slamming them together and spitting out a container-friendly distro.

36:49.960 --> 36:54.120
Now Drew, when you looked at this, was it more Fedora than you expected?

36:54.120 --> 36:57.400
Because it sounds like a big part of this has been moving a lot of those tools over.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.680
So I'm kind of curious about the practicals.

36:59.680 --> 37:07.240
Honestly, no, I don't really feel, it doesn't feel like a Fedora project to me, but part

37:07.240 --> 37:14.480
of it is because I had used CoreOS back when I was working in an MSP and it really feels

37:14.480 --> 37:23.960
more like an extension of that ethos and just kind of Fedora-ified in that it is using familiar

37:23.960 --> 37:28.760
tools right down to things like Podman and Builda.

37:28.760 --> 37:38.240
So the thing that I really want to expand upon is Alex's servers as cattle metaphor

37:38.240 --> 37:39.240
here.

37:39.240 --> 37:44.800
So one important thing to note is once you get one of these up and running, there is

37:44.800 --> 37:51.240
not really any reason to log into a server and make changes.

37:51.240 --> 37:58.680
Instead of doing that, the intention is for you to spin up a replacement server and then

37:58.680 --> 38:02.800
kill the old server that no longer has that change.

38:02.800 --> 38:09.360
So it's very rare, I think, and it's going to be very rare for people to use this on

38:09.360 --> 38:11.000
any kind of bare metal.

38:11.000 --> 38:19.600
It really is targeting virtual infrastructures like KVM or AWS or anything like that.

38:19.600 --> 38:25.360
It even distributed across multiple virtualization hosts.

38:25.360 --> 38:30.320
Because of the way it's built, you can use many of these spread out across the internet

38:30.320 --> 38:37.200
and orchestrate them all together so that you have nodes in multiple data centers and

38:37.200 --> 38:44.880
if any one service goes down, you can automatically fail over to a completely different data center.

38:44.880 --> 38:52.120
It's worth mentioning that one of the core advantages, if you will, is that it's self-updating,

38:52.120 --> 38:57.720
self-maintaining in a sense, because the applications are all isolated in the containers, and it

38:57.720 --> 39:01.480
uses etcd as a key value store that's shared across the cluster.

39:01.480 --> 39:05.220
I mean, it makes it makes Beowulf clusters look adorable, it really does.

39:05.220 --> 39:08.920
And so it's like just at a whole new level.

39:08.920 --> 39:09.920
All right.

39:09.920 --> 39:13.320
Well, I'm interested, Drew, you mentioned getting it set up.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.960
I saw I had to use something called Ignition.

39:15.960 --> 39:19.000
How do I go about actually using Fedora Core OS?

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
Right.

39:20.000 --> 39:25.800
So when you go to do an installation, like I'm going to use the QEMU example here, they've

39:25.800 --> 39:28.640
got a pre-built QEMU image.

39:28.640 --> 39:35.240
And what you can do is you can point your QEMU launch command at this Ignition file,

39:35.240 --> 39:42.320
which is not handwritten, you've got to write it out in, I think it's YAML.

39:42.320 --> 39:47.880
And then after you've written that, you use something called the Fedora Core OS Config

39:47.880 --> 39:54.440
Transpiler, or FCCT to generate that Ignition file.

39:54.440 --> 39:58.580
So the Ignition file is not meant to be handwritten at all.

39:58.580 --> 40:02.140
It's really more machine readable.

40:02.140 --> 40:07.740
And you can honestly just write it with very human readable text, which then just gets

40:07.740 --> 40:09.280
kind of converted over.

40:09.280 --> 40:17.920
So once you spin it up, the QEMU image is going to pull your config from that file and

40:17.920 --> 40:19.940
automatically set itself up.

40:19.940 --> 40:26.640
And that includes things like user creation, SSH key installation for that user, and system

40:26.640 --> 40:28.200
D units.

40:28.200 --> 40:33.400
And the whole thing is kind of developed around using system D units to build things.

40:33.400 --> 40:36.440
So say you want it to be a Docker host, right?

40:36.440 --> 40:43.140
Well, you can create a system D unit in that configuration file that calls Podman, or Docker

40:43.140 --> 40:49.200
if you want to use Docker, to pull down the image, build it, run it, the whole nine yards.

40:49.200 --> 40:52.260
So just actually, can I touch on something there?

40:52.260 --> 40:56.320
Is this, we've been using containers as a term, but are they actually Docker containers

40:56.320 --> 40:58.840
or is this a Podman based system?

40:58.840 --> 41:00.380
Podman is Red Hat's thing, right?

41:00.380 --> 41:01.700
They're competitor to Docker?

41:01.700 --> 41:07.720
I'm not sure I would say competitor, because Red Hat and Docker are both in the Open Container

41:07.720 --> 41:10.240
Initiative, the OCI.

41:10.240 --> 41:17.240
And what that is doing is trying to make a cross compatible version of containers so

41:17.240 --> 41:22.840
that you could use Docker or Podman to accomplish the same goals.

41:22.840 --> 41:23.960
Ah, okay.

41:23.960 --> 41:27.840
But they're using, in this case, they're using Podman, which would essentially be the tools

41:27.840 --> 41:31.120
behind standing up the containers and managing the containers?

41:31.120 --> 41:35.920
Well, both Docker and Podman are included in the base image for Fedora Core OS.

41:35.920 --> 41:38.320
Now Docker is not the preferred one.

41:38.320 --> 41:45.400
They want you to use Podman because Podman is not running a daemon as root the whole

41:45.400 --> 41:46.400
time.

41:46.400 --> 41:49.140
The entire system can be run with only user permissions.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.800
That's kind of the whole reason behind them creating Podman.

41:52.800 --> 41:56.320
So I don't know if you are familiar, when you're running cockpit, I think you have to

41:56.320 --> 41:58.360
mount the Docker socket.

41:58.360 --> 42:02.320
And that is considered a bit of a security no-no.

42:02.320 --> 42:06.560
Because Podman is daemonless, you don't have to mount anything as root in order to see

42:06.560 --> 42:07.560
what's going on.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.120
So it's a user space thing.

42:09.120 --> 42:10.320
That's the difference.

42:10.320 --> 42:11.540
I see.

42:11.540 --> 42:12.720
Thank you.

42:12.720 --> 42:19.280
And the other thing is Podman was designed with Kubernetes integration in mind, whereas

42:19.280 --> 42:25.740
Docker kind of predates the whole Kubernetes fanfare by a little bit.

42:25.740 --> 42:31.040
And its Kubernetes integration is more of an afterthought than built from the ground

42:31.040 --> 42:32.040
up.

42:32.040 --> 42:33.600
Would you agree with that, Alex?

42:33.600 --> 42:34.600
Yeah, absolutely.

42:34.600 --> 42:39.760
I don't want to poo-poo any of the work that Docker did in the early days, because they

42:39.760 --> 42:42.320
closed that last 10% for containers.

42:42.320 --> 42:47.880
I mean, you look at what the FreeBSD guys had for ages with jails, and we started talking

42:47.880 --> 42:50.480
about containers years after they had them.

42:50.480 --> 42:54.640
And they were smugly sat over there going, you know, we've had this for years, guys.

42:54.640 --> 43:02.920
But Docker closed that gap, and now the industry as a whole has really woken up to the engineering

43:02.920 --> 43:08.960
challenges around containers, and Podman and Builder and Scopio are the end result.

43:08.960 --> 43:14.460
And there's a link in the show doc which talks about there's a growing movement of moving

43:14.460 --> 43:19.640
away from this monolithic daemon, which is Docker, which is all the plumbing and everything

43:19.640 --> 43:26.160
required to run a container, a Docker container, as we always call them, when actually they

43:26.160 --> 43:31.120
are just Linux containers, they're not really Docker containers.

43:31.120 --> 43:37.240
And now we're moving into a world where you have Podman, which is Pod manager, designed

43:37.240 --> 43:38.720
to execute containers.

43:38.720 --> 43:47.020
You have Builder, Build-A-H is how it's spelt, and that's designed to just build containers.

43:47.020 --> 43:51.140
And then you have Scopio, which is designed to do things like tagging and moving images

43:51.140 --> 43:53.120
around all over the place and stuff like that.

43:53.120 --> 43:59.200
So it separates out the various concerns into separately maintainable tools, which has a

43:59.200 --> 44:04.400
huge benefit, if you think about it, of not needing to ship the entire thing when you

44:04.400 --> 44:07.040
only want to update your build tool.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.040
Right?

44:08.040 --> 44:11.480
Or the reverse, if you don't need to build images on your production boxes, you don't

44:11.480 --> 44:12.480
need that there either.

44:12.480 --> 44:13.480
Oh, yeah.

44:13.480 --> 44:14.480
Yeah, that's a great point.

44:14.480 --> 44:15.480
I hadn't thought of that.

44:15.480 --> 44:19.960
I think that's true, because one thing I have in the back of my mind is I think I have made

44:19.960 --> 44:24.320
the mistake of kind of comparing this directly with Ubuntu Core, and they're sort of solving

44:24.320 --> 44:25.600
different problems.

44:25.600 --> 44:27.000
They're entirely different.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.080
They are.

44:28.080 --> 44:36.000
And essentially, the way I look at Ubuntu Core is more of an Internet of Things type

44:36.000 --> 44:43.880
workload than necessarily server host nodes, which is what I think of for Core OS.

44:43.880 --> 44:44.880
You'd agree with that, Wimpy?

44:44.880 --> 44:51.320
Yeah, Ubuntu Core is designed for IoT devices, and Ubuntu via cloud init is designed for

44:51.320 --> 44:53.760
containers and has been for many years.

44:53.760 --> 44:58.400
So to quickly summarize it, the key difference is that Ubuntu Core is targeted more at endpoint

44:58.400 --> 45:03.260
devices, and Fedora Core OS is targeted more at server devices.

45:03.260 --> 45:05.840
That's essentially the gist of it.

45:05.840 --> 45:09.600
Now, you can run Fedora Core OS on a local device.

45:09.600 --> 45:11.480
You can install it on bare metal.

45:11.480 --> 45:14.200
There's just not much reason to.

45:14.200 --> 45:17.120
It's really meant more for virtualization.

45:17.120 --> 45:22.540
But when I spun up Ubuntu Core, the first thing that you notice is that you're not going

45:22.540 --> 45:25.060
to use apt at all.

45:25.060 --> 45:32.000
It's primarily for Snap D, and one of the big use cases that I think is growing is for

45:32.000 --> 45:33.000
kiosks.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.560
That's certainly one of the use cases.

45:34.560 --> 45:37.880
I mean, there is no apt in Ubuntu Core.

45:37.880 --> 45:43.800
It's an entirely new Ubuntu for a new use case.

45:43.800 --> 45:46.880
So everything in Ubuntu Core is a snap.

45:46.880 --> 45:48.680
The kernel is a snap.

45:48.680 --> 45:50.920
The base operating system is a snap.

45:50.920 --> 45:56.760
And the applications that you deploy on it are snaps, and they have to be strictly confined.

45:56.760 --> 45:59.500
So that's the only way you can go.

45:59.500 --> 46:04.440
And yes, there are a number of digital signage organizations using Ubuntu Core to deploy

46:04.440 --> 46:05.440
their products.

46:05.440 --> 46:06.440
Cool.

46:06.440 --> 46:10.760
That sign may be running Linux, and we just don't even know it.

46:10.760 --> 46:15.680
I think the thing where there is some confusion is there is, unless I'm wrong, a common thread

46:15.680 --> 46:23.760
between Silverblue, Fedora Core OS, and Ubuntu Core, and that is the updates are done in

46:23.760 --> 46:26.560
a way where you can roll back.

46:26.560 --> 46:28.040
It's sort of self-updating.

46:28.040 --> 46:30.840
Those are sort of the common elements between all of those, right?

46:30.840 --> 46:31.840
Right.

46:31.840 --> 46:36.640
What you're really looking at is the idea of an immutable file system, which is really

46:36.640 --> 46:44.360
becoming an important aspect for security and stability across a lot of different distributions

46:44.360 --> 46:45.960
these days.

46:45.960 --> 46:52.960
And essentially, what you're looking at is the base file system does not change during

46:52.960 --> 46:54.040
user operation.

46:54.040 --> 46:59.800
The only way to change it is during a reboot by booting into a new image.

46:59.800 --> 47:07.360
And I was not finding strict documentation on how Ubuntu handled this for Ubuntu Core.

47:07.360 --> 47:14.880
So I'm curious, Wimpy, if you had any insight into how it does its image generation for

47:14.880 --> 47:16.240
updates.

47:16.240 --> 47:18.320
For updates of the OS?

47:18.320 --> 47:19.320
Yes.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.320
Okay.

47:20.320 --> 47:29.080
So updates of Ubuntu Core behave exactly like Ubuntu updates for the cloud images, which

47:29.080 --> 47:36.560
is every time we provide an update that patches a security vulnerability, we automatically

47:36.560 --> 47:39.000
spin a new image.

47:39.000 --> 47:43.560
So if you are downloading that image on that day, you get the current version.

47:43.560 --> 47:45.920
And those images are then pushed down.

47:45.920 --> 47:50.360
So in the case of cloud init, they're available via apt updates.

47:50.360 --> 47:54.760
And in the case of Ubuntu Core, they're just atomic updates that just happen.

47:54.760 --> 47:55.760
Right.

47:55.760 --> 47:56.760
Okay.

47:56.760 --> 47:57.760
That makes a lot of sense.

47:57.760 --> 47:58.760
Future.

47:58.760 --> 47:59.760
Yeah.

47:59.760 --> 48:00.760
Right now, Wes, you feel it?

48:00.760 --> 48:01.760
Oh, yeah.

48:01.760 --> 48:02.760
That's kind of great.

48:02.760 --> 48:11.280
What's interesting is we're all arriving at the same solutions, the same style of solutions

48:11.280 --> 48:14.200
to meet the demands of our customers.

48:14.200 --> 48:21.640
So while we're all pursuing a slightly different tech here, this is what modern Linux looks

48:21.640 --> 48:23.200
like now.

48:23.200 --> 48:26.400
It's not just Canonical and Red Hat doing this.

48:26.400 --> 48:33.280
This is what enterprise and industry demands of commercial Linux these days.

48:33.280 --> 48:34.280
Yeah.

48:34.280 --> 48:39.960
And that's why also Manjaro is there and looks which technology is the best to do that.

48:39.960 --> 48:45.240
And strict confinement is also good because most people say, hey, in snaps, there can

48:45.240 --> 48:46.580
be malware.

48:46.580 --> 48:48.880
But if you're in strict confinement, it's confined.

48:48.880 --> 48:54.200
So it's only the application which might be affected, but not the whole system.

48:54.200 --> 48:55.200
Right.

48:55.200 --> 48:56.200
Absolutely.

48:56.200 --> 48:59.120
So modern desktop has to have something in place for that, especially if we really do

48:59.120 --> 49:04.360
want to have the regular quote unquote users join us over here.

49:04.360 --> 49:05.660
We've got to keep them protected.

49:05.660 --> 49:10.940
And how magical is it, Chris, when you take down a server and you have your state stored

49:10.940 --> 49:15.800
somewhere else, bring your server back up somewhere else and just point it at the state,

49:15.800 --> 49:19.720
the volumes on a different storage somewhere and it just works.

49:19.720 --> 49:24.040
The application runtime is separated from the application state.

49:24.040 --> 49:26.640
It's just magical when you do that and it's as you left it.

49:26.640 --> 49:27.640
It really is.

49:27.640 --> 49:30.720
And it's neat to see things scaled down and we're finally getting them scaled down to

49:30.720 --> 49:31.720
work nicely.

49:31.720 --> 49:32.720
Right.

49:32.720 --> 49:36.440
So you can use them to just run little infrastructure at home, still solving basically the same

49:36.440 --> 49:38.640
fundamental problems that are needed when you are Facebook.

49:38.640 --> 49:42.440
I mean, essentially what we've set up here at the studio is a little small business server

49:42.440 --> 49:46.520
for a small team to work out of an office, which is a studio.

49:46.520 --> 49:50.760
And so we have certain data transfer and storage requirements that might be out of the ordinary

49:50.760 --> 49:52.540
than a small business.

49:52.540 --> 49:54.620
But what you're saying there is so true.

49:54.620 --> 49:59.640
This enterprise scale technology that lets you deploy systems all around the globe on

49:59.640 --> 50:04.280
across multiple different clouds is also now approachable by somebody like me.

50:04.280 --> 50:06.040
And Alex, you asked how does it feel?

50:06.040 --> 50:11.440
I can't really equate it because you have to have been there, but I imagine it must

50:11.440 --> 50:17.920
feel like somebody who was a professional chef for their career and they retired and

50:17.920 --> 50:22.680
a few years, like five, 10 years after they retired, the microwave was invented.

50:22.680 --> 50:23.680
Right.

50:23.680 --> 50:28.640
And then you watch how fast people can like warm stuff and it just blows your mind.

50:28.640 --> 50:30.480
That's containers to me on Linux.

50:30.480 --> 50:31.480
Yeah.

50:31.480 --> 50:34.080
You, I mean, when you got out of things, I was only just sort of starting, right?

50:34.080 --> 50:36.120
I mean, you were in the height of the VM world.

50:36.120 --> 50:37.120
Yes.

50:37.120 --> 50:38.120
Oh, big time.

50:38.120 --> 50:43.680
Yesterday we destroyed all of the containers on the server here for a couple of minutes

50:43.680 --> 50:47.600
and then within minutes have them all back up and running, reattached to their config

50:47.600 --> 50:48.600
and good to go.

50:48.600 --> 50:49.600
And you weren't even worried.

50:49.600 --> 50:52.320
The first time you do that, it changes your life.

50:52.320 --> 50:53.320
I swear.

50:53.320 --> 50:54.320
And we just did it yesterday.

50:54.320 --> 50:57.200
Just, you know, I was like, I got to, I got to, I can't even remember what we were.

50:57.200 --> 51:00.920
We were, oh, we were, uh, we were doing a dry run of the full upgrade and security update

51:00.920 --> 51:04.200
process on Fedora and wanted to make sure like everything worked.

51:04.200 --> 51:06.780
And we did the SE Linux troubleshooting and we're doing the whole, we did a whole dry

51:06.780 --> 51:09.880
run on the whole thing, which happened to be a hot run and it worked.

51:09.880 --> 51:15.000
So you know, these days you're mad if you're not using virtualization at scale.

51:15.000 --> 51:18.000
Seven years ago, you were mad if you were considering it.

51:18.000 --> 51:22.720
I feel like containers are at that kind of same point, right?

51:22.720 --> 51:29.240
Where it's reaching a critical velocity, a terminal velocity where you're beginning to

51:29.240 --> 51:32.520
get to that point where you're crazy if you're not doing stuff this way.

51:32.520 --> 51:40.080
Whereas, you know, five years ago, containers were just, you know, fairy dust.

51:40.080 --> 51:44.720
One other thing I wanted to bring up is silver blue.

51:44.720 --> 51:52.300
Silver blue as a workstation was never really meant for standard desktop work.

51:52.300 --> 51:58.840
It was meant for people who are building containers with, I think, an eye towards the release

51:58.840 --> 52:05.960
of Fedora Core OS and the migration from Atomic into the new Core OS future.

52:05.960 --> 52:14.240
So to me, them releasing the silver blue workstation and getting that shipped in a very usable

52:14.240 --> 52:20.260
state was kind of a precursor to what we're getting ready to see, which exactly as Alex

52:20.260 --> 52:23.800
said is about to be all containers all the time.

52:23.800 --> 52:24.800
Wow.

52:24.800 --> 52:25.800
You're right.

52:25.800 --> 52:31.880
So Fedora Core OS will have developers running Fedora Silver Blue, developing the software

52:31.880 --> 52:33.880
to run on Fedora Core OS.

52:33.880 --> 52:34.880
That's right.

52:34.880 --> 52:36.980
Ah, that puts it all in perspective right there.

52:36.980 --> 52:37.980
Thank you, Drew.

52:37.980 --> 52:42.680
Thank you for trying these out and helping us better alliterate the differences between

52:42.680 --> 52:47.480
Ubuntu Core, Fedora Silver Blue, and now Fedora Core OS.

52:47.480 --> 52:49.480
Yeah, I mean, Chris can really say them all.

52:49.480 --> 52:52.960
There's no way he would have got it all right.

52:52.960 --> 52:53.960
You know what, Drew?

52:53.960 --> 52:54.960
We appreciate it.

52:54.960 --> 52:55.960
Thank you very much.

52:55.960 --> 52:57.720
Phil, thank you for coming on the show.

52:57.720 --> 53:02.400
I look forward to hearing the future of the Manjaro project and of course having you back

53:02.400 --> 53:03.400
on here.

53:03.400 --> 53:05.040
Phil, one of the founders of the Manjaro project.

53:05.040 --> 53:06.400
Thank you very much for joining us.

53:06.400 --> 53:07.400
Thanks.

53:07.400 --> 53:10.080
Now, we'd love to have you join us too, jblive.tv.

53:10.080 --> 53:12.540
We do this here show on Tuesdays.

53:12.540 --> 53:15.440
Very soon we're going to have a very special all-in-studio edition.

53:15.440 --> 53:16.440
Oh, I'm excited.

53:16.440 --> 53:17.920
I think that's in two weeks.

53:17.920 --> 53:18.920
Is that right?

53:18.920 --> 53:19.920
Two weeks.

53:19.920 --> 53:21.920
So if you can, put that on your calendar.

53:21.920 --> 53:25.520
Get the times over at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar and all of our links over at

53:25.520 --> 53:27.040
linuxunplugged.com.

53:27.040 --> 53:28.040
Thanks for joining us.

53:28.040 --> 53:43.160
See you next Tuesday.

53:59.040 --> 54:04.840
All right, we've got to go boat.

54:04.840 --> 54:05.840
Jbtitles.com.

54:05.840 --> 54:06.840
All right.

54:06.840 --> 54:07.840
So you know what got me?

54:07.840 --> 54:10.240
It's that sweet new intro Joe made me.

54:10.240 --> 54:11.240
You caught me.

54:11.240 --> 54:14.200
I was like getting a sip of water during the regular intro because my instincts kicked

54:14.200 --> 54:15.200
in and I thought it was longer.

54:15.200 --> 54:16.200
Yeah.

54:16.200 --> 54:17.200
And you do want to wet the palette, right?

54:17.200 --> 54:18.200
Yeah.

54:18.200 --> 54:19.200
Right?

54:19.200 --> 54:20.200
I was trying to prepare for the show.

54:20.200 --> 54:21.200
That's pretty good.

54:21.200 --> 54:22.200
I resisted.

54:22.200 --> 54:23.200
I resisted.

54:23.200 --> 54:24.320
I wanted to do it.

54:24.320 --> 54:26.400
I wanted to say one more thing.

54:26.400 --> 54:27.400
Well, what did you want to say?

54:27.400 --> 54:28.440
Get it in now.

54:28.440 --> 54:35.400
There's actually a third piece to the core OS silver blue thing that was kind of glossed

54:35.400 --> 54:38.360
over and that's that there's a Fedora IOT edition.

54:38.360 --> 54:45.240
And the IOT edition takes the core OS technology and puts it in an even smaller base, even

54:45.240 --> 54:52.040
more reduced and even more simplified for targeting the same use cases that Ubuntu

54:52.040 --> 54:53.720
core does.

54:53.720 --> 54:59.720
And again, it's a container focused workflow because what they're going with is more of

54:59.720 --> 55:04.760
a model of, well, you already have these OCI images and they can be built multi-arch just

55:04.760 --> 55:09.360
like every other reasonable format can or unreasonable format.

55:09.360 --> 55:15.160
And so you can build these targeting ARM, targeting power, targeting x86, MIPS, whatever

55:15.160 --> 55:16.160
you like.

55:16.160 --> 55:23.800
In this case, Fedora is supporting ARM and x86 with this and actually also I686 because

55:23.800 --> 55:31.560
shockingly, and this depresses me to no end, 32-bit x86 is alive in IOT and that hurts

55:31.560 --> 55:33.880
me really bad.

55:33.880 --> 55:41.440
But that world is where a lot of this Fedora IOT stuff is going into is that they're building

55:41.440 --> 55:48.440
an even more reduced functionality targeted for bare metal kind of environment for supporting

55:48.440 --> 55:53.440
these kinds of applications on there because as it turns out, as Ubuntu core also proves,

55:53.440 --> 55:58.760
a containerized confined model for applications can also work well in an IOT space when the

55:58.760 --> 56:03.920
machine is sufficiently powerful, as in the case of kiosk digital signage and stuff like

56:03.920 --> 56:04.920
that.

56:04.920 --> 56:08.480
But the goal there would be, and who knows if it could be accomplished, but the goal

56:08.480 --> 56:14.520
would be that the vendors could then actually maintain and update the applications and the

56:14.520 --> 56:20.440
operating systems would be self-maintaining and we'd maybe actually live in a reality

56:20.440 --> 56:25.320
of standardized IOT devices that have some level of security.

56:25.320 --> 56:26.320
Bingo.

56:26.320 --> 56:31.960
And in fact, next week at Flock, the guy who is primarily leading the Fedora IOT edition,

56:31.960 --> 56:37.920
Peter Robinson, is actually going to be giving a talk about enterprise scale usage of Fedora

56:37.920 --> 56:38.920
IOT edition.

56:38.920 --> 56:40.920
Wimby, I have a question for you.

56:40.920 --> 56:45.720
How does Ubuntu core boot from a kernel snap?

56:45.720 --> 56:48.520
Is there a bootloader that can mount a snap?

56:48.520 --> 56:52.300
A kernel delivered as a snap is just a bunch of files on disk, right?

56:52.300 --> 56:54.260
It's no different from anything else.

56:54.260 --> 56:56.080
It's not magical.

56:56.080 --> 57:04.160
Within the project, we were a little bit surprised when Joey posted a few months ago about the

57:04.160 --> 57:10.880
snap store was a snap and it can install snaps.

57:10.880 --> 57:14.280
Everyone else was like, well, how the bloody hell does that work?

57:14.280 --> 57:15.280
Snapseption.

57:15.280 --> 57:16.280
Yeah, right.

57:16.280 --> 57:17.840
We were like, it's obvious how that works.

57:17.840 --> 57:23.200
It was obvious to us at least, and then it was completely unobvious to everybody else.

57:23.200 --> 57:26.840
There are some things like this and it is a little bit of a paradigm shift, but it's

57:26.840 --> 57:29.240
just snaps are not magic.

57:29.240 --> 57:30.280
They're not voodoo.

57:30.280 --> 57:35.080
It's just another way of getting bits on a disk somewhere.
