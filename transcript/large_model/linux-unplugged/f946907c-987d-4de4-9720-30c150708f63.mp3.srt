1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,180
Well, this is gonna be a fun episode

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,180
because Brent's in studio.

3
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,080
Hello, Brent.

4
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,200
Oh, hello.

5
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,280
Nice to see you here.

6
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,680
Oh, so nice seeing you too.

7
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,000
We're getting ready to go down to Portland

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,200
for a Clear Linux event.

9
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,040
We are.

10
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,440
And enjoying ourselves pineapple cider.

11
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,900
I think we're just warming up at this point

12
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,740
for the trip, you know?

13
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,560
Yeah, that's right.

14
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,760
We're warming up for the show,

15
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,880
and then after the show,

16
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,860
we'll be like ready to go to Portland, yeah.

17
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,400
We're gonna need somebody to drive us, but.

18
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,840
Anybody, anybody?

19
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,280
I'm excited to have you here, Brent.

20
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,120
Thank you.

21
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,760
It's great to be back in studio,

22
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,600
typically the way it's worked previously

23
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,080
is a year's gap between that.

24
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,120
But now we're looking at,

25
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,760
this is, well, I haven't even been home

26
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,920
since the last time I've been here, so.

27
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,560
No, we were on the Friday stream

28
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,560
and I was like, Brent, come back, come back.

29
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,480
It's funny, because the whole story

30
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,160
is really captured in that Friday stream.

31
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,880
It really is, and I hesitated, I have to say.

32
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,880
But you called, you were here, you're here though.

33
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,960
You gotta pull those things off

34
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,800
when you get to get the chance.

35
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:49,640
When you get an opportunity.

36
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,460
Yeah, of course.

37
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,300
I'm glad you did.

38
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,400
We went out and bought brats.

39
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,200
Brats, they were at the front of line.

40
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,660
As they should be.

41
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:01,660
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 302 for May 21st, 2019.

42
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,460
Welcome into Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show.

43
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:18,180
My name is Chris.

44
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,020
And my name is Brent.

45
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,860
Hey there, Brent.

46
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,680
Well, hello.

47
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,520
Great to have you here.

48
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,340
That's good mean.

49
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,180
You already knew that though.

50
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,220
Aw, you know.

51
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,500
Well, you picked a good episode,

52
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,540
because we have, I don't know, man.

53
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,100
We have like staggering community news this week.

54
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,940
You and I were out and about when this news came in.

55
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,500
I was like, whoa, whoa, we're adding that to the show.

56
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,840
It's just breaking today as we're going on the air.

57
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,260
But there's also just some really great future stuff

58
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,620
that we're gonna talk about with Cassidy

59
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,980
from Elementary OS.

60
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,500
Couple of important things in housekeeping

61
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,740
I wanna talk to you guys about and get your feedback.

62
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,720
And then, after all of that, we're going Team Silverblue.

63
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:52,900
It's kind of like a Red Hat arc we've been having.

64
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,700
You know, we started with Fedora's release,

65
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,740
then we went to Red Hat Summit and Rell,

66
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,580
and now we're ending it with a look at Silverblue,

67
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,820
because Drew's joining us too.

68
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,780
Hello, Drew.

69
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,900
Hello, hello.

70
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,100
Drew took the plunge.

71
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,360
He's been rocking Silverblue for the past week and change

72
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,640
and been taking copious notes.

73
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,420
So he'll be joining us later on in the show

74
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,940
to chat about that.

75
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,020
Of course, Mr. Bacon's here too.

76
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,940
Hello, Cheesy.

77
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,780
Hey, guys.

78
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,600
How's it going?

79
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,440
Oh, good, good.

80
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,280
And hello, Alex.

81
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,240
Good to see you here as well.

82
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,220
I'm excited to get into the news this week.

83
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,460
Yes, there's a lot to...

84
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,420
So very quickly, I will say hello to the mumble room

85
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,700
to our virtual lug time.

86
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,340
Appropriate greetings to y'all.

87
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,180
Hello.

88
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,020
Hello.

89
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,840
Hi, there.

90
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,020
Hello, Bruce and Byte and Cassidy and Mini Mac

91
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,680
and Nerd Burner and the others that will join us

92
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,800
that never get called out as they filter in later

93
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,220
in the show because they're running late.

94
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,040
But a future hello to you.

95
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,820
Now, let's start with, I think,

96
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,100
what is probably the news that sort of shocked me

97
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,980
the most this week, and that is the Antergos project

98
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,900
has announced it's coming to an end.

99
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,920
Don't say it.

100
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,760
It's true.

101
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,660
Come on.

102
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:00,200
Yeah, this is really, really sad

103
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,220
because I know a lot of folks in our audience run it.

104
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,340
I ran it for a while.

105
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,540
They say over their run since they've been tracking,

106
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,540
which is about 2014, they had 931,439 unique downloads.

107
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,180
Today, they are announcing the end of the project

108
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,860
for existing Antergos users.

109
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,320
There's no need to worry.

110
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,460
They'll continue to receive updates directly from Arch,

111
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,980
and soon, Antergos will release an update

112
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,600
that will remove some of their specific repos

113
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,440
from your machine.

114
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,620
You are a daily Antergos driver.

115
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,860
You use it every single day.

116
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,220
I really am, and part of that reason is from JB

117
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,520
and all the recommendations that were coming in from that,

118
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,620
and I've loved it.

119
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,960
I've really loved it, and what I appreciated about Antergos,

120
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:45,420
or Antargos as it was called,

121
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,000
is that it made the whole process

122
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,060
of going through Arch really simple,

123
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,780
and so with seeing that go away,

124
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,900
I know there's some alternatives,

125
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,220
but with seeing that go away,

126
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,940
it makes me wonder a lot of questions.

127
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,580
I know, it's not that Manjaro isn't great,

128
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,980
and you do wonder if maybe the Manjaro competition here

129
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,980
is a bit of this.

130
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,480
They say they ran out of time.

131
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,700
Maybe there was too many options.

132
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,540
The thing that I really liked about it over other options

133
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,260
is it was essentially mainline Arch

134
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,580
with a couple of small changes,

135
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,100
like a couple of icon packages and whatnot

136
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,580
from their own repository,

137
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,100
but it was a great way to get a fairly base Arch desktop

138
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,180
with Gnome or Plasma or any desktop you really wanted.

139
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,900
They gave you an option right there,

140
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,940
and it was really, it was just,

141
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,780
gosh, it's good.

142
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,540
I mean, we're talking about it like it's gone.

143
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,200
I guess it'll still work for a little while.

144
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,120
Do we know a little bit more about what the main reason was

145
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,900
for the Switch or the decision, I suppose?

146
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,820
Only what they posted.

147
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,040
Dustin, Alex, and Gatsu posted on a blog over here about it,

148
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,260
and they talk about just,

149
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,880
if you've been paying attention to the project,

150
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,340
and I kind of noticed this myself,

151
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,940
like they really haven't been doing much recently,

152
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,560
and it's because they've been running out of time.

153
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,400
Right.

154
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,520
Yeah, well, time is a precious thing,

155
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,060
and sometimes it's a good thing

156
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,460
when you can decide that a project needs to switch

157
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,260
and to do it gracefully

158
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,540
instead of just kind of letting it die for a long time.

159
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,320
So I hope that this is accepted by the community

160
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,160
in a nice way,

161
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,020
and that the alternatives for current users,

162
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,540
if I'm gonna stay on this system,

163
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,100
which I love and I've had for a few years,

164
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,700
I hope it doesn't just degrade.

165
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,980
Does seem like a classy way to handle it, right, Cheez?

166
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,980
Oh, yeah, definitely.

167
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,180
And it seems like the way that they've kind of,

168
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,640
they're shutting down the project,

169
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,400
and they're pulling these packages,

170
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,060
but they're still leaving you a desktop to work from.

171
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,140
I mean, they're gracefully bowing out,

172
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,860
and they state that it really began as just a project,

173
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,560
a summer project seven years ago,

174
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,880
and grew into what it is.

175
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,400
And as people grow older and their time is more valuable,

176
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,420
they move on to other things.

177
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,380
So I'm very thankful that they've bowed out

178
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,220
the way that they have,

179
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,940
and they've allowed anyone to step up and take the plate,

180
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,700
and fork it and keep going with any of their hard work

181
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,820
that they've provided us.

182
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,740
Alex, does this mean we can't really trust

183
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,060
these small-time distributions?

184
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,540
Like, we have to stick with our Ubuntu,

185
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:04,200
Debian, Fedora world, and there are open SUSEs out there,

186
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:09,200
and things like Antigros or other small projects

187
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,500
are just too risky?

188
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,340
They just seem to come and go every couple of years.

189
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,340
They made it a few years.

190
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,860
I mean, to give them some credit, they did make it a while,

191
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,660
but at the end of the day,

192
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,980
it's like another small distro that's distro fading.

193
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,440
That's the nature of human effort though, isn't it?

194
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,620
Is that, like Chi said, as you grow older,

195
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,240
your time becomes more valuable,

196
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,100
and priorities change and everything changes in your life.

197
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,360
However, if we look at Google, right?

198
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,200
They like changing stuff, don't they?

199
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,620
And they're not a small-time thing.

200
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,140
So I'm not necessarily certain

201
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,340
that your assertion is accurate.

202
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,300
It might be fair in this case though.

203
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,460
However, another thing I'd like to say is that

204
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,500
installing Arch isn't that difficult.

205
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,580
So the value proposition of what Antergos

206
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,460
brought to the table was, I mean, I used it a lot.

207
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,060
So back in 2013, 14 sort of time,

208
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,180
I did a computer science masters,

209
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,820
and as part of that, I did a Linux desktop comparison

210
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,740
as part of my dissertation.

211
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,300
And I used the heck out of Antergos,

212
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,520
and I'm reveling in that pronunciation.

213
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,780
Might as well get it out while we can,

214
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,620
cause it's gonna be gone.

215
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,580
I used the heck out of it.

216
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,820
It was one of the most vanilla Linux distro

217
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,380
kind of presentations of multiple different

218
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,260
desktop environments that was out there at the time.

219
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,900
It really fulfilled that niche for me at that point,

220
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,860
very, very well, and I'm sad to see it go,

221
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,380
but at the same time I recognize

222
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,420
that nothing lasts forever.

223
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,740
Well said, and I agree also with Brent's point

224
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,860
about if they have to do it,

225
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,020
doing it in a graceful manner is the best way to do it.

226
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,620
Keep users' expectations.

227
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,780
They could've stretched the thing out for a year.

228
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,600
I mean, this could've taken them a year

229
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,220
to come clean about it. Or let it rot,

230
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,380
and just disappear without having an official path.

231
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,020
Your pride could get in the way

232
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,820
of coming clean on that kind of stuff.

233
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,660
What I appreciate about a small project like this

234
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,900
is just taking some risks to try to get it going,

235
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,420
and then okay, if it's not gonna work after a few years,

236
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,100
that's okay, we can be all right with that.

237
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,900
I think both you and Alex are convincing me

238
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,660
that it's worth the attempt.

239
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,580
Even if in the end you get four or six years in,

240
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,780
or three years in, and it distro fades.

241
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,020
In the meantime, if they're doing something innovative,

242
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,340
it's worth the attempt.

243
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,100
And I think I completely agree with that.

244
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,940
I'm glad they tried.

245
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,700
Yeah, did not all distributions start

246
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,940
with two guys in a living room,

247
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,740
or are a few people just trying to put some ideas together?

248
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,420
Well, Apple started out of a garage, didn't it?

249
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,900
You know, that's the famous one.

250
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,620
I thought they all did.

251
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,420
Yeah, I think that's the rumor.

252
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,060
They all do.

253
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,900
Hey, you know what?

254
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,580
Technically JB did, so.

255
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,460
All right, don't we all need garages?

256
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,500
Yeah, we do.

257
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,620
All right, so that's probably

258
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,420
the most upsetting news of the week.

259
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,420
So let's talk about something

260
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,620
that I'm excited about for the future.

261
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,140
And I made this a prediction on this show,

262
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,380
so I'm very thrilled that this is happening, obviously.

263
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,500
That's my bias up front.

264
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,900
But dark mode, all the things.

265
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,020
Not by force, but give the user option.

266
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,180
And I thought Cassidy nailed it in a post

267
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,460
that they posted on their Medium blog

268
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,940
about OS-wide dark styles.

269
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,780
And this is actually a,

270
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,460
this is a pretty complicated topic.

271
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,100
I was reading through your post, Cassidy,

272
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,180
and I was reading the part you touch on

273
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,380
and hear about research, and you say,

274
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,340
"'In my time contributing to elementary and GNOME,

275
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:31,180
I've become familiar with pleas from users

276
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,300
to implement official support for arbitrary themes.

277
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,660
While that itself is a large, controversial topic,

278
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,740
I've been working over the past few years

279
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,180
to better understand the why behind these requests.

280
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,220
In addition to listening to folks across the elementary,

281
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,740
pop OS, and GNOME issue trackers,

282
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,500
as well as social media, in-person hackfests,

283
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,700
meetups, and conferences,

284
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,820
I also decided to conduct a study

285
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,340
to see if I could identify patterns in the data

286
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,100
over 1,500 users of various OSes,

287
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,140
environments like Android, GNOME, Ubuntu, Mac OS,

288
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:08,060
and dozens more were participating in the survey,

289
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,980
which gave me a decent look into this group of users.

290
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,620
In summary, I found an overwhelming majority,

291
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,060
88% of respondents,

292
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:19,180
said they sometimes or always use a dark style

293
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,660
when given the choice,

294
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,220
and 81% of that group are using dark modes

295
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,420
to address factors outside their device,

296
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,540
like getting headaches, combining that with eye strain,

297
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,860
or just working in a dark office."

298
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,940
This research you did here seems fairly extensive, Cassidy.

299
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,620
Thanks, yeah.

300
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,180
Maybe a little obsessive about it,

301
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,460
but it's really important to get it right, I think.

302
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,660
It's really easy to say,

303
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,820
you know, of course you can use a dark theme today.

304
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,340
You just switch out your GTK theme,

305
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,220
and, you know, if apps are broken, they're broken.

306
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,900
Yeah, why doesn't a dark theme solve this?

307
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,380
Because, you know what, Cassidy,

308
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,460
I can install ArcDark,

309
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,820
and I can go tick a box in GNOME tweaks,

310
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,620
and I'm off to the races.

311
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,780
Yeah, and especially on platforms like elementary OS,

312
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,980
where we have developers

313
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,660
doing much more interesting custom styles,

314
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,500
that doesn't really work.

315
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,580
First of all, those developers

316
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,180
are targeting a specific style sheet,

317
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,460
like the elementary style sheet,

318
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,500
or in the case of GNOME apps, more commonly now,

319
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,220
they're targeting Adwaita for their custom styling.

320
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,860
And so when you, basically,

321
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,940
you're ripping the style sheet out from under that app

322
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,020
and replacing it with something that's inverted,

323
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,380
unless they've tested against that specific style sheet,

324
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,380
it's not gonna go well.

325
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,260
Yeah, the app doesn't know that you've just done that.

326
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:33,100
It's unaware that it's now on a dark canvas, right?

327
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,300
Exactly, and there's, of course,

328
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,420
there's APIs you can manually look at,

329
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,620
well, what is the background color?

330
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,820
What is the foreground color?

331
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,660
Does the theme end in dash dark?

332
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,820
Which is, all of those hacks exist in apps in GNOME today,

333
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,060
but they're hacks, they're not really a,

334
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,020
they don't really solve this issue in an elegant way,

335
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,700
and they also don't solve it for other toolkits

336
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,620
or big popular apps like Chrome and Firefox,

337
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,900
which today don't support dark mode on Linux,

338
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,500
but they do on Mac OS and on Windows now.

339
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,740
It seems like we also have a more comprehensive problem

340
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:10,100
we're just on the verge of, Android Q, Android 10,

341
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,940
big parts of their feature focus there

342
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,300
is their new dark mode, which also interestingly enough,

343
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,780
if you turn on battery saver now in Android Q,

344
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,540
it automatically turns on dark mode,

345
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,700
so there does seem to be maybe some power saving benefits,

346
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,500
especially if you have an OLED screen.

347
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,260
But like I say, it's more comprehensive than that.

348
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,780
So it's the applications, it's the system dialogues,

349
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,980
but in the future, it also could be the web browser

350
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,180
and the web page.

351
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,860
The website could be, I'm not sure

352
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,020
what the right terminology to use here,

353
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,420
because this hasn't really happened yet,

354
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,860
but the web browser and the website could communicate

355
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,700
to know if they're both using a dark theme

356
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,380
and display the dark theme by default

357
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,180
if your desktop is in dark mode.

358
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,620
Like it seems like it's a full stack issue

359
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,540
from the OS dialogues all the way up to the applications

360
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,820
and what the applications themselves are rendering.

361
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,340
So it has to be a solution

362
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,060
that is bigger than elementary OS, I think.

363
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,980
Do you agree?

364
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,580
Exactly, and that's why I published this post

365
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,660
and ended this study,

366
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,220
not just from the elementary perspective,

367
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,620
but from the known perspective and the cross desktop,

368
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,780
the free desktop perspective.

369
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,580
We had been working, I'd been working,

370
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,860
I guess I said in the post, you know,

371
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,220
kind of secretly for months on this, on a prototype

372
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,700
for supporting a dark mode in elementary OS.

373
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,620
But what I kept running into is it really doesn't work

374
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,780
unless it's a cross desktop effort.

375
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,260
You know, you can hack it on,

376
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,500
you can bolt it on on a GTK desktop like elementary OS,

377
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,500
but as soon as you open Firefox

378
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,060
and your web pages are all white, it really sucks.

379
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,740
Yeah, it's a blast of white in the face.

380
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:38,540
Yeah, and it's actually implemented today

381
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,860
on Mac OS now in Safari.

382
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,900
Their dark mode actually propagates out to the websites

383
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,540
and on Chrome, I believe Chrome Canary,

384
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,740
maybe Chrome Daily on Android, on Android Q,

385
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,580
you can enable it.

386
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,620
So you have, it follows your system-wide dark mode.

387
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,660
So it's sooner than later then.

388
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,780
Yeah, and as of Firefox 67,

389
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,300
it's also supported on Mac OS and Windows,

390
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,180
and there's a buried setting you can go change on Linux

391
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,700
to force it as well.

392
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,340
So it's happening across the entire industry.

393
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,100
It's not even just Linux, it's the entire industry

394
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:12,020
that's really shifting to say, you know what?

395
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,340
Dark style preference is really an accessibility feature.

396
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,220
It's something that users expect

397
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,340
and it's something that they're catering to.

398
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,860
Yeah, it just means I really nailed that prediction.

399
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,140
It's so great.

400
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,500
So moving from beyond that, it also seems like

401
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,460
if it's say a free desktop.org standard type thing,

402
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,740
then there is still a room for a distribution like yourself

403
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,100
that's building a whole platform

404
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,460
to still provide a lot of value

405
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,980
that's outside the standard potentially,

406
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,140
like really good documentation for developers

407
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,900
on how to use your whole toolkit in dark mode.

408
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,700
Those kinds of areas,

409
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,460
integration with your own applications,

410
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,580
with the app center, there's areas that

411
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,180
once there's a standard, you could kind of build

412
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,020
on top of it.

413
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,980
Exactly, so cross platform across toolkit,

414
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,940
there's just the baseline of, hey, this app

415
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,420
or this user has requested the app to use a dark style.

416
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,940
And that's just, that's it, that's where that ends.

417
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,460
But then on the distribution side,

418
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,780
there's things like making sure

419
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,220
that all of the included apps support this dark style,

420
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,540
that third-party developers are heavily encouraged

421
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,220
to support it, that you give them hints

422
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,100
on how color works differently in a dark style.

423
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,860
Maybe they use slightly desaturated colors

424
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,540
because it's less harsh against a darker background.

425
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,380
All of those types of issues are things

426
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,460
where we can step in as a distribution

427
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,660
and really make the experience really great.

428
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,100
Yeah, I could totally see that.

429
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,580
And I could see where you and Island Montreal OS

430
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,980
in particular would really exceed at that area.

431
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,020
So it seems like I've seen the prototype screenshots

432
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,260
which we'll have linked in the show notes

433
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,180
and it looks really good.

434
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:47,140
Now it's sort of like convince everybody else, right?

435
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,460
It looks like you're planning to go to Guadec

436
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,660
and try to get people talking about this.

437
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,940
Yeah, so I have a session at Guadec,

438
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,860
the free desktop dark style preference,

439
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,180
birds of a feather session, which is a mouthful.

440
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,140
Yeah.

441
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,780
But we're hoping to get people both within Gnome proper

442
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,780
and also just interested app developers

443
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,740
and free desktop people together in a room

444
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,060
to kind of hammer out the actual technical side of it.

445
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,820
I have basically an example specification

446
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,060
that could be adopted,

447
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,820
but it's not necessarily a cross desktop specification.

448
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,820
So I've also been reaching out to people from KDE

449
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,540
and XFCE and other desktops to see,

450
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,060
hey, if we were to do this cross desktop,

451
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,940
how would be, what would be a way

452
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,940
that we're all comfortable with?

453
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,460
And also keeping in mind technologies like Flatpak

454
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,900
where the way an app interacts with their system

455
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,740
is slightly different.

456
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,340
You can't just read and write to system settings

457
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,340
the same way you can with native non-containerized apps.

458
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,980
So there's a whole lot of pieces that have to come together,

459
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,060
but I really was, I'm really trying to show people,

460
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,260
hey, this is a thing we need to do.

461
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,660
It's an accessibility issue.

462
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,620
It's also something that users are gonna expect

463
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,660
more and more as other platforms are all adopting it.

464
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,700
Absolutely.

465
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,420
I'm really glad that you're reaching out too

466
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,900
to the other projects, because, you know,

467
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,380
obviously you're very GTK focused,

468
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,140
but the project has done a really good job in my opinion

469
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,420
of visiting the different camps

470
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,020
and sort of staying friendly with the entire community

471
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,460
and not really tribling down.

472
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,340
And so, you know, like your recent decision with Flatpak,

473
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,940
I know for a fact that people from elementary

474
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,700
attended a lot of canonical events

475
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,460
to get all the information to participate

476
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,100
in both sides of the discussion fully.

477
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,940
Like I witnessed that firsthand.

478
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,100
And I think you guys did that really well.

479
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,980
You have a great reputation for design.

480
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,380
So it seems like too, you're a project

481
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,380
that's already respected in this design area.

482
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,220
So you're positioned really well

483
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,620
from a design standpoint too,

484
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,540
like people respect your opinions on this stuff.

485
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,500
So I really think you got a shot here, Cassidy.

486
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,980
Yeah, I hope, I mean, we're always a fan of a co-operatition,

487
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,220
I guess is what we call it, where, you know,

488
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,260
we think we have the best desktop obviously,

489
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,700
cause we made it and we wouldn't be making it

490
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,740
if we didn't think it was the best.

491
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,700
But we're gonna work with everyone else

492
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,780
to help them, you know, realize their visions too.

493
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,100
And if there's shared effort,

494
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,700
it's gonna make everyone better.

495
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,060
Well, Cassidy, keep us posted on how it goes.

496
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,740
And if you wanna check out the post, go do so.

497
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,220
And is there a way for elementary OS users right now

498
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,740
to try out any of this?

499
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,420
Not super easily slash officially,

500
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,820
but if you do go to github.com slash elementary,

501
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,660
there's a projects tab there.

502
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,540
And one of those projects is called Dark Style Preference.

503
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,620
And you can kind of track the work there.

504
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,300
There's a bunch of in-progress branches

505
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
that might support this feature.

506
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,500
So if you get your hands dirty and start compiling stuff,

507
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,740
you can kind of see what's going on.

508
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,340
What do you think of this kind of thing, Cheese?

509
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,180
Because I know as a professional design application user,

510
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,220
your day-to-day applications,

511
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,540
almost all of them for years now have been dark themed.

512
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,340
Plus you just have the overall design differences

513
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,740
between designing for a web that's dark versus light,

514
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,780
applications, curious to get your perspectives on this.

515
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,900
Yeah, I mean, I think dark theming everything

516
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,460
is definitely happening.

517
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,140
It's gonna happen a lot sooner rather than later.

518
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,940
But I would say too that there is something to be said

519
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,700
about dark text on a white background too.

520
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,420
I mean, there is a reason that books are printed

521
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,620
the way they are.

522
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,780
But I really like what Cassidy's done here,

523
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,300
the research that he's done,

524
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,540
and providing this back to the community.

525
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,620
And I think it's something that is really something

526
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,540
that needs to be focused on going forward in future distros,

527
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,500
is that UI and UX done top-notch.

528
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,660
And that's to me is what elementary has seemed to have done

529
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,700
over the years.

530
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,940
And for them to iterate on that and put a dark theme,

531
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,660
I mean, I think it's just, it's gonna be great.

532
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,860
My body is ready.

533
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,260
Yeah, I'm ready to have it.

534
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,740
Cassidy, I would say I've been waiting for this for years,

535
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,020
doing all the photography stuff that I do.

536
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,740
The worst thing I experience

537
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,460
is doing a whole bunch of photography,

538
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:12,060
getting in the zone and then opening a webpage

539
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,740
or a spreadsheet and just bam.

540
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,860
But what I realized is that it changes my,

541
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,900
the ways my eyes adjust to the colors

542
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,780
and things on the monitor.

543
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:25,140
And so it takes me a little while for that to come back.

544
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,540
And it's sort of frustrating.

545
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,700
My mom says the same thing.

546
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,420
My mom is a professional graphic artist.

547
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:33,660
And one of the reasons she's very, very particular

548
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,180
about having her background one solid color

549
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,100
is because it does that same thing to her eyes.

550
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,540
It messes with her perception of it.

551
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,380
Yeah, absolutely.

552
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,860
But when an application comes and hits you in the face,

553
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,260
you don't really have a choice, do you?

554
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,540
Yeah, so hopefully we can get applications on board

555
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,660
and get desktop environments on board and fix that problem.

556
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,180
I just want it because I'm sitting in dark rooms

557
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,020
all the time.

558
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:53,860
Yeah, right.

559
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,820
Well, I think you're gonna see that 88% support

560
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,980
just be out there through everybody.

561
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,260
Well, that's pretty neat.

562
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,620
I'm looking forward to see where that goes.

563
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,740
I love the ideas as it's, you know,

564
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,820
here's a working example,

565
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,980
but also let's make this a free desktop standard.

566
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,140
It's cross toolkit.

567
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,540
I think it's brilliant.

568
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,180
And a link to information in the show notes.

569
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,060
I wanna move forward now to WireGuard.

570
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,700
Love it, love it, love it.

571
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,100
It's really great.

572
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,420
WireGuard is a beautiful novel VPN technology

573
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,740
that we've been talking about and texting up

574
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,580
for a little bit now.

575
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,620
We've covered a little bit in this show,

576
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,860
but it's great because it's a VPN as fast as it takes

577
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,860
to bring up a network interface on your box.

578
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,780
However, it does require you do some command line fiddling

579
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,940
and nothing too bad, you know.

580
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,620
If your old humble podcaster here can do it,

581
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,780
you can probably do it if you follow some directions,

582
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,860
but you won't need to very soon.

583
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,860
Native WireGuard support is coming in Network Manager 1.16.

584
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,660
It has landed and it is beautiful.

585
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,020
So Network Manager just provides a defacto standard API

586
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,500
for configuring networking on the host.

587
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,300
The other thing that's really nice about this

588
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,180
is you get a lot of other features besides

589
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,940
just a basic WireGuard tunnel setup.

590
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,780
You get some DNS configuration and firewall D,

591
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,500
which is set up in a consistent manner.

592
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,980
So your traffic's getting routed properly.

593
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,940
Your name resolution is getting routed properly

594
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,580
and it's all done from the nice, comfortable GUI

595
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,740
of Network Manager.

596
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,140
This to me feels like such a gift.

597
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,140
I've been interested in WireGuard for a long time,

598
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,940
which I think probably everybody should be.

599
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,660
But I, unlike the Wes, I don't have the technical skills

600
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,500
necessarily to feel really cozy about it.

601
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,340
I've read it over and over and over

602
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,540
and I've wanted to implement this,

603
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,300
but just haven't quite felt comfy about it.

604
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,260
And I'm really hoping this makes the difference.

605
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,660
I was hoping I could point you at the last episode

606
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,380
of TechSnap because Jim and Wes did a fantastic job

607
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,820
breaking down some of the stigma around WireGuard.

608
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,500
So maybe Brent, have a listen to that

609
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,620
and maybe you'll feel like you don't need to be quite

610
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,180
so much of a command line ninja to pull it off.

611
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,820
Yeah, I've been getting a lot of good feedback

612
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,260
about that last episode of TechSnap.

613
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,740
If you haven't checked out TechSnap recently,

614
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,220
that might be a good one to go catch

615
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,300
because I've gotten several comments

616
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,260
saying it was a pretty good one.

617
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,380
Do you agree, Alex?

618
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,900
Yep, I do.

619
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,180
Jim in particular just has this great way

620
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,780
of breaking down, he's like the new version of Alan.

621
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,020
He breaks down a complex topic and distills it

622
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,980
to the points you actually need to understand

623
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,020
and then communicates it in a simple way.

624
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,220
Yeah, it was great meeting Jim at LinuxFest Northwest.

625
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,660
Okay, so we've been talking a little bit

626
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:32,020
about Project Stadia and I think the big takeaway

627
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,620
from all of the Linux media coverage was,

628
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,780
well, it could be good for Linux.

629
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,500
It could be good for Linux because it's gonna be

630
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,340
using Falcon and the servers are gonna be running Linux,

631
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,780
right, that's been the coverage and it was a gamble.

632
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,140
We weren't sure if that was the case.

633
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,500
Well, this week, we've gotten some evidence

634
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,700
that it is very much the case.

635
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:57,580
Now again, anecdotal, but this seems like strong evidence

636
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,380
that Stadia, which is Google's game streaming platform

637
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,100
that runs Linux, will benefit desktop Linux gaming

638
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,180
and here's perhaps why.

639
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,260
At GDC 2019, in one of the developer sessions,

640
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,420
up on stage was a developer from id Software

641
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,460
who was responsible for porting Doom,

642
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,060
because why not, you know, it's the acid test, right?

643
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:24,940
Porting Doom over to Stadia and he talks about

644
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,020
the base setup they did to get ready to do the porting

645
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,540
and I think some of this setup might sound familiar.

646
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,460
As I mentioned before, we had gotten Doom 2016

647
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,580
running on vanilla Ubuntu.

648
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,580
We actually used this as a stepping stone

649
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,260
to get onto Stadia itself and it's an easy approach

650
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,380
for you to take to start experimenting

651
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,620
with the various technologies involved.

652
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,580
We always recommend that you simply engage

653
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,020
with Google directly, but this is an easy way

654
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,060
to evaluate technologies if that is preferred.

655
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,820
What we did is we developed our own spec

656
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,060
in which we took, for the software side of things,

657
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,340
we took a vanilla Ubuntu 1804 image

658
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,420
with Clang 6 as the compile tool chain.

659
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,780
You'll want to develop against Vulkan, Pulse Audio,

660
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,620
and then for the hardware you can use,

661
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,740
sorry, for the hardware you can build a box

662
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,500
comprising an Intel processor with eight threads,

663
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,940
an AMD Vega 10 GPU with eight gigs of VRAM,

664
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,060
eight to 16 gigs of system memory,

665
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,180
and an SSD-like storage device.

666
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,620
Not too surprising because there's been

667
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,740
a lot of speculation, but that detail there

668
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,460
that the GPU they're targeting is the AMD Vega

669
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,940
is also very exciting because it's just likely

670
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,460
to just battle test the hell out of that software stack,

671
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,380
and that has a lot of good ramifications

672
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,180
for desktop Linux too.

673
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,980
That seems like a good indication

674
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,220
that at least for some folks, they're demoing or testing,

675
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,140
they're gonna use Linux to try it out,

676
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,500
and if that means they have to get their build on Linux,

677
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,460
it's not gonna be that big of a leap

678
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,300
to go from that to fixing it up and shipping it.

679
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,260
It is a leap, I grant that.

680
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,340
They're not moving mountains to make that happen.

681
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:05,500
Like they've already ported it and got it working on Stadia,

682
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,220
and they must have it at least somewhat reliable on Linux.

683
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,100
So to just then go, well, now let's package it up

684
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,300
and sell it on Steam, that doesn't seem crazy.

685
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,660
That seems reasonable.

686
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,780
So I think this could actually,

687
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,460
I think the Stadia crap, if it's successful,

688
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,500
I'm sorry, I think the Stadia project, if it's successful,

689
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,300
could be really good for desktop Linux.

690
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,700
Not that that's all I care about.

691
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,140
I don't know, anybody wanna push back

692
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,020
and tell me I'm being crazy there?

693
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,500
But I think that's a good sign, right?

694
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,140
We can't trust Google for this thing

695
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,500
to stick around, though, can we?

696
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,020
I know, I know, but even if it sticks around

697
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,460
for three years, you're gonna have, what,

698
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,660
a dozen different game makers try to get their games

699
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,660
to work on Linux?

700
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,500
Well, that's true.

701
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,820
And Vulkan, too, and the AMD Vega graphics stack.

702
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,060
And maybe that's what's needed

703
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,380
to just break that barrier of entry

704
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,820
or the thought that there's this uphill climb to take on.

705
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,980
This seems really crazy.

706
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,620
I'm just trying to picture explaining the story

707
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,380
to a 10-year version of me, like 10 years ago,

708
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,300
trying to explain the story,

709
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,260
and his mind would just be like, what, no,

710
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,220
this isn't possible.

711
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,820
I thought you were gonna say 10 years in the future

712
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,940
when everything's running on Linux.

713
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,420
Oh, yeah, of course, of course.

714
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,620
It's the air of the Linux desktop, Brent.

715
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,380
Oh, I'm feeling it every year, every year.

716
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,100
The bell's getting some use today, guys.

717
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,020
It's been a while.

718
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,300
I definitely think that there's an issue.

719
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,220
There's a deal there, too, with the reliability,

720
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:24,500
like Alex said, of Stadia being around

721
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,860
in another seven years, and then you've got gamers

722
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,300
that invested multiple hours into a game,

723
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,460
and Google kills its service.

724
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,460
That's gonna upset a lot of people.

725
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,940
That's no different to a PlayStation game now, though.

726
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,060
I have progress on GTA 5 on the PlayStation

727
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,020
that I've literally had to bring across the ocean with me

728
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,580
so I wouldn't lose it.

729
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,900
It's the same vendor lock-in.

730
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,740
True.

731
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,980
The thing that I think is really going to be good about it

732
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,740
is it's going to get more people using Vulkan.

733
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,020
Even if Google goes away once people start targeting Vulkan

734
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,780
and say, well, this isn't too much different

735
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:03,940
from, say, DirectX and its cross-platform,

736
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,260
maybe we'll see much more adoption of Vulkan,

737
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,940
not just if this project leaves, but forever more.

738
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,140
Well, that's my point, Drew, is if they get two,

739
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,180
three years down the road with this thing,

740
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,260
then dev shops will set up a tool chain

741
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,500
and a software workflow based around this technology stack,

742
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,660
and they're gonna be all in.

743
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,220
They're not gonna, like if Stadia goes away,

744
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,620
they're not gonna be like, well, throw away

745
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,780
all these computers.

746
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,700
Best case scenario is the next Xbox or PlayStation

747
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,220
is based around Vulkan because of this.

748
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:37,220
I wouldn't be too surprised if the next console

749
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,660
uses streaming in a heavy way.

750
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,620
Maybe like all backwards compatibility

751
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,740
is via streaming or something like that.

752
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,580
I could definitely see that.

753
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,260
You could see them just virtualizing those things

754
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,180
and then streaming it.

755
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,020
I feel like Sony has already talked about that

756
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,700
with the PlayStation 5.

757
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,700
I'm not 100% on that, but I do feel like I read that

758
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,540
somewhere.

759
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,740
Okay, that wouldn't surprise me.

760
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:01,300
All right, well, some important things

761
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,140
in housekeeping this week.

762
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:05,260
So we're rolling out a Joe Rez original

763
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,100
for the background music.

764
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,500
You like this?

765
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,340
I'm grooving already.

766
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,860
I'm dancing in this west chair here.

767
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:11,060
Yeah, I know, right?

768
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,580
You can tell it's kind of a Joe original, too.

769
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,420
It's great.

770
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,260
I love it.

771
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:17,300
So I have tried to put together,

772
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,300
although I have failed miserably.

773
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,140
I'll see if I can put one in the show notes.

774
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,500
I've been doing PC part picker.

775
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
You ever done this before?

776
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,580
I don't know what this is.

777
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,820
Really?

778
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,840
Oh, it's really kind of cool.

779
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,680
You should check it out.

780
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,700
So you go through here and people will spec out

781
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,900
different PC builds and they'll save them.

782
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,300
And so I went in and I built a Ryzen AMD build

783
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,140
for my son Dylan.

784
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,100
I'm thinking after school, after school gets out,

785
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,220
in the summer we do a little build project

786
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,780
and do an AMD system top to bottom to replace his laptop.

787
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,180
That's an amazing learning opportunity for him, I think.

788
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,940
Yeah, last week I was asking about laptops,

789
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,860
but then I thought about it more.

790
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,540
It's like a desktop is really what he needs.

791
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,600
And so I was wondering if the audience had any suggestions,

792
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,440
if they wanted to send me some PC part picker links

793
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,500
at Chris LAS or hit me up on Telegram at Chris LAS.

794
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,380
And there's the Jupyter broadcasting Telegram link

795
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,300
at the top of the JB website.

796
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:12,100
I got a couple different builds I've done.

797
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,180
It's like around 800 bucks,

798
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,940
so it's not like the cheapest machine.

799
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,180
I'll try to get a link to it in the show notes

800
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,220
so people can review it and tell me what I've done wrong.

801
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,420
Cause I think like the one thing is like,

802
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,860
I'm not sure about the storage or the RAM.

803
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,580
That's tricky, but it's all AMD top to bottom

804
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,100
and it looks like it'd be Linux compatible.

805
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,420
And it's just going to be a gaming rig for him, right?

806
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,440
Yeah, I mean, it's his desktop,

807
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,580
so he'll do schoolwork too, but mostly it's for gaming.

808
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,300
Right, so, and you've got the 2600, 2600X?

809
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,120
Oh yeah, you can see it.

810
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,020
Can you see it there in the link

811
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,540
that I put in the show notes?

812
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,600
I don't think that it's in the link,

813
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,700
but there are some stats, some specs that you put in there.

814
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,600
That's a pretty good setup.

815
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,020
I would bump the RAM to 16.

816
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,300
I did, so I, well actually I bumped it to 32

817
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,180
and I put a Radeon RX 580 in there.

818
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:56,220
And then I put a 930 gig Samsung

819
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:58,620
and then I put a one terabyte spinning rust

820
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,300
for like large, long-term game storage and stuff.

821
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,140
That much storage, why wouldn't you just wait

822
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,460
till it got cheaper in a year or two

823
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,300
and then upgrade it?

824
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,140
Maybe, yeah.

825
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,100
You can get a one terabyte SSD for about 90 to $100 now.

826
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,840
And I know a spinning rust is half that price,

827
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,860
but an SSD versus a spinning rust

828
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:19,700
is a heck of a difference to usability, isn't it?

829
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,060
Yeah, oh yeah.

830
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:23,340
Well, I had an SSD in there for his OS drive.

831
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,180
You're right, OneDrive.

832
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,180
Anyways, I'd like to get people's part lists,

833
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,260
get their own suggestions,

834
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,140
and then I'm gonna, I'll follow up on the show

835
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:29,980
and I'll build it.

836
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,260
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

837
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,140
Be Dylan's first home-built Linux rig?

838
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:33,980
No.

839
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,800
No.

840
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,640
For what it's worth.

841
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,480
Yeah, he doesn't know yet.

842
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,300
This is almost exactly my computer,

843
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,080
except I've got 16 gigs.

844
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,500
And I've got three SSDs in there

845
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
instead of one big one.

846
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,620
How's the GNU slash Linux compatibility?

847
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,460
Perfect.

848
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,180
Perfect, those are bold words, Drew.

849
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,020
Perfect.

850
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,180
Those are, cause I'm looking for zero IT overhead here.

851
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,740
I'm gonna put elementary OS on it,

852
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,260
and then I'm just gonna let them run it for years again.

853
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,800
Well, so the thing about an AMD GPU these days

854
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,180
is it's built into the kernel.

855
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:06,260
So there's nothing proprietary to install,

856
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,300
so it just works.

857
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,260
It's fabulous.

858
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,140
That's what I was thinking.

859
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,980
And it does.

860
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,200
It just works.

861
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,580
Mm-hmm.

862
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,980
All right, well, I'll follow up.

863
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,940
And I'll let you know what the audience suggests too.

864
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,860
I'd like a range.

865
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,460
I'd say that the max is 1500.

866
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,300
So, and that'd be really high end,

867
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,020
but I'd like to see a range of devices people recommend.

868
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,820
And Linux compatibility is top.

869
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,660
And then gaming.

870
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:30,360
And you know, Samsung, for their SSDs,

871
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,340
they even have a utility to upgrade the firmware

872
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,960
in Linux from the CLI.

873
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,260
All right, so that's my personal thing in housekeeping.

874
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,660
Moving on, we were just talking

875
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,340
about free desktop standards.

876
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,420
The guys are gonna have a much deeper conversation

877
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,100
in user error.show.

878
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,940
Even, you know what,

879
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,740
just not even for the free desktop standard stuff.

880
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,720
Just go there.

881
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,240
It is such a good show.

882
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,540
It is such a good show.

883
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:55,820
It's hosted by Joe Rezington, Alan Pope, and Daniel Foray.

884
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,660
And I love it.

885
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,860
It's my, like, as soon as it's out,

886
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,460
I listen to it immediately.

887
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,340
Episode 66 comes out this Friday.

888
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,100
Then the show that is one train wreck after another,

889
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,400
it's the Friday stream.

890
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,220
This is a way for you to come say hi,

891
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,220
hang out with us, and meet us.

892
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,900
We wanna do more things with our community.

893
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,860
We wanted an opportunity to stream and do live chats,

894
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,940
have people join us.

895
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,780
Brent, you've been joining every episode?

896
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,860
I think so far? Ever since the start,

897
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,220
even from various pubs near you.

898
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,060
Yep, yep.

899
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,880
Yeah, that's right.

900
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,720
That's right.

901
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,560
That's when we got the,

902
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,140
was that when we heard the squirrel story?

903
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,980
That was Andrew's.

904
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,020
No, squirrel was what?

905
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,960
Was that last week? Okay, okay.

906
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,040
If you listen to the Friday stream,

907
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,580
you know why Brent's here right now already.

908
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,420
That's what it is.

909
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,320
It's like there's a lot going on.

910
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,660
We have a big crew.

911
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,340
And it's a chance to hear from people

912
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,020
that are often in this show in a different context.

913
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,940
If that interests you at all,

914
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,860
come check out the Friday stream, fridaystream.com.

915
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,200
What I love too is a giant mash of ideas

916
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,800
that otherwise on certain other shows

917
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,700
don't have the space for, which is really great.

918
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,060
Yeah, you know, you've seen behind the curtain

919
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,340
of some of the stuff we're playing with.

920
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,580
We've got some ideas.

921
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,820
Just around the corner,

922
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,880
Texas Linux Fest, May 31st to June 1st.

923
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,440
Cheesy Alex and I will be at Texas Linux Fest

924
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,740
along with Elle.

925
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,420
Come say hi to us.

926
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,660
We have a meetup too down there, like a dinner.

927
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,100
Yep, come get some barbecue.

928
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,620
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

929
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,060
as well as information about

930
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,420
our next Kubernetes study group over there.

931
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,220
And I'm gonna just say this.

932
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,620
I don't know if, don't tell them I told you this, okay?

933
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,100
If you become a Community Edition member

934
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,380
over at Linux Academy,

935
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,500
there may be an opportunity to upgrade that account

936
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,340
at a really good deal.

937
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,340
I'm gonna put that out there.

938
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,180
It's kind of a secret.

939
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,000
I don't wanna say anything.

940
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,540
And they've recently added the Community Edition

941
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,440
to the Linux Academy mobile app.

942
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,580
So you can grab the mobile app

943
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,860
and get access to the free community content.

944
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,880
Now that's the content that Elle and I curate

945
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,220
every single month.

946
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,580
And there's a lot of really good stuff

947
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,580
that she and I have been putting in there.

948
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,500
She's got a good head for what should go in there, really.

949
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,540
So it's more like I say, good idea Elle.

950
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,940
That's really my involvement.

951
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,260
Um,

952
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,740
but she's good at it.

953
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,620
And that's available now for free.

954
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,460
And the app's free.

955
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,660
You can get into the Community Edition for free.

956
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,220
And then if you decide to get,

957
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,340
you know, upgrade to like all of the stuff,

958
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,180
there might be a promo in there.

959
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,100
I can't say.

960
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:03,940
This is so great.

961
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,340
I would totally grab this.

962
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,380
Like for example, when I took the train down here.

963
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,220
Yes.

964
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,060
You can do it on your mobile

965
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,900
instead of having to take out something like the laptop.

966
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,700
You can also cache the videos offline and stuff.

967
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,540
So.

968
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,360
Now you're talking.

969
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,200
Yeah, if you want.

970
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,700
For us out of country travelers.

971
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,580
It's nice, isn't it?

972
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,420
It is.

973
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,240
Go check it out.

974
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,180
We'll have links in the show notes.

975
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,780
And that my friends is the housekeeping.

976
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,180
So Silverblue is an interesting beast.

977
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,260
And it promises, I would say,

978
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,140
what seemed like an impossible stable workstation, Drew.

979
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,700
And so that's why we've been talking about it

980
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,600
behind the scenes.

981
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,340
Seems like it could have, you know,

982
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,700
long-term great use in the studio.

983
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,100
There could be all kinds of production purposes

984
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,720
for an OS like Silverblue.

985
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,900
Is there like a newbie way you could explain

986
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,800
what the draw is to Silverblue above regular Fedora?

987
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,640
Okay.

988
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,320
So Silverblue is following on the heels of Project Atomic.

989
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:04,060
And I love the idea of immutable file systems

990
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:08,540
where basically your root is mounted read-only.

991
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,280
So anytime that you go to do an upgrade,

992
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,160
it builds a whole image and then you reboot into that image.

993
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,380
That's kind of the high level view of

994
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,180
this is what Silverblue is doing

995
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,520
and this is how it remains stable.

996
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,500
And the advantage to that would be something goes haywire,

997
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,860
you could boot back into the previous image

998
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,600
and you're exactly right back where you left off.

999
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,500
Correct.

1000
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,440
So if an upgrade goes horribly wrong,

1001
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,220
you just reboot and in your boot menu,

1002
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,140
just drop back to the last version,

1003
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,180
boot up, you're right where you were

1004
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,640
before you did that upgrade.

1005
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,620
No need to go in and do an LVM snapshot rollback

1006
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,740
or anything like that.

1007
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,580
You're just, you're right there with minimal downtime

1008
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,140
trying to fix the issue.

1009
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,660
I have a layman's question about this.

1010
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,900
If you're updating just like, let's say one piece of salt,

1011
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,900
you get a new, I don't know,

1012
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,260
a new version of Audacity coming in and you update,

1013
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,020
does that mean you have to do a reboot every time

1014
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,540
or how does that work out?

1015
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,860
Depends on how you installed it.

1016
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,540
So the whole thing is it's trying to push people

1017
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,860
into using flat packs more for their standard applications

1018
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,580
rather than installing directly into the OS.

1019
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,020
If you have Audacity installed as a flat pack,

1020
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,260
which yes, there is a flat pack for it,

1021
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,460
then no, it just upgrades automatically in the background,

1022
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,060
no need to reboot or anything.

1023
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,960
However, if you're using RPM OS tree to slip that

1024
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,540
into the image, then yes, you would need to reboot

1025
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,740
for every application update.

1026
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:41,980
Is the idea a clear wall between your base operating system

1027
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,060
and your applications?

1028
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,340
In fact, so much so, I think by default,

1029
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,500
doesn't Silverblue even lack DNF?

1030
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:52,500
It does lack DNF and you're not going to put it on

1031
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,560
the base image.

1032
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,400
Oh, really? No.

1033
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,240
Really, okay.

1034
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,340
If you want to use DNF to say search for package

1035
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:03,460
because RPM dash OS tree does not have a search feature

1036
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,420
that I found yet.

1037
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,580
Womp, womp.

1038
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,640
What you do is you use this thing called toolbox

1039
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,740
and toolbox is really, really cool.

1040
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,660
What you do is you use the toolbox command

1041
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,100
to create an OCI container,

1042
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,900
which then has a full Fedora 30 base image.

1043
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,780
It's a minimal image, but it's a base image

1044
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,780
as an OCI container that you then enter into that toolbox

1045
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,300
and you can do things like install DNF,

1046
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:35,580
install applications, including graphical applications,

1047
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:39,860
and it does have by default access to your home directory,

1048
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,020
which is great.

1049
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,300
So you can do something like install Audacity in a toolbox,

1050
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,060
launch it there, and then you can do your DNF upgrades

1051
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:53,340
in that OCI container and have your stable base

1052
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,420
stay the same.

1053
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,660
In theory, could you also install your own versions of,

1054
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,280
you can install FFmpeg and other things

1055
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,540
in that same toolbox and Audacity could see it?

1056
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,360
Like VST plugins, could you stash those in there?

1057
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,580
Yes.

1058
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,900
Now, that's kind of where it fell down for me though,

1059
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,420
is I thought, okay, well, what if I make an audio container?

1060
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,060
It has all of my audio stuff.

1061
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,660
It has my VSTs. Right, right, sure.

1062
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:19,220
It has LinVST to let me use my Windows only VSTs.

1063
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:20,460
It's got wine in there.

1064
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,900
It's ready to go.

1065
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,500
I got everything set up.

1066
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,140
I got Reaper installed.

1067
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,540
It launched.

1068
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:31,100
I had the graphical interface and no connection

1069
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,940
to the audio system.

1070
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,940
You can't see any of the sound devices.

1071
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,380
Right, sad trombone there.

1072
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,260
So that didn't last long.

1073
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,500
And this was after I put it on bare metal

1074
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,920
because I wanted to play with it.

1075
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,500
I wanted to see how well it worked on bare metal.

1076
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:55,700
And it works great except for those little fringe cases.

1077
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,420
Now, it's clearly meant for developers, right,

1078
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:04,300
for people who want to, say, launch this OCI container

1079
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,460
with Python version whatever and program against that

1080
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,940
because they know that that's what they have on their server

1081
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,540
and they want to do their testing

1082
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,340
in this particular container.

1083
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,380
And then they want to see what happens when they upgrade it.

1084
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:22,660
That's the sort of use case that they're really targeting.

1085
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,860
General workstation use cases, it can be done.

1086
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:32,020
But you've got to really be aware of what you're doing,

1087
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,900
the fact that you're adding complexity to your upgrade

1088
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,660
mechanisms because, say, you need to upgrade something

1089
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,780
in an OCI container.

1090
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,580
Well, you'll have to go into that container,

1091
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:45,500
do the DNF upgrade from the command line, all of that.

1092
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,500
So there's a lot more complexity that you're adding on top.

1093
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,180
Per toolbox, you have to do that per container slash toolbox.

1094
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,020
OK, so that could get to be a little much after a while.

1095
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,860
It can.

1096
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,300
But that's the trade-off for having

1097
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,620
such a super stable base.

1098
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,740
Now, you can go the other direction

1099
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,380
and just do things in rpm-ostree and add them to the base image.

1100
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,700
The problem you might face, which the developers are really

1101
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:16,220
upfront about this, is if you add too much on top in their hybrid

1102
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:19,340
application layer, you could end up

1103
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:22,780
with a system that does not properly upgrade when

1104
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,180
it comes time for Fedora 31.

1105
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,700
And you don't really know until you've crossed a threshold.

1106
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,200
Right.

1107
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,860
It's never going to tell you, oh, hey, by the way,

1108
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,620
your system is.

1109
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,140
Yeah.

1110
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,260
This particular library.

1111
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,620
That sounds pretty risky to me.

1112
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,380
Yeah.

1113
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,060
Right.

1114
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,020
So daily driver, not for me yet.

1115
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,180
But I think if they keep working on it

1116
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,020
and Toolbox gains more functionality

1117
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:47,940
to be able to tie into maybe GNOME

1118
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,780
software or something along those lines

1119
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,220
where it can be more useful to supplant the hybrid application

1120
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:58,700
layer, I think it has a real shot

1121
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:02,620
at being an excellent workstation for regular users

1122
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,100
and not just devs.

1123
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,100
Interesting.

1124
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,060
Now, putting on your IT hat, you must see some use cases too

1125
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,380
as like enterprise-grade workstations.

1126
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,620
I wonder, is it usable now for enterprise,

1127
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:16,660
or would it require changes on the Silverblue team's part

1128
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,060
to make it usable?

1129
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,260
So here's the nice thing.

1130
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:24,900
You can point the RPM-OS tree upgrade path wherever you want.

1131
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,020
So say you're in an enterprise, and you've

1132
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,900
deployed a bunch of these workstations,

1133
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,000
even in VDI or something like that,

1134
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,880
and you publish a new image with some upgrades

1135
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,540
or some new applications for your employees

1136
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,340
to take and use, what you can do is

1137
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,220
you can point all of those at your image

1138
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,300
locally on your servers and have them pull it.

1139
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,260
And once they reboot, they're in that new image,

1140
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,540
and they're working, and it's on a new image

1141
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,740
that you've already tested and put it through its paces

1142
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,700
and said, yes, this is ready for my employees

1143
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,540
to use, which limits downtime for individual people

1144
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,700
and issues that they might have.

1145
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,260
That's really a huge benefit to something like this,

1146
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,020
where you've got the stable base that is bit for bit

1147
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,780
the same across deployments.

1148
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,300
And it's also the same reason why

1149
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,660
Debian and NixOS and other distributions

1150
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:22,580
are targeting build reproducibility

1151
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,100
is for this exact kind of thing.

1152
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:28,940
Now, I think that it could be made better.

1153
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,780
They could build some tooling around it

1154
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,780
to tie into, say, LDAP, where you can automatically

1155
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,340
spin up an instance in a VDI cluster

1156
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,340
that people could log into.

1157
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,940
Right, maybe some central storage,

1158
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,620
like maybe make some provisions for quickly

1159
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,260
mounting some NFS storage.

1160
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,340
Exactly.

1161
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,740
I think if they can really get that going,

1162
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:53,340
then that would be a game changer for enterprise.

1163
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:56,300
Yeah, you could really see the beauty in a VDI

1164
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,860
or even just standard workstation setup,

1165
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,100
where you combine it with LDAP for the authentication.

1166
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,980
So that way you're not having to keep updating password files

1167
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,660
and things like that.

1168
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,860
It's all centralized.

1169
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,940
Oh, man.

1170
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,620
God, that would be a dream.

1171
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:12,380
Well, I used to use a Citrix desktop, which

1172
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,220
was a Windows-based system VDI thing.

1173
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,220
And the applications on there were

1174
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,900
delivered via a container.

1175
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,860
So a lot of this stuff is already done in the Windows

1176
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,900
space, bizarrely.

1177
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,460
Yeah, any other thoughts on it, Drew?

1178
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,700
I mean, this seems like it was a worthwhile experiment,

1179
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,460
but ultimately, you're not sticking with it.

1180
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,020
Right.

1181
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,380
I'm not going to stick with it, just

1182
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:37,460
because my particular workflow, working with media,

1183
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:43,020
is not a use case that really is part of their spec.

1184
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,860
And I don't expect it to be.

1185
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:49,740
But right now, it does not work for me for what I need to do.

1186
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:53,340
If I were wearing a sysadmin hat,

1187
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,460
things would be different.

1188
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,180
I would love this.

1189
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,340
Yeah, that's what I was just thinking.

1190
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,780
For what I'm doing, it doesn't quite fit the bill.

1191
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:06,820
Now, speaking of the sysadmins again, though,

1192
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:08,900
just to bring it back a little bit,

1193
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,620
if they could put some tooling in that really ties this

1194
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,220
together, you could start supplanting things

1195
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:20,220
like Chef and Puppet for broad system control,

1196
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,860
where that can be baked into the image,

1197
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,140
and you don't need to run as many scripts

1198
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,940
across multiple machines.

1199
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:28,380
I could see that's where they're going.

1200
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:29,580
It could still be really early days.

1201
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,180
I mean, it's only been called Silverblue for a few months.

1202
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,140
That's very true.

1203
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:33,740
Yeah.

1204
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,140
I think Atomic might have been a better name.

1205
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:35,780
But hey, you know what?

1206
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:36,380
We'll move on.

1207
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,620
We'll move on from that.

1208
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,080
Well, Drew, thank you for the roundup.

1209
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,700
I've been very, very curious about it.

1210
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:43,100
So I'm glad you had a chance to do a deep dive on that.

1211
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,540
That was fascinating.

1212
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,060
And I think we'll keep watching it and seeing

1213
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,340
if there isn't a time, maybe an opportunity down the road,

1214
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,100
to use it in something.

1215
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,260
I could also really see it as just being a great host

1216
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,260
for containers and VMs on the server.

1217
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,060
That's another area beyond the workstation,

1218
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,860
where it just seems like it could be a killer system.

1219
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,260
We've got CoreOS for that one.

1220
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,020
Don't forget.

1221
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:01,860
That's true.

1222
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,420
That's true.

1223
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:04,540
CoreOS is really sort of the story there now.

1224
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:06,220
And that's sort of when things changed.

1225
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,740
And we went to Silverblue, really,

1226
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,540
was after CoreOS came along.

1227
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,980
Alex, I want to give you all of the credit

1228
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,540
for one of the picks this week.

1229
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,700
I did not even have it in my list.

1230
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:19,020
I'd never even seen it until you suggested it to me.

1231
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,020
Full disclosure, audience, prepare yourselves.

1232
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:22,580
Get ready.

1233
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,420
I have to tell something to Brent in private.

1234
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,660
So just give me a moment.

1235
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:27,060
I'm sorry.

1236
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:27,940
You won't be able to hear this.

1237
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:28,860
The cone of silence.

1238
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,340
Ooh.

1239
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,580
Hey, Brent.

1240
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,260
Yeah, Chris?

1241
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,540
They can't hear us, so don't worry about it.

1242
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,100
I am.

1243
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,900
So I got a really good app pick this week.

1244
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,220
Really?

1245
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,180
Where'd you find it?

1246
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,820
It was Alex told me about it.

1247
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:46,140
The issue is, though, it's on an Electron app.

1248
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:46,900
It's a what?

1249
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,660
It's an Electron app.

1250
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,900
You think I should tell them about it?

1251
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,700
You know, that's a little risky, I think.

1252
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,140
All right, you got my back on this?

1253
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,620
I'm with you.

1254
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,100
All right.

1255
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,540
The cone of silence.

1256
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:00,060
All right, well, sorry.

1257
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:00,940
We're back now.

1258
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,580
The app pick this week is called MineTime.

1259
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,140
It's a calendar for the 21st century.

1260
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,340
And it's, I think, the best calendar application

1261
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,020
I've ever used.

1262
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,340
Alex, how the hell did you find this?

1263
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:12,820
And why didn't you tell me about this sooner?

1264
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,580
I hate you.

1265
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:19,020
I had to try and find a way to get calendars for work

1266
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:25,940
and at home in sync, because Android's just rolled out

1267
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,060
a new feature, or it's just been presented to me

1268
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,220
a new feature that you can have different profiles

1269
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,300
on your device for work and home.

1270
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,620
So it installs Gmail and the Calendar app

1271
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,780
on your Android device into a container.

1272
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,620
The downside of that is it means that I can no longer

1273
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:44,860
see my home calendar and my work calendar in the same place.

1274
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:45,460
Right.

1275
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,980
So I was looking for a way to try and synchronize things

1276
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,460
with Nextcloud, with CalDAV, to try and get it all in one

1277
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:51,500
place again.

1278
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,300
And I just searched for Linux CalDAV calendar,

1279
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,020
and this MineTime thing came up.

1280
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,540
And I've been searching for the longest time

1281
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,980
for an iCal replacement.

1282
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:05,580
I think the Apple Calendar application is possibly

1283
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:09,220
my favorite way of just viewing events.

1284
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,580
The UI is clean.

1285
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:12,500
Adding new events is simple.

1286
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,780
And it's just really customizable.

1287
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:19,020
I can tell it that I want 15 hours viewable in a day,

1288
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:19,860
for example.

1289
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:25,340
And it just basically looks like a polished version

1290
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,980
in Electron of Apple's iCal.

1291
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,740
It also is a fairly snappy Electron application.

1292
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,540
I wasn't 100% sure it was even Electron.

1293
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:36,980
It wasn't smelling real bad or anything like that.

1294
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,620
It didn't have a code stink.

1295
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,020
It launched pretty good, doesn't use a ton of memory.

1296
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:43,580
And sure enough, if it doesn't work great

1297
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,860
with the different hosted calendars I have.

1298
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,940
And I've really been recently struggling with this

1299
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,340
because Linux Academy uses Google Apps.

1300
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,220
I have my own personal stuff.

1301
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,860
And I have the JB stuff.

1302
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,380
And it's been a real struggle for me

1303
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,700
because I don't really like Lightning.

1304
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:00,100
I don't like the way Evolution does it.

1305
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,020
I haven't really taken to any particular calendaring

1306
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,060
application.

1307
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,780
And so what I've been doing like a monster

1308
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:10,640
is I've been just natifying the Google Calendar

1309
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,620
for different calendars and just having

1310
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,060
three different natifier applications running

1311
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,540
on my desktop like a caveman, right?

1312
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,700
I mean, this is horrible, think about this.

1313
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,660
So I could have those different calendar stuff.

1314
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:26,140
And then Alex comes around with this mindtime.ai application.

1315
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,300
And Bob's your uncle.

1316
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,100
I've got it all in one application.

1317
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,500
But here's another thing it does,

1318
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,780
which you did not even tell me about, but is quite impressive,

1319
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,580
is it gives you a fascinating analysis of how

1320
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:41,820
you spend your time and who you spend your meetings with,

1321
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,300
who initiates the meetings.

1322
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,300
That might be dangerous.

1323
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:45,700
Oh, yeah.

1324
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,960
Boy, is it sometimes fuel for a righteous fire

1325
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,260
that I can have, let me tell you.

1326
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:51,740
But it's so great because now I have

1327
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,860
visuals of how much of my time per week is spent in meetings.

1328
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:57,460
And it's, let's just say, vindicating.

1329
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:58,580
Let's just put it that way.

1330
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:00,540
And it tells you who the worst offenders

1331
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,060
are for scheduling meetings.

1332
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,980
So my boss is right at the top of the list.

1333
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:06,580
Yeah, yeah.

1334
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:10,740
Mindtime also has, like, they call an assistant.

1335
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,460
But a lot of other really nice calendar applications

1336
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,580
have this, where it just understands natural language.

1337
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,820
So you just say, go to Portland with Brent on Wednesday.

1338
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,620
And it processes all of that.

1339
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,020
It says, well, he must mean the next Wednesday.

1340
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,500
And he must mean Brent from his contacts.

1341
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,420
And so it just figures all of that out

1342
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,860
and then puts it on your calendar

1343
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:32,540
right at the right time.

1344
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:35,140
And you can just do a brain dump right into a text field.

1345
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,060
You mean in English?

1346
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:36,780
Yeah.

1347
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,580
Isn't that right?

1348
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,420
Yeah, the computer has to adapt to you.

1349
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,500
And then it also provides some smart scheduling,

1350
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,940
which is really, really nice.

1351
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,460
It'll try to analyze your schedule.

1352
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,380
And it'll look at other people's schedules.

1353
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:50,980
And it'll make group scheduling simple and easier

1354
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,140
and recommend the times that have worked best for you

1355
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:53,940
in the past.

1356
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,500
It's a nice, it's an electron application, like I said.

1357
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,460
But that means it is also cross-platform.

1358
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:00,780
And it's probably one of the better electron applications

1359
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,140
that I've seen.

1360
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,260
Could I highlight their data policy?

1361
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,100
Yes, please.

1362
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,180
As a research project, Mindtime is

1363
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,980
financed by ETH Zurich, a Swiss innovation agency.

1364
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,140
We take data protection seriously.

1365
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:17,420
We will never sell your data.

1366
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,340
These technologies are developed and released for free

1367
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:23,860
and can be used by everybody for non-commercial purposes.

1368
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:25,500
That's pretty clear, don't you?

1369
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,100
Thank you, Alex.

1370
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,980
Yeah, I think that's a good thing to point out.

1371
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,100
So Alex, I was literally, last evening,

1372
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,100
I was literally looking for something like this

1373
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,460
because I'm sharing a few calendars with some people who

1374
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,620
only do the Googles and stuff like that.

1375
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:40,700
And it's almost like you were listening into my mind

1376
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,180
and you've solved my problem for me in about 15 hours.

1377
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,660
So kudos to you.

1378
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,420
I was looking recently, and this did not come up.

1379
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,220
Well, you're not looking in the right places.

1380
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:52,420
Just need to ask Alex.

1381
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,580
It's fairly new, right?

1382
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:56,260
So I don't know when it exactly was released,

1383
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:01,460
but it's a new entrance into the 21st century calendar

1384
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,700
landscape.

1385
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,420
Well, check out Mindtime.

1386
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,020
We will have a link in the show notes, as always,

1387
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,460
at linuxunplug.com slash 302 or in your podcast player.

1388
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,060
Now, since we did an Electron application,

1389
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:17,620
I want to clear the decks with a good old classic desktop

1390
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,100
Linux application.

1391
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,940
The good stuff just keeps on getting better.

1392
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:25,660
Now, if you've been rocking a rolling release Linux distro,

1393
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,500
you may already be enjoying this goodness.

1394
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,740
But if you are on Ubuntu 18.04 or 19.04,

1395
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:39,500
it turns out you may be running a slightly older

1396
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,420
version of Quake that is the world's best

1397
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,540
drop-down terminal.

1398
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,380
Have you had the pleasure of a drop-down terminal?

1399
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:47,340
Oh, I have.

1400
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,940
So I am an old Quake game user.

1401
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,580
Yes, yes.

1402
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,860
So I was first familiar with the drop-down terminals

1403
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,540
where its origin.

1404
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,140
That's where it's from.

1405
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,260
And it was great.

1406
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,060
That's why I keep it to the tilde key, too.

1407
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,560
That's why I still use the tilde key.

1408
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,060
Classic.

1409
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,860
One tilde key away from a terminal.

1410
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:06,580
Man, it's so brilliant.

1411
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:08,980
Well, Quake has, and something I have not

1412
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,100
been able to really enjoy until I just went ahead

1413
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,780
and slapped a PPA on my system, Quake

1414
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,780
has added a bunch of great features.

1415
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,820
And one of them that I just want to take a moment

1416
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,740
and highlight recently, if you're using an older version,

1417
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,580
first of all, you need to upgrade.

1418
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:25,540
Second of all, split terminal functionality.

1419
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:27,300
Now, let me take a moment here and tell you

1420
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,700
about how this will change your life.

1421
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:29,740
So you got a tilde key.

1422
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,780
You're one tilde key away.

1423
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:32,780
Boom, your terminal drops down, right?

1424
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,540
So now you can split this sucker horizontally, vertically,

1425
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:36,420
however you want it.

1426
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,580
Let me tell you how I do it.

1427
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,740
So I've got one large terminal on the left-hand side.

1428
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,580
That's my free terminal, always available.

1429
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,900
As soon as I need to do something, I got a terminal.

1430
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,820
And then on the right side, the right half

1431
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,940
of the drop-down terminal, I've got

1432
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,500
three different terminal areas.

1433
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,820
They're all vertical breaks on this horizontal panel.

1434
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:00,300
And in there are all of those weird esoteric command line

1435
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,300
applications that I need to run that I

1436
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,140
go start on the command line for some reason

1437
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,380
that I don't really need them until the time comes.

1438
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,940
So I just go run them manually.

1439
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,300
And then I like to watch their output on the command line

1440
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,240
because that's how I get feedback

1441
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,480
of what they're doing.

1442
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,020
I stash those in the different panes.

1443
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:18,420
And they're just why I always have the left-hand side always

1444
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,140
available.

1445
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:22,020
So I'm always a tilde key away from getting immediate feedback

1446
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,340
on what my Usenet application is doing

1447
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:26,740
or what that command line torrent application is doing

1448
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,420
or any of that kind of stuff.

1449
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:33,060
So I find that to be so useful just to have that.

1450
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:35,380
And then one tilde key, and it's all gone.

1451
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,940
And I'm right back to what I'm doing.

1452
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,980
I just think it's great.

1453
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:43,820
So Guake if you're on GNOME and Uake if you're on Plasma.

1454
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,660
And they both are just fantastic.

1455
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,740
And is this propagating to Uake?

1456
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:50,460
I think Uake already has it, although I

1457
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,980
don't remember for sure.

1458
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:53,220
Because that's what I use daily.

1459
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,300
And if not, if someone in the community in IRC

1460
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,900
would just put a feature request there.

1461
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:58,660
Open that thing up.

1462
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,300
And then in the post show, you should tell us.

1463
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,500
Well, maybe I will.

1464
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,180
Because Uake's great too.

1465
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:07,700
But now that I'm an XFCE user, I've been using Guake again.

1466
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,700
You like that?

1467
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,180
It's part of what makes the perfect XFCE desktop is

1468
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,380
ULauncher and Guake.

1469
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:17,220
You add those two applications, and you're 90% of the way

1470
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:17,700
there.

1471
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,380
Then you add the Arc theme to XFCE.

1472
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:21,300
And then you're good.

1473
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,300
You just sit back and wait for Cassidy and team

1474
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,740
to make elementary OS and dark theme a thing.

1475
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,340
They're going to do it.

1476
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:26,860
Come on.

1477
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,940
We're working on it.

1478
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:30,980
I had a real XFCE problem today, Chris.

1479
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:34,260
I'm so used to 10, 12 hours of battery life

1480
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,380
that I just stopped packing my charger.

1481
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,940
And I turned up at the office.

1482
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,300
And nobody had a USB-C charger.

1483
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,460
First world problem, eh?

1484
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,780
And the value of this is negative.

1485
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:45,540
You know what?

1486
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:48,900
I really, really appreciate the battery life.

1487
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,500
In fact, Brent is sitting here in the living room

1488
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,020
at the studio.

1489
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,180
And I'm like, Brent, watch this.

1490
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:53,860
Watch this, Brent.

1491
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,940
And I open up the laptop.

1492
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:55,380
And boom.

1493
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:55,980
You see how fast?

1494
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,260
Did it wake up fast or what?

1495
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,180
I was impressed.

1496
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,060
It almost like it knew you were going to open the lid

1497
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:00,900
and it woke itself up.

1498
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,180
And that was after it had been there for like a day

1499
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:02,660
and a half.

1500
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,380
Just pow.

1501
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:03,940
It's instant.

1502
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:04,900
XFCE to the rescue.

1503
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,700
It's impressive.

1504
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,380
It took you.

1505
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,060
You asked me.

1506
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,220
You said, so how's it going?

1507
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:11,180
And what don't you like about using XFCE right now?

1508
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,020
And it took me.

1509
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:14,060
I sat there and I thought about it for a minute.

1510
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:17,460
And I realized what I'm not in love with right now

1511
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,140
is the window management.

1512
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:22,180
I did figure out how to stop applications that bring

1513
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:24,660
a browser tab up from moving the browser from, say,

1514
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:26,580
the first virtual to the fourth virtual desktop.

1515
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:27,980
I figured out how to fix that.

1516
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:31,060
But if anybody in the audience has tips on scripts

1517
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:34,860
I can run that would restore my applications to their

1518
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:39,540
positions and also restore my window screen layouts,

1519
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:41,660
I'm still having the issue from time to time.

1520
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:44,380
When I wake up from sleep, my windows are completely

1521
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,140
jumbled, even though I've put everything

1522
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,340
in the right display ports, I've made sure

1523
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,220
like the primary displays and the right display

1524
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,860
port and all of that, I still get things that move around.

1525
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:55,700
Because I've got one regular monitor,

1526
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,340
one 16 by nine regular monitor,

1527
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,700
and then two vertical monitors.

1528
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:02,900
And XFCE just has a hell of a time with that sometimes.

1529
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,420
Sounds like you want to try out i3 next, Chris.

1530
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,300
That is something I'm actually considering doing.

1531
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,980
A lot of people have been recommending that to me.

1532
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,980
It's definitely something I'm starting to consider

1533
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,620
much more seriously right now.

1534
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,060
I'm just still like in the XFCE zone.

1535
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:19,140
But I gotta be honest, because I was so judgmental

1536
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,740
about XFCE and discounted it for a long time,

1537
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,980
I've now decided that, well, alright,

1538
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,300
I need to also give i3 a shot,

1539
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,620
because I've been sort of behaving the same way with i3.

1540
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:29,580
So I'm getting there.

1541
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,140
But in the meantime, if people have scripts

1542
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,220
or hacks they have to like restore window layouts

1543
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,640
and screen layouts for XFCE, let me know.

1544
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,540
Because one of the things I'm really enjoying

1545
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:40,860
is I can go find like a stack exchange post

1546
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,460
or whatever from like two years ago,

1547
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,660
and it's still applicable.

1548
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,020
It's still applicable, it's the best thing ever.

1549
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,300
It's so nice.

1550
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,580
Like it just makes so much more of the documentation

1551
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,900
online actually applicable,

1552
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,600
because like XFCE for the last four years

1553
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,960
has basically not changed much.

1554
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:58,820
So if I find something from like the last four years,

1555
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:00,740
I'm pretty much good.

1556
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:02,620
It's a persistent documentation.

1557
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,860
It's like what Windows users get.

1558
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:05,700
It's true.

1559
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,540
But in Windows, it's just because nothing changes.

1560
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,780
Yeah, well, yeah, because it's super boring,

1561
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:11,360
nothing changes, yeah, and nobody upgrades.

1562
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,220
But it's the same thing.

1563
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,760
All right, well, if anybody has,

1564
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,740
this has been the Help Chris episode really.

1565
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,100
If anybody, don't you think, help me build a PC for my son

1566
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,900
and help me fix XFCE.

1567
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,280
It's not that I3 wouldn't work for me either, I think.

1568
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,540
So it may happen.

1569
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:30,220
You know, some of these pics are helping me with problems

1570
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:31,460
I didn't even realize I had.

1571
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,280
Oh, yeah?

1572
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:33,740
Are you trying to wake out already?

1573
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:36,260
Yeah, I have to say, I haven't figured it out yet, so.

1574
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,020
What if you right click in the middle of the terminal?

1575
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:39,980
Oh, hey, now, that seems too obvious.

1576
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:42,580
So go over there and drop that terminal down.

1577
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:44,360
So I'm a control tilde, just saying.

1578
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,200
Oh, yeah, well.

1579
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,460
Because I got nothing on the right click.

1580
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,740
Plasma already assigned something

1581
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:48,900
to the tilde by default.

1582
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:49,580
Really, nothing?

1583
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,340
No, not even like adjust your profile?

1584
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,420
Oh, split left, right, split top, bottom.

1585
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,060
You just got to know where to right click.

1586
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:56,860
Yeah, there you go.

1587
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:58,180
Yeah, I figured.

1588
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,340
That's how all Plasma software is.

1589
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:01,340
It already does.

1590
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:02,340
You just got to find it.

1591
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:04,780
Well, it's all a learning journey, right?

1592
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:05,940
Especially with Plasma.

1593
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,300
Yeah.

1594
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,220
All right, Brent, well, thanks for filling in

1595
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,100
on Mr. Paint's seat.

1596
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:10,620
Thanks for being here.

1597
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,460
This is a great seat.

1598
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,980
And we have missed Mr. West.

1599
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:14,300
Yeah, we have.

1600
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,660
Hey, Wes, how are you doing out there in Barcelona?

1601
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:17,820
Bubble worries.

1602
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,460
What was that?

1603
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,500
Bubble worries.

1604
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,260
Oh, bubble worries, OK.

1605
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:24,620
Yeah, he's out in Barcelona right now at Kubicon with Elle.

1606
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,300
So I'm sure they're doing OK.

1607
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,940
I think it's like 3 AM there right now.

1608
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:29,980
I would imagine they're partying at this point.

1609
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,540
I hope they're sleeping, to be honest with you.

1610
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,460
Because they've got to get back here,

1611
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:34,860
and they've got to get back on mic.

1612
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:37,460
So anyways, this show will be live next Tuesday.

1613
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:39,860
I think Mr. Paint will be back, assuming he's not

1614
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,620
too jet-lagged.

1615
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,420
You can get it converted to your local time

1616
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:44,380
at jupitabroadcasting.com calendar.

1617
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,860
LinuxUnplugged.com for our website.

1618
00:59:46,860 --> 00:59:47,700
See you next Tuesday.

1619
00:59:47,700 --> 01:00:16,940
I'll talk to you then.

1620
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:22,500
Holy smokes! Look at this, Wes Payne on the remote line. Wes, I can't believe you're here.

1621
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,460
Shocker.

1622
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:29,060
Hey buddy, so how are you feeling? Give me just like the quick elevator review

1623
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,820
of how Kubicons gone so far.

1624
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:33,540
It's like the most boring rave I've ever been to.

1625
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,500
Really? Wow. Well, can I ask you something? Do you think,

1626
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,220
do you feel like it's something that regular people would want to go to?

1627
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,660
Could anybody do it, Wes? Could anybody be like you and go to Kubicons?

1628
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,820
It turns out if you try hard enough, you can.

1629
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:50,980
Well, there you go. Wes, thank you so much for being here. See you later, buddy.

1630
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,860
But we'll, but we'll raise.

1631
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:52,660
Yeah. See you later.

1632
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:53,620
So nice to hear from him.

1633
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:54,260
Yeah, it really was.

1634
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:54,660
Good guy.

1635
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,900
What a champ showing up at 3 AM, huh?

1636
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,300
I know.

1637
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:58,420
He's so dedicated.

1638
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:04,900
All right. Let's go pick our title. JBtitles.com. So Bruce, are you, are you still over there?

1639
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:06,100
Are you still 3D printing?

1640
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,260
I sure am. The lizards are still squealing.

1641
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:09,300
Oh, they really are.

1642
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,260
Screaming salamanders.

1643
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:15,140
That is funny. Yeah. So if you, if you hear something in the background,

1644
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:18,500
when Bruce talks, it sounds like a thousand salamanders being strangled.

1645
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:21,060
He's 3D printing what right now, Bruce?

1646
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:24,100
So I've got this show thing coming up. So I'm printing things that I hope will be

1647
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:28,260
interesting to people. So right now I'm doing a, what's called a self-watering flower pot.

1648
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:33,380
Oh, that is right. That is so cool. How is this self-watering flower pot?

1649
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:40,820
This one's pretty basic. It's just, it's got a, an inner cone, basically with a perforated cone

1650
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:45,460
inside that you plant the plant in that goes inside a bigger reservoir thing that you can water from

1651
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:49,300
the side that, you know, you can fill it with water without having to pour it right in the dirt.

1652
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,220
It's supposed to just draw water up as it needs it.

1653
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:56,820
And Bruce, can we get a clean salamander screaming sound here? Just an open mic.

1654
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:04,420
Yeah. It truly sounds like a torture chamber there for a second. Did you hear that?

1655
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:08,660
Well, it's the sound of the stepper motor singing. So actually some people use the,

1656
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:12,500
they use like, you just, you know how you had the people who did the floppy drives

1657
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,180
doing songs and stuff like that? So they do, they could do the same thing with 3D printers.

1658
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:19,380
They can program the three motors on them to do harmonies and stuff like that.

1659
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,580
So if I was ever like torturing lizards in the background while doing a show,

1660
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:25,860
I could just say I was 3D printing and people wouldn't know any better.

1661
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,540
What kind of 3D printer is it?

1662
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:32,660
It's actually interesting that I've been looking for, I've had a little one for a while and 3D

1663
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:37,540
prints are typically, you know, fairly expensive, usually over four figures to get one. And I walked

1664
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:43,140
into a computer store and found this guy, which is a pretty standard size for 3D printers, which is

1665
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:48,580
a 20 by 20 centimeter bed. And it was only 300 and some odd dollars.

1666
01:02:48,580 --> 01:02:54,100
And then do you load everything onto an SD card or a USB thumb and pop that sucker in there? Or

1667
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:55,380
is it actually hooked up to a machine?

1668
01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:57,540
This particular one can do both.

1669
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,740
How are you doing it though?

1670
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:04,820
I'm doing it from the computer and that's because I want to be able to click on the screen and move

1671
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:09,700
the head around for things like if I want to move the head out of the way for taking things off the

1672
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,700
bed or stuff like that.

1673
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,860
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

1674
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,700
Is that working on GNU slash Linux?

1675
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,220
Absolutely. I wouldn't do it if it didn't.

1676
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:19,220
I love that answer.

1677
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:24,340
Hey, Bruce, I have a quick question for you. Have you discovered OctoPrint yet?

1678
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:29,060
I know about it. I haven't gone to that level yet, but it's probably in my future. I have a

1679
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:35,380
couple of other... I have a RepRap 3D printer, which just needs a new part that belongs to the

1680
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:39,940
makerspace that I'm part of. And another little guy that's only 100 by 100 millimeter that I think

1681
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:44,020
I probably will end up putting Octopi on when we get our physical makerspace set up.

1682
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:49,940
And Bruce, I have a question as well. How many salamanders do you have to feed it per hour

1683
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:51,540
to get to the output that you're looking for?

1684
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:59,220
It's measured by millimeters of PLA, so it depends on what you're printing.

1685
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:03,060
Of course, right, obviously. Well, it's really exciting here that you're setting up a makerspace.

1686
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:03,940
How far along is that?

1687
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:09,940
Well, a lot of the preparation is done. It's just a matter of... We've got a local space that's

1688
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:14,900
probably about 15,000 square feet that we're dealing with the current owner that is probably

1689
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,860
going to give us a sweet deal on it because it's community based and that sort of thing.

1690
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:22,260
So we're probably within a week or two of getting the signature and then moving in.

1691
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,300
It's going to be fantastic.

1692
01:04:23,300 --> 01:04:27,060
Congratulations. Will you please keep us updated? That's really awesome.

1693
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:30,180
I love to follow that kind of stuff. Can I ask where you are?

1694
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:38,180
Barrie, Ontario, which is an hour north of Toronto and three hours south east of Brent.

1695
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:38,740
Yeah.

1696
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:46,740
Oh, that's a nice reference. So I have given some talks at a makerspace in Sudbury and I would...

1697
01:04:46,740 --> 01:04:51,540
And actually when I was in Cranbrook recently at the coworking space, I was doing the podcasting

1698
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,140
out of, they were saying, hey, we're just putting up a makerspace. So this is an area that I'm

1699
01:04:55,140 --> 01:05:00,580
pretty interested in. And so with my having travels through Barrie often,

1700
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,980
I would love to come see this space once you get it up and running.

1701
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:06,260
I've been thinking for a while and I've kind of put it out there a couple of times in the

1702
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:11,620
chat room and stuff is that I think JB would do well with having some sort of a maker kind of

1703
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:15,940
podcast. But of course, another thing on your plate is not... I mean, I would love to be part

1704
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:20,980
of it, but time and stuff like that. I'm the kind of guy who can talk, but I've got four kids and

1705
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:25,380
a makerspace to do, but I would like to be part of it. It might be something we can put together.

1706
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:30,020
Well, we'll talk more. Let's keep talking and yeah, maybe we'll get Brent out there

1707
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:33,140
sometime. He can be our on the scene reporter and maybe we'll get going. Maybe something

1708
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:36,980
will get rolling because I do want to do a makers podcast in the future. Well,

1709
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:40,740
good luck Bruce and make sure those salamanders meet their doom.

1710
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:43,700
I'm keeping this puppy running as fast as often as I can.

1711
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:48,260
Bruce, I would say hit me up in like Telegram or something, but I'd love to come down and

1712
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:53,380
take a few photos for you if you need that kind of thing. I'll get you some extra assets.

1713
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:56,660
Yeah, media and promotion and all that kind of stuff is definitely valuable.

1714
01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:14,260
Yeah, no kidding. It's a great idea, Brent.
