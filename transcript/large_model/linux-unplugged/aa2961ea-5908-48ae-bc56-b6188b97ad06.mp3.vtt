WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.800
So it's called AmpliPi, I think, Wes.

00:02.800 --> 00:03.880
Is that what it's called?

00:03.880 --> 00:07.520
AmpliPi, like amplify, but with a Raspberry Pi involved.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.640
Yeah, or at least the compute module.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.600
This is one of these Kickstarters

00:11.600 --> 00:14.920
that I wasn't sure if no one would pay any attention to

00:14.920 --> 00:16.360
or if it would be a big success.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.160
And it seems like it's going to be in the big success category.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.660
They've already reached their goal.

00:20.660 --> 00:23.040
But it is a whole house audio system

00:23.040 --> 00:25.260
with multi-zone audio support, like the old school

00:25.260 --> 00:29.040
amplifiers, that you pop a Raspberry Pi into.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.880
And so you can imagine it's gotten a lot of attention.

00:31.880 --> 00:34.240
And it also has an API.

00:34.240 --> 00:39.160
So of course, you could now write scripts for your amp.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.160
This is so cool.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.000
I mean, yeah, not only can it do the kind of standard stereo

00:43.000 --> 00:44.800
stuff with analog input so you can hook up

00:44.800 --> 00:47.040
any of your standard stereo gear,

00:47.040 --> 00:50.320
but it can also stream directly from AirPlay, Pandora, Spotify

00:50.320 --> 00:52.120
if you've got a DLNA source.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.280
And all of its open source, the schematics, the rest API

00:55.280 --> 00:56.640
is written in Python.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.920
They've got low-level control written in C controlled by Python.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.080
You can get all of it.

01:01.080 --> 01:02.680
Yep, if you ever wanted a free software

01:02.680 --> 01:05.600
amp for your home theater setup, this is it.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.360
We'll have a link in the show notes.

01:07.360 --> 01:19.360
Hello, friends, and welcome into episode 393.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.120
My name is Chris.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.000
My name is Wes.

01:21.000 --> 01:21.900
Hello, Wes.

01:21.900 --> 01:24.360
This episode is brought to you by the all-new Cloud

01:24.360 --> 01:26.400
Guru, the leader in learning for the Cloud, Linux,

01:26.400 --> 01:27.600
or modern tech skills.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.560
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs,

01:29.560 --> 01:34.520
get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

01:34.520 --> 01:38.480
We have some fun things to get into on episode 393,

01:38.480 --> 01:41.280
and I'm obviously just now realizing

01:41.280 --> 01:44.320
that that's almost 400 episodes and having a mild panic attack

01:44.320 --> 01:45.720
while I do the introduction.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.960
But we won't worry about that today.

01:47.960 --> 01:51.160
No, no, it's a very special day in open source.

01:51.160 --> 01:56.000
A brand new workstation-grade desktop is rolling out today,

01:56.000 --> 01:59.800
and we've gone hands-on and have our opinions, our thoughts,

01:59.800 --> 02:07.800
and some procrastinations, I got nothing on that one.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.240
It's horrible.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.320
But we'll get there.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.380
We'll get through some community news.

02:11.380 --> 02:12.800
And to help us do all of that, we've

02:12.800 --> 02:14.300
got to bring in our virtual lug.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.960
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.520
Hello, hello, hello.

02:17.520 --> 02:18.680
Hello.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.440
Hello, hello.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.240
I see Phil from Mangero snuck in there too.

02:22.240 --> 02:22.920
Hello, Phil.

02:22.920 --> 02:23.680
Yeah, hello.

02:23.680 --> 02:24.400
How are you?

02:24.400 --> 02:25.320
Good, welcome back.

02:25.320 --> 02:27.800
Well, I'm glad to have all of you here today,

02:27.800 --> 02:30.640
because there's a lot to talk about.

02:30.640 --> 02:35.200
And I'm going to start with a little bit of local news

02:35.200 --> 02:37.480
here at the Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.800
We just hit 400 episodes on our CODA radio program,

02:40.800 --> 02:42.580
eight years of fun shows.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.720
And I think a lot of you are probably

02:44.720 --> 02:46.720
aware that Jupiter Broadcasting hasn't

02:46.720 --> 02:49.960
done any swag or merchandise in over two years,

02:49.960 --> 02:52.880
since before we were acquired and then now independent again.

02:52.880 --> 02:54.880
And that is definitely something I wanted to fix,

02:54.880 --> 02:58.480
but I didn't want to do the same old stuff everyone else is

02:58.480 --> 02:59.520
doing.

02:59.520 --> 03:03.920
I wanted something awesome, something useful, something

03:03.920 --> 03:05.920
great, something that can help you

03:05.920 --> 03:07.880
be productive and comfortable.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.560
And it took combining multiple platforms and shops,

03:10.560 --> 03:13.040
multiple team members researching and conducting

03:13.040 --> 03:13.880
calls.

03:13.880 --> 03:17.800
It's a product born of 2020 and early 2021,

03:17.800 --> 03:19.800
and we are calling it the CODA.

03:19.800 --> 03:24.840
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

03:24.840 --> 03:29.040
It's 100% terry cloth velour, soft, cozy robe.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.960
It feels great on the skin out of the shower,

03:30.960 --> 03:33.040
and it works well all day long.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.720
It's embroidered right here in the US of A,

03:34.720 --> 03:38.240
and we are doing a limited run on a brand new CODA radio robe,

03:38.240 --> 03:39.600
all black, white logo.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.800
It looks fantastic, the CODA.shop.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.160
It's our first swaggin' forever.

03:45.160 --> 03:47.520
Pre-orders are now until the end of February.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.320
It's $65 plus shipping.

03:50.320 --> 03:53.280
And depending on how bad I screw this up or how good it goes,

03:53.280 --> 03:55.960
this will 100% kind of drive what we do in the future

03:55.960 --> 03:57.200
with merchandising.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.280
I don't think it's going to be robes,

03:59.280 --> 04:01.680
but I do want to do kind of neat stuff

04:01.680 --> 04:05.360
that nobody else is doing, or as far as I know.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.440
And I'd love for you to grab a robe, the CODA.shop.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.640
I'm getting you one, Wes.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.400
Ooh, does that mean pants are optional?

04:11.400 --> 04:12.200
Totally.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.760
That's the great thing about this robe.

04:13.760 --> 04:15.380
You could wear it all day long, and it

04:15.380 --> 04:16.720
could be the only thing you wear,

04:16.720 --> 04:19.120
or you could wear it over your clothes.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.200
It's not a house coat.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.760
It's a house coder, the CODA.shop.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.080
But now moving back into, yes, it's really here

04:26.080 --> 04:26.800
in the chat room.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.320
Look at that.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.800
What do you think, Brent?

04:29.800 --> 04:31.800
Do you feel like you want a robe now?

04:31.800 --> 04:34.600
I saw this in the Telegram, Jupiter broadcasting Telegram

04:34.600 --> 04:35.080
group.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.780
I think that might have been a sneak peek.

04:36.780 --> 04:39.680
And I'm not a robe guy, but man, you've got me tingling.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.240
So we're going to have to see.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.060
I think it's super awesome and hilarious.

04:44.060 --> 04:44.640
I love it.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.760
Everyone can be a robe guy or gal,

04:46.760 --> 04:49.000
and I hope people enjoy it.

04:49.000 --> 04:54.840
So I thought we'd start today with a bit of Linux history.

04:54.840 --> 04:58.320
22 years ago yesterday as we record this,

04:58.320 --> 05:00.120
it was Windows Refund Day.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.440
We've talked about this once before on the show,

05:02.440 --> 05:06.000
but this was a day where Linux users, including

05:06.000 --> 05:10.440
Eric Raymond and others, got together to go to Microsoft

05:10.440 --> 05:16.760
and request that they actually fulfill an aspect of the Windows

05:16.760 --> 05:19.440
EULA in the Windows End User License Agreement.

05:19.440 --> 05:22.120
It clearly states that the agreement can

05:22.120 --> 05:24.920
be refused by the end user and that Windows can be

05:24.920 --> 05:27.120
returned to the manufacturer.

05:27.120 --> 05:30.200
However, in real life, the way that kind of plays out

05:30.200 --> 05:31.920
is the manufacturer says, sorry, you've

05:31.920 --> 05:33.120
got to go to Microsoft for that.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.900
Microsoft says, sorry, you've got to go to the OEM for that.

05:35.900 --> 05:40.560
And the user is left paying for Windows that they don't want.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.600
So this group decided to make a statement out of it

05:43.600 --> 05:48.040
and go down to Microsoft's office in the Bay Area

05:48.040 --> 05:48.840
and protest.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.460
And they actually got a group together.

05:50.460 --> 05:52.200
They had signs.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.840
And the press showed up, and there

05:54.840 --> 05:56.080
was quite a bit of coverage.

05:56.080 --> 06:00.600
And I grabbed one of these clips from 1999, 22 years ago.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.080
It was a small orderly protest calling attention

06:03.080 --> 06:05.440
to some big issues facing Microsoft.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.040
Some computer users who don't want Windows 98

06:08.040 --> 06:10.440
on their computers want a refund for the software

06:10.440 --> 06:12.400
they say they're forced to pay for.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.480
High tech business reporter Jim Goldman has the story

06:14.480 --> 06:15.760
from our San Jose News Center.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.200
These people don't just dislike Microsoft.

06:21.200 --> 06:22.360
They want a refund.

06:22.360 --> 06:25.440
And they may indeed have a legal leg to stand on.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.440
We don't want their Windows.

06:27.440 --> 06:29.240
And we want our money back.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.880
That was Eric Raymond right there.

06:30.880 --> 06:33.600
The protest was organized by a group supporting

06:33.600 --> 06:36.280
a free alternative operating system called

06:36.280 --> 06:38.680
Linux that works on most PCs.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.120
It also happens to be in direct competition

06:41.120 --> 06:42.960
with Windows 98.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.320
Linux is also gaining in popularity,

06:45.320 --> 06:47.320
but still mostly an operating system

06:47.320 --> 06:49.360
for hardcore computer users.

06:49.360 --> 06:52.060
60 computer makers from 14 countries

06:52.060 --> 06:54.960
now sell systems with Linux pre-installed,

06:54.960 --> 06:58.640
just as Compaq or Dell sell computers with Windows 98

06:58.640 --> 06:59.800
already loaded.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.920
The refund demand was really a stunt

07:01.920 --> 07:05.720
to let consumers know there is indeed a choice to Microsoft.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.240
When you call a manufacturer, when you talk to someone,

07:08.240 --> 07:10.280
that Windows isn't your only alternative.

07:10.280 --> 07:13.640
Microsoft mostly took the PR nightmare in stride,

07:13.640 --> 07:16.960
even displaying a welcome sign to the Linux community.

07:16.960 --> 07:19.120
Protesters were not amused.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.240
You could be looking at a class action suit.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.240
They even tried to get up to the company's ninth floor offices.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.280
So you're not letting the people upstairs to-

07:26.280 --> 07:28.560
No, it's a business day.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.440
There's a lot of people working upstairs.

07:30.440 --> 07:32.760
But were prevented from getting inside.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.840
The message is, it's OK to take your money,

07:34.840 --> 07:36.400
but it's not OK to listen to you,

07:36.400 --> 07:38.200
or to pay attention to their own licenses.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.240
That's Chris Tabona.

07:39.240 --> 07:41.280
For its part, Microsoft says consumers

07:41.280 --> 07:44.360
are free to choose whatever operating system they want.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.840
And policies are already in place to get that refund.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.880
The license agreement that comes with Windows clearly states

07:50.880 --> 07:53.400
that if you do want a refund on the copy of Windows that

07:53.400 --> 07:54.520
comes with your PC, that's fine.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.480
There's nothing preventing you from doing that.

07:56.480 --> 07:58.480
You just go and contact your PC manufacturer,

07:58.480 --> 08:01.960
and they handle the process and policy for that return.

08:01.960 --> 08:05.080
In enlightened circles, this is called a catch-22.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.280
This subdued protest will not end here.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.800
Organizers hope to create somewhat of a groundswell

08:09.800 --> 08:13.200
to pressure Microsoft into a new refunding program.

08:13.200 --> 08:17.040
But with 25 million copies of Windows 98 already licensed,

08:17.040 --> 08:18.440
at least at this stage, it appears

08:18.440 --> 08:20.760
Microsoft has little to worry about.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.680
In Foster City, I'm Jim Goldman, New Center 4.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.880
Microsoft might not have worried about it very much,

08:25.880 --> 08:29.640
but I actually think it did catch the attention of OEMs

08:29.640 --> 08:30.800
to some degree.

08:30.800 --> 08:34.360
And it showed that there was a demographic of customer

08:34.360 --> 08:37.480
out there that was happy to buy a machine without Windows.

08:37.480 --> 08:40.840
Now, the process of OEMs unwinding themselves

08:40.840 --> 08:43.840
from Microsoft's grasp was an entirely different issue.

08:43.840 --> 08:47.200
You know what stood out to me from all this archival history?

08:47.200 --> 08:48.400
The rat tales.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.520
Oh, yeah, lots of rat tales.

08:50.520 --> 08:51.960
Lots of tuxes out there.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.680
And we will have a link in the show notes

08:54.680 --> 08:57.680
where you can read the original posts about it and the day.

08:57.680 --> 09:00.840
And then you'll also find links to the video archive,

09:00.840 --> 09:05.400
CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.600
Oh, and I guess CNN, but you can't get the video anymore.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.560
They all were there.

09:08.560 --> 09:13.800
And there is old, retro video footage of it that is, well,

09:13.800 --> 09:15.800
it's very nostalgic.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.960
So much has changed, and so much is still the same.

09:18.960 --> 09:22.120
Well, speaking of things that are about 20 years old,

09:22.120 --> 09:26.360
VLC 4.0 is coming later this year.

09:26.360 --> 09:27.600
Embrace yourselves.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.600
It has a new UI.

09:30.600 --> 09:36.320
Now, the player has reportedly been downloaded by more than,

09:36.320 --> 09:40.160
or it has been downloaded at least 3.5 billion times.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.000
That's what they say.

09:41.000 --> 09:44.600
Now, I don't know if that even includes Linux distributions

09:44.600 --> 09:46.200
that have it in the repository.

09:46.200 --> 09:49.680
And work on version 4.0 is nearly complete.

09:49.680 --> 09:52.320
The stable release is expected in the coming months.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.440
And the user interface, as they say,

09:54.440 --> 09:57.160
will be redesigned from the ground up.

09:57.160 --> 09:59.360
Another interesting major feature

09:59.360 --> 10:02.840
will be what they're calling the Moviepedia project, which

10:02.840 --> 10:05.120
is kind of like an IMDb competitor,

10:05.120 --> 10:08.920
but with Wikipedia-style user contributions.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.440
Interesting.

10:10.440 --> 10:12.040
The new version will also focus more

10:12.040 --> 10:13.480
on playing videos from the internet,

10:13.480 --> 10:16.840
relying on extensions to find third-party content.

10:16.840 --> 10:20.000
And it sounds like they're maybe working on a WebAssembly

10:20.000 --> 10:22.760
version that could play videos right inside the browser.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.000
That's interesting.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.080
But going back to the plugins thing, hmm.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.280
Well, I could see that being a real pain in the butt.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.720
You go to play something, and this whole dialogue comes up,

10:32.720 --> 10:34.400
and you've got to go retrieve a plugin.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.520
What about the reverse case of, like, MPV integrates

10:36.520 --> 10:39.120
with YouTube DL already, and that just works?

10:39.120 --> 10:39.760
That's true.

10:39.760 --> 10:40.560
Something like that.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.240
That's a great example of just being

10:42.240 --> 10:44.920
able to pop YouTube DL support into VLC,

10:44.920 --> 10:48.040
and they don't have to develop it directly themselves.

10:48.040 --> 10:48.760
That'd be OK.

10:48.760 --> 10:48.960
All right.

10:48.960 --> 10:49.840
You got me on there.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.440
But did you see the bit in this article

10:51.440 --> 10:55.480
about that John Baptiste is mulling

10:55.480 --> 10:58.360
around the idea of an ad-supported video streaming

10:58.360 --> 11:01.000
service, similar to what Plex did back in 2019

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
to support the project?

11:02.000 --> 11:02.720
Whoa.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.160
I don't know how I feel about that.

11:05.160 --> 11:08.640
Yeah, more ads is not necessarily what I want.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.320
Yeah.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.800
And I don't really like what Plex has done so far.

11:12.800 --> 11:17.120
As a fan of Plex, you know, I've interviewed their CEO.

11:17.120 --> 11:19.120
I've been a user a long time.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.120
I like it.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.960
I mean, I wish it was all open source.

11:21.960 --> 11:24.520
But that aside, I really like it.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.440
And I have not been a fan of their streaming service.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.320
I have tried it out in various incarnations

11:29.320 --> 11:31.000
that they've updated it, and I have not

11:31.000 --> 11:33.520
found it to be particularly compelling.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.840
And in part, it's really coming down to content licensing

11:35.840 --> 11:38.320
deals and stuff, because everybody

11:38.320 --> 11:40.520
who owns content that is worth a damn

11:40.520 --> 11:43.160
is just launching their own streaming service right now.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.680
And they don't want to license it.

11:44.680 --> 11:47.160
And it's not really clear to me that the Video Land Foundation

11:47.160 --> 11:50.680
is really the best project to take that on.

11:50.680 --> 11:51.960
I mean, I want to support them.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.480
I use VLC all the time, especially

11:53.480 --> 11:56.840
with the handy new Chromecast features, good mobile support,

11:56.840 --> 11:58.120
all the things I like about it.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.920
But that, I don't know, just doesn't speak to me.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.600
Yeah, Colonel, what are your thoughts on them developing

12:03.600 --> 12:06.240
this Movipedia project?

12:06.240 --> 12:08.400
Yeah, I wonder why they're doing that,

12:08.400 --> 12:10.960
because as a lot of people may be aware,

12:10.960 --> 12:15.400
IMDb has been a crap show, in my opinion, for a long time.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.400
But a couple of years ago, there was a new competitor

12:18.400 --> 12:22.240
that started up called TMDB.org.

12:22.240 --> 12:26.400
And it essentially sounds like what they're trying to create.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.640
So why not just partner with them?

12:28.640 --> 12:31.120
Because TMDB started because people

12:31.120 --> 12:33.920
didn't like the direction that IMDb took.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.240
So they go, well, let's just remake it and make it better.

12:37.240 --> 12:42.320
And TMDB is very much about community contributed content

12:42.320 --> 12:44.880
and making it that way.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.640
So I wonder how much of what they're doing

12:47.640 --> 12:49.600
is maybe they're not aware.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.240
Maybe they tried, and there's some issue there.

12:52.240 --> 12:56.600
Or if it's a not invented hair syndrome, or what?

12:56.600 --> 12:59.240
Piecrash, it could also come down to an issue of focus

12:59.240 --> 13:01.000
with a new streaming service.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.920
Yeah, I mean, one of the problems

13:02.920 --> 13:06.200
of implementing streaming services

13:06.200 --> 13:10.040
is that it moved from the core project on the core business.

13:10.040 --> 13:14.000
I mean, it's people that are not spending their time making

13:14.000 --> 13:18.480
the video LAN player better, but are working on code

13:18.480 --> 13:21.480
for supporting the streaming services and stuff like that.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.120
And I think it's a problem for the project.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.400
Yeah, yeah.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.920
I'm kind of skeptical of this plug-in system.

13:27.920 --> 13:28.880
How about you, Brent?

13:28.880 --> 13:31.600
Yeah, you were mentioning their thoughts of putting plug-ins.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.640
And I was remembering how VLC was so great because they

13:35.640 --> 13:37.160
solved that problem originally.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.280
So it almost sounds like they're creating a problem

13:39.280 --> 13:42.240
that they solved originally, which might be worrisome.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.600
I think you nailed that's exactly what it is for me.

13:44.600 --> 13:48.520
It's like VLC was my no plug-ins, no extra codecs required.

13:48.520 --> 13:52.240
I can just open a video file, and I know it's going to play.

13:52.240 --> 13:55.080
I would feel a bit of a loss if that changed.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.520
But maybe it's more like Wes was saying,

13:57.520 --> 14:00.080
and it's additional outside functionality.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.360
Well, right, things have changed since those old days.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.360
I think, hopefully, it wouldn't be

14:04.360 --> 14:05.800
dropping any of that support for just playing

14:05.800 --> 14:06.840
whatever you throw at it.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.120
But we now live in a world where you often

14:09.120 --> 14:11.360
aren't throwing a file at it because it's just

14:11.360 --> 14:12.800
some third-party service.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.760
True.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.800
Well, we've been sifting through Fosdom 2021.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.080
They did a virtual event.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.560
They had Matrix as their chat.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.200
And they've been posting videos of the event

14:22.200 --> 14:27.120
as the people that did the talk approved the video.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.920
And one of the things that's interesting is a Facebook

14:29.920 --> 14:32.000
employee gave a talk at Fosdom.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.240
And I think it's Michael Salem is his name.

14:34.240 --> 14:37.920
And we learned a little bit about Facebook's desktop Linux

14:37.920 --> 14:38.440
use.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.240
Yeah, isn't that interesting?

14:40.240 --> 14:43.840
Facebook is known for their usage of CentOS on the servers.

14:43.840 --> 14:46.720
But when it comes to Linux on the employee desktops,

14:46.720 --> 14:49.600
turns out Fedora is the primary target these days,

14:49.600 --> 14:53.040
but with growing support for CentOS Stream.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.680
For a while, Facebook internally recommended Ubuntu LTS

14:55.680 --> 14:57.920
releases in the past for their employees,

14:57.920 --> 15:00.000
but shifted to Fedora so they could leverage

15:00.000 --> 15:01.960
some of the internal infrastructure and tooling

15:01.960 --> 15:05.040
that they already had for handling CentOS on the server.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.720
Well, yeah, OK, that makes sense.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.480
They're using Chef.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.840
They've got a lot of open-source Chef libraries.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.360
Now, they can also use that on the desktop.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.960
Yeah, though, the notable thing here,

15:13.960 --> 15:17.960
it sounds like from the talk, is that the Fedora CentOS

15:17.960 --> 15:19.720
Stream on the desktop thing is going

15:19.720 --> 15:24.920
to be like an official stance supported by Facebook IT,

15:24.920 --> 15:27.600
whereas the prior recommendation just if you're going to use

15:27.600 --> 15:29.200
Linux, you've got to use Ubuntu.

15:29.200 --> 15:32.280
They left the employees to self-support that themselves

15:32.280 --> 15:33.680
with Windows and Mac OS remaining

15:33.680 --> 15:35.240
the most common platforms.

15:35.240 --> 15:37.440
But in addition to the standard Fedora repositories,

15:37.440 --> 15:39.600
when they have a Fedora image that they deploy,

15:39.600 --> 15:41.520
their own internal repository gets added,

15:41.520 --> 15:42.960
Facebook's own internal repo.

15:42.960 --> 15:43.800
They have one.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.240
And also, they enable the RPM Fusion

15:46.240 --> 15:48.480
on their Fedora desktops repos, and they

15:48.480 --> 15:50.800
allow the use of Flatpaks.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.400
So modern, right?

15:52.400 --> 15:54.760
And you can kind of see why CentOS Stream might

15:54.760 --> 15:56.040
be a good fit for them.

15:56.040 --> 15:57.440
I mean, Fedora is great for a lot of reasons.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.840
They've got a slide in the presentation

15:58.840 --> 15:59.840
sort of addressing this.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.560
But there are some downsides.

16:01.560 --> 16:04.040
You've got to figure out how to keep up on the updates,

16:04.040 --> 16:04.640
a lot of change.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.440
Maybe there's employees who just don't care

16:06.440 --> 16:08.480
about being that cutting edge.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.160
I'm sure some do, some don't.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.240
So with CentOS Stream, you kind of get a nice balance

16:12.240 --> 16:14.120
of a stable, quote unquote, rolling

16:14.120 --> 16:16.160
release, binary compatibility with which

16:16.160 --> 16:19.280
you're running on the servers, good security posture,

16:19.280 --> 16:21.960
and still a close relationship with Fedora.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.400
I noticed that they packaged internally

16:24.400 --> 16:25.800
some of their dependencies, and it

16:25.800 --> 16:27.160
sounds like they try to get stuff

16:27.160 --> 16:29.640
they might need for their internal stuff,

16:29.640 --> 16:32.000
actually just packaged in Fedora or upstream

16:32.000 --> 16:35.080
or in user-provided repositories when they need to.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.240
This is an interesting development

16:37.240 --> 16:40.560
in that imagine if multiple large companies like this

16:40.560 --> 16:43.120
started recognizing this value chain,

16:43.120 --> 16:46.840
and then they start contributing towards Fedora.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.120
In this article specifically to that end,

16:49.120 --> 16:51.320
Michael Larble says, you look at some of the things that

16:51.320 --> 16:53.920
have come down, like enabling early out-of-memory daemon

16:53.920 --> 16:56.960
and stuff, that's because Facebook is now using Fedora,

16:56.960 --> 16:58.360
and they're contributing directly.

16:58.360 --> 17:00.720
So Neil, I'm sure you've seen some of this go by.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.440
I'm curious what your thoughts are on this.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.560
So some of this is a little bit less of a surprise

17:04.560 --> 17:06.800
if you'd seen some earlier versions of their talks.

17:06.800 --> 17:10.280
They gave a similar talk at Nest with Fedora

17:10.280 --> 17:13.440
about their growing usage of Fedora on the desktop.

17:13.440 --> 17:18.560
And last year, not last year, the year before, for Flock,

17:18.560 --> 17:22.360
they gave a keynote about their growing usage of Fedora

17:22.360 --> 17:25.920
when they switched to Fedora by default for the desktops.

17:25.920 --> 17:31.120
A big part of the rise of CentOS stream for desktops

17:31.120 --> 17:34.040
mostly is attributed to the NVIDIA driver

17:34.040 --> 17:38.680
because the NVIDIA driver is only officially supported

17:38.680 --> 17:42.920
for RHEL platforms, especially for certain things like CUDA

17:42.920 --> 17:45.080
and data science and all that fun stuff

17:45.080 --> 17:47.360
that nobody really wants to talk about.

17:47.360 --> 17:51.480
But because those things are only really properly supported

17:51.480 --> 17:53.880
on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives,

17:53.880 --> 17:58.560
they are ramping up CentOS stream for desktop users

17:58.560 --> 18:00.240
for people that need those things.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.160
And everyone else is generally going

18:02.160 --> 18:04.200
to be encouraged to use Fedora.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.000
That's pretty neat.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.480
And you can see how that's a nice system for them.

18:08.480 --> 18:11.600
And for a modern company like Facebook who gets it,

18:11.600 --> 18:12.880
there's a lot of advantages to it.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.280
And you start to see serious contributions,

18:15.280 --> 18:17.160
real improvements get added to the distribution

18:17.160 --> 18:19.280
because one large shop uses it.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.840
And you wonder what if Google came to a similar realization

18:22.840 --> 18:24.800
or some other large organization,

18:24.800 --> 18:27.240
maybe not even at that scale, but still had developers

18:27.240 --> 18:28.520
that were contributing upstream.

18:28.520 --> 18:31.080
And all of a sudden, you start seeing a lot of really good

18:31.080 --> 18:33.240
code floating into the project.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.840
That's pretty exciting the way that works.

18:34.840 --> 18:40.000
So I debated this one because I'm like, it's Facebook.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
And I know that's not great.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.360
But when you look at the code contributed,

18:45.360 --> 18:47.840
it actually has worked out really good for Linux users.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.440
And so this is a positive development.

18:49.440 --> 18:52.240
And I also, as a former corporate user

18:52.240 --> 18:54.520
who was trying to use Linux, I always really like a story

18:54.520 --> 18:57.640
when I see the corporate IT staff are saying,

18:57.640 --> 18:59.480
yes, Linux is allowed.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.880
This is like first party, yeah, they're saying, go at it.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.520
Run Linux on your desktop.

19:03.520 --> 19:04.560
We need more of that.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.120
Exactly.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.280
So that's good to see, too.

19:06.280 --> 19:08.080
So all in all, it was a good story.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.120
And we'll have a link in the show notes

19:09.120 --> 19:10.520
if you want to read the details.

19:12.840 --> 19:14.560
linode.com slash unplugged.

19:14.560 --> 19:18.040
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account

19:18.040 --> 19:19.200
and support the show.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.400
Linode's how we host anything online.

19:21.400 --> 19:24.920
Since JB 3.0 launched, we've put everything on Linode

19:24.920 --> 19:25.840
for a lot of reasons.

19:25.840 --> 19:27.260
I started using them a couple of years ago.

19:27.260 --> 19:28.760
And I just realized how great they

19:28.760 --> 19:30.440
are at doing what they offer.

19:30.440 --> 19:32.200
They've been around since 2003, but they

19:32.200 --> 19:35.520
decided to focus on a handful of sensible services

19:35.520 --> 19:37.820
and just do a killer job.

19:37.820 --> 19:39.560
And that means the entire package.

19:39.560 --> 19:40.880
That means support.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.320
That means web UI.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.880
That means network infrastructure.

19:43.880 --> 19:45.200
That means disk speed.

19:45.200 --> 19:46.800
That means host speed.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.200
It means having packages available

19:48.200 --> 19:50.680
if you want dedicated GPU or if you need a lot of storage

19:50.680 --> 19:52.160
or you just need something simple

19:52.160 --> 19:53.800
or maybe you just want object storage.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.960
It means getting those things right

19:55.960 --> 19:57.680
and doing them really well.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.840
That's what Linode is all about.

19:59.840 --> 20:02.840
And one of the things that I like about Linode as a user,

20:02.840 --> 20:05.080
having a system I'll put up and then I kind of don't think

20:05.080 --> 20:07.880
about it very often, is they have really sensible defaults

20:07.880 --> 20:11.160
for alerts that they just set up automatically for you.

20:11.160 --> 20:14.000
You can obviously always go in, look at the dashboard,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.600
look at the charts, see what performance has been like.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.760
But if something gets a little out of whack,

20:18.760 --> 20:22.520
like on one of our PeerTube instances, all of a sudden,

20:22.520 --> 20:24.640
we were just using a ton of data and there

20:24.640 --> 20:26.720
is a trigger that will automatically tell me that.

20:26.720 --> 20:31.040
There's one for CPU and other basic system connectivity

20:31.040 --> 20:34.120
issues and whatnot where they are set that up already

20:34.120 --> 20:36.520
with a watchdog and they will alert you to that stuff.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.480
So it keeps us proactive because we

20:38.480 --> 20:42.040
can keep an eye on how our PeerTube instances are doing

20:42.040 --> 20:44.160
without having to hover at the dashboard all the time.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.360
And they just set that stuff up for you.

20:45.360 --> 20:47.040
And of course, it's all customizable.

20:47.040 --> 20:49.760
I mean, like I said, they've been doing this since AWS.

20:49.760 --> 20:53.040
So what they offer, they know how to do really well.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.120
I encourage you to go over there and try it out.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.060
It's also a fantastic platform to learn on.

20:58.060 --> 21:00.480
And there's really pretty much no downsides

21:00.480 --> 21:02.140
in terms of making changes and then being

21:02.140 --> 21:04.840
able to revert them or trying something, having it go wrong.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.520
It's like you get a save button in a game.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.120
Before you go fight the boss, you can hit the Save button,

21:09.120 --> 21:11.680
save your game, and then go fight the boss.

21:11.680 --> 21:14.240
And if things go wrong, you just reload your save point.

21:14.240 --> 21:15.200
That's what it's like when you're

21:15.200 --> 21:16.320
doing servers on Linode.

21:16.320 --> 21:19.000
It's so great to have that peace of mind.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.080
So go to linode.com slash unplugged and check it out.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.000
One of the things I do with all of my Linodes

21:24.000 --> 21:26.680
is I always turn on that backup, automatic backup.

21:26.680 --> 21:27.520
It's cheap.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.440
It's peace of mind.

21:28.440 --> 21:29.960
And they give you really good output

21:29.960 --> 21:31.880
on when the last backup was and all of that.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.420
It's just another way that Linode just

21:33.420 --> 21:36.080
keeps our infrastructure running and makes it possible,

21:36.080 --> 21:39.160
even with a limited team, to offer a lot of services

21:39.160 --> 21:40.240
to our audience.

21:40.240 --> 21:42.320
So check it out at linode.com slash unplugged.

21:42.320 --> 21:45.120
Support the show and get that $100 60-day credit

21:45.120 --> 21:46.200
towards a new account.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.240
And thanks to Linode for sponsoring the Unplugged

21:48.240 --> 21:51.200
program, linode.com slash unplugged.

21:51.200 --> 21:55.480
A few more bits of community news.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.600
So I want to talk about this one item

21:58.600 --> 22:00.200
just to give people some advice.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.520
And then I want to do some updates with Phil.

22:02.520 --> 22:04.680
So let's start with this one just

22:04.680 --> 22:06.280
to get this out of the way because it's bad news.

22:06.280 --> 22:09.080
And I don't want to end the new segment on bad news.

22:09.080 --> 22:11.380
LastPass, if you're still using it,

22:11.380 --> 22:12.960
has made the final changes that are

22:12.960 --> 22:14.600
going to get you to drop it now.

22:14.600 --> 22:18.720
LastPass free users must choose between mobile or desktop

22:18.720 --> 22:23.080
computers for unlimited device access starting March 16.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.600
If you want access on multiple machines, mobile and desktop,

22:26.600 --> 22:27.800
you'll have to pay.

22:27.800 --> 22:28.640
You'll have to pay.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.340
It's not an unreasonable amount right now,

22:30.340 --> 22:32.880
although I'm sure they'll eventually raise the rate.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.600
It's like $3 a year right now.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.000
But it's a pretty brute force kind of change.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.480
It's a real screw your users, we don't care about you

22:40.480 --> 22:43.120
kind of change, the kind that's going to get people really

22:43.120 --> 22:44.160
upset.

22:44.160 --> 22:47.240
And as a free user, you're going to have to log in after March

22:47.240 --> 22:49.200
16 when this change takes effect.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.680
And you're going to have to set your active device type.

22:51.680 --> 22:53.520
You're going to have three opportunities after that

22:53.520 --> 22:57.040
to switch your active device type and then lock it in.

22:57.040 --> 22:58.960
In addition to that change, email support

22:58.960 --> 23:02.720
will only be available to premium and family customers.

23:02.720 --> 23:07.120
So I thought this is a moment to sit around our lug

23:07.120 --> 23:11.040
and say, what are you doing for password management today?

23:11.040 --> 23:13.920
We've talked about Bitwarden before on the show.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.840
So I wanted to make that recommendation.

23:15.840 --> 23:20.000
You can also self-host Bitwarden, which I like a lot.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.780
Wes, I think you're a KeyPass user?

23:21.780 --> 23:23.700
I have been, although these days I'm

23:23.700 --> 23:26.480
pretty much all on Bitwarden, although I'm using

23:26.480 --> 23:28.560
one password for my work stuff.

23:28.560 --> 23:30.680
Yeah, I was going to mention that.

23:30.680 --> 23:34.040
OnePassword is not open source, but it

23:34.040 --> 23:35.960
is well-supported on Linux.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.800
They've recently just wrote a new Linux app,

23:38.800 --> 23:41.960
and it's well-supported in business and enterprise.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.120
So there is that advantage of it.

23:44.120 --> 23:48.760
Looks like KeyPassXC is getting recommended in the chat room,

23:48.760 --> 23:51.840
but a lot of people are saying they're using Bitwarden now.

23:51.840 --> 23:55.080
Pass, P-A-S-S, on the command line.

23:55.080 --> 23:59.360
The orange one uses KeyPassXC plus Next Cloud Sync and KeyPass

23:59.360 --> 24:01.240
to Android to put it all together.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.120
But I think if you are a one-password user right now,

24:04.120 --> 24:05.920
you're probably going to be a little bit more

24:05.920 --> 24:09.200
happy with Bitwarden or one-password.

24:09.200 --> 24:10.680
And that just really stinks, and I

24:10.680 --> 24:13.960
hate to see this because password hygiene is super

24:13.960 --> 24:17.160
critical to keeping your online account secure,

24:17.160 --> 24:19.560
and there could have been a better way to handle this.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.920
And they claim they wanted to let us know as soon as possible.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.280
Josh is like, OK.

24:24.280 --> 24:26.160
It's kind of funny to watch this.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.800
They were one of the pioneers, maybe not pioneers,

24:28.800 --> 24:31.840
but at least in the broader public sphere,

24:31.840 --> 24:34.360
one of the first companies to really get broad adoption

24:34.360 --> 24:36.560
of using a password manager.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.120
And now they're kind of like a weird off-brand.

24:39.120 --> 24:41.760
They're just not, you know, the value has gotten worse and worse

24:41.760 --> 24:43.840
to become more restrictive.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.120
You complain about it, I think, every week or so

24:46.120 --> 24:47.720
when you have to log in again.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.480
It's just they haven't kept up.

24:49.480 --> 24:50.360
Yeah.

24:50.360 --> 24:51.040
It's time.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.800
This Band-Aid has to be ripped off.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.040
I just hadn't really come to a conclusion on how I wanted

24:56.040 --> 24:58.040
to host my password database because

24:58.040 --> 25:00.480
of the scale of that decision.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.640
But they're making the decision for me.

25:02.640 --> 25:05.440
So I guess I don't really have a choice.

25:05.440 --> 25:10.640
And I hope they have a great day.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.440
I hope they have a great day.

25:12.440 --> 25:15.040
So let's change gears and talk about something a little more

25:15.040 --> 25:16.240
positive.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.360
Phil's back from Andrea.

25:17.360 --> 25:18.280
Phil, welcome back to the show.

25:18.280 --> 25:19.320
It's good to have you, sir.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.320
Good to be here.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.400
We're going to get our plasma on in a little bit.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.720
And I noted that your project recently

25:25.720 --> 25:27.520
did an update for plasma mobile.

25:27.520 --> 25:28.980
And I'm just curious how all of it's

25:28.980 --> 25:31.280
going with the PinePhone and plasma mobile in general.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.160
And any other updates you have for us?

25:33.160 --> 25:36.120
Well, we paired up with KDE Foundation

25:36.120 --> 25:40.360
and started to work much closer with plasma mobile and plasma

25:40.360 --> 25:41.440
in general.

25:41.440 --> 25:45.120
So we always have the latest and greatest software

25:45.120 --> 25:47.280
as we do daily Git snapshots.

25:47.280 --> 25:51.160
And you can always get a daily build PinePhone images

25:51.160 --> 25:53.920
of all our branches from GitHub now.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.160
Wow, that's great, pumping it out.

25:56.160 --> 25:59.380
And 5.21 lands with NeoChat, which

25:59.380 --> 26:01.400
we've talked a little bit on the show before,

26:01.400 --> 26:04.360
kernel 5.10.16.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.600
What else?

26:05.600 --> 26:07.160
What's new in the world of mobile?

26:07.160 --> 26:08.920
Is it anything noteworthy that we

26:08.920 --> 26:10.200
should share with the audience?

26:10.200 --> 26:14.400
Well, we managed to get the ring tone

26:14.400 --> 26:17.200
ringing on the phone on the first dial tone

26:17.200 --> 26:18.660
when you do the phosh image.

26:18.660 --> 26:19.920
So that is going on.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.280
And we're also working on the firmware.

26:22.280 --> 26:25.480
So the firmware will be replaced by a Linux kernel.

26:25.480 --> 26:28.960
So all the Qualcomm firmware getting out,

26:28.960 --> 26:30.520
and you can then replace it.

26:30.520 --> 26:33.640
So we have a really open source firmware for the hardware

26:33.640 --> 26:34.640
as well.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.600
So that's some of the things that

26:36.600 --> 26:39.120
was going on for the PinePhone in the background.

26:39.120 --> 26:40.620
Well, that's great.

26:40.620 --> 26:43.640
I saw too that shells.com recently launched.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.920
I might be talking about them more soon.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.960
And I noticed that Manjaro is on there.

26:47.960 --> 26:48.920
Tell me about this.

26:48.920 --> 26:50.680
Yeah, we partnered up with them as well.

26:50.680 --> 26:55.040
So we will ship out on lunch day KDE Plasma.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.520
Then we have XFC on GNOME.

26:57.520 --> 27:00.720
And we will do all the other additions on shells.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.640
So coming up as well to see.

27:03.640 --> 27:06.200
And the good thing is you can run it

27:06.200 --> 27:08.800
on any device which has internet access.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.240
So if your fridge has some browser feature,

27:11.240 --> 27:13.520
you can run your computer there.

27:13.520 --> 27:17.080
And some people also told me that they run it successfully

27:17.080 --> 27:19.520
on their Teslas.

27:19.520 --> 27:20.760
Teslas.

27:20.760 --> 27:21.600
OK.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.600
Yeah, so if you're not familiar, shells.com

27:24.600 --> 27:28.760
is a in the cloud virtual desktop environment

27:28.760 --> 27:31.760
that you can deploy or you can just use it

27:31.760 --> 27:33.280
from your browser, obviously.

27:33.280 --> 27:37.880
And we've talked before about cloud desktops.

27:37.880 --> 27:43.320
Being able to run Manjaro is super appealing.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.840
I wasn't going to be too surprised if they offered

27:45.840 --> 27:48.880
a Debian desktop or a CentOS or a Ubuntu.

27:48.880 --> 27:51.720
But having Manjaro on there is really great

27:51.720 --> 27:55.200
and means that people can get a really super up-to-date plasma

27:55.200 --> 27:56.840
system in the cloud.

27:56.840 --> 27:58.880
These shells.com guys should come on the show.

27:58.880 --> 27:59.760
We should talk to them.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.280
Yeah, sure.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.800
We can hook you up with them.

28:01.800 --> 28:05.120
And I think they are really interested in getting

28:05.120 --> 28:07.120
some promotion out for the new systems.

28:07.120 --> 28:11.160
And yes, and some mini PCs will come along as well

28:11.160 --> 28:12.760
because we partnered up with Beelink.

28:12.760 --> 28:16.480
And I just tweeted out some of the new devices

28:16.480 --> 28:17.720
we will support soon.

28:17.720 --> 28:19.640
Well, speaking of new stuff, all things

28:19.640 --> 28:20.840
going OK at the project?

28:20.840 --> 28:22.280
Anything new to report in general

28:22.280 --> 28:24.080
beyond just plasma mobile?

28:24.080 --> 28:25.200
Not really.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.480
We're deep in development for the phone and shells,

28:28.480 --> 28:31.160
as you told now, and other things coming up.

28:31.160 --> 28:34.960
So yeah, we have a good stride for 2021.

28:34.960 --> 28:37.360
Yeah, I don't mean to make it sound like it's not enough.

28:37.360 --> 28:39.440
It's plenty.

28:39.440 --> 28:41.760
You guys are doing plenty, so that's great to see.

28:41.760 --> 28:42.480
Well, very good.

28:42.480 --> 28:43.880
Thanks for coming on and giving us

28:43.880 --> 28:45.920
a quick update on what's going on over there.

28:45.920 --> 28:50.160
It's good to see the updates landing on the mobile device.

28:50.160 --> 28:50.720
Very good.

28:50.720 --> 28:51.240
Well, thank you, Phil.

28:51.240 --> 28:51.800
Have a good one.

28:51.800 --> 28:52.280
You too.

28:52.280 --> 28:52.780
Bye-bye.

28:52.780 --> 28:56.280
Well, Mr. Payne, a couple of things

28:56.280 --> 28:58.040
I wanted to touch on in the housekeeping.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.720
So if you'd help me just tidy up a little bit around here.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.600
First of all, I've got to mention the Telegram

29:02.600 --> 29:05.000
because I feel like Telegram's new again all of a sudden

29:05.000 --> 29:05.600
for a lot of people.

29:05.600 --> 29:07.400
And if you've recently signed up with Telegram

29:07.400 --> 29:09.760
and would like to hang out with like-minded folk,

29:09.760 --> 29:11.800
well, you can join the Jupiter Broadcasting Group

29:11.800 --> 29:15.520
at JupiterBroadcasting.com slash Telegram,

29:15.520 --> 29:17.900
where we're hanging out 24-7 and chatting.

29:17.900 --> 29:21.440
And then also, if you want to take it up one more notch,

29:21.440 --> 29:23.120
you can join the Luplug.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.440
That goes down on Sunday.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.320
Obviously, it happens right now during the show.

29:26.320 --> 29:29.520
But Sunday is the official Luplug gathering

29:29.520 --> 29:31.680
right there in the Mumble Lobby.

29:31.680 --> 29:34.600
And you can hang out with everybody and chat Linux.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.840
We have anything we should plug for the Luplug, guys?

29:36.840 --> 29:38.600
I'm a little bit in vacation mode.

29:38.600 --> 29:42.720
But we have our recording scheduled for next Sunday.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.160
I don't know if it will happen.

29:44.160 --> 29:45.920
But otherwise, it will be in a week.

29:45.920 --> 29:48.520
So if you follow the Telegram group,

29:48.520 --> 29:50.840
you will get any information about Luplug

29:50.840 --> 29:52.280
and the recording of the next show.

29:52.280 --> 29:52.880
Pow.

29:52.880 --> 29:53.160
That's right.

29:53.160 --> 29:54.580
The recording's coming up soon.

29:54.580 --> 29:56.560
We also have the matrix chat for the Luplug.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.480
And that information, links to all that stuff's

29:58.480 --> 30:00.680
at LinuxUnplugged.com.

30:00.680 --> 30:02.820
If you're looking for something to listen to,

30:02.820 --> 30:05.600
I was on the recent episode of The Opinion Dominion,

30:05.600 --> 30:09.440
chatting about the podcast markets and whatnot, episode 28.

30:09.440 --> 30:12.200
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

30:12.200 --> 30:15.880
And we get into the business end of podcasting.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.640
And let me tell you, the business end,

30:18.640 --> 30:20.240
there's a lot going on there.

30:20.240 --> 30:22.240
So that's The Opinion Dominion, episode 28,

30:22.240 --> 30:23.880
if you want to check that out.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.240
I think we did it.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.160
We are down and efficient with the tidying, Wes.

30:28.160 --> 30:28.800
We got this.

30:28.800 --> 30:28.960
Yeah.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.380
Well, I mean, once you do that, then we

30:30.380 --> 30:31.420
can have the drinks, right?

30:31.420 --> 30:31.920
Yeah.

30:31.920 --> 30:32.420
Yeah.

30:32.420 --> 30:39.820
Let's pour one and talk about Plasma 5.21, which is,

30:39.820 --> 30:41.480
this is something special, you guys.

30:41.480 --> 30:45.000
We don't always talk about the point releases here.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
But as I hope you'll come to understand

30:48.000 --> 30:52.960
at the end of this segment, the KDE Plasma team

30:52.960 --> 30:54.560
has done something special here.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.380
They've cleared another castle.

30:56.380 --> 31:07.280
This is a fantastic release.

31:07.280 --> 31:10.760
This is a benchmark for free software releases.

31:10.760 --> 31:13.960
And look, I really enjoy Gnome Shell still these days.

31:13.960 --> 31:17.160
On my single monitor gaming setup, it is choice.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.240
It's great.

31:18.240 --> 31:21.680
I am in my happy place, playing with my machine,

31:21.680 --> 31:23.440
using Gnome Shell.

31:23.440 --> 31:26.720
I'm even down to give 40 a good go.

31:26.720 --> 31:30.120
But Plasma, that's my workhorse.

31:30.120 --> 31:35.360
Plasma is becoming the ultimate professional workstation.

31:35.360 --> 31:40.400
And it's getting better and faster while doing it.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.560
There's so much we could talk about in 5.21.

31:43.560 --> 31:47.040
I could spend the entire show talking about 5.21.

31:47.040 --> 31:48.840
And it probably deserves it.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.600
But a couple of things that are worth mentioning,

31:51.600 --> 31:53.360
the new app launcher is great.

31:53.360 --> 31:55.520
I have it installed right here because I'm on Neon.

31:55.520 --> 31:58.240
And they've nailed it.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.120
I'm so proud of them.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.200
I'm so happy with this.

32:00.200 --> 32:02.460
They have really, really nailed this.

32:02.460 --> 32:03.360
And it looks great.

32:03.360 --> 32:04.120
It's functional.

32:04.120 --> 32:06.240
It looks beautiful in dark mode.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.800
You know, the old one, I kind of just ignored, honestly,

32:08.800 --> 32:10.760
especially since KRunner also exists.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.760
But yeah, the new version, I think

32:13.760 --> 32:15.200
I might actually start using.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.840
KRunner's had some improvements too.

32:16.840 --> 32:18.240
They have the new system monitor.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.040
They have that new Breeze Twilight,

32:20.040 --> 32:21.440
which is an interesting idea.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.400
If you like a dark plasma theme, but you

32:24.400 --> 32:27.480
want your applications to be light themed, that's what it does.

32:27.480 --> 32:31.400
There's a lot in here, including new firewall settings,

32:31.400 --> 32:34.640
Discover supporting unattended updates, improvements

32:34.640 --> 32:36.240
in most of the applets.

32:36.240 --> 32:38.040
What they, I feel like, have achieved here,

32:38.040 --> 32:40.280
Wayland support, what I feel like they have achieved here

32:40.280 --> 32:43.760
is like a line in the sand.

32:43.760 --> 32:48.200
With 5.21, this is a new grade of professional workstation

32:48.200 --> 32:49.680
desktop environment.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.000
And it's just really well-refined.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.340
Has anybody in the Mumble Room had a chance to look at this?

32:54.340 --> 32:56.480
Of course.

32:56.480 --> 32:57.880
What are your thoughts?

32:57.880 --> 33:01.120
I think that with Plasma 5.21, we

33:01.120 --> 33:06.480
have reached a point where I feel genuinely very comfortable

33:06.480 --> 33:10.480
with saying that Plasma is something

33:10.480 --> 33:14.760
that I am willing to recommend by default to people,

33:14.760 --> 33:18.040
rather than feeling a little bit like I

33:18.040 --> 33:21.060
need to wait to see if they don't like the GNOME desktop

33:21.060 --> 33:23.320
experience before going to Plasma,

33:23.320 --> 33:25.960
because it seems to have that polish.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.400
It seems to have that integration.

33:28.400 --> 33:29.960
They're taking paper cuts seriously.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.680
They're doing a great job with the Wayland stuff

33:32.680 --> 33:36.880
to make it so that the experience is smooth and competitive

33:36.880 --> 33:39.960
with Windows and Mac OS.

33:39.960 --> 33:42.120
And really, the remainder bits are,

33:42.120 --> 33:43.540
what do you do for integration?

33:43.540 --> 33:46.600
How do you handle things like preloading and stuff like that?

33:46.600 --> 33:48.400
And those will all come with time.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.620
But the fact that the desktop itself,

33:50.620 --> 33:56.040
that the core experience is now so solid and so well thought

33:56.040 --> 33:58.360
out, I'm blown away at how well it is.

33:58.360 --> 34:01.120
Like, it's come a long way since when I first

34:01.120 --> 34:04.880
switched to KDE Plasma back in 2013,

34:04.880 --> 34:08.520
after just suffering for a couple of years in GNOME 3

34:08.520 --> 34:10.600
and not being able to deal with the workflow.

34:14.200 --> 34:20.040
That vision from when the first KDE Plasma active stuff

34:20.040 --> 34:24.240
and all that stuff back then in the KDE 4 era, that vision,

34:24.240 --> 34:29.480
I feel, has finally started to be properly realized.

34:29.480 --> 34:33.680
Yeah, to me, it's not a good Linux desktop environment.

34:33.680 --> 34:37.680
It's a good desktop environment, period, for any platform.

34:37.680 --> 34:40.400
And the other thing that I feel like I get with Plasma

34:40.400 --> 34:43.080
to a degree that I don't quite get with GNOME Shell

34:43.080 --> 34:45.360
is true distribution independence.

34:45.360 --> 34:48.420
I can have any distro I want under the hood,

34:48.420 --> 34:51.000
and I get a great Plasma experience.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.280
I can get there, absolutely, with GNOME Shell.

34:54.280 --> 34:57.120
But there's POP's version of GNOME Shell.

34:57.120 --> 34:58.160
There's Ubuntu's version.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.520
There's Fedora's version.

34:59.520 --> 35:02.640
And each of those is a very unique starting point

35:02.640 --> 35:04.360
for building up the GNOME Shell.

35:04.360 --> 35:08.680
And with Plasma, it's like it's just

35:08.680 --> 35:10.160
feels more independent, right?

35:10.160 --> 35:12.360
Yeah, for better or for worse, it feels more independent.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.080
And Wes, I think part of what appeals to me now, too,

35:15.080 --> 35:18.640
is the track record that we're seeing from the project.

35:18.640 --> 35:21.560
Yeah, they've really hit a certain stride.

35:21.560 --> 35:24.680
We've gotten some great updates from Nate Graham's blogging

35:24.680 --> 35:25.820
around this.

35:25.820 --> 35:28.080
And it just feels like it's in a healthy state,

35:28.080 --> 35:30.520
especially with a lot of these whaling improvements

35:30.520 --> 35:32.640
finally addressed, that you can just

35:32.640 --> 35:35.360
count on Plasma being there for you in the future.

35:35.360 --> 35:36.760
Yeah, and you know it's just likely

35:36.760 --> 35:38.440
going to get better and better.

35:38.440 --> 35:42.320
If there is a regression, they've addressed it quickly.

35:42.320 --> 35:44.440
We were looking just before the show,

35:44.440 --> 35:46.840
and I can't remember the exact date.

35:46.840 --> 35:47.760
Oh, yeah, I do.

35:47.760 --> 35:52.860
It was January 29, 2018 is when we installed this Neon

35:52.860 --> 35:55.100
workstation that I'm sitting in front of right now.

35:55.100 --> 35:57.680
And I have updated it at least at a minimum

35:57.680 --> 36:02.680
twice a week since January 29, 2018 with few exceptions.

36:02.680 --> 36:07.240
And I've gone through a different base OS

36:07.240 --> 36:09.680
and many, many Plasma releases.

36:09.680 --> 36:12.480
And in every single release, I have noted something

36:12.480 --> 36:16.080
that I have liked about that upgrade every single time,

36:16.080 --> 36:19.120
every upgrade since 2018.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.240
Sometimes there are a few regressions,

36:21.240 --> 36:23.980
especially if you're riding the Neon edge there.

36:23.980 --> 36:26.700
But those always come with other improvements.

36:26.700 --> 36:28.360
And I think, really, the track record

36:28.360 --> 36:31.720
has been borne out that they get fixed pretty quickly.

36:31.720 --> 36:34.760
I can't think of a lot of niggling little Plasma

36:34.760 --> 36:37.800
issues that have hung around and kept bothering me on Neon.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.200
They kind of just go away.

36:39.200 --> 36:43.320
Yeah, I really do agree with CM in the chat room.

36:43.320 --> 36:46.240
It is the ideal desktop environment

36:46.240 --> 36:48.680
for a distro hopper.

36:48.680 --> 36:52.280
I now run Plasma on, currently, just out of my current mix,

36:52.280 --> 36:56.600
I run it on Ubuntu, I run it on Arch, and I run it on Fedora.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.640
And I run it on different versions of Arch,

36:58.640 --> 37:00.520
and I run it on different versions of Ubuntu,

37:00.520 --> 37:02.840
and I run it on the latest Fedora.

37:02.840 --> 37:06.720
And it's still the same Plasma, still the same window rules.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.760
Everything's, I mean, it's really great.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.560
It is really great, a tool like that.

37:11.560 --> 37:14.000
And I don't know why I don't have that same quite sensation

37:14.000 --> 37:16.840
with GNOME Shell, other than the distro makers generally

37:16.840 --> 37:18.320
just customize it more.

37:18.320 --> 37:19.960
Yeah, well, and it does almost feel like there

37:19.960 --> 37:21.440
are some different use cases.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.240
I think you touched on it there.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.000
And my systems are somewhat the same.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.120
I've got a distro set up for just sort of gaming,

37:28.120 --> 37:31.440
casual use, and GNOME or Pop works really well there.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.560
But when I want things to get out of my way,

37:33.560 --> 37:36.320
when I want to be configurable, the machine I'm using right now

37:36.320 --> 37:39.040
for the live show, that's going to be Plasma.

37:39.040 --> 37:41.160
And I don't see that changing anytime soon.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.400
Where I'm really finding GNOME Shell's working super well

37:43.400 --> 37:46.560
for me is that single monitor laptop setup.

37:46.560 --> 37:48.920
And the one that I'm using for gaming right now,

37:48.920 --> 37:50.760
that G14 that I talked about recently,

37:50.760 --> 37:52.160
that's really a sweet spot for me.

37:52.160 --> 37:54.240
And I think for my son, we were talking

37:54.240 --> 37:56.440
about giving him a new machine last episode.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.600
I think for him, and probably because I'll then hand down

37:59.600 --> 38:01.520
his machine and down to the younger,

38:01.520 --> 38:03.960
each kid gets a machine iteration essentially.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.920
When I do that, I think all of them

38:05.920 --> 38:08.880
will probably be on GNOME Shell still.

38:08.880 --> 38:11.000
I don't think I'm going to change it for them,

38:11.000 --> 38:14.920
because they're using the computer somewhat for homework,

38:14.920 --> 38:16.920
but their school gives them Chromebooks for that.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.440
They're really using it for play.

38:19.440 --> 38:22.400
And if you have a more casual relationship

38:22.400 --> 38:25.400
with your computer, I think GNOME Shell's perfect for it.

38:25.400 --> 38:25.720
Right.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.100
It's sort of that area of, do the defaults

38:28.100 --> 38:29.280
work really nicely for you?

38:29.280 --> 38:31.060
Or do you have specific use cases

38:31.060 --> 38:32.640
where you need more tunability?

38:32.640 --> 38:33.680
And most of the time, no.

38:33.680 --> 38:36.480
But when you do, that's where Plasma really shines.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.680
Yeah, and in a way, Wes, it lets me mentally context shift.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.960
So when I'm on the GNOME desktop,

38:41.960 --> 38:43.120
well, that's my play time.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.240
That's off work time.

38:44.240 --> 38:45.640
That's playing games.

38:45.640 --> 38:49.360
Maybe I don't have my work chat installed on that system.

38:49.360 --> 38:53.080
And then when I am in work mode, I'm in Plasma.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.760
And so in a way, it gives me a bit of a context shift

38:56.760 --> 39:00.680
that I otherwise wouldn't get between personal life and work.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.960
For me, it also sort of means I fuss less with the GNOME setup.

39:03.960 --> 39:06.720
I just let it be GNOME, or POP, or whatever it is over there,

39:06.720 --> 39:08.360
and don't install too many extensions.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.520
Don't try to fight customization there,

39:10.520 --> 39:12.240
because I have that outlet in Plasma.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.200
Totally.

39:13.200 --> 39:13.680
Totally.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.360
That has been the same for me, too.

39:15.360 --> 39:16.600
That has been totally the same.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.160
It's just a few extensions.

39:19.160 --> 39:20.520
I do have Discord installed, but I

39:20.520 --> 39:22.440
don't have any other chat programs installed.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.080
So I'm not getting notifications when I'm

39:24.080 --> 39:25.720
in the middle of doing something.

39:25.720 --> 39:26.920
That's worked out really good.

39:26.920 --> 39:30.040
And you could replicate that on one box.

39:30.040 --> 39:31.680
That doesn't have to be separate boxes.

39:31.680 --> 39:34.760
It could be you have both Plasma and GNOME shell installed,

39:34.760 --> 39:37.840
and you'd log out and log back in when you're done for the day.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.120
Absolutely.

39:40.120 --> 39:43.640
Anyways, 5.21 is super, super great.

39:43.640 --> 39:45.360
I invited Nate Graham on to talk about it,

39:45.360 --> 39:46.440
but he's really busy today.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.600
So we may get him on in the future to talk about it.

39:48.600 --> 39:49.840
But this is the release.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.680
This is the one that you want to try out.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.040
If you've been thinking about trying it

39:54.040 --> 39:56.400
when we talked about it, it's just super good.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.640
And I just want to give the project a ton of props,

39:58.640 --> 40:02.120
because I think this is probably one

40:02.120 --> 40:04.520
of the best examples of free software development.

40:04.520 --> 40:07.320
When you want to talk about innovation,

40:07.320 --> 40:08.960
look at what this project is doing,

40:08.960 --> 40:11.040
the features they're bringing that other desktops have never

40:11.040 --> 40:12.440
even thought about, and then just

40:12.440 --> 40:15.040
the continued pace of iteration.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.080
They lost one of their own to COVID recently,

40:17.080 --> 40:18.880
and this release is dedicated to them.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.640
And they kept going as a team.

40:20.640 --> 40:23.840
And I think this is a release they should be super proud of.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.880
So congratulations, guys.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.840
Your job is well done.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.920
You deserve a release party for this one.

40:29.920 --> 40:45.440
And honestly, I'm looking forward to seeing GNOME 40.

40:45.440 --> 40:47.280
That's going to be a lot of fun to try out, too.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.280
It just makes me happy in general.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.400
We've got multiple great desktops.

40:51.400 --> 40:54.440
The Wayland work is coming along really nicely

40:54.440 --> 40:56.200
in all kinds of areas.

40:56.200 --> 40:58.800
It's just a good time to be a desktop Linux user.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.200
Yeah, absolutely.

41:00.200 --> 41:04.640
Datadog.com slash unplug.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.760
This episode right here is brought to you by Datadog,

41:06.760 --> 41:09.560
the unified monitoring and analytics platform that

41:09.560 --> 41:13.320
gives you comprehensive visibility into your cloud.

41:13.320 --> 41:15.000
If you have a hybrid setup or if you

41:15.000 --> 41:16.440
have multiple cloud environments.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.640
I mean, I'm talking about full stack monitoring.

41:19.640 --> 41:23.080
This is make important business decisions monitoring.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.440
Data about your entire stack monitoring.

41:25.440 --> 41:28.480
Quickly analyze the performance of your Linux servers.

41:28.480 --> 41:29.160
Go in deep.

41:29.160 --> 41:32.400
Get real-time, customizable dashboards

41:32.400 --> 41:35.240
that will update and show you exactly what you want to see.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.840
Have a dashboard for troubleshooting issues.

41:37.840 --> 41:39.360
Trace something down in seconds.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.080
Think about it.

41:40.080 --> 41:41.620
You could build a beautiful dashboard

41:41.620 --> 41:43.120
because these dashboards are gorgeous.

41:43.120 --> 41:46.200
Check out datadog.com slash unplug just

41:46.200 --> 41:48.160
to see the dashboard because they are great.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.040
But think about this.

41:49.040 --> 41:51.480
You could build a real-time dashboard that pulls in data

41:51.480 --> 41:55.120
from your application logs, your system logs,

41:55.120 --> 41:57.440
has performance traces in there, and you

41:57.440 --> 42:00.080
can get a snapshot of the health and performance

42:00.080 --> 42:03.440
of this application stack or your entire infrastructure.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.960
That is really useful.

42:04.960 --> 42:07.080
And you can build graphs for over time.

42:07.080 --> 42:09.680
You can go and get information from containers themselves.

42:09.680 --> 42:11.920
They recently rewrote their agent in Go,

42:11.920 --> 42:13.360
so it's really simple to deploy.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.840
You install it on a Linux box.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.380
You can get all kinds of information.

42:16.380 --> 42:18.560
They have multiple ways to monitor, too.

42:18.560 --> 42:20.240
But you just got to get started by going

42:20.240 --> 42:22.520
to datadog.com slash unplugged.

42:22.520 --> 42:23.760
Start a free trial.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.460
Create one dashboard.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.840
And then you get a free Datadog t-shirt.

42:27.840 --> 42:31.480
That's all you got to do, just datadog.com slash unplugged,

42:31.480 --> 42:33.960
free trial, a dashboard, t-shirt.

42:33.960 --> 42:34.840
Pow.

42:34.840 --> 42:37.340
And you get to see what I've been talking about, just really

42:37.340 --> 42:38.600
beautiful analytics.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.620
You could communicate with other team members

42:40.620 --> 42:41.960
about what's going on with.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.720
That's what's so super valuable at Datadog.

42:43.720 --> 42:47.520
You got to check it out, datadog.com slash unplugged.

42:47.520 --> 42:52.260
I have a wee spot of follow up for us.

42:52.260 --> 42:55.880
We talked about a SATA enclosure a couple of episodes

42:55.880 --> 43:01.480
ago where you put an MVME style M.2 SATA disk in there.

43:01.480 --> 43:04.280
And then it's essentially a big fat USB stick,

43:04.280 --> 43:05.600
but you get MVME speeds.

43:05.600 --> 43:06.680
Right.

43:06.680 --> 43:10.400
Wes, Wes, you got to get one of these.

43:10.400 --> 43:14.240
This is, this is, I highly recommend this.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.440
It's that good?

43:15.440 --> 43:16.600
You're this excited?

43:16.600 --> 43:18.480
It's really good.

43:18.480 --> 43:21.720
This is going to be a game changer for me, because just,

43:21.720 --> 43:24.760
if it was just the improvement of how fricking fast you

43:24.760 --> 43:28.800
can copy ISOs over to it, I'd be like, it's worth it.

43:28.800 --> 43:32.160
But it is a game changer for the live environment.

43:32.160 --> 43:33.920
It is completely responsive.

43:33.920 --> 43:36.080
It is, I mean, it's just, it's got

43:36.080 --> 43:39.360
to be like near the best case you could ever get from USB 3.0.

43:39.360 --> 43:40.800
It is so fantastic, Wes.

43:40.800 --> 43:43.440
And you know, with Ventoy on there, it's,

43:43.440 --> 43:45.880
the combo is so nuts.

43:45.880 --> 43:47.960
That's what I was just thinking about, like, oh,

43:47.960 --> 43:48.920
that sounds perfect.

43:48.920 --> 43:49.600
Yes.

43:49.600 --> 43:52.080
So that's what I have done is I threw Ventoy on there,

43:52.080 --> 43:55.460
and then I have the big partition, which I reformatted.

43:55.460 --> 43:57.960
So this thing's only 256 gigs, but for ISO images,

43:57.960 --> 43:59.280
I mean, come on, right?

43:59.280 --> 44:00.400
And it's, I think, all in.

44:00.400 --> 44:02.640
It's like, I'm under $100 for this whole setup.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.640
Anyways, so I throw Ventoy on there.

44:04.640 --> 44:10.000
I reformat the big ISO partition to XF from, what is it,

44:10.000 --> 44:11.960
originally, Wes, like fat something?

44:11.960 --> 44:13.880
Yeah, fat or, oh, ex-fat.

44:13.880 --> 44:14.880
Yeah, that's what it is.

44:14.880 --> 44:15.940
Ex-fat, OK.

44:15.940 --> 44:17.960
Anyways, I reformatted that sucker right away

44:17.960 --> 44:19.320
to extended 4.

44:19.320 --> 44:22.200
Debated butter FS, but just opted to keep it simple.

44:22.200 --> 44:23.280
Keep it simple, sure.

44:23.280 --> 44:25.280
Went to extended 4 on there.

44:25.280 --> 44:27.280
And so you plug that into your Linux desktop.

44:27.280 --> 44:28.960
You mount it, and then it just shows up.

44:28.960 --> 44:31.800
It doesn't, the Ventoy stuff side, you just ignore that.

44:31.800 --> 44:33.640
And you throw the ISOs on there.

44:33.640 --> 44:38.080
And then when you boot off that, it just is lightning fast.

44:38.080 --> 44:40.520
And the combination of an enclosure

44:40.520 --> 44:46.160
that's like a big thumb drive, but with maximum USB 3 speed,

44:46.160 --> 44:50.120
it makes booting ISOs just so much smoother, so much faster.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.760
And if you do that a lot, if you're a distro hopper,

44:52.760 --> 44:54.300
or you're doing tech support, or you

44:54.300 --> 44:56.300
need to have multiple ISOs you carry around,

44:56.300 --> 44:57.440
you've got to do this.

44:57.440 --> 44:59.400
Take Ventoy, take it off the USB stick,

44:59.400 --> 45:00.640
and put it on this enclosure.

45:00.640 --> 45:02.140
I'll have a link in the show notes.

45:02.140 --> 45:05.080
If I could make this as a swag product and sell it, I would.

45:05.080 --> 45:06.600
That's how much I like this thing.

45:06.600 --> 45:09.480
I would love to have a JB branded one of these

45:09.480 --> 45:10.280
that you could buy.

45:10.280 --> 45:12.640
It comes with Chris's hand-picked ISOs.

45:12.640 --> 45:14.160
Yeah.

45:14.160 --> 45:17.000
Wouldn't that be great?

45:17.000 --> 45:20.840
I just put the latest Manjaro Gnome Spin on there.

45:20.840 --> 45:25.440
And it's just such a great way to experience the desktop.

45:25.440 --> 45:28.720
So I just wanted to give that little bit of a follow up

45:28.720 --> 45:30.720
from just a couple episodes ago.

45:30.720 --> 45:35.760
And we do have a little bit of feedback to get to.

45:35.760 --> 45:40.080
And we wanted to start with some ARCH upgrade tips.

45:40.080 --> 45:42.520
This one comes from, I'm going to say Omni,

45:42.520 --> 45:43.720
because that's a great name.

45:43.720 --> 45:45.840
I heard you and Wes were upgrading your ARCH server

45:45.840 --> 45:48.160
a couple of weeks ago, and that you were considering

45:48.160 --> 45:49.720
giving ARCH to your son.

45:49.720 --> 45:51.480
May I recommend a package from the AUR

45:51.480 --> 45:54.480
to remove most, if not all, upgrade uncertainties

45:54.480 --> 45:55.540
with ARCH?

45:55.540 --> 45:57.200
It's called Informant.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.360
And as you know, ARCH officially requires

45:59.360 --> 46:01.440
you to read its news before you upgrade.

46:01.440 --> 46:04.100
It is on you to go read the news.

46:04.100 --> 46:05.640
There may be manual intervention,

46:05.640 --> 46:07.120
and that's where they're going to tell you about it.

46:07.120 --> 46:09.900
But it's a pain in the neck to do that every time you upgrade,

46:09.900 --> 46:12.800
which, if you're like some of us, is 10 times a day,

46:12.800 --> 46:13.600
he says.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.760
Well, Informant installs a Pac-Man hook

46:15.760 --> 46:19.300
such that when there is news, it won't upgrade

46:19.300 --> 46:22.680
until you apply the required manual intervention

46:22.680 --> 46:25.200
and then mark the news as read.

46:25.200 --> 46:28.120
And it's just an AUR install away.

46:28.120 --> 46:29.600
So I put that on my box right away.

46:29.600 --> 46:31.400
I know we've kind of talked about this before.

46:31.400 --> 46:32.320
Wes, you ever tried it?

46:32.320 --> 46:33.440
No, you know, I haven't.

46:33.440 --> 46:36.280
I've sort of relied on my hopefulness

46:36.280 --> 46:39.120
that I'll check before upgrading or have the skill

46:39.120 --> 46:42.000
to figure out if I don't do that and fix

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
whatever is wrong by then eventually reading the blog.

46:45.000 --> 46:45.900
That's worked OK.

46:45.900 --> 46:49.220
But this seems maybe ideal for a case

46:49.220 --> 46:51.840
where you're providing support and you just want to say,

46:51.840 --> 46:53.120
all right, Delamuul, if you run into this,

46:53.120 --> 46:54.940
I mean, if he's not comfortable doing it,

46:54.940 --> 46:57.200
that's a perfect sign to go call dad.

46:57.200 --> 47:01.160
That was your humble brag way of saying, I follow the news.

47:01.160 --> 47:03.280
Sometimes.

47:03.280 --> 47:05.560
No, but you're right, it is great.

47:05.560 --> 47:07.640
That's probably a good, solid thing to have on the server,

47:07.640 --> 47:09.940
just to remind us, since we don't upgrade it frequently,

47:09.940 --> 47:13.320
and definitely for a laptop for like a kid or myself.

47:13.320 --> 47:14.840
I put it on my box because why not?

47:14.840 --> 47:16.400
You know, just see how it goes.

47:16.400 --> 47:19.240
Do you want to take Frank the Tank's email?

47:19.240 --> 47:20.880
Yes, I mean, we've got some great names

47:20.880 --> 47:21.760
writing into us today.

47:21.760 --> 47:24.480
Frank the Tank had a similar take

47:24.480 --> 47:27.840
on thoughts for Arch on the laptop of Dylan.

47:27.840 --> 47:30.680
And he points us to some comments back from October,

47:30.680 --> 47:34.200
pointing to issues with NVIDIA drivers and kernels

47:34.200 --> 47:36.680
greater than 5.9.

47:36.680 --> 47:39.160
Mostly to say, you really should probably

47:39.160 --> 47:40.880
consider the LTS kernel.

47:40.880 --> 47:42.280
There might be changes, especially

47:42.280 --> 47:44.540
if you're using something like NVIDIA graphics, which

47:44.540 --> 47:47.260
I think on that laptop you are.

47:47.260 --> 47:49.560
Those two systems don't always play nicely.

47:49.560 --> 47:51.960
So either choose a distro that's not going to get into this,

47:51.960 --> 47:56.040
or try to find the bits of stability that you can in Arch.

47:56.040 --> 48:00.240
I think that's solved now with the latest kernel.

48:00.240 --> 48:02.800
That whole, remember that whole GPL condom-inspired issue?

48:02.800 --> 48:04.480
I think that's pretty much resolved now.

48:04.480 --> 48:07.120
But it's a good note, Frank, that it

48:07.120 --> 48:10.120
is another example of the kind of thing that

48:10.120 --> 48:12.880
can come up that the LTS kernel will steer you away from.

48:12.880 --> 48:15.920
Right, and you're just going to be on that cutting edge

48:15.920 --> 48:16.400
right there.

48:16.400 --> 48:18.020
Because yeah, sure, this one is solved.

48:18.020 --> 48:21.640
But there very well could be future problems like this.

48:21.640 --> 48:24.360
Not that they're huge problems, but just that they

48:24.360 --> 48:25.560
do have to get figured out.

48:25.560 --> 48:26.780
It can take some time.

48:26.780 --> 48:29.080
And if you don't follow the latest kernel development,

48:29.080 --> 48:31.540
maybe you don't listen to Linux Unplugged for some reason,

48:31.540 --> 48:33.720
then you might run into issues that you just

48:33.720 --> 48:34.640
don't want to deal with.

48:34.640 --> 48:36.040
Don't listen to Unplugged.

48:36.040 --> 48:36.880
Come on.

48:36.880 --> 48:38.360
Come on.

48:38.360 --> 48:40.320
That's not happening.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.680
All right, we have one pick this week.

48:42.680 --> 48:45.120
And I didn't even warn you about this one, Wes.

48:45.120 --> 48:47.160
But you were chatting about it.

48:47.160 --> 48:50.280
And I just grabbed it from our chat conversation

48:50.280 --> 48:53.060
and threw it in here because, man, this looks really cool.

48:53.060 --> 48:54.760
And I would love you to explain it to me.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.600
It's called Sonobus.

48:56.600 --> 49:01.240
And the subheadline is, it's a high quality network audio

49:01.240 --> 49:02.680
streaming system.

49:02.680 --> 49:03.560
That's all I know.

49:03.560 --> 49:07.480
Yeah, this looks like a tool that we might want to adopt.

49:07.480 --> 49:10.320
So it's open source, easy to use,

49:10.320 --> 49:12.080
runs as just an application.

49:12.080 --> 49:14.440
You can get it on iOS even, or Mac, or Windows,

49:14.440 --> 49:18.440
or they've got instructions for building it on Linux.

49:18.440 --> 49:21.360
You can even run it as a VST if you want.

49:21.360 --> 49:23.240
And it's kind of like some of the software

49:23.240 --> 49:26.040
we're using already to talk right now for the show.

49:26.040 --> 49:27.120
But runs as an application.

49:27.120 --> 49:28.040
It's open source.

49:28.040 --> 49:30.200
And you don't have to rely on a hosted service.

49:30.200 --> 49:32.500
Oh, you mean we could do it for real time chat?

49:32.500 --> 49:33.000
Yes.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.400
And if you take a look, it's got a really neat UI.

49:36.400 --> 49:38.480
It shows all the different tracks in there.

49:38.480 --> 49:40.200
It gives you some waveform previews.

49:40.200 --> 49:41.160
It's got recording.

49:41.160 --> 49:43.880
One thing I haven't figured out is if it's got local recording

49:43.880 --> 49:44.800
yet, that'll be next.

49:44.800 --> 49:46.860
But it's got Opus integrated right in there,

49:46.860 --> 49:50.040
configurability around what kind of bit rates you're sending.

49:50.040 --> 49:52.480
And then it does just direct peer-to-peer streaming.

49:52.480 --> 49:55.160
So perhaps future episodes of this here show

49:55.160 --> 49:57.800
could be recorded using such a thing.

49:57.800 --> 49:59.300
They've also got some nice docs too.

49:59.300 --> 50:01.000
So whether you're trying to record a podcast,

50:01.000 --> 50:03.280
or maybe you're in a band and you miss hanging out

50:03.280 --> 50:05.520
and playing with your bandmates, they've

50:05.520 --> 50:07.260
got some good docs for getting this set up.

50:07.260 --> 50:08.760
And I think the biggest thing to me

50:08.760 --> 50:10.760
is that they do have those docs.

50:10.760 --> 50:15.160
They've got binaries available for Mac, Windows, and iOS.

50:15.160 --> 50:18.400
That goes a long way, because sure, we've all got Linux.

50:18.400 --> 50:20.840
We're comfortable building things from a Git repository.

50:20.840 --> 50:24.740
But when you add on that to the already sometimes complex

50:24.740 --> 50:28.440
nature of getting audio set up for non-technical users,

50:28.440 --> 50:31.760
you just want it to be as plug and play as possible.

50:31.760 --> 50:33.920
And Sonobus looks like a great fit.

50:33.920 --> 50:36.640
Yeah, check it out at sonobus.net.

50:36.640 --> 50:38.720
And of course, we'll have a link in the show notes.

50:38.720 --> 50:41.920
If you've got a cool app, or an email, or feedback

50:41.920 --> 50:43.560
that you'd like to share with us,

50:43.560 --> 50:45.520
anything we've talked about is fair game.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.800
We'd love to get your feedbacks, and your show ideas,

50:47.800 --> 50:48.880
and questions for the show.

50:48.880 --> 50:51.720
In fact, we're kicking around an email that was sent into the show

50:51.720 --> 50:52.200
this week.

50:52.200 --> 50:54.480
And we're holding it right now, because we're

50:54.480 --> 50:56.560
thinking maybe we'll just base an entire episode

50:56.560 --> 50:57.120
off that email.

50:57.120 --> 50:57.920
It's possible, too.

50:57.920 --> 50:59.520
So we'd love to get your feedback

50:59.520 --> 51:03.920
at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

51:03.920 --> 51:06.000
I also want to thank our members who

51:06.000 --> 51:09.320
have supported the Unplugged show with their contributions.

51:09.320 --> 51:12.600
The Unplugged core is at unpluggedcore.com.

51:12.600 --> 51:14.920
And you can become a core contributor,

51:14.920 --> 51:18.680
help keep this show independent for as long as this is a show,

51:18.680 --> 51:20.280
and you reduce the amount of ads we

51:20.280 --> 51:21.640
need to make the show profitable.

51:21.640 --> 51:24.600
But you get some perks, too, as a thank you.

51:24.600 --> 51:26.020
When you become a core contributor,

51:26.020 --> 51:28.040
you get access to two feeds, your choice,

51:28.040 --> 51:31.160
the limited ad version of the show, same production,

51:31.160 --> 51:34.880
just limited ads, or the full live stream,

51:34.880 --> 51:36.920
where you'll actually hear us reformatting

51:36.920 --> 51:41.600
this show a little bit in real time on today's pre-show.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.220
And you get a lot more of that, too.

51:43.220 --> 51:44.880
That's in the second feed.

51:44.880 --> 51:46.800
You know, we don't say this often, Wes,

51:46.800 --> 51:50.440
but it's also the best way to get the show immediately.

51:50.440 --> 51:53.720
Because Wes and I hustle after we get off the air

51:53.720 --> 51:56.600
to get the full live stream published.

51:56.600 --> 51:58.640
So that way, if you can't make it,

51:58.640 --> 52:00.920
but you want to get the show for a Tuesday evening commute

52:00.920 --> 52:03.360
or something like that, that's another good reason

52:03.360 --> 52:04.160
to become a member.

52:04.160 --> 52:08.320
Because we give it our best to get the full live feed

52:08.320 --> 52:10.840
published as soon as we can after the show.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.960
It's not immediate, but we do our best.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.480
You can get that at unpluggedcore.com.

52:14.480 --> 52:17.360
And thanks to everybody who does support the show.

52:17.360 --> 52:18.600
We appreciate you.

52:18.600 --> 52:19.640
We really do.

52:19.640 --> 52:22.360
And don't forget about the coder, the coder.shop.

52:22.360 --> 52:25.640
It's Jupiter Broadcasting's first swag item in like forever.

52:25.640 --> 52:28.920
And you can get that at the coder.shop.

52:28.920 --> 52:30.760
Clear room in the closet, Mr. Payne.

52:30.760 --> 52:32.280
Yours is on the way.

52:32.280 --> 52:34.720
Oh, boy.

52:34.720 --> 52:35.520
OK.

52:35.520 --> 52:38.040
If you do the Twitter thing, you can follow this show

52:38.040 --> 52:39.040
at Linux Unplugged.

52:39.040 --> 52:41.160
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

52:41.160 --> 52:44.560
And all of the great shows, you can find more of them

52:44.560 --> 52:46.600
at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

52:46.600 --> 52:49.220
Self-hosted's coming out later this week.

52:49.220 --> 52:53.320
And Alex shares a super cool file manager web-based app

52:53.320 --> 52:57.240
that you can self-host that I wish I would have found first.

52:57.240 --> 52:59.800
But that'll be in self-hosted and a lot more

52:59.800 --> 53:01.120
at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

53:01.120 --> 53:02.580
And everything we talked about today

53:02.580 --> 53:04.840
is at Linux Unplugged, LinuxUnplugged.com

53:04.840 --> 53:06.880
slash 393 for our links.

53:06.880 --> 53:08.880
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

53:08.880 --> 53:10.120
of The Unplugged Program.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.440
And I'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

53:12.440 --> 53:17.080
Oh

53:42.440 --> 53:53.800
JBtitles.com.

53:53.800 --> 53:57.760
So I tried out enlightenment really briefly last week.

53:57.760 --> 53:58.760
What?

53:58.760 --> 53:59.760
Sneaky.

53:59.760 --> 54:04.920
You know what I thought would be great is my center monitor stays on one workspace and

54:04.920 --> 54:08.240
then separate workspaces for my two edge monitors.

54:08.240 --> 54:12.000
I just wanted two so I could have like a business side, you know, so I could just flip between

54:12.000 --> 54:20.320
them, but had to hard bail, hard, hard bail on enlightenment because first of all, I have

54:20.320 --> 54:24.440
this horrible thing where my monitor assignment when you first log into a graphical desktop

54:24.440 --> 54:25.440
is all crazy.

54:25.440 --> 54:29.020
My desktop is the wrong orientation because I have two vertical screens.

54:29.020 --> 54:30.520
The monitors are all out of order.

54:30.520 --> 54:32.520
The wrong primary screen is always set.

54:32.520 --> 54:34.560
I mean, it's real bad.

54:34.560 --> 54:37.600
It's one of the reasons why I had to get off Gnome Shell on that box because every time

54:37.600 --> 54:41.720
I'd wake up from sleep, I would reorder all of my screens and even an X-Ranger script

54:41.720 --> 54:43.680
could only do so much for me.

54:43.680 --> 54:46.000
So I have not had that problem with plasma.

54:46.000 --> 54:47.000
So I log into enlightenment.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.680
I'm like, oh, right.

54:49.680 --> 54:53.160
Here's the thing, though, guys, and I would just I just installed enlightenment from from

54:53.160 --> 54:54.160
arch.

54:54.160 --> 54:56.080
So it's, you know, whatever is in arch is repo.

54:56.080 --> 54:57.080
Wow.

54:57.080 --> 55:01.200
The display manager, it doesn't have a graphical layout for arranging your screens.

55:01.200 --> 55:03.500
Like you have to say this monitor is left of this monitor.

55:03.500 --> 55:04.760
This monitor is right of this monitor.

55:04.760 --> 55:05.760
This monitor set.

55:05.760 --> 55:09.320
And then it doesn't identify which monitors it thinks are one, two or three.

55:09.320 --> 55:13.120
It just lists them, but it doesn't actually tell you like this one's monitor one.

55:13.120 --> 55:14.120
This one.

55:14.120 --> 55:17.160
So you so you just have to say I just had to start guessing, OK, this one's going to

55:17.160 --> 55:18.160
be left of this one.

55:18.160 --> 55:19.160
This one's right of this one.

55:19.160 --> 55:20.160
Apply.

55:20.160 --> 55:21.160
Oh, no.

55:21.160 --> 55:22.160
Got that wrong.

55:22.160 --> 55:23.160
And then I do that two or three times.

55:23.160 --> 55:24.160
Crash.

55:24.160 --> 55:25.160
Hard crash.

55:25.160 --> 55:26.160
Guru meditation error.

55:26.160 --> 55:27.160
So then I do that a couple more times.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.160
Crash.

55:28.160 --> 55:29.160
Guru meditation error.

55:29.160 --> 55:30.160
Then I do that one more time.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.160
Crash.

55:31.160 --> 55:32.160
Do that one more time.

55:32.160 --> 55:33.160
Crash.

55:33.160 --> 55:34.160
Do that one more time.

55:34.160 --> 55:35.160
Crash.

55:35.160 --> 55:36.160
It starts crashing every time.

55:36.160 --> 55:37.160
So then I reboot, log back in, make a few more changes.

55:37.160 --> 55:38.160
Crash.

55:38.160 --> 55:39.160
And it was rough.

55:39.160 --> 55:41.680
It was really rough because I couldn't just visually lay them out.

55:41.680 --> 55:46.300
And God bless it, I even I even launched a render because I have the gooey graphical

55:46.300 --> 55:49.200
front end to X render, laid it out in there.

55:49.200 --> 55:50.200
Hit apply.

55:50.200 --> 55:51.880
It applies for like two seconds.

55:51.880 --> 55:55.440
And then like enlightenment says, oh, I need to resume your layout for you.

55:55.440 --> 55:57.680
And it reverts it back to the horrible layout.

55:57.680 --> 55:58.680
Oh, no.

55:58.680 --> 56:01.340
I disabled that setting in the display manager.

56:01.340 --> 56:02.340
It still does it.

56:02.340 --> 56:07.560
And then when I go to change it crash and I could tell it was close at one point, but

56:07.560 --> 56:08.560
it just got so crashy.

56:08.560 --> 56:09.600
I bailed.

56:09.600 --> 56:13.920
But it enlightenment does have the ability for like my side displays to have their own

56:13.920 --> 56:14.920
virtual desktops.

56:14.920 --> 56:16.920
And that would be so awesome.

56:16.920 --> 56:19.040
I got close, but I had to walk away.

56:19.040 --> 56:42.800
I had to go back to plasma.
