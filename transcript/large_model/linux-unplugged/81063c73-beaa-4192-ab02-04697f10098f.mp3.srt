1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
So, it doesn't really fit in with the show, but does anybody have a way they've been impacted

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,020
by this Amazon AWS outage that's going on right now?

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:16,000
As we record, AWS and its related services are down for many people.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,120
Chadron's been talking about it for the whole show, pre-show.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,120
I have my customers.

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,120
Who had customers?

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,120
What happened?

8
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:34,800
I have a bunch of customers that use AWS to host their PBXs, or dialers, or CRMs in.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,280
Yeah, I think that happened to Ting.

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Ting was knocked off.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,760
Their call center was knocked offline for a bit.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,120
They're still able to do web chat and email support.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,240
Yeah, it's interesting.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,640
You can actually see 5,000 calls dropped down to about 3,000 calls, and you're just like,

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,640
what just happened?

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:04,160
Yeah, every time this happens, I really am just sort of shocked at the massive dependence

17
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,160
on Amazon.

18
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,880
It is the underlying infrastructure for a lot of the services I use.

19
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,840
Just before the show started, I was trying to get a screenshot for the show notes, and

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:21,460
I tried two different imaging sites that were offline because of AWS being down.

21
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:26,040
We get asked all the time why we don't host our switch because our switch is all cloud-based

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,080
and Amazon.

23
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,840
This is why we actually have our own data centers and our own cloud infrastructure

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,840
around ourselves.

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Really?

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,280
Even though this only happens like once every year, a couple of years, you still feel like

27
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,560
it's worth it, huh?

28
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,600
If your telecom went down once or twice a year because of this, or had problems routing

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
to the customer...

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Yeah, telecom.

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,160
Boy, that's a tough choice.

32
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,440
Yeah, you're right.

33
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:55,920
Telecom and medical, just the cost differential there is, I got to imagine, I mean, thousands

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,720
and thousands of dollars a month just for a data center.

35
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
Not really.

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
I mean...

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
Shut your face.

38
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,720
I'm serious.

39
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:07,080
When you map it out for the amount of bandwidth, I mean, we're connecting to 10Git connections,

40
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,400
you just can't compare...

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:14,060
AWS, if I went to them and said, I want 30 or right now, it takes about 30 to 40 images

42
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,060
to run each site.

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,080
I want 30 images and I want a 10Git connection.

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,520
It doesn't, you know, even buying hard $40,000 worth of hardware every year isn't going to...

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,600
Yeah, you know, that does add up.

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
I agree.

47
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,600
That does make sense.

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,600
Hmm.

49
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,660
I wonder, I wonder every time this happens, I think to myself, is this the time that people

50
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,560
are going to start looking at other options?

51
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,120
You know, you have to think too, like, even just differentiating a bit.

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,560
So not going all crazy and just saying like, no more Amazon, I'm done with Amazon forever,

53
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,640
but just saying, well, I'm going to put some backup resources on DigitalOcean or I'm going

54
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,520
to put some additional storage on ScaleEngine.

55
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
It seems like, it just seems like this is...

56
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,200
Every time this happens, I have this conversation and everybody goes, yep, yep, that's the way

57
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,200
to do it.

58
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Yep, yep, yep.

59
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,920
And then another AWS outage happens and here we are, nobody's done it.

60
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:21,400
This is Linux Unplugged episode 186 for February 28, 2017.

61
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,760
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that has so much breaking news this

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,040
week, you might as well just call me Shep Smith.

63
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,280
My name is actually Chris.

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,640
Hey, Shep.

65
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
This is Wes.

66
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
Thanks, Wes.

67
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Thanks for going with it.

68
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
What's your new name now?

69
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,920
I kind of lost steam and then I realized, if I go as Shep, do I have to try to do an

70
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
accent?

71
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Oh, yeah.

72
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Okay, maybe I'll spare everybody that then.

73
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,800
We do have a really great episode.

74
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,120
So much stuff has happened literally as we're recording today and I'm not even talking about

75
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,800
the big AWS outage, no, no, no, we have big news stories on items and gadgets and projects

76
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,800
that we love.

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Oh my.

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Yeah, really.

79
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,480
And all of them are like things that everybody's been buzzing about this week.

80
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,120
So we'll jump into that, get those all banged out for you guys right away so you'll get

81
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,800
your veggies right up front.

82
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
Ooh, tasty.

83
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,440
Then we're going to reignite the debate.

84
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,080
Is swap on modern systems actually necessary?

85
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,040
I kind of felt like we had this settled and then Red Hat released this big old document.

86
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,640
Red Hat weighs in with their official documentation and advisories.

87
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
Those guys.

88
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,640
Oh my goodness.

89
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,080
And then later on in the show, Telegram, some perhaps shenanigans afoot.

90
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,640
It looks like what was once promised to be open source may actually be closed up.

91
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,640
Now they haven't said anything officially, but the tea leaves look bad.

92
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,200
We'll cover that if you're a Telegram user, it's going to be relevant to your interest.

93
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,120
And then Noah warned us all, but an internet connected teddy bear has leaked millions of

94
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,000
voice messages and passwords.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,920
We'll tell you what went wrong, what the fundamental issue is with this particular type of approach,

96
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:05,640
and the details, and also the horribly awkward video that walks users through setting up

97
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,200
the worst security ever.

98
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,040
Oh, I'm excited.

99
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,080
And then Wes, I think this might all just be for me.

100
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,920
So I hope the audience enjoys this, but at the end of the show, we're going to have some

101
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
fun with G-Streamer.

102
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,680
I recently just went on a big G-Streamer purge on my main Archbox.

103
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,680
Get it out of here.

104
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,440
I'll talk about the problems it's causing, I'll talk about how you can fix it if you're

105
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,080
having your G-Streamer woes on Arch right now.

106
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,080
And then Wes has been playing around with some really cool stuff powered by G-Streamer,

107
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,120
which maybe, maybe will make me kick that dirty old FFM peg to the curb.

108
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
I'm kidding.

109
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
I love FFM pegs.

110
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Everyone does.

111
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
All right.

112
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,800
Before we get into all of our breaking news, let's bring in that mumble room.

113
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Time appropriate greetings, mumble room.

114
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
Hello.

115
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Hello.

116
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Wow.

117
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
Yeah.

118
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,400
That's how you do it.

119
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
I like that.

120
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Nice one.

121
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
That was really good.

122
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
All right, guys.

123
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,960
Let's start off with our breaking news.

124
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,040
This is the one that people have been talking about maybe almost number two in the chat

125
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,040
room today.

126
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:13,960
It is the Raspberry Pi Zero W. A $10 computer with with it and Bluetooth built right in.

127
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,400
Raspberry Pi Zero W. The W signifies exactly what is new.

128
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Wireless connectivity.

129
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,960
I thought it was for Wes.

130
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,520
I'm sorry, buddy.

131
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,880
One gigahertz single core Broadcom like the old one, 512 megabytes of RAM, a 40 pin header,

132
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
just like its predecessor.

133
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,040
But it adds an 802.11n and Bluetooth 4.0 to the existing Zero design.

134
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,960
Now that's pretty nice because the original Zero will stay cheap at $5.

135
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,900
And then the W with its fancy Wifi and Bluetooth, $10.

136
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,400
The Raspberry Pi Foundation is also offering a new injection molded case.

137
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,840
And I got a picture of it here.

138
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,680
It does look really slick, actually.

139
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Yeah, look at that.

140
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Yeah.

141
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,040
So just to recap, the new features are one gigahertz single core CPU, 512 megabytes of

142
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,560
RAM, a mini HDMI port, a micro USB on the go port, micro USB power, HAT compatible 40

143
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,560
pin header.

144
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Is that hat?

145
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Do you actually say it hat?

146
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Is it pronounced hat?

147
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
I don't know.

148
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,480
Yeah, composite video and reset headers and a CSI camera connector as well as now 802.11n

149
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,480
wireless LAN and Bluetooth 4.0.

150
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,640
And then of course the official case to accompany it.

151
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,320
That is really great.

152
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,120
This is for me, I've been recently discussing with Mr. Michael Dominic on the Coderadio

153
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,960
program about different use cases for embedded devices like this and I've come up with a

154
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,000
few that just require something really simple that could connect to a couple of sensors,

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,160
have a web server and this could be perfect for what I have in mind.

156
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:46,440
I'm really tempted to order one even though I don't actually have the use case yet.

157
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
Yeah, totally.

158
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
I'm wondering if I just find it.

159
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,080
For $10, what's the harm?

160
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,920
And then you have it when you have a spare Saturday or something, not that that ever

161
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,400
happens, but if you do, you can actually work on it.

162
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,120
True, and Mr. Gogo in the chat room points out that this is great for digital signage.

163
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Oh yeah.

164
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,840
I can think of a lot of things where it's less work, you put it on Wi-Fi, put it somewhere

165
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,360
and just be done.

166
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,400
They rolled out new distributors too, so it sounds like there's actual availability for

167
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
this, which is nice.

168
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,720
Remember how it used to be different?

169
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,280
They've really gotten their act together when it comes to availability.

170
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
You can get this stuff.

171
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,600
You don't have to go to weird providers that you're uncomfortable giving them their credit

172
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,920
card number and you're like, is this ever going to show up in my house?

173
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,320
This is really great.

174
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,080
Anybody in the mobile room have any thoughts on this story before we move on?

175
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,040
Elf into the room, the Pi 3 is getting Wi-Fi.

176
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,800
So is the Pi 3 getting Wi-Fi finally?

177
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,380
If this was getting Wi-Fi, why does the Pi 3 not have Wi-Fi?

178
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,480
Maybe the update's coming soon.

179
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,600
Maybe the... ooh, Rotten Corpse's Red Book prediction right there.

180
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Good job.

181
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Write it down.

182
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

183
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
So everybody mark it in your minds.

184
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,440
Episode 186, producer Michael says that the Raspberry Pi 3 update is imminent with Wi-Fi.

185
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,960
Bold prediction, sir.

186
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,800
All right, so XMetal says that he agrees.

187
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,660
For $10, it's an order now, find use later device.

188
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
Not bad.

189
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,660
Not bad.

190
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,200
Pi 3 has Wi-Fi with arch arm Chris Lass.

191
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
All right.

192
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
There you go.

193
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Thanks.

194
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Boom.

195
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,000
And this is the story that sort of had me sort of sat back in my chair and go, what

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,800
is going on here?

197
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,960
Is this a bad sign?

198
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,280
Is this a good sign?

199
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:26,620
Mozilla has made its first strategic acquisition, and it's acquired Pocket.

200
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,640
Now Pocket is the read it later service that they bundled into Firefox.

201
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
It's some controversy.

202
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,120
Yes, definitely.

203
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,320
And when I first... my cynical take on this story when I first saw it was, well, this

204
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,520
is Mozilla trying to save face.

205
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,620
They didn't want to back down, they didn't want to pull it, they probably had a contract

206
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
in place.

207
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,920
Yeah, probably.

208
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,880
So this was their way of saving face.

209
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,920
But then I sort of rethought it a little bit, and I actually think this could be a pretty

210
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,240
clever purchase for them, because Pocket has supposedly 10 million monthly active users.

211
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,240
Ten million is not a...

212
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,240
That's a good number.

213
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,000
That's our peanuts.

214
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,440
That includes advertising deals, existing deals, premium subscriptions with credit cards

215
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,800
attached, analytics for publishers.

216
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:21,240
It seems to me like that could be a good business for Mozilla to have for revenue generation.

217
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,160
And I'm certainly more comfortable with it as something under them as compared with this

218
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,440
other party that may or may not share their values that they're working with.

219
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,120
Yeah, and Mozilla says they're going to open source the bits and pieces.

220
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,160
They say that it's going to run as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Corporation,

221
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,200
and they'll continue at least for the next year to run things sort of as they have been,

222
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,000
as they are.

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,880
I used to use Pocket for a while, and it was a fine service.

224
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,760
The read it later functionality is good to have.

225
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,160
And I enjoy their... They do pretty good little translations for easy reading, mobile

226
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,400
view or whatever.

227
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,560
I wonder, W.W., you have any thoughts on this before I get into the Verge coverage specifically?

228
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,780
I'm hoping that this is a way to mitigate any kind of Yahoo buyout that could possibly

229
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,580
be taking place.

230
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:17,040
So we'll see, because I know Firefox has a clause to get out if they don't agree.

231
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,360
So this may be a way to diversify and have more cash flow if they need to.

232
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,800
What do you mean, buyout from Yahoo?

233
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:35,400
Yahoo has been long in talks of being bought out, and since Firefox is primarily dependent

234
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,120
upon them for cash flow, and yeah, they need-

235
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,640
Verizon be buying Yahoo.

236
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
Right.

237
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,840
It sounded like you were saying Yahoo was buying Firefox or Mozilla, and I was-

238
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
No, no, no.

239
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,840
Now here's what I want to just really... Because this is a trend that I've been noticing from

240
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,200
the Verge recently.

241
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,680
We covered it a couple of weeks ago too.

242
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,600
There are routine jabs at open source anything in the Verge coverage.

243
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,840
So this is from Casey Newton, at Casey Newton on Twitter, posted at the Verge, and here's

244
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,600
a couple of things that I highlighted in the article that felt like they didn't need to

245
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,600
be there and just simply are there to attack and disparage Mozilla.

246
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm trying to think of the motivation behind that, because even if you're a devout Chrome

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,040
user or Microsoft Edge user or Safari user, it benefits the web, and it's pretty easy

248
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,360
to understand how an open source browser that's always pushing for web standards is beneficial

249
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,480
to the entire web.

250
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,040
Even if it's not the browser for you.

251
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Right.

252
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
Yeah.

253
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,920
And so either this is a super shallow technologist who doesn't properly understand the technology

254
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,940
they're writing about, or there's some sort of fanboy that is biased against open source,

255
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,080
and I see this a lot at the Verge.

256
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:54,880
So here's a piece that I'm just, here's like a little paragraph.

257
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,500
Best known, speaking about Mozilla, for its Firefox web browser, Mozilla has faltered

258
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:05,520
in the mobile era, spending years on its failed Firefox phone project and waiting until 2016

259
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,040
to release Firefox and iOS globally.

260
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:13,800
Meanwhile, the slow decline of desktop web, which is just stated as a fact, has made Mozilla's

261
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,340
broader future uncertain.

262
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:23,200
They have millions of active users.

263
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,280
That is an unfounded statement that is just speculation on the part of the author.

264
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,800
The author later writes, after talking about the purchase of Pocket, and unlike Mozilla's

265
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,960
existing mobile products, people seem to actually enjoy using Pocket.

266
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,480
The implication being that the people don't enjoy using any of Mozilla's products.

267
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,040
And that's why they had to buy Pocket, because you see nobody likes to use Mozilla's stuff,

268
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,560
according to this author.

269
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,160
And then he takes in a quote that kind of implies that, by a Mozilla person.

270
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,920
It's, it's, what was it, do you remember like a week or two ago we covered something else

271
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,080
from the Verge that was taking just unnecessary pot shots at open source?

272
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
What was it?

273
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
It's escaping me.

274
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
We'll have to check.

275
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,760
If anybody in the chat remembers, maybe mention it, but I don't understand why this coverage

276
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
has to be like this.

277
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,920
I mean, there's parts of the article that are fine.

278
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,160
You just don't need to, you know, just report on it as a neutral reporting agency.

279
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,520
Maybe the stinger like, unlike Mozilla's existing mobile products, people seem to enjoy using

280
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
it.

281
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:23,560
First of all, you're projecting people's enjoyment of Pocket versus Firefox, and the two are

282
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,480
so incomparable it is not even funny.

283
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,320
Because Firefox is competing, especially on iOS, which is what this author is referring

284
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,160
to, Firefox is competing against the incumbent Safari, which will always be the default web

285
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
browser.

286
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,440
No other app can launch Firefox unless the developer has specifically programmed their

287
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,480
application to send URL links to Firefox, which is not ever going to be in the default

288
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,640
iOS system.

289
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:51,640
It's never going to be in any of Apple's apps, and it's never going to be in any of the trendy

290
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,120
apps either that are all in with Apple.

291
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,480
So it is such an unfair comparison to compare the usage of mobile Firefox and iOS to Pocket,

292
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,840
which is a completely different category of application, and it only competes with Safari's

293
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:09,400
Read It Later service, which has only been around for one iOS version and is lightly

294
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
used.

295
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,960
It is such an incomprehensible comparison, but yet this author takes the time to draw

296
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:22,640
the comparison after taking a shot at Firefox for failing in the mobile era, which the mobile

297
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:28,480
era would seem to imply the last eight years, perhaps nine years.

298
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,080
So Firefox has been in a state of failure for nine years, according to this author,

299
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:41,080
and they waited, they quote-unquote waited until 2016 to release Firefox on iOS, which

300
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,920
is, guess what, shocker everybody, not using the gecko rendering engine.

301
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
It's not a real product.

302
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,640
That's why they waited, because they didn't want to water down their brand, didn't want

303
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:54,520
to water down their product, but eventually they bowed to the user base on iOS and released

304
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,080
something that sits around the WebKit engine.

305
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,040
Surprise, surprise.

306
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,640
Apple didn't even allow you to make a separate browser other than Safari for like five years

307
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
anyway.

308
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,880
I actually think Chrome, for example, on iOS is pretty great, it's pretty great.

309
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:14,320
So I can understand that you could say it's not a success on iOS, but to compete against

310
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,440
Safari and Chrome, it's a ridiculous comparison to make it to the read it later service.

311
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,140
And I don't get why The Verge is like doing this more and more.

312
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,440
It seems odd to me because it's the two things that I find odd about, and then we're gonna

313
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,200
wrap up on this topic.

314
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,640
It's odd to me that they're taking unnecessary pot shots, perhaps just to fill out the article.

315
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,340
But then at the same time, why are the authors choosing to cover these subject materials

316
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,160
that they appear to loathe in the first place?

317
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,360
They're choosing to cover open source related stories, but yet they apparently loathe that

318
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,580
at the same time.

319
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,960
So they understand perhaps that there is some sort of demand and they can get a certain

320
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,360
click through threshold by covering these news stories, but yet they almost resent having

321
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
to do it.

322
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,360
I hate this.

323
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,000
All right, there you go.

324
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,080
That's hopefully the only rant for this show, we'll see, but geez, it just gets me fired

325
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,520
up, The Verge these days, gets me fired up.

326
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,840
You're on The Verge, Verge.

327
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,360
You're on The Verge.

328
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:18,120
So this has me excited, AMD's Ryzen really looks great.

329
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:23,800
I can't wait to see some people posting like Linux builds based around this.

330
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:29,440
And there is something that I think is interesting to note, if you're looking at pre-ordering,

331
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,240
getting ready to do a new build, you're gonna wanna run a distribution that'll have a newer

332
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,920
version of Linux, version 4.10 specifically.

333
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:44,800
Now this is posted by Michael Larrell over at Foronix, and he sets it up like this.

334
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,460
Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but he says, I haven't received any communication

335
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,920
from AMD about any review samples or the like.

336
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,900
Okay, I don't need to know that as the reader.

337
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,280
You don't need to communicate, guess what?

338
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,000
Jupyter Broadcasting has not been in communication with AMD about review samples.

339
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,240
Haven't offered to send us things.

340
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,360
Should I disclose that for every company that I haven't been in communication about?

341
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,880
That implies to me that he's been trying and not getting the recognition that he thinks

342
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,280
he deserves.

343
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:17,240
So then he goes on to say, after a comma, so I'm not under any NDA for the upcoming

344
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:24,520
AMD Ryzen launch on 2nd March, and thankfully received some information from a reliable

345
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,320
source this weekend regarding Ryzen support Linux requirements.

346
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,360
Jeez, is he drunk when he wrote this?

347
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Sorry Michael, but jeez.

348
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,480
I mean, good on you if you were actually.

349
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,240
So he says, here they are.

350
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,960
Like because they are not working with me and giving me a review unit, because they

351
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,320
haven't given me a review unit, I haven't had to sign an NDA, and because I don't have

352
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,180
an NDA, I'm gonna spill the beans on what I know.

353
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,400
But if you had given me a review unit and I had signed the NDA, I wouldn't be posting

354
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,000
this right now, is essentially what he's saying.

355
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,400
So is he saying that his news coverage can be bought simply with free product reviews?

356
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,360
Because Michael, that's not really the message you want to send, man, as somebody who does

357
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,460
product reviews.

358
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,460
So he goes on to say.

359
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,460
So it kind of sounds like extortion.

360
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,800
Yeah, it does, right?

361
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,400
It's like public shaming a little bit.

362
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Come on, dude.

363
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,660
So he says, but here's the good juicy bits.

364
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,220
You need Linux 4.10 because according to this trusted confidant, a good point for AMD testing

365
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:22,960
and usage was 4.10, so the Linux 4.11 cycle's gonna have some updates, but 4.10 I guess

366
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,080
has some code that AMD.

367
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,640
I can't really decipher the hint, but essentially he says if you're using Ubuntu 16.10, if you

368
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,320
want to go by this marker, or 16.04.2, so you're on the LTS, but you have the new hardware

369
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,480
enablement and all that jazz, you'll have a good base state for AMD Ryzen.

370
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,880
So either if you're going by the Ubuntu releases, that's what you need to be in, or you just

371
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,160
need to be on a distro running kernel 4.10.

372
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Easy peasy, right?

373
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Easy peasy.

374
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,720
By the time the hardware ships, that'll be easier said than done.

375
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,840
I mean, wait, is that, it'll be, that'll actually, hmm.

376
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Right.

377
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,920
So if you've got 16.10, 16.04.2, and you're on Fedora, I think 5.26 is gonna have kernel

378
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,480
4.10 soon by the time the product's shipping.

379
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,320
So a lot of the major distros are gonna be close to 4.10 or on 4.10 if you're on a current

380
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
distro.

381
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Yep.

382
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,160
And hey, if you're chomping at the bit to buy the processor on release day, then just

383
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,400
compile a new kernel, you'll be fine.

384
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,400
I kinda am.

385
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,240
I'm not going to, but I am actually fairly impressed with what AMD has to offer here.

386
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,560
I think they've actually got a pretty good product that's gonna be really competitive

387
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,160
in a way that AMD, in my personal opinion, has not been competitive to the i7 and i5s.

388
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,360
I feel like we're at an inflection point where things are kinda questionable for Intel, they've

389
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,760
had some slowness, or...

390
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,720
This is Intel's Firefox moment, and this is AMD's Chrome moment.

391
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
Yeah.

392
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,960
It may not go that way at all, but it's interesting.

393
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,560
I kinda want it to, because competition in this space is critical for really competitive

394
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,400
laptops and desktop PCs that can be high performance, and Intel has...

395
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,560
They're really pushing the die size and all of that.

396
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,720
They've really done a lot of work there, but at the same time, they just announced the

397
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,200
next couple of releases, there's not gonna be a die size change, if I'm correct, I'm

398
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
not sure.

399
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,800
But it hasn't gone the way they expected.

400
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,200
And maybe a little kick in the arse might lube up the machinery there at Intel.

401
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,240
Anybody in the moment room have thoughts on Ryzen before we move on?

402
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,440
Because I've seen a lot of people talking about it on the subreddit and the chatroom,

403
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,920
so I gotta figure somebody in here has a thought on it.

404
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,200
I'm still waiting for actual benchmarks from PCpern and other tech places that don't just

405
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,000
do pure synthetic benchmarks before I decide.

406
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,400
I'm really excited for...

407
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:40,600
I'm hesitantly excited about the stuff I hear that I want real proof before I decide.

408
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
You know what's...

409
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Oh, go ahead.

410
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,320
Unfortunately, I can't provide any information because I received a review unit, and I'm

411
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,960
under NDA.

412
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Such a tease.

413
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,760
Also, A and B, hey, you know, I could use some Ryzen parts, please.

414
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
There is...

415
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
You're right.

416
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
I totally agree with you, WW.

417
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,920
I haven't seen a lot of the non-synthetic stuff yet.

418
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,920
But what does give me sort of like a positive indicator is they're being really responsive

419
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,720
to other reviewers besides Michael.

420
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,440
They are letting them get in and dig into the systems.

421
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,760
They're not doing the whole, we can't talk about that yet, we can't show you that yet.

422
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,760
They're...

423
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,640
And they're honestly like letting people get hands-on with the hardware in certain cases

424
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,880
in a way that in the past, they haven't.

425
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,940
They've been a little more hands-off, a little more distant.

426
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,640
And I think that's a good indicator.

427
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,040
Hopefully, they've really got something exciting to show.

428
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
I hope so, Wes.

429
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
I hope so.

430
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:38,260

433
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,000
Wes, what's the most important asset?

434
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,320
What's your most valuable asset?

435
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
It's your mind.

436
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,480
Oh, I have one of those.

437
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
Yeah, you know what?

438
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,320
I was just sitting here thinking about this too, Wes.

439
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,620
What if you go out into space one day and you're out there for years and years and years?

440
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,000
Your body would shrivel away.

441
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Sure.

442
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
But you'd be like a jellyfish.

443
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,040
You'd still have your mind, right?

444
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Yup.

445

447
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,840
You know what jellyfish Wes is excited to learn about?

448
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,840
What's that?

449
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
Oh, yeah.

450
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,840
Very important in space.

451
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,520
And you know, I'll tell you, especially when you've got a lot of systems to keep running

452
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,200
and they have been like life support, they've been partnering directly with chefs or for

453
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,040
a great new set of courses and you have instructor mentoring when you need it.

454
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,160
They've got labs to give you hands-on training.

455
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,680
They have a great community stacked full of Jupiter broadcasting whether you're an experienced

456
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,820
sys admin or new to the world of Linux, Azure and AWS, OpenStack and DevOps, a sharp skill

457
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,960
set is an absolute necessity to succeed.

458
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,800
Meet Linux Academy, an online Linux and cloud training platform that uses self-paced video

Linux ecosystem.

469
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
You should too.

470
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,960
Yeah, that's legit right there.

471
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,560
That bleeding edge part is legit.

472
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:34,520
Even when I'm not out in the quote-unquote industry, I'm still hoping for that day that

473
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,040
Elon comes on, knocks on my door and says, I'd like to take you to Mars, and I need your

474
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,040
mind.

475
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,760
And I'm going to go invest in my mind at linuxacademy.com slash unplug, sign up for a free seven-day

476
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,240
trial, dig around in there.

477
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,760
Even if you're busy, they have course schedulers that will work with your time frame.

478
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,520
They'll customize some work, customize some lessons, and I think one of the other things

479
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,560
you could probably dig into, even if you're like me, I run my own business and I got three

480
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
kids.

481
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,280
I understand that you can be busy, but you know what's great is these nuggets, just little

482
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,280
tiny bits of wisdom.

483
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,120
You jump in, it's one topic, you do a deep dive, and you're done.

484
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,600
In the time you could have watched a few silly videos on YouTube, you could learn something

485
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:17,880
completely new about Linux, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and a big thank you to Linux

486
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,080
Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

487
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,220
The debate rages on like dis-defragging.

488
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:28,320
Do we really need a swap partition on modern systems?

489
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,520
And I thought we'd kind of, here was my advice.

490
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,020
If you're on a desktop with lots of RAM, you probably don't.

491
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:38,160
If you're on a laptop and you want to hibernate, you probably do.

492
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,160
That was sort of my...

493
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:43,200
Those are the obvious kind of corner edge cases on the spectrum.

494
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,960
Yeah, yeah, and then these guys, maybe you've heard of them over at this company called

495
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,960
Red Hat.

496
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
I don't know if you're familiar with this.

497
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,320
This Red Hat company comes along, noobs I think, I think they compete with Canonical,

498
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,620
and they came in here and they said, well, ha ha ha, well here's a couple of caveats.

499
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,300
They actually wrote this whole article telling you about how you should and why you should

500
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,400
use swap, and then it says at the bottom, but can I run without swap, Red Hat?

501
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Can I do it?

502
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,040
Is further tuning possible?

503
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:14,560
And Red Hat's official stance, systems without swap can make sense and are supported by Red

504
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,400
Hat.

505
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,540
Just be sure the behavior of such a system under memory pressure is what you want in

506
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,320
most environments.

507
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,640
A little bit of swap does make sense.

508
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,480
Yeah, I can see that.

509
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,480
Yeah, that's where I've kind of come at too.

510
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,600
How are you running swap on that system you're on right now?

511
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,800
I don't actually know.

512
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
That's a good question.

513
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:40,080
Let's, yes, so there you go, there you go.

514
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,080
And I can do swap off.

515
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:47,800
I could do swap off right now and I think I'd be fine because I've still got 3.6 gigabytes

516
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,800
of RAM.

517
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Nice.

518
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
Yeah.

519
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,740
But the reason why I actually wanted to link to this in the show notes for those of you

520
00:26:54,740 --> 00:27:00,120
at home is they've essentially done one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine

521
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:05,480
or so, eight bullet points, really eight, that tell you the parameters and where swap

522
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,320
might or might not work for you.

523
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,960
And this one I thought was interesting.

524
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,060
If you design your applications to regularly use swap, make sure to use faster devices

525
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:19,840
like SSDs starting with Red Hat Enterprise 7.1.

526
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:25,000
You can do swap on, dash, dash, discard, which can be used to send trimmed SSD devices to

527
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,600
discard the device contents on swap on.

528
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,160
So it's some good tips there too.

529
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
So I don't know.

530
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,000
You thought, what do you think, Wes, when you're building a system swap?

531
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,320
Yeah, I usually do, but I could see doing it on a desktop, but it would probably depend

532
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,680
on, you know, maybe do some tests if you feel adventurous.

533
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,480
I could see it like, I wouldn't care here, you know, if like, all right, well, the out

534
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,840
of memory killer comes by and kills my Chrome session, which is probably one of the things,

535
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,280
but I'm generally not doing anything.

536
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,880
I habitually, you know, colon W and Vim all the time.

537
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,840
So I'm not that worried about programs being killed and things dying.

538
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,480
But say if you're like, you know, you're the beard and you're working on editing the show,

539
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,960
it might be worth just a couple of gigs of swap to make sure that that situation doesn't

540
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
really happen.

541
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,320
One of the things I think about too is how fast certain types of storage have gotten

542
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,280
now where you can get nearly a gigabyte or 900 megabytes or even 300 megabytes of throughput.

543
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,400
Swap is a little less expensive than it used to be.

544
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,920
Somebody in the moment wanted to jump in with their thoughts on the swap.

545
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Swap on.

546
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,480
You know, one of the things you could do too, is you, go ahead.

547
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:35,680
I've never, okay, so ever since like elementary 12.04 and other, like going to KDE Plasma,

548
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:44,120
I've never seen swap used on like the swap partition or swap file used at all.

549
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Zero.

550
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,440
And I have never tweaked it.

551
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,560
And I'm like, maybe you just don't have enough to do.

552
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
You're not working hard enough.

553
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Yeah.

554
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,560
You're just not swapping right.

555
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,600
That's what she said.

556
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,720
The thing is, it's like I'm going to be redoing my system really soon and I'm going to be

557
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:09,720
putting an SSD in and I want that to last me as long as I can for several different

558
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,880
reasons.

559
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,560
So I don't want to use swap on that drive if it's going to be wearing it out, causing

560
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:21,120
problems or, or should I just be moving it?

561
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:28,280
And I can never find an answer to any good swap like questions like, okay, is the double

562
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,160
thing still valid?

563
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,480
Like double your RAM size, you know, there needs to be a hard drive.

564
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
No, no.

565
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
I don't think so.

566
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
It depends on the RAM.

567
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
It depends on what your RAM is.

568
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,280
If you have like four gigs of RAM, maybe, but you can even get away with that.

569
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,280
I would say like a hundred percent what your RAM is until you get to like 16 or more than

570
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,280
you can just do half of that and just stay at eight.

571
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,280
Yeah.

572
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,520
I actually just do like two gigs these days, really.

573
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,700
And I'll tell you, the only time I would do more is if I wanted to be able to hold the

574
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,000
contents of RAM during hibernation or something like that.

575
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,480
I tell you really, I have it mostly out of legacy.

576
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,840
I have it so that way for me, it feels like it's my, my bumper in the bowling lane that

577
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,360
I, if I go a little crazy, which I sometimes do, I'm not going to, the gnome desktop, and

578
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,560
I haven't hit it with plasma yet, but boy is it crap when you run out of memory and

579
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,620
you don't have swap.

580
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:25,080
It is, it is, it is not, and it, especially if you're using Chrome, oh, it just is the

581
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
most frustrating.

582
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,800
You're right in the middle of work.

583
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,560
Everything starts locking up.

584
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,780
Clicks are taking forever to get registered.

585
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,320
It becomes practically, everything starts timing out.

586
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,640
This tab's died, this tab's died, this tab's died, this application is not responding.

587
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,400
It is a train wreck.

588
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,240
It's a dumpster fire.

589
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,720
So should we get an option where, you know, you hit that memory seal and instead of like

590
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,560
add a memory killer, it just reboot?

591
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,920
You know what, you know, and, and, and I, yeah, really, you know what I think is faster,

592
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,920
you know, with an SSD.

593
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,920
We have an option.

594
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:58,100
It's called swap.

595
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,560
Is it, isn't Ubuntu switching to swap files instead of a swap partition?

596
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,280
This is another thing you can do is instead of dedicating like a whole partition to it,

597
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:12,800
you could switch to a swap file, which more and more distros are doing and might make

598
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,080
sense because then you have sort of the best of both worlds.

599
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,680
You don't, you don't necessarily lose a lot of hard drive space and you give, you make

600
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,680
a swap file.

601
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,240
I'm not sure if you have to preallocate the space with a swap file or not.

602
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
I don't know exactly how.

603
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
You don't.

604
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
Okay.

605
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Well, that definitely seems like that could be the way to go.

606
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
Yeah, that's what I use.

607
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,440
I don't know about hibernation on a swap file.

608
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Good question.

609
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
No.

610
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,920
Popeye in the chat room says no.

611
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
So that's sort of a bummer.

612
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,920
But on the desktop,

613
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,080
Well, he says no and yes.

614
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,080
Oh.

615
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:43,080
If only there was some sort of communication method we could use in which we could speak

616
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,880
more clearly and rapidly.

617
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,880
I don't know.

618
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,880
I don't think that's a thing.

619
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Oh, okay.

620
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,880
Wait, have you tried IRC?

621
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,880
Hmm.

622
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,680
All right.

623
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,960
So I, that's something we'll have to leave a bit of.

624
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,580
I was hoping we could just finally stop talking about this, but like with the disty fragging

625
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,440
topic too, it just keeps coming back.

626
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,200
There's a good chat, I mean a good thread in the subreddit though, if you kind of want

627
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,200
some guidelines to follow.

628
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
You have any other thoughts on it?

629
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
No.

630
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
I think that's it.

631
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,200
All right.

632
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
All right.

633
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,400
Well, then I suppose without other people inputting, it is time to move on, wink, wink.

634
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,360
I think isn't Popeye like at Mobile World Congress or something right now?

635
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,360
What's going on right now?

636
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,960
The canonical folks are over there doing all, there's an interview with Mark Schultz.

637
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,440
I hear that you're in the mobile space sometimes.

638
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
From time to time.

639
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,440
Yeah, from time to time.

640
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:35,040
Now, we have a story coming up that, I don't know, I don't want us to get all riled up

641
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,200
because we got a lot of fans of Telegram in the audience.

642
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,840
So I know this is a big deal.

643
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,640
I know this can get people upset.

644
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,120
So before we jump into the Telegram story, I want to talk about this 11-year-old flaw

645
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:51,040
that has been patched, but I just want to put it out there so people know what's up.

646
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,400
A security researcher at Google found a use after free hole within Linux, speaking of

647
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,600
memory usage.

648
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,420
This particular flaw is of interest because it appears to be situational.

649
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:06,240
It only showed up in kernels built with a certain configuration option, which was config

650
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,200
IP DCCP enabled.

651
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Unfortunately, many people, or I'm sorry, popular Linux distributions have enabled this

652
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,880
option by default.

653
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:20,080
A new Linux update has since patched the vulnerability, although the exploit is present in Linux kernels

654
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,160
since 2005.

655
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,680
It uses heap spraying methods to execute arbitrary code inside the kernel, which allows the attacker

656
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,540
to escalate permissions.

657
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,640
So you can think of it like this.

658
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,120
An attacker could hijack a low permissions account, maybe a remote services listening

659
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,400
that has limited privileges, like a database service or a web server, your NGINX user,

660
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,400
something like that.

661
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,680
If there's a flaw in NGINX, it just takes one other piece of software that's perhaps

662
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,120
on your system running in the background under a less privileged user.

663
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,120
Or even your own user account on your desktop that is a standard user, and maybe something

664
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,160
happens like inside the web browser, the attacker can use your basic privileges of that account

665
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,980
and then escalate from there.

666
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,740
That's by very definition a local escalation bug.

667
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:13,020
When you combine it with other types of attacks, it's sort of the island hopping approach that

668
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,600
you guys and we used to talk about in TechSnap.

669
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:22,940
And it is definitely worth patching, but you don't really have to worry because some distributions

670
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:25,060
don't really need to be patched.

671
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,760
Most distributions that do, Debian 7, Debian 8, for example, have been fixed.

672
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,360
Stretch and SID have yet to be patched.

673
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,880
Only one version of SUSE is affected.

674
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,520
And if you have SE Linux, well, you can mitigate this problem pretty much all together.

675
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,820
So it's not like it's a huge problem, but it's been around for 11 years, so it probably

676
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,000
does by just the very nature impact a lot of people.

677
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,380
So I just wanted to give a little breaking news PSA update before we got into this whole

678
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,380
Telegram thing.

679
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,960
Because the Telegram thing is not exactly breaking news.

680
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,000
That kind of ends our breaking news section of the show.

681
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,240
And thanks, Shep, for stopping by.

682
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:08,160
I've enjoyed Telegram for, I don't know, since it was an early, early beta stage.

683
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,960
It's a great chat application for collaborating with groups or individuals.

684
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:17,840
One of the things that I really appreciate is a very serviceable desktop Linux client.

685
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,400
They have great mobile clients, good bot support, lots of fun features like stupid stickers

686
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,840
and whatnot.

687
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,840
And a big part of using Telegram is using it on mobile.

688
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,480
In fact, you have to have a freaking mobile number to even use it.

689
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,120
I hate that.

690
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,920
And this is where we run into a problem.

691
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,040
Essentially it looks like Telegram for Android is essentially a closed sourced application

692
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,440
now.

693
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,200
According to the repository in the Telegram website, the Android client is covered by

694
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,120
the GPL license.

695
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:57,080
However, since early October 2016, there has been many releases but no updates of the source

696
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,240
code.

697
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,000
Everyone involved so far is pretty much not responding.

698
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,120
The original author hasn't responded, the Telegram chat support doesn't respond, the

699
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:11,960
Twitter account doesn't respond to the questions, other individuals like the face of Telegram,

700
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,660
the spokesperson of Telegram doesn't respond, and there's really no other contact method

701
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,780
for Telegram other than a physical mailing address.

702
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,880
Is it time to really start seriously considering wire?

703
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,580
Does this concern you or is this wire or signal, I guess?

704
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,720
You concerned about this at all?

705
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,680
I mean it's very disheartening.

706
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,800
I have not investigated it very much.

707
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,840
I know like Telegram has never been like the perfect messenger, at least in my eyes.

708
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
I agree.

709
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:43,840
We've talked about the problems before, but it has been that mix of like, it's not stagnant

710
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,600
like Hangouts and wrapped up in this, you know, other...

711
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,960
It does feel like stagnation is beginning to set in.

712
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,280
Because when I first picked it up, it was like changing all the time and it's always

713
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,480
been very snappy, fast, supports file uploads very well, all those kinds of things, plus

714
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,800
all the stickers and the font and all that.

715
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Part of me is grateful that they haven't gone down the rabbit hole of video and audio and

716
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,200
trying to be like all in all...

717
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,760
They're not another Snapchat clone.

718
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,400
Yeah, because it, you know, focus on text chatting.

719
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,440
There's other applications that can do video and audio, but when I say stagnation at the

720
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,680
same time, like there are still things about it that kind of bug me that I'm surprised

721
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,680
they haven't fixed.

722
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,720
Like, my big one is freaking global status.

723
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,360
Allow me to set my status to DND for goodness sakes.

724
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,720
And the more things I have coming in Telegram, I have, you know, a bot that sends me something

725
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
in Telegram.

726
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,520
I check it, but now all of a sudden I'm shown online and I get 15 telegrams.

727
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
Literally, that's what happens to me.

728
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,480
And if I could just go in there and say DND for a little while and let me read through

729
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:41,480
my telegrams and just catch up, it would just be very useful for somebody like myself.

730
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,760
Those kinds of things are...

731
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,120
There are companies out there like Slack who've really nailed DND.

732
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,120
Yes.

733
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,000
I mean, it's like the best implementation I have found and Telegram could just wholesale

734
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,120
rip that off and they just don't.

735
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,520
Mr. Tonell, you were going to say something.

736
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,720
Yes, I was going to say that Wire is already a good alternative now and it's even gotten

737
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,720
better from a recent announcement.

738
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,200
What do you mean by good?

739
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,760
Like, well, it's a good option because...

740
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,480
Like, how's the desktop app for Linux?

741
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
It's fine.

742
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
I mean...

743
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Is it better than Telegram?

744
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,000
At first, does it do the audio and video stuff on the desktop?

745
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Yes, it does.

746
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Yeah, okay.

747
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,800
It has the audio and video stuff and the video stuff is actually surprisingly well-made.

748
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,520
I expect it to kind of underperform because of the WebRTC approach, but it's almost flawless.

749
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
It's got an app image.

750
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,520
I'm installing it right now.

751
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
Are you?

752
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,520
Downloading it.

753
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,160
I got an app image and they also got like a regular tar.

754
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,680
My hesitation here is...

755
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,320
So like, for example, Linux Fest Northwest, just around the corner, when everybody is

756
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,080
working, everybody we're working with has Telegram.

757
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,100
And it's not even just like our team.

758
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:53,880
It's people that we meet up with or other people that are coming to Linux Fest and all

759
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,560
of a sudden we want to start coordinating with.

760
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
Everybody has Telegram.

761
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,840
And for a while, it was in that spot, right?

762
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,800
It was like, hey, open source, yeah, not perfect, they have their own crypto, there's problems,

763
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,360
but it was that beautiful combination of like functional, we have people who use it and

764
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,360
open source.

765
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,680
The network, I think, like interacting with the network, you can still build your own

766
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,680
client.

767
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
Right.

768
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,760
There's QtGram on the desktop and others.

769
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:21,720
The protocols, the APIs are open for the client side, but the server has never been open.

770
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,160
So I'm not really surprised that this is happening.

771
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,560
I'm more surprised that people are being bothered by it rather than questioning, oh, this is

772
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,560
happening.

773
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,880
Well, their server has also been proprietary the entire time.

774
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,880
True.

775
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,880
And their encryption is weird and homebrew.

776
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
Right.

777
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
Exactly.

778
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:42,800
And no one's audited it because they've not allowed it to be audited.

779
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:50,600
The Wire, though, like Wire uses already audited encryption algorithms.

780
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:54,720
They're actually announced recently that they're going to be open sourcing their server.

781
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,520
So they're going to be completely open source.

782
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,600
And they haven't set a license yet, but everything other than that, everything that you can check

783
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,920
the license on is GPLed.

784
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,920
Yeah.

785
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,440
Here's my problem.

786
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:10,920
This is me becoming more salty in my old age.

787
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,520
I've been around long enough to know that you can have the best technology and still

788
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,360
not succeed at all.

789
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,760
I mean, look at Linux versus Windows for so many years.

790
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,560
Really what I feel like the issue is, is user base.

791
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,240
It is user adoption and user base.

792
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,960
And it is simpler for people not to care, and it is simpler for companies to slowly

793
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,880
add the features that their competitors have.

794
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,520
System is so entrenched that we really need almost to reboot this whole problem.

795
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,320
And I think Google is working on something called RCS messaging.

796
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,760
Are you familiar with RCS messaging?

797
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
No, I'm not.

798
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,440
Yeah, I'm not either.

799
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,720
But it's a messaging system that's designed to move beyond SMS to take advantage of more

800
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,920
modern cellular networks.

801
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,420
It's more of a standard.

802
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,680
Google is a big part behind it.

803
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,360
You can go to jibe.google.com.

804
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,360
RCS stands for Rich Communication Services.

805
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,420
And the idea is to standardize a way to have messaging across phones and across carriers

806
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:13,440
that allow you to do things like high-resolution photos, videos, large files, group chat.

807
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,840
Knowing messages have been read, you can make video calls.

808
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,700
And it's not like a Hangouts app.

809
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:23,320
It would be literally built into the text messaging application of all of the phones.

810
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:28,960
So it would be a new standard that carriers and other type telcos could have.

811
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,920
And Google is, while not – like it's weird.

812
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,680
Google is like all-in in some cases because they've got their management layer talking

813
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:40,680
to the other management layers of carriers, like they've managed to convince Sprint

814
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:44,120
and some other carriers outside the US to take on RCS.

815
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,080
At the same time, they're not really pushing it very hard on a software front.

816
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,640
Now they're going to be – eventually I suppose.

817
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,080
And they're going to update the Android Messages client to be the RCS client for Android.

818
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,440
But I don't really understand how that plays into their greater messaging strategy with

819
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,120
Allo and Hangouts and – it's just very confusing.

820
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:06,880
But if the industry can sort this out and Apple and Google and everybody and Microsoft

821
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,560
and Android and everybody can – Samsung and get along with RCS, we may have something

822
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,320
that's more sophisticated.

823
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,560
But you know it's not going to be encrypted like the way we need.

824
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,160
It's not going to be end-to-end, definitely.

825
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,280
It might be encrypted but the carriers are going to have the keys, guaranteed.

826
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,840
We know how much we love those carriers.

827
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:30,880
So it could help the average user but for us like users that want something beyond that,

828
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:40,520
Wire has got a – I think we as a technical community are exceedingly bad at estimating

829
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,720
how much of an uphill climb a company like Wire has because we look at it from – we

830
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,600
weigh the technical merits heavier than we should.

831
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:54,320
Because the average user doesn't even consider the technical merits.

832
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,480
We literally are not even a consideration in their decision process.

833
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,280
They are absolutely irrelevant to them.

834
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:05,860
But we can't get beyond it because we understand technically this is a superior thing and so

835
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:10,240
we should be using this thing and yet the market continues to use things like Skype

836
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,960
and Telegram and all the other messaging platforms.

837
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,240
I would really love to see people switch over to Wire.

838
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:21,880
I could see maybe a revolution taking over here at JB but you know I look at somebody

839
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:27,920
like Noah and he puts his entire life in Telegram.

840
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:30,360
I cannot describe to you.

841
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:36,480
You just have to be around Noah and witness how Telegram is integrated with his task list,

842
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,280
his to-do items, all of his family, all of his friends, all of his work, everything goes

843
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,440
through Telegram.

844
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,080
When Noah has to take notes for a show, he sends it to himself in a Telegram message.

845
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,440
When Noah has to remember to do something for a client, he sends it to himself in a

846
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,560
Telegram message.

847
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,360
When somebody needs tech support from Noah, he gets them to install Telegram first so

848
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,360
they can chat.

849
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
I mean so there are people out there.

850
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,360
That is quite the adoption.

851
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,360
Yeah.

852
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,040
Yeah and then he's in like a dozen group chats.

853
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,680
I don't know how he managed that.

854
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,680
I think he's insane.

855
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,680
Yeah.

856
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,680
Well that's, we know that to be true.

857
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,680
All right.

858
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,680
Mumble room.

859
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,080
Any final thoughts before we move on from messaging?

860
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,400
Yeah I don't think Google is going to get the carrier, the cellular carriers to switch

861
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,920
over to a new standard in lieu of SMS in the back end because it would require such a massive

862
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:24,920
hardware update.

863
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,400
They're going to have to do it over the IP side.

864
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,400
Yeah.

865
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,600
Well I think that is exactly what the intent is.

866
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:36,280
SMS messaging, the way it is distributed and routed between carriers is very much a hack.

867
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,200
I don't know enough anymore but it was explained to me by a friend of mine that works for a

868
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,000
carrier, how crazy they have to set this up to get messaging to work between the different

869
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,000
carriers.

870
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,720
And it's out of bound messaging gateways and it's so limited.

871
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,720
Oh yeah.

872
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,080
Monkey, you would probably actually be kind of familiar with it.

873
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,080
Yeah.

874
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,080
I mean do you want to expand on that at all?

875
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,080
Yeah.

876
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:01,920
I mean the whole SMS craze, I mean even iPhone isn't using SMS anymore and we get subpoenas

877
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,200
all the time for messaging in the back end.

878
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,560
It doesn't exist because they were on an iPhone using the iMessenger which doesn't use SMS.

879
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,020
It uses iMessenger which is an IP based solution.

880
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:19,320
And so when you start having conversations with people, yeah I'm using SMS, no you're

881
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,320
not.

882
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,280
You're using a third party application which is going over the IP.

883
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:26,920
And that's maybe coming up with new standard from Google's perspective is a good idea.

884
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,800
I just think it's a waste of time.

885
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,920
That kind of bums me out.

886
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,480
But maybe long term something like Wire can be something that at least a larger percentage

887
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,840
of users adopt.

888
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:43,200
If you're thinking about ditching Telegram and trying out something like Signal or Wire

889
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:48,400
or something else, Facebook Messenger obviously, this is a project that may be of interest

890
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
to you.

891
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,400
It's the Telegram history dump.

892
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,000
It backs up your Telegram chat logs.

893
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,400
It just kind of requires a few things to be installed like the Telegram CLI client which

894
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,400
is actually kind of cool.

895
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,400
Have you ever used that?

896
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,400
Yeah it is cool.

897
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,200
One of the things that's creepy about it is it constantly logs who's in and out so you

898
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,560
can constantly see who's coming on and offline if people turn that status on.

899
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,240
It supports incremental backups which sounds pretty nice.

900
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:17,560
And it has a separate YAML formatted configuration file so Pope could geek out on that all the

901
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,560
time.

902
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,680
You don't just need to get a snap of this.

903
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,520
Just need to snap it up.

904
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:30,760
So it's on GitHub so I'll just link to it in the show notes or it's telegram-history-dump

905
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,760
on the GitHub.

906
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,160
So how's it going over there?

907
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,160
Pretty well.

908
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,160
Yeah?

909
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
Did you get your app image of Wire?

910
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,160
Yeah.

911
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,160
I'm running.

912
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
Can I see what the UI looks like?

913
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,000
Do you mind sharing with the class?

914
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I haven't...

915
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Wow, that's quite the background over there on the side.

916
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,520
So it's... is it an Electron app?

917
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,520
Why is your webcam on?

918
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,520
Oh, I was testing.

919
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,520
Oh, OK.

920
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,520
Thanks for later.

921
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:55,520
Oh, look at you, really?

922
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,040
Oh yeah, that's going to be a fun demo.

923
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,040
We got to get moving, huh?

924
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,040
All right.

925
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:01,040
Well, I'll play with that after.

926
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,040
So you're playing with a bot right now in the Wire?

927
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,040
Yeah.

928
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,040
That was the first thing.

929
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,040
Auto the bot.

930
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,360
Hey, I'm Auto, a robot sent by Wire to talk to you through the app.

931
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
That's OK.

932
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,360
Hi, Auto.

933
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,360
You know what?

934
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,360
I'm getting kind of excited about Wire.

935
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,880
I'm getting kind of excited.

936
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,160
If you're thinking about switching up the whole thing, maybe you're ready to try messaging

937
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,680
on a mobile device and you're going to be using data, you're not going to be using text

938
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:21,680
messages.

939
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,440
You're going to use something like Wire or Telegram.

940
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,800
Ting is such a great carrier for you because if you don't use text messages, you just don't

941
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,800
pay for them.

942
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,080
It's so awesome.

943
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:33,680
It's pay for what you use wireless, six dollars for a line.

944
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:37,920
And then your minutes, your messages and your megabytes, add that up and that's pretty much

945
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,920
just what you pay.

946
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:44,080
They go in there, they have, go to, do me a favor actually, go to linux.ting.com.

947
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48,920
Not only does that save you 25 bucks, either in service credits or off a device, but it

948
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,800
lets them know you heard about it here, which kind of keeps us on the air.

949
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,900
Anyways, you go to linux.ting.com, click on what would you save and you can dig around

950
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,880
on this chart and get a really good idea of what your Ting cost is going to be.

951
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,400
Your Ting cost.

952
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:07,360
Right now, I think even with the beard traveling, even with the beard traveling, like our, because

953
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,960
he has a JB phone with him that's on Ting, we have three lines and his is one of them.

954
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:16,320
I mean, we have, gosh, maybe we actually have more than that now, now that I think about

955
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,320
it.

956
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,320
Wow.

957
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,240
You know, it really doesn't up our nominal cost because I think our cost this month was

958
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,600
like 45 bucks or something.

959
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,800
And that's with, I think now we have four lines active all the time and we turn some

960
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,600
lines on and off too, so that's another nice thing about Ting.

961
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,440
You would have a hard time finding a plan for one person for that much on another carrier.

962
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,440
I know.

963
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,440
I know.

964
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,920
And it's so nice too, especially like in a company where we're all kind of technical,

965
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,600
we're always on Wi-Fi all the time.

966
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,720
I also thought it was kind of nice that Ting did a blog post that kind of resonated with

967
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,160
me.

968
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,480
Why buying last year's flagship phone is the smarter choice?

969
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,040
And I've been thinking too about people that have been emailing into the show about their

970
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,520
phones, which we don't really talk about much on the show anymore, but I've been thinking

971
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,000
that more and more like the 5X is that price point gets to where the 5X is at.

972
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,800
You get something like the 5X directly from Google Play, you get Android updates, in fact

973
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:14,320
you get, unbelievably, you get more functionality with the 5X than you do with the 6P right

974
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
now.

975
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:18,520
I don't know if you know about this, but the latest, if you're in the beta channel, the

976
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,800
latest Android updates coming down to the 5X give you the gesture swipes that you can

977
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,860
do on the fingerprint reader to like check notifications and stuff.

978
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:31,280
So you can, yeah, there's like different finger gestures on the fingerprint reader that will

979
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,240
interact with your display, which is really nice when you're holding the phone in your

980
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:35,800
hand and the fingerprint reader's on the back.

981
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,800
You can just whoop.

982
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,280
It's very nice.

983
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,280
6P doesn't get it.

984
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,280
No fair.

985
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,320
The 5X gets it.

986
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,220
There's something to be said for that 5X.

987
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,240
It's a sturdy phone, it's not metal.

988
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,360
That also means that when you drop it, it doesn't dent.

989
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:51,360
That's kind of nice.

990
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,360
It's a great price.

991
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,600
The back comes off, you can replace the battery.

992
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,140
I don't know if you're supposed to do that, but I've done it.

993
00:49:57,140 --> 00:49:58,140
It happened.

994
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,140
Don't question it.

995
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,320
I used to do it on my 5.

996
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,240
It's just kind of a nice sweet spot because then you also get the updates directly from

997
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,240
the Googs.

998
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,160
Then you go over to Ting, you bring a device like that, you get it from the Play Store,

999
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,000
you can put it on GSM or CDMA, so you get to take advantage of either one of Ting's

1000
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
networks.

1001
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,520
And if you bring a device, you just get $25 in service credit.

1002
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:20,140
And if you don't use a lot of text messages or mobile minutes or data if you're on Wi-Fi,

1003
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:24,720
that $25 service credit would potentially get you for a couple of months.

1004
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,720
It's ridiculous.

1005
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,720
It's such a nice setup.

1006
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:27,720
So check them out.

1007
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,840
Go to linux.ting.com.

1008
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:34,040
That lets them know you heard about it here and saves you some monies.

1009
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,040
Linux.ting.com.

1010
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,240
How's that pixel working out?

1011
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,240
Still pretty happy?

1012
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,240
Yeah, actually I'm very happy with it.

1013
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,240
Hmm.

1014
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,240
Hmm.

1015
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,240
Hmm.

1016
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,240
Pretty nice.

1017
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,240
Hmm.

1018
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,240
It's not quite like as it is now.

1019
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,240
It's last year's.

1020
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,240
The only thing that kind of makes me...

1021
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,240
I don't know.

1022
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,240
What is it?

1023
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:51,240
I don't know, man.

1024
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,240
I just, you know...

1025
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,240
Basically, I've been on the iPhone.

1026
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,240
Right.

1027
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,240
It's fine.

1028
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:58,840
But every mobile operating system starts to get on my nerves after a while.

1029
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,840
Yeah.

1030
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:00,840
That is...

1031
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,640
This time around, I just haven't invested that much.

1032
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,440
Like I haven't super customized it.

1033
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,440
Yeah.

1034
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:06,440
Just use it for like core things.

1035
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,440
Yeah.

1036
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,240
Because I get that same point where I'm like, this is just not the platform for me.

1037
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,240
Yeah.

1038
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,920
And it's interesting because I'm going further and I'm deeper in.

1039
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:23,320
Like now it's like there is maybe a handful of applications in the past I'd have to re-log

1040
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,320
into.

1041
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,040
But now, it's probably a good solid 15 applications.

1042
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:37,120
Like just an example, all my TP-Link power adapters, the DJI Phantom, the Amazon Echo,

1043
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:43,840
the Harmony Logitech remote that I have, the Wemo power adapters, all of those, all of

1044
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,440
the information, all of the configuration for all of those stupid things is on this

1045
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,440
stupid phone.

1046
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,160
And it makes switching harder and harder and harder.

1047
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,160
You're bought in.

1048
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,200
It almost makes me want to get out just because now they've tried to get me in.

1049
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,200
Yeah.

1050
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,680
Like I almost, a visceral response, I want to get out of here.

1051
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,280
I want to get out of here.

1052
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,480
But I should focus on more dramatic things.

1053
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:06,640
These Internet of Things devices, they're not just part of a lock-in system.

1054
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,140
They're not just making me more dependent on apps.

1055
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,060
They're also making us more vulnerable.

1056
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:18,960
And there's one that's sort of like the worst case scenario because it affects the children.

1057
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,720
And to set up this product for you, I'm going to play their commercial.

1058
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,000
It's called Cloud Pets.

1059
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,080
Saying goodbye can be hard.

1060
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,840
The ones you love seem so far.

1061
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,520
Now staying in touch is easy and fun with Cloud Pets.

1062
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,520
Just record a message.

1063
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,000
I hope you had a good day at school.

1064
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I miss you.

1065
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,480
And send to the cloud.

1066
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,080
You know, let's stop right here.

1067
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:45,640
Before we go any further, yes, this company was hacked.

1068
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:51,280
All of their users' information was exposed online, including their actual conversations

1069
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,240
when they use this product.

1070
00:52:53,240 --> 00:53:00,960
Full-fledged, not by one attacker, not by two, not by three, but by at least four separate

1071
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,400
attackers that can be identified potentially more.

1072
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:08,400
The company was notified not once, not twice, not three times, four times the company was

1073
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,800
notified and they did nothing.

1074
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,520
No password on their database.

1075
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,360
Their Amazon Web Services was left wide open with public URLs for all of the files.

1076
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,360
No.

1077
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,360
Yeah.

1078
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,240
So as we watch this, bear that in mind.

1079
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,800
With Cloud Pets.

1080
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,800
Just record a message.

1081
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,280
I hope you had a good day at school.

1082
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,280
I miss you.

1083
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,280
Let's stop right there.

1084
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,400
You know what drives me crazy about this type of advertising?

1085
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,080
The only time daddy is away from his little girl is when he is out at a hotel bringing

1086
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,500
home the bacon and mommy and the little girl are at home.

1087
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,040
This type of advertising is so basic.

1088
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:47,520
It's so insulting and this already, this company's got me upset.

1089
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,160
I hope you had a good day at school.

1090
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,160
I miss you.

1091
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,160
And send to the cloud.

1092
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,560
In just seconds, it floats down to the app on your smart device, allowing you to send

1093
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,120
the message to the Cloud Pet.

1094
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,800
I hope you had a good day at school.

1095
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,800
I miss you.

1096
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,400
It's a message you can hug.

1097
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:07,000
If you didn't catch that, that message you can hug doesn't even get sent directly to

1098
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
the bear.

1099
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,360
They couldn't put a Raspberry Pi Zero in this thing.

1100
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,920
You have to separately like...

1101
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:16,240
So the mom in the background, of course, she's at home with the little girl because dad's

1102
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,240
out at home.

1103
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,980
She's the caring parent.

1104
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:24,280
She has to download it on her iPad and then upload it to this stupid bear.

1105
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,780
It's not even...

1106
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:26,780
It's amazing.

1107
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,600
And then the little girl hugs the message out of the bear.

1108
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,600
Now squeeze puppy's paw to send one back.

1109
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,600
Night daddy, I love you.

1110
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,920
Cloud Pets makes you feel like the ones you love are always near.

1111
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,920
Hi, this is grandma.

1112
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:41,320
See you real soon.

1113
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,360
The Cloud Pets app uses Bluetooth technology to send your messages.

1114
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,000
Hi, this is grandma.

1115
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,800
See you real soon.

1116
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:54,480
In other words, some parent or caretaker has to be near the damn bear and constantly uploading

1117
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,120
these files when they could just play the message on the iPad.

1118
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:00,120
Hi, grandma.

1119
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,120
Hi, grandma.

1120
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:07,200
Whether you're all the way on the other side of the world...

1121
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,200
I miss you guys.

1122
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:09,200
I'll be home soon.

1123
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,560
And this is the most insulting because it's a service member and he's all earnest and

1124
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,800
he's all sad and I'll be home soon.

1125
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:22,000
And of course, it's stereotypical white family, moms in the middle, two kids next to what

1126
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
looks like the fakest fireplace.

1127
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,320
It's faker than my green screen fireplace.

1128
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:32,260
And it's the perfect family, which is an impossible standard, which then service members look

1129
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:36,760
at these types of advertising and they look at this impossible standard and they judge

1130
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,480
themselves by this and go, oh geez, we really don't have our shit together.

1131
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:44,400
Again, this kind of basic advertising is so insulting to have then expose everybody's

1132
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,400
information is just...

1133
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:46,400
I miss you guys.

1134
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,240
I'll be home soon.

1135
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,240
Or very close by.

1136
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,240
Good morning, sunshine.

1137
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,240
Make sure you eat your breakfast.

1138
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,240
Good morning, sunshine.

1139
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,240
Make sure you eat your breakfast.

1140
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,560
That's the last thing I want, a lecture toy.

1141
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:58,560
I know.

1142
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,560
I know.

1143
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:04,000
So this is the really dirty details about this.

1144
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,360
It is definitely the worst case scenario cloud device ever.

1145
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,120
This is more than two million voice recordings exposed of children and their parents, along

1146
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:20,960
with email addresses and passwords of over 820,000 user accounts.

1147
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,240
Clouds not only that, but cloud pets data was also held for ransom.

1148
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:29,880
The customer data was left unprotected from December 25th, 2016 to January 8th in a publicly

1149
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:36,640
available database that wasn't protected by any password or firewall.

1150
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:42,540
The creator of I've Been Pwned said that its exposed data was accessed multiple times by

1151
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:47,800
many third parties, including hackers, who used and stole customer emails and hash passwords

1152
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,040
from cloud pets database.

1153
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:53,780
In early January, cyber criminals were actively scanning the internet for badly configured

1154
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,840
Mongo databases and guess what?

1155
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,840
Cloud pets was one of them.

1156
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:00,480
Their database was actually overwritten twice.

1157
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:01,860
They didn't fix it then.

1158
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:06,400
The toy maker was allegedly notified four times that its customer data was online and

1159
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,620
available for anyone to have their hands on, yet the data remained up for almost a week,

1160
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,520
with evidence suggesting the data was stolen on multiple occasions.

1161
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,880
Cloud pets blog has not been updated to reflect this.

1162
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,380
In fact, it hasn't even been updated since 2015.

1163
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:22,800
So if you're a cloud pets customer, you essentially have, unless you're listening to the show

1164
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,340
or reading these blogs, have no idea this has happened.

1165
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:31,320
Look, we hacked them again, but get all the bears to spit out a security warning.

1166
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,520
So it's kind of funny because AWS is out today, right?

1167
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:36,080
And that's part of AWS is part of the story.

1168
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,360
So you had the MongoDB database.

1169
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,820
And that's where you got like the URLs and session IDs and user information.

1170
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:48,580
But spiral toys, the parent company used Amazon hosted services that required no authorization

1171
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:54,040
to store any of the recordings or profile pictures or the children's names and the relations

1172
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:59,160
to the parents and friends and family and pets and all of that is like a worst case

1173
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,460
scenario Internet of Things hack.

1174
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,100
And it's such a stupid product.

1175
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:08,340
And the other problem is not only is the company unresponsive, but check out their tutorial

1176
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,240
video on getting started.

1177
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:16,360
Sybil looks like Sybil looks like she is she is deeply she and I don't I'm just saying

1178
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,040
she looks like she's a deeply tortured woman.

1179
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,400
I don't know what's going on.

1180
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:30,840
But watch how Sybil tells us to set up a password email ready and choose a password and watch

1181
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:40,920
this Q W E and good Q W E confirmed and good in their official tutorial video with Sybil

1182
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,580
the tutorial host.

1183
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:50,780
They recommend a three character password Q W E and in fact tested by some security

1184
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,780
researchers.

1185
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:54,680
Their application allows a single digit password.

1186
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,680
If you so choose.

1187
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:02,120
Well I mean the children got to think of the children all this makes me sick and it's funny

1188
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:06,800
because we're recording this in the middle of an AWS outage and as part of this outage

1189
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,840
people on Twitter are really going on and on about how their Internet of Things devices

1190
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:13,880
are not responding right now which is just my bear is broken.

1191
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:19,800
Yeah because if this than that it depends on AWS and if it's just it's incredible.

1192
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:26,360
It is incredible that it is 2017 and a company like this exists where they just throw this

1193
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,280
crap online and don't bother securing it.

1194
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:33,200
But what's to stop them if they can get manufacturing that's crazy cheap if they can take advantage

1195
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,840
of people's smart devices that have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth they just have to throw together

1196
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,840
some Web services.

1197
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:41,440
It's a lot cheaper if you don't bother to secure your things properly.

1198
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,200
You don't have to even hire a sysadmin if you don't right.

1199
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:51,880
You know what you put a Docker image up online that's a big deal.

1200
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:52,880
Pretty bad.

1201
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,880
Pretty bad.

1202
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:54,880
Pretty bad.

1203
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:59,520
So you think there's like a market niche after this for like super secure cloud bear because

1204
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,520
maybe we should go into business.

1205
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:07,100
I don't I don't like being a like a naysayer of all cloud things because you're looking

1206
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:11,880
at a man who is pretty pretty satisfied with the echo product.

1207
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,440
I just today set up another smart thing.

1208
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:16,440
You're a cloud child.

1209
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,560
I've been using the harmony right remote with it with the echo to turn my television and

1210
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,320
soundbar on and off since our last episode.

1211
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,320
It's actually pretty great.

1212
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,240
I don't have any idea where some of those remotes are right now.

1213
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,940
I think I just put them away in a drawer.

1214
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,940
It's the best thing ever.

1215
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:33,400
It is literally the best thing ever when you when you sit down on your couch and you bark

1216
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,600
at the echo to just turn on your television and it turns on the television the soundbar

1217
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,840
and the Nvidia shield.

1218
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:39,840
Mind blowing.

1219
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,840
Great.

1220
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:41,840
That's been fun.

1221
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:42,840
You know what.

1222
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,840
And today I put a heater on it.

1223
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,200
I put a heater in the RV on this so now I can just tell the echo and turn the heater

1224
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,200
on or off.

1225
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,200
I'm cold.

1226
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,880
I can actually tell I can actually tell this echo to turn it off at the RV at home.

1227
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,920
So before I leave I can have the heater turn on.

1228
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:55,920
Which saves power.

1229
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,920
I don't have to leave it running all day.

1230
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,620
But it's toasty warm when you get home.

1231
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:01,440
So I don't want to be like this all cloud all innovative things.

1232
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,080
I'm not all Noah on this.

1233
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:05,200
I'm not all Alan Jude on this.

1234
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,000
I have a middle ground where I think there's a room there's room for products that are

1235
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,300
well maintained.

1236
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:15,680
There's room for a product like like the transactional update products from Canonical there's room

1237
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,680
for that kind of stuff.

1238
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:20,260
But you see this and it's just so disheartening that we're in the majority I feel like we're

1239
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,260
never going to get it right.

1240
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,260
Yeah right.

1241
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:24,600
And that's the thing is like the more things we have like this than the less faith we have

1242
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:25,920
in the entire marketplace.

1243
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:31,040
And there's unfortunately not enough pressure to make companies behave good.

1244
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,040
And they can just disappear.

1245
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,040
They sell a product.

1246
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,640
You got to do it right.

1247
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,640
You got to do it right.

1248
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:37,200
Go to DigitalOcean.com and do it right.

1249
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,680
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED after you create an account and you get a ten dollar credit

1250
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:47,640
DigitalOcean.com sign up then use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED simple cloud hosting provider

1251
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:53,240
and they have if you are totally a noob they have a fantastic beautiful easy to use interface

1252
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,600
and they have one click deployments of systems that are updated.

1253
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,480
They partner with upstream providers.

1254
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,560
They make sure it's configured right and then they back it up with really clear really really

1255
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,920
well done documentation.

1256
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:09,720
So you can deploy a system that is configured properly that does get updated or you can

1257
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,720
build it from scratch.

1258
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,520
Go to DigitalOcean.com and try it.

1259
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:17,400
One of the things I love about their web UI is the HTML5 console.

1260
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:21,600
Not only is that just a handy feature to have but the way DigitalOcean has implemented it

1261
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:27,080
there is some quote unquote power user features that you can take advantage of that really

1262
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,960
up the flexibility of a DigitalOcean droplet.

1263
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:30,960
Try it out.

1264
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:31,960
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1265
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,280
They got data centers all over the world.

1266
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,240
They got an API that will make you fall in love with the concept of APIs.

1267
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:42,280
You're like Chris you always talk about APIs and I say where the hell have you been.

1268
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,640
Seriously what where have you been.

1269
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,920
But if you want to see an API done well you go over to DigitalOcean.

1270
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:49,600
They have an intuitive API.

1271
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,200
They have utilities where you can just get right to work with it.

1272
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,200
They have libraries and frameworks and they got everything up the wazoo.

1273
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,480
I mean they got a wazoo even for it.

1274
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,480
It's incredible.

1275
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:04,240
I actually I don't know for sure but I suspect that their own tools like the interface to

1276
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,440
their website and all of that shenanigans must use the API.

1277
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,640
It's so well done.

1278
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,940
We use it every single day here at Jupiter Broadcasting for our DigitalOcean droplets.

1279
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:18,040
We turn on the things and we turn off the things all day long using the API.

1280
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:21,560
Even though their website is great I don't even have to log in.

1281
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,600
I do with a bot in our IRC chat room.

1282
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,960
You can deploy a new machine in seconds.

1283
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:30,520
All of their systems use SSDs from the five dollar a month rig all the way up to the ones

1284
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,960
with gigabytes of RAM.

1285
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,520
They have 40 gigabit connections coming into the hypervisor.

1286
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:36,000
You can have team accounts.

1287
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:40,200
They have highly available block storage and the pricing is ridiculous for three cents

1288
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,200
an hour.

1289
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:43,600
And remember we'll give you a ten dollar credit when you use the promo code D1Plugged for

1290
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:46,280
three cents an hour.

1291
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:50,800
Two gigs of RAM a two core processor 40 gigabyte SSD and three terabytes of transfer.

1292
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,960
They've also just launched their new load balancer service which is online and working

1293
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:55,960
right now.

1294
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,720
And it makes you look like a boss.

1295
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:03,160
Load balancers by DigitalOcean integrated in with their control panel 20 bucks a month.

1296
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,160
Boo yeah.

1297
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,160
Ridiculous.

1298
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:09,280
DigitalOcean.com use our promo code D1Plugged after you sign up and a big thank you to DigitalOcean

1299
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,760
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1300
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:14,840
Now I like the idea of you know those like coin machines you throw your coins in they

1301
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:17,000
sort them and give you money back.

1302
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,920
What about those but you just get like an AWS credit card you know.

1303
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,560
You're like hey I took my change and now I got servers.

1304
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,560
I love it.

1305
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:28,040
You know I've been I've been grousing off the air for the last couple of weeks that

1306
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:34,920
the fine folks that package up G streamer for Arch Linux move the old buggy unsupported

1307
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:40,600
G streamer 0.10 into the A U R. And that means every time I do an update I'm sitting there

1308
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:46,000
trying to build G streamer it makes my A U R updates take way longer on most my systems

1309
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,840
not all but most my system it fails to build anyways depending on your A U R client sometimes

1310
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,120
that stops the entire update process.

1311
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,140
It's a bad experience and if you've been running into this and I've seen people grousing about

1312
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:02,640
it in our chat room check to see if anything actually depends on G streamer 0.10 because

1313
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:05,560
it's old it's buggy it's unmaintained.

1314
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:07,000
You might just want to install all of it.

1315
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,480
I have the uninstall command just to take it all out in the show notes if you do and

1316
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:16,980
you have your or substitute your own package manager and after I did this purge things

1317
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:21,520
were running much better in my updates much smoother and it made me think about G streamer

1318
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:28,320
a little bit as something that I've been following now for almost a decade I think.

1319
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,960
It has sort of a reputation as well that's how I watch videos on GNOME.

1320
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,960
Why do I need G streamer building in the A U R it's that thing I use to watch my video

1321
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:43,920
but it actually has some pretty pretty as they say dope functionality Wes and I'm kind

1322
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,960
of curious about some of the playing you've done recently because it sounds like you've

1323
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,840
been kicking things around using G streamer and winning victories impressing the ladies

1324
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,960
and showing friends how it's done.

1325
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,960
Tell me all about it.

1326
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:00,280
I just I was just kind of rekindle I would have been playing with it maybe six months

1327
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,640
ago eight months ago and I've been playing with it more recently work just because it

1328
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:07,880
can do it has first class support for RTP and other things so you can use it to receive

1329
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:14,200
like media from say a SIP call but it also does RTMP which is something we do a lot here.

1330
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:18,360
Yeah we do.

1331
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:24,000
That's how we send our video stream up to DigitalOcean from DigitalOcean to ScaleEngine

1332
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,240
and YouTube and it just it just impresses me like there are some issues we've seen some

1333
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,640
security things where you know like hey G streamer runs and it supports these weird things

1334
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:35,520
and then that can cause you know it's not well tested or you have a bunch of like the

1335
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:42,360
bad set of plugins that aren't good quality but and I'm also a big fan of FM pick but

1336
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:44,800
I love that it has this like.

1337
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,800
Server side component to it.

1338
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:49,080
Well it has a server side component and it has like this notion of pipelines which is

1339
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,080
very powerful and composable.

1340
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:54,820
So like FM pick works great there's a lot of options but it's not quite as composable

1341
01:06:54,820 --> 01:07:02,680
or as clear, concise, well it's more concise but it's less like G streamer really has this

1342
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:06,500
much like a Unix command line model where you can just take different pieces stick them

1343
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:11,200
together build complex pipelines hey maybe you want to do like a video wall with four

1344
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,240
pictures up on a screen and a timestamp yeah G streamer does it all.

1345
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:19,760
I have a graphic up on the screen that kind of attempts to illustrate this a little bit

1346
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,200
because you can have like one of the pipes could be to a media player the other pipe

1347
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,160
could be to a streaming server the other pipe could be to a real-time video editor which

1348
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,840
is kind of a cool concept.

1349
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:34,880
The other thing with the latest G streamer I think it's like 1.10 or something like that

1350
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,800
they support Microsoft smooth streaming are you familiar with smooth streaming?

1351
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,800
No I'm not.

1352
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,880
So this is interesting to anybody who's on sort of a crappy connection smooth streaming

1353
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:51,600
is adaptive bitrate in real time so as your connection goes up it can stream a higher

1354
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:56,680
bitrate and it's not just bitrate it can also adapt resolution so it can change to from

1355
01:07:56,680 --> 01:08:01,120
to an HD picture down you know way down to whatever you have support for and G streamer

1356
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:04,360
has added support for that and that kind of got my attention because that's something

1357
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:08,480
I know that the live stream they've been looking for that scale engines working on that YouTube

1358
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,880
offers that somehow but I think you have to manually choose it kind of.

1359
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:18,920
So this is interesting G streamer is is so much more it's kind of like and boy this

1360
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:26,640
is a risky comparison to make but it has elements of QuickTime.

1361
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:31,080
People really commonly think of QuickTime is just that really shitty video player especially

1362
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,080
on Windows.

1363
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:38,960
I never really fought with it on Windows but I've heard horror stories and this it's just

1364
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,920
that's like that's the tip of the iceberg that's like the totem or the movie player

1365
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:43,920
on Gnome.

1366
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:51,600
The QuickTime plumbing and and and pipe system is what makes video editing on OS X better

1367
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:57,080
than pretty much all of the other platforms QuickTime and core animation and and the accelerated

1368
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:02,800
graphics capabilities that plug into the QuickTime pipeline system are are really the secret

1369
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:09,180
sauce of video editing and and motion compositing and work like that on OS X that if you don't

1370
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:13,080
use G streamer on Linux you have to cobble together with different libraries yourself

1371
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:18,760
and each editor in each or you know maybe Splendor whatever has to either find another

1372
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:26,400
stack create their stack out of a collection of libraries or use G streamer.

1373
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,360
What kind of stuff were you streaming around with?

1374
01:09:28,360 --> 01:09:31,040
I was doing the screencast or what?

1375
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,520
Yeah doing that I've seen some projects and I played with a little bit like doing like

1376
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,320
a video wall where you decompose a video into different segments and then send those each

1377
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:40,520
to a different computer attached like a pie attached to different TVs.

1378
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,560
So are you streaming right now from this machine because I saw your webcam was on earlier was

1379
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,760
earlier but I can be what is going on over there so what are you using what what software

1380
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,880
do you use on the desktop there to start the stream?

1381
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:51,880
G streamer.

1382
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:56,320
Okay so it's just a command command line yeah and you just say G streamer grab my webcam

1383
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:01,120
yeah and then send my webcam to yeah I have a URL if you want oh really where do I find

1384
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:06,880
this URL all right go to we'll open up maybe MPV because it'll be an RTMP stream all right

1385
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,680
oh oh all right all right let's do this right now here I'm gonna should I put is it okay

1386
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:15,200
to put up on the you okay with the URL being public yeah it's just westpain.com oh look

1387
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:18,320
at you I just needed I was just a droplet that I had a DNS name for.

1388
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:29,120
RTMP first RTMP oh right of course RTMP wes dot anything or westpain.com slash live slash

1389
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:35,360
test slash live slash test okay let's see if it works all right video stream discovered

1390
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:40,400
after having already parsed oh I like that I don't know what that means but I like it

1391
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:46,080
survey says oh some red some red oh oh we got it oh there it is hey that's me there's

1392
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:51,800
Wes's face there it is yeah we are but like at the same time if I want I could switch

1393
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:56,260
it to sending my desktop we could be sending this so does the desktop show up as a virtual

1394
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:01,240
camera or how does that so I'm gonna try lighting you whoa boom there we go now I'm so now you're

1395
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:04,320
lit let's see if that looks better on the stream here see what the delay it looks like

1396
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:10,800
about it's probably and then I hit cancel because I was gonna switch oh okay let's do

1397
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,280
this all right this is fast oh boom and it's down so it's about about a seven second eight

1398
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:18,000
second delay there yeah and probably some of that is this I'm doing like a ton of things

1399
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,040
and this is doing h264 conversion yeah yeah I believe you can get it to do like the quick

1400
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,760
sync or other types of hardware offloading but I do you have the IRC on this yeah I'd

1401
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:29,960
be curious to see what the if you paste it with the command you don't have to put the

1402
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,360
whole URL for your server in there but I'd be curious to see what the command looks like

1403
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,560
just so I can get an idea of how complicated that is because that's pretty nice Wes just

1404
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,560
to have that built into gstreamer right there yeah seems like something I mean you can do

1405
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,760
the same thing with ffmpeg there's a lot of overlap there so if that's your preferred

1406
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:48,040
tool that's usually what I use but it's neat and it exposes some options that you might

1407
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:52,080
not otherwise have and it makes it really neat to see like you saw some of those diagrams

1408
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:56,200
there like if you want to do like a whole bunch of multiplexing into one thing and then

1409
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,920
mix it and send it gstreamer it's a nice tool I was just thinking about how I would have

1410
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:04,840
maybe used this back when I was working in IT and I could totally see setting up a like

1411
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,440
a link on an intranet and I would say at this time let's go here and it would be a stream

1412
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:13,400
of my desktop and we could do like a tutorial or a walkthrough yeah totally could you also

1413
01:12:13,400 --> 01:12:17,120
is it pretty straightforward to set up audio capture yes I don't have that working right

1414
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:21,000
now sure yes so that seems like another like a headset it'd be a really nice way to do

1415
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,680
like tutorials internally or something it really well that's a great idea mm-hmm way

1416
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:29,760
of the future way of the future I'm gonna look more into it because I'm curious about

1417
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,320
smooth stream I mean I know it's a Microsoft technology but if it's something if it works

1418
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:39,200
well yeah I mean I really like the idea of it why not why can't why can't the player

1419
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:44,520
in the server talk and say okay this is looks like a first rate support for what people

1420
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:48,600
do with like dash or HLS yes so without it just having to like actually switch I don't

1421
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,760
know exactly I don't know if exactly like with HLS it's kind of a hack because we essentially

1422
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:56,300
do is have all of these different bitrate streams and you encapsulate them in a playlist

1423
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:59,520
and then you throw them at somebody as fast as possible and it's possible to jump from

1424
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:04,480
one one playlist stream to the other but most clients don't get that right and it all depends

1425
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:09,520
on how good the client is if this is like you get one stream and this is my understanding

1426
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,080
because I was looking at how flow soft has implemented and the way they do it is it's

1427
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:18,640
one stream and you you connect to this stream and it adjusts the resolution and bitrate

1428
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,500
in a range that they have set up for that stream so they predefined a range of what

1429
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:27,280
the smooth stream can can fluctuate between and then you just connect to that one URL

1430
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:32,240
interesting like a nice client experience yes yes could be a game you have to play with

1431
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:36,760
some more game changer as they say Wes well interesting so where did you learn where did

1432
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:40,320
you learn all these shenanigans about G streamer you can find like they have a G streamer cheat

1433
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,960
sheet there's a lot of bloggers one thing I will say is the documentation could be improved

1434
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:50,160
there's a lot of stuff there's a lot of documentation for that old zero dot one zero release so

1435
01:13:50,160 --> 01:13:52,960
some things have changed there's different command line options different parameters

1436
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,520
to the plugins watch out for that but the 1.0 1.10 version can pretty much do all the

1437
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:02,600
same stuff so you just have to tweak it a little bit very nice very nice thanks Wes

1438
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:08,080
also Mr. Gogo in the chat room points out that the blog post about that teddy bear breach

1439
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:11,960
yes is really good including more details about the company's response and I have that

1440
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:16,040
linked in the show notes if you want to read more and they have other videos that are also

1441
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:20,240
just as horrible all of that's linked up in the show notes you can go check that out go

1449
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:59,220
me youtube.com slash Chris Fisher I'm going to have a behind the scenes edition of this

1450
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:26,080
here show there see you next week.

1451
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:47,120
So you know what's a real son of a bitch last week as I said Australia instead of Austria

1452
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:51,680
that's a real son of a bitch and I think the problem is is that I think the same thing

1453
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:56,040
so it's fine it's fine I think in part the problem is is that I'm probably dyslexic but

1454
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:04,400
I think the other thing is is that I'm not when I'm on the air my primary focus isn't

1455
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:09,720
reading it's talking yeah right it's a different thing and it's talking about what I'm reading

1456
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:14,600
and it it gets me more often than I'd like and then the other thing that compounds is

1457
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:18,400
we don't edit very heavily so it's not like I go back and edit for content right like

1458
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,400
if it was user air I would probably affix that because that's I did do that you would

1459
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:27,160
have caught it but in this show I'm like no it's it's live to tape oh man it gets me

1460
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:30,800
you know the thing is is then you also have to multiply it by volume because I do so many

1461
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,920
shows and I've been doing them for so long like this just there's so many out there where

1462
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,440
I've done this you can't win I cannot win nope I cannot so even track so as long as

1463
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:44,440
everybody sets their expectations remembers that I am a simple man who can only do so

1464
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:48,080
many things the things you say they'll probably start with the right letters so and you know

1465
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:53,760
what else you know what else it's theater of the mind it's mad libs podcasting everybody

1466
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,160
and you know it might be fun for the viewer we'll just try to make more mistakes and just

1467
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:18,480
see if you guys can catch them watch out
