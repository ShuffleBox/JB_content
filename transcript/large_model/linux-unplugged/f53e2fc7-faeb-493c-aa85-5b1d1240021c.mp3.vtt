WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
Did I miss all the media server discussions the last couple of weeks completely?

00:06.240 --> 00:08.360
We have had some on and off.

00:08.360 --> 00:12.560
It's sort of like a project I have been working on because I want to do a review for the Linux

00:12.560 --> 00:19.400
action show and I've been kind of going through Open Media Vault, Rock Filer, of course FreeNAS

00:19.400 --> 00:22.840
I'm familiar with, so I kind of just, I'm bringing some of that into it without actually

00:22.840 --> 00:28.240
currently, I mean I currently use FreeNAS but I'm not currently installing it, and Open

00:28.240 --> 00:29.240
Filer I believe.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.240
Did I say Open Filer?

00:30.240 --> 00:34.200
That's what we agreed you weren't going to look at.

00:34.200 --> 00:38.160
Which has all been whittled down to Open Media Vault just simply based on looking at either

00:38.160 --> 00:43.320
the fact that what their technology stack is or how long they've been since they've

00:43.320 --> 00:47.360
been updated or what Wimpy's been poking me about that's gotten me excited, you know all

00:47.360 --> 00:48.960
those things factoring.

00:48.960 --> 00:53.040
But actually legitimately looking at it all it seems like Open Media Vault has the best

00:53.040 --> 00:56.960
trajectory and long term sustainability for a project like this which is exactly what

00:56.960 --> 01:00.480
I want for my file server and I like the folks behind it and I like the whole stack and I

01:00.480 --> 01:04.600
like the community so Open Media Vault is the winner so now that's the one I'm going

01:04.600 --> 01:05.600
to focus on for the review.

01:05.600 --> 01:12.360
And I have a basic, basic setup on a NUC right now, an i7 older generation NUC but

01:12.360 --> 01:20.520
it does have USB 3 attached to a 3TB RAID 1 disk setup over USB 3.0 and that's also

01:20.520 --> 01:29.600
connected to a, what are those called, a UPS which I'm hoping to test like Open Media Vault

01:29.600 --> 01:32.200
support for that which I haven't gotten to yet, I haven't actually hooked it all up.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.080
It supports that, that's how I run it.

01:34.080 --> 01:37.400
Yeah and I want to just test that all and then I also plan to test how much power it

01:37.400 --> 01:40.520
draws and all of that stuff.

01:40.520 --> 01:51.080
This is Linux Unplugged episode 159 for August 23rd, 2016.

01:51.080 --> 02:01.480
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux podcast that's broadcasting from all over

02:01.480 --> 02:05.000
the world right here, right now.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
My name is Chris.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
And I'm Angela.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
Hello Angela.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Hello.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
It's great to have you in studio.

02:10.000 --> 02:13.360
A couple of people will be joining us this week to keep us grounded, to give us the new

02:13.360 --> 02:18.520
user's perspective but fear not, Mr. Payne's reporting in from the field on location.

02:18.520 --> 02:19.520
Hello Wes.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.800
Hello everyone, it's good to be here.

02:21.800 --> 02:22.800
Hello hello.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.120
So we have a great show lined up today.

02:25.120 --> 02:29.480
We got some big open source project updates to give you, of course, Linux cons going on,

02:29.480 --> 02:31.720
there's a bit of interesting tidbits that came out of that.

02:31.720 --> 02:35.320
A couple of gentlemen from the elementary OS project have stopped by to tell us what

02:35.320 --> 02:37.080
they've got cooking.

02:37.080 --> 02:40.200
Later on in the show, I'll tell you about some of my woes.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.040
I know I love myself the rolling release, but I think I finally got bit this morning

02:44.040 --> 02:46.280
in the worst way possible.

02:46.280 --> 02:48.400
I'll tell you about that coming up in the show.

02:48.400 --> 02:53.320
Then later on, LibreVault, it promises to replace BitTorrent Sync and Syncthing, bring

02:53.320 --> 02:57.400
the best of both of them to one GPL3 based project.

02:57.400 --> 03:01.840
What is it and why do we keep talking about it and is it actually feasible?

03:01.840 --> 03:06.080
LibreVault gets a little test today and will give you our report.

03:06.080 --> 03:11.400
And then later on in the show, the new version of Android is out, Marshmallow?

03:11.400 --> 03:12.400
No more.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.200
It's all about that nougat now.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.200
I've got it loaded.

03:15.200 --> 03:20.440
I'll give you my first thoughts and why I think it's damn near time I switch to Ubuntu

03:20.440 --> 03:21.440
Touch.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.440
That's right.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.440
That's right.

03:23.440 --> 03:28.280
I'm actually, you know, the thing is every now and then you got to reassess and that's

03:28.280 --> 03:29.280
the phase I'm at.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.280
So I'll share that with you guys.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.200
But first, we got to bring in our virtual lug.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.400
Some appropriate greetings, MumbleRoom.

03:36.400 --> 03:41.680
Oh my gosh.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.680
Powerful stuff today.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.680
Oh, I feel kind of violated almost.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.320
You all right, Ange?

03:46.320 --> 03:47.320
That is a room.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.320
That is a room.

03:48.320 --> 03:49.320
All right.

03:49.320 --> 03:52.120
So you guys have all heard the big news today.

03:52.120 --> 03:55.400
Microsoft's got you scratching your heads with the announcement of PowerShell coming

03:55.400 --> 03:56.400
to Linux.

03:56.400 --> 03:59.040
GNU slash Linux is now the home of PowerShell.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.160
First it started with.NET and then of course the next domino to fall was the.NET base.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.080
PowerShell.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.560
Microsoft obviously reaching out to system administrators that have to manage Windows

04:07.560 --> 04:13.560
boxes from Linux boxes and as your enthusiast, but I have to tell you, every time Microsoft

04:13.560 --> 04:19.080
makes a move like this, I kind of sit here and go, what's next?

04:19.080 --> 04:20.080
What is next?

04:20.080 --> 04:25.880
It started really with.NET and then Visual Studio Code and now this.

04:25.880 --> 04:31.440
And I thought for a second here and I thought, holy, holy crap.

04:31.440 --> 04:35.480
Did Microsoft just become one of the biggest proprietary companies in the world to figure

04:35.480 --> 04:37.280
out how to make money on open source?

04:37.280 --> 04:39.720
Oh, that's a thought.

04:39.720 --> 04:40.720
Kind of.

04:40.720 --> 04:41.720
Right.

04:41.720 --> 04:42.920
We always talk about how do you make money on open source.

04:42.920 --> 04:48.760
Meanwhile, Microsoft comes along and they figure out how to actually sell software as

04:48.760 --> 04:54.840
a service via Azure and then how to use open source as sort of its backup dancers to bring

04:54.840 --> 04:59.280
people into its platform and generate revenue.

04:59.280 --> 05:00.280
Who would have thought?

05:00.280 --> 05:01.280
Microsoft.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.000
It's fascinating to watch them do this.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.560
Wes, have you messed at all with PowerShell?

05:06.560 --> 05:09.880
I've written some things back in the dark days when I had Windows machines to support.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.880
Thankfully not anymore.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.120
It's kind of an interesting environment.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.080
You get all the.NET goodness.

05:15.080 --> 05:19.080
A lot of people talk about how cool it is to pass objects around in the pipeline.

05:19.080 --> 05:22.960
It's kind of got a neat, you get class-based things.

05:22.960 --> 05:27.400
You have all the access to the.NET stuff and at the same time, you have what you might

05:27.400 --> 05:29.920
call function composition where you can pass things to each other.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.560
You don't have to parse text.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.640
You can just get properties of objects.

05:33.640 --> 05:38.560
That's neat, but personally, I'm kind of more interested in Python or other things like

05:38.560 --> 05:39.560
that.

05:39.560 --> 05:43.720
I don't see that much of a need, but for interoperability and working with Windows tools, definitely

05:43.720 --> 05:47.360
it's far better than the Windows command line.

05:47.360 --> 05:48.720
Mr. Tonell there has to…

05:48.720 --> 05:51.240
I totally agree with Wes.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.240
What's the point?

05:52.240 --> 05:53.240
Python exists.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.240
Bash exists.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.720
As a system admin, I don't need PowerShell.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.880
I think Ange could tell you.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.240
So Ange, picture this.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.240
Here it's me.

06:00.240 --> 06:03.240
We were just talking on the pre-show back in the bad old days when I had to use Outlook

06:03.240 --> 06:05.280
under Crossover Office.

06:05.280 --> 06:09.240
I would do whatever it took to be able to manage the Windows systems I was responsible

06:09.240 --> 06:11.680
for from a Linux desktop.

06:11.680 --> 06:18.840
And for me, if I could have had a Linux-compatible Windows automation tool where I could have

06:18.840 --> 06:24.720
wrote scripts for Windows systems from my Linux box, I totally would have jumped on

06:24.720 --> 06:26.000
that.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.280
And so I think that's who it's for.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.280
I kind of agree.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.280
Go ahead.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.280
Ansible?

06:31.280 --> 06:32.280
Yeah, I know.

06:32.280 --> 06:33.280
Right.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.760
And I think that's where, I think that's why this move is necessary for them to keep

06:35.760 --> 06:36.760
this tool relevant.

06:36.760 --> 06:37.760
Great.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.280
So it's doing what Microsoft have always done, it's reacting.

06:40.280 --> 06:43.640
It's not being this trailblazer that you make them out to be, it's reacting.

06:43.640 --> 06:46.800
I don't know if I mean to make them out to be a trailblazer so much as I am sort of

06:46.800 --> 06:51.840
in awe of the fact that they keep doing this and I just don't know where it's going

06:51.840 --> 06:52.840
to end.

06:52.840 --> 06:53.840
That's fair.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.360
That's the story that fascinates me about it.

06:55.360 --> 06:59.840
I think you have to acknowledge that this is without a doubt about revenue for them

06:59.840 --> 07:02.720
and they wouldn't be doing it without it, without that motivation.

07:02.720 --> 07:08.120
They're not doing it for – they're not doing it for RMS purposes, right Mr. Tunnell?

07:08.120 --> 07:10.920
Yeah, they're selectively listening to RMS.

07:10.920 --> 07:17.140
So like showing that you could give away the software and use the services to make money

07:17.140 --> 07:22.720
like RMS has said for years but then you know, also proprietary and everything else.

07:22.720 --> 07:23.720
Yeah.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.960
So – but you know what?

07:25.960 --> 07:33.680
In some weird kind of way, I think it's actually better for a company like Microsoft

07:33.680 --> 07:39.160
that it's the bottom line that's forcing them to do this and not some moral rationale

07:39.160 --> 07:43.840
because leadership as we've seen at Microsoft changes.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.600
Board members can make things move around.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.400
There's corporate restructuring that's happened.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.640
There's many layoffs that happen at Microsoft.

07:49.640 --> 07:53.520
CEOs even come and go over time at Microsoft.

07:53.520 --> 08:00.560
If it's a moral sort of community imperative that's driving them, that could easily change

08:00.560 --> 08:04.120
with the next CEO or the next board or –

08:04.120 --> 08:05.840
You can't argue with the bottom line though.

08:05.840 --> 08:06.840
Exactly.

08:06.840 --> 08:07.840
Very well said.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.760
Yeah, it keeps a company like Microsoft in the game because their livelihood depends

08:10.760 --> 08:11.760
on it.

08:11.760 --> 08:16.080
It's also a good example of showing how the open source system – like the open source

08:16.080 --> 08:19.380
software works in a way that a lot of people say it doesn't because you can't make

08:19.380 --> 08:21.420
money off giving away stuff and like when –

08:21.420 --> 08:25.080
A lot of people – you mean like Microsoft has said, like Microsoft has said for a long

08:25.080 --> 08:26.080
time.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.080
Right.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.080
That's true.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.080
Yeah.

08:29.080 --> 08:32.160
Well, I was referencing like people who were like regurgitating what Microsoft says but

08:32.160 --> 08:36.160
the fact that Microsoft is changing their tune is maybe a way to show that everybody

08:36.160 --> 08:40.840
else that – there is a reason why open source works.

08:40.840 --> 08:41.840
I don't know –

08:41.840 --> 08:48.400
Chris, I kind of think this relates to my prediction that I made a long ago about Microsoft

08:48.400 --> 08:51.720
and Canonical and that because if you think about it –

08:51.720 --> 08:56.920
Are you foreseeing a merger here, a marriage of two companies?

08:56.920 --> 09:05.440
Yeah, especially after the release of Ubuntu 17.04 which will be the last in alphabetical

09:05.440 --> 09:08.480
order and that will be Z.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.840
And then after that, because Mark's run out of letters, he's going to call it good?

09:12.840 --> 09:14.840
Yeah, pretty much.

09:14.840 --> 09:15.840
You know what?

09:15.840 --> 09:16.840
It's just a double A.

09:16.840 --> 09:17.840
Yeah.

09:17.840 --> 09:18.840
You're right, Mr. Lou.

09:18.840 --> 09:19.840
Maybe you're right.

09:19.840 --> 09:20.840
I've heard crazier theories.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.880
There's still A and C which haven't been filmed yet so there's a couple more releases

09:23.880 --> 09:25.520
to go.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.200
This week is the 25th birthday of Linux.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.200
Happy birthday, Linux.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.360
I'd play the jingle but it would get us pulled down.

09:32.360 --> 09:37.720
I know the Linux Foundation as they do likes to note the occasion and they've noted a

09:37.720 --> 09:42.500
couple of things that are interesting, 13,500 developers from more than 1300 companies have

09:42.500 --> 09:48.080
contributed to the Linux kernel since the adoption of Git made detailed tracking possible.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.360
Now that is something else.

09:49.360 --> 09:52.600
5,000 developers from 400 companies have contributed to the kernel.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.920
Nearly half these developers contributed for the first time.

09:54.920 --> 09:58.760
The top 10 organizations sponsoring Linux kernel development since the last report include

09:58.760 --> 10:09.000
Intel, Red Hat, Lenoir, Samsung, SUSE, IBM, Google, AMD, Texas Instruments, and you guessed

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
it, ARM.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.440
Oh, I didn't hear Microsoft in there.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.680
You know they actually did show up on the radar for one year.

10:15.680 --> 10:16.680
Really?

10:16.680 --> 10:17.800
Yeah, they did.

10:17.800 --> 10:22.340
They were contributing to making the drivers for Hyper-V. The rate of Linux development

10:22.340 --> 10:25.880
continues to increase as does the number of developers and companies involved in the process.

10:25.880 --> 10:31.400
The average number of changes except in the Linux kernel per hour is point or 7.8 which

10:31.400 --> 10:33.880
is up from 7.71 in the last report.

10:33.880 --> 10:38.320
What is kind of not really said here but is fascinating is and I guess I'd kind of be

10:38.320 --> 10:42.600
curious to get the Mumble Room's take on this, predominantly the contribution to Linux

10:42.600 --> 10:47.440
kernel is corporate sponsors, companies.

10:47.440 --> 10:51.680
Does anybody have any qualms about the fact that predominantly all of Linux is developed

10:51.680 --> 10:54.080
by commercial companies trying to make money off Linux?

10:54.080 --> 11:01.600
Chris, this is kind of not really but in order to say happy birthday to Linux, I only have

11:01.600 --> 11:06.520
one thing to say and I say it in the chat room a lot whenever he's brought up.

11:06.520 --> 11:11.840
All hail King Linus!

11:11.840 --> 11:14.280
And the value of this is negative.

11:14.280 --> 11:17.000
So okay, go ahead Mr. Bitton.

11:17.000 --> 11:22.600
And to celebrate the Sphinx Linux Foundation told on their keynotes on Thursday people

11:22.600 --> 11:28.120
are going to have a black tie or a penguin or a Linux related shirt.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.120
I wish we could have gone.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.440
Toronto though kind of made it unfeasible for us to go but yeah, they've been doing

11:32.440 --> 11:33.440
the keynotes.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.520
There is a live stream and you've been watching it.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.760
Yeah, at least one or two hours.

11:37.760 --> 11:41.280
I've been busy with work but I watched the first ones at least.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.360
And anything jump out at you?

11:42.360 --> 11:44.640
Any kind of impressions you took away?

11:44.640 --> 11:49.640
I haven't really think that much about it.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.840
Yeah, I guess that's what struck you, huh?

11:52.840 --> 11:57.400
I only had time to watch an hour, I was too busy and stuff.

11:57.400 --> 12:01.040
Yeah it was just a little expensive for us to go but I would have liked to have attended.

12:01.040 --> 12:02.680
It's always fun to be able to go to those events.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.280
I did make it last year when they had it in Seattle.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.280
That was good.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.040
It wasn't just too long ago.

12:07.040 --> 12:11.720
All right, so we are going to chat with the gentleman from Elementary OS here in just

12:11.720 --> 12:12.720
a moment.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.320
They've got something pretty cool they're working on and you may have seen it go by

12:15.320 --> 12:18.880
if you've been watching the Twitters or the Reddits and we're going to talk to him about

12:18.880 --> 12:19.880
it.

12:19.880 --> 12:22.840
But first, I want to talk to you about my mobile service provider and that's Ting.

12:22.840 --> 12:29.240
Go to linux.ting.com to get a $25 discount off your first device or if you bring a device,

12:29.240 --> 12:31.680
you'll get $25 in service credit.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.480
Now you could probably scrounge up a device because they support CDMA and GSM.

12:35.480 --> 12:38.960
You just go to their BYOD page and find out which ones are supported.

12:38.960 --> 12:42.200
They're on a mission to really make mobile simple.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.000
It's just your minutes, your messages and your megabytes.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.120
You just pay for them individually.

12:45.120 --> 12:49.320
What you use is what you pay for at $6 for the line plus Uncle Sam's dirty take like

12:49.320 --> 12:50.320
he always does.

12:50.320 --> 12:54.520
He's got his hand in your pocket, that Uncle Sam and it's really straightforward.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.560
Your customer service is amazing.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.240
They've got regular human beings that are geeks that you get to talk to.

12:59.240 --> 13:04.640
You've got an incredible control panel and Ange, did you hear about the big news for

13:04.640 --> 13:05.640
Ting?

13:05.640 --> 13:06.640
There's big news afoot, Ange.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.080
They've dropped their data prices on Ting.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.080
Did you hear about this?

13:09.080 --> 13:10.080
Oh, that's great.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.080
Yeah, check it out.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.080
It's kind of a big deal.

13:12.080 --> 13:16.200
So they've now gotten competitive across the board with just about damn near anybody.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.400
Pay for what you use wireless is a great model.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.000
No gimmicks, no leather jackets required.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.280
Data is now cheaper on Ting.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.440
From now on, prices look like this.

13:26.440 --> 13:27.440
Need more?

13:27.440 --> 13:28.440
It's just $10 a gig.

13:28.440 --> 13:32.440
That's what new customers pay, that's what current customers pay.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.440
It's simple.

13:33.440 --> 13:34.440
We like simple.

13:34.440 --> 13:38.360
See for yourself at ting.com slash rates.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.720
So they're doing $10 per gigabyte beyond the one gigabyte level.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.080
Really simple to understand.

13:43.080 --> 13:46.000
Ting's data pricing is obvious and if you want to know more, they have a great blog

13:46.000 --> 13:47.160
post about it.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.840
Start by going to linux.ting.com, check out any of their devices.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.840
Feature phones all the way up to real nice Cadillac devices.

13:53.840 --> 13:59.240
In fact, if I recall, they're doing a giveaway of, yeah, the Galaxy S7 Edge.

13:59.240 --> 14:00.240
Oh man.

14:00.240 --> 14:07.960
Oh man, 3600 milliamp battery, Arduino 430 GPU, four gigabytes of RAM, 5.5 inch quad

14:07.960 --> 14:11.800
HD display, and they're giving it away for free.

14:11.800 --> 14:12.800
You just got to subscribe.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.800
Making me drool, Chris.

14:13.800 --> 14:14.800
I know.

14:14.800 --> 14:15.800
Making me drool.

14:15.800 --> 14:16.800
Wes, it's like the Cadillac.

14:16.800 --> 14:17.800
It's the Cadillac, Wes.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.680
You got to subscribe to their Ting account on YouTube.

14:19.680 --> 14:20.680
Simple, simple, simple.

14:20.680 --> 14:26.800
And then comment on their unboxing video and do that in the next three days.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.800
So think about that.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.760
You subscribe to their channel, you comment on the video, and by the 26th, you could get

14:31.760 --> 14:32.900
a free S7.

14:32.900 --> 14:36.720
They do this a lot too, so it's worth doing if you want a free phone because that's not

14:36.720 --> 14:38.440
going to be a huge group.

14:38.440 --> 14:41.880
And this is going out to a lot of folks that could act on that, so I would jump in.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.120
See if you could get that free phone and then let me know.

14:44.120 --> 14:46.240
I would, oh man, I'd be so jelly.

14:46.240 --> 14:48.080
Free S7 on Ting, there's nothing better.

14:48.080 --> 14:51.400
You take some of the best phones, you put them on the Ting network, it's a match made

14:51.400 --> 14:52.400
in heaven.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.400
Pay for what you use.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.400
They don't get in the way of the updates.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.840
I've got the Nexus 6P and guess what?

14:55.840 --> 14:59.960
I'm already running Android N. Ting doesn't play that game where they get in the way of

14:59.960 --> 15:00.960
your updates.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.160
They get you basically a dumb pipe.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.720
If you want to use it for data, go ahead.

15:05.720 --> 15:07.320
You want to use it to make calls, Ting don't care.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.440
They're Honey Badger and that's what I love about it.

15:09.440 --> 15:10.880
They just get you connected.

15:10.880 --> 15:16.040
Linux.Ting.com and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring your unplugged program and

15:16.040 --> 15:18.400
thanks to all of you guys out there for visiting.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.600
That's what keeps us on the air.

15:20.600 --> 15:26.040
Linux.Ting.com and then maybe go get yourself an S7 and then make me totes jelly.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.120
I would love that.

15:27.120 --> 15:32.240
So Lewis and Fabian are joining us today from Elementary OS and they're going to talk

15:32.240 --> 15:36.080
to us about a little hack fest they're trying to put together in Paris.

15:36.080 --> 15:40.440
In fact they've raised an IndieGoGo page to try to get some funding going to make this

15:40.440 --> 15:41.440
thing possible.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.840
So gentlemen, welcome to the show and I don't know if you guys want to fight it out between

15:45.840 --> 15:50.400
you maybe to the death Kirk and Spock style and tell me which one of you wants to start

15:50.400 --> 15:55.040
with why an IndieGoGo page for a hack fest.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.960
Yeah I think I'll take that one.

15:56.960 --> 15:59.880
Go ahead.

15:59.880 --> 16:09.200
We currently raise funds on our website and that mainly goes to the elementary employees

16:09.200 --> 16:13.640
and those funds are pretty tied up with paying the employees.

16:13.640 --> 16:23.220
So we thought it would be a good idea to raise the money for the hack fest separately.

16:23.220 --> 16:29.280
So we don't cut into the money we need for the employees.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.440
And Fabian you're located in Paris right?

16:32.440 --> 16:40.760
No I'm actually located in Switzerland but because the event is in Paris we put that

16:40.760 --> 16:42.760
as a place there.

16:42.760 --> 16:46.560
And so what's going to take place at a hack fest like this?

16:46.560 --> 16:50.400
Is this sort of the kick off for the next version of elementary OS sort of get everybody

16:50.400 --> 16:54.960
together in one room and brainstorm and begin writing code?

16:54.960 --> 16:56.940
Yeah that's the idea here.

16:56.940 --> 17:06.200
We want to brainstorm what we want to do for the next release but also look at a few things

17:06.200 --> 17:14.560
we already have on our bug tracker maybe and maybe do a little bit of finishing work on

17:14.560 --> 17:15.560
Loki.

17:15.560 --> 17:16.560
Okay.

17:16.560 --> 17:17.560
It depends.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.560
We have to see.

17:18.560 --> 17:23.680
Do you plan to have any kind of like report or summary or anything interesting for people

17:23.680 --> 17:28.800
who do support you to see what awesome things come out of this hack fest?

17:28.800 --> 17:34.160
Yeah we are planning to do a blog post on it at least.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.560
Not sure what will be in it yet but.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.560
Well right.

17:37.560 --> 17:38.560
Great.

17:38.560 --> 17:43.440
So you're raising funds for this hack fest but is attendance free?

17:43.440 --> 17:46.760
Or will there be a sign up page where a fee is paid?

17:46.760 --> 17:50.040
Actually I think that's a clear point to make to kind of for people to understand it's not

17:50.040 --> 17:52.040
necessarily for people to attend.

17:52.040 --> 17:55.800
It's not like a like a fest or an event is it?

17:55.800 --> 18:00.640
It's not necessarily something that's closed but it's something where currently there's

18:00.640 --> 18:05.800
just a gist that people are commenting on and it's just sort of getting people organized

18:05.800 --> 18:06.800
who are going to pop in.

18:06.800 --> 18:12.880
But this is a four day thing so the people that are staying over are just elementary

18:12.880 --> 18:15.200
people who have been pre-organized.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.740
So you're right that it's not totally open as such.

18:18.740 --> 18:22.480
It is sort of you need to ask to attend.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.880
Man I wish we had somebody we could send.

18:24.880 --> 18:31.680
So I know maybe if we want to give Lewis a chance to jump in.

18:31.680 --> 18:36.060
You know I've read some of the comments guys and like on some subreddits and things like

18:36.060 --> 18:41.280
that and people just don't seem to grok the value in you guys doing this.

18:41.280 --> 18:43.200
Why not do a Google hangout?

18:43.200 --> 18:45.020
I guess you know and I'm looking at it right now.

18:45.020 --> 18:47.560
You guys launched it yesterday and you're already doing pretty good.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.840
You've got 26 backers.

18:49.840 --> 18:55.560
That's $493 U.S. have been raised and you have a real reasonable goal of $1800.

18:55.560 --> 18:59.520
I'm almost surprised to see you haven't popped it yet and I kind of wanted to give you guys

18:59.520 --> 19:04.960
a chance to sort of explain why sort of a in-person meeting is actually important to

19:04.960 --> 19:05.960
the process.

19:05.960 --> 19:11.680
Lewis do you want to jump on that one?

19:11.680 --> 19:12.680
Sure.

19:12.680 --> 19:18.240
Well historically we haven't sort of had much of meetings going on in the European community.

19:18.240 --> 19:22.360
I think there was some things that have been attended in Germany but that was a case of

19:22.360 --> 19:27.360
people who are actually employees of elementary being flown over from America.

19:27.360 --> 19:31.240
So this will be the first time that that sort of group of people have actually met each

19:31.240 --> 19:32.240
other.

19:32.240 --> 19:39.000
Obviously we think that when the sort of American siblings of that community have got together

19:39.000 --> 19:44.000
they've got a ridiculous amount of work and some very long-standing stuff sorted out over

19:44.000 --> 19:49.600
the course of a few days just because it's so much faster to be talking in person and

19:49.600 --> 19:54.080
you can just show someone your screen instead of needing to screenshot it and upload it

19:54.080 --> 19:57.560
somewhere and post it and have a discussion about that.

19:57.560 --> 20:06.320
It's so much quicker to do that in person than it is to do that online as you do normally.

20:06.320 --> 20:11.040
Even when there's only two or three people meeting up we've seen just there'll just

20:11.040 --> 20:16.120
be a flood of stuff suddenly get fixed and you can just tell it's all just coming off

20:16.120 --> 20:18.600
of them typically.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.920
And there's that.

20:20.920 --> 20:26.160
There's like the actual code that gets created or the documentation or the project outline

20:26.160 --> 20:30.840
but Wimby I kind of want to throw it to you just for a moment because I think you'll

20:30.840 --> 20:32.080
agree with me.

20:32.080 --> 20:37.360
There's also an energy or an enthusiasm that sort of gets created and then shared amongst

20:37.360 --> 20:41.800
the team when you have an in-person meeting that translates to actual productive work.

20:41.800 --> 20:42.800
Do you agree?

20:42.800 --> 20:43.840
Yeah I do.

20:43.840 --> 20:51.120
So I haven't met Fabian or Lewis but I did meet three of their colleagues at the Snappy

20:51.120 --> 20:58.040
Sprint a few weeks ago and that was Daniel, Kortan and Cody.

20:58.040 --> 21:04.800
And prior to that I'd got a passing sort of more or less developer acquaintance with Cody

21:04.800 --> 21:10.400
and I kind of knew of Daniel but didn't really know him and through the course of that week

21:10.400 --> 21:19.400
although we were focused on Snappy stuff during the day out of the Sprint you develop some

21:19.400 --> 21:25.000
personal relationships and some friendships and some understanding as to who these people

21:25.000 --> 21:32.280
are that you're trying to communicate with that outlives that brief period of you being

21:32.280 --> 21:38.840
in the same room together and now means that we have a much easier way of communicating

21:38.840 --> 21:43.120
with each other over the internet having spent some time in person.

21:43.120 --> 21:48.760
Yeah it makes those text chats easier to parse because you have a personality model to apply

21:48.760 --> 21:49.760
it to.

21:49.760 --> 21:56.680
Yeah and I absolutely see the value in elementary crowdfunding a get together like this because

21:56.680 --> 22:01.560
actually getting people in the same place together isn't only productive but it builds

22:01.560 --> 22:06.520
those relationships those working relationships and those personal understandings that really

22:06.520 --> 22:13.600
bind a project together so I'm all in favor of what elementary are doing here and I think

22:13.600 --> 22:20.800
that crowdfunding not just these kind of activities but crowdfunding in general is the financing

22:20.800 --> 22:24.920
model for independent open source projects for the 21st century.

22:24.920 --> 22:27.340
Why do you think that?

22:27.340 --> 22:34.080
Because it works you don't have to ask for lots of down payment and investment from individuals

22:34.080 --> 22:40.480
what you're looking for is small affordable amounts of money from lots of people and and

22:40.480 --> 22:46.360
you can do an awful lot with that and I think that that model works very well there's certainly

22:46.360 --> 22:54.400
a place for corporate sponsorship and corporate led you know projects and governance and things

22:54.400 --> 22:59.320
like that but for the independent projects I think crowdsourcing is you know it's still

22:59.320 --> 23:03.200
fairly new and in its infancy and I think people are still finding their way with the

23:03.200 --> 23:10.560
blend and how to do things but different people need to explore the options and find out where

23:10.560 --> 23:16.780
it works where it's unsuccessful and then refine that and reproduce it in the future.

23:16.780 --> 23:23.260
So and perhaps Fabian or Lewis if you guys I'm noticing something you're doing and Wimpy

23:23.260 --> 23:28.120
just totally touched on it perfectly that blending of funding for open source projects

23:28.120 --> 23:33.200
so the best model I have is Jupiter broadcast and we have sponsors like you just heard from

23:33.200 --> 23:38.600
and we have Patreon and we blend the two to sort of balance out not only multiple revenue

23:38.600 --> 23:44.260
streams so if one dies we don't die as a company but two so we can sort of leverage one to

23:44.260 --> 23:50.000
build projects up like for example we have something coming soon that we're relying on

23:50.000 --> 23:54.960
the crowd funding to actually finance the creation of this thing to make it viable so

23:54.960 --> 23:59.320
that and which is really great because there's no outside influence on creating this new

23:59.320 --> 24:04.880
thing but it's not it's not just one or the other and I think it was Fabian who said one

24:04.880 --> 24:09.360
of the things they're doing here ooh a little ambiance there I like that one of the things

24:09.360 --> 24:13.120
Fabian said they're doing here is we use the traditional funding model we have to pay full

24:13.120 --> 24:16.920
time employees and because this is something sort of above and beyond what we normally

24:16.920 --> 24:22.220
do we're going back to our user base and saying please help us here do you guys want to touch

24:22.220 --> 24:29.320
on at all why why break it out like this is it is it is it mainly down to things are pretty

24:29.320 --> 24:32.760
tight and it's hard to raise funds so when you want to do something big like this are

24:32.760 --> 24:38.240
you going to the user base hoping that they'll do the same people who may already be funding

24:38.240 --> 24:42.840
it will go above and beyond or are you hoping that new folks will come into the fold Fabian

24:42.840 --> 24:51.560
do you want to take that yeah the reasons for this are probably both and we do want

24:51.560 --> 24:59.600
new users to contribute who maybe didn't complete contribute when they first got elementary

24:59.600 --> 25:10.280
hours they've been impressed by now yeah or also get the users that are using it and liking

25:10.280 --> 25:19.280
it to directly impact changes now because getting together like that will certainly

25:19.280 --> 25:27.840
help push the next release out faster so I just want to vote I guess vote with my own

25:27.840 --> 25:33.760
wallet here by the way Ange I backed it today I threw in some just a little bit of money

25:33.760 --> 25:37.880
this this they so they have the indiegogo indiegogo campaign which we will link in the

25:37.880 --> 25:42.600
show notes the elementary hack fest in Paris I threw some money just because on my own

25:42.600 --> 25:48.160
professional experience I can tell you absolutely that first of all eight hundred dollars is

25:48.160 --> 25:53.080
a ridiculously low amount for what you guys are doing and and what the value of what you're

25:53.080 --> 25:59.240
doing is is easily ten thousand twenty thousand dollars because it's not just about getting

25:59.240 --> 26:03.800
there if you guys if you guys literally did nothing but bullshit and hang out the entire

26:03.800 --> 26:09.520
time and didn't write a line of code the value for the end users of having a tighter knit

26:09.520 --> 26:14.880
team that likes each other more that has more passion compassion for each other and understanding

26:14.880 --> 26:19.840
of each other will translate to a distribution that is supported by that team for longer

26:19.840 --> 26:23.560
that has a higher level of passion that goes into creating the software that has better

26:23.560 --> 26:27.880
communication understanding amongst the team members that is likely easier to resolve issues

26:27.880 --> 26:33.800
amongst the team members it is so super fundamentally value for valuable for the long term viability

26:33.800 --> 26:38.400
of this distribution that it just I don't personally run it but our son runs elementary

26:38.400 --> 26:43.640
OS and for me it was a no brainer to back this because he's gotten more than a year

26:43.640 --> 26:47.760
of use out of the last version of elementary OS I can't wait to upgrade into the next version

26:47.760 --> 26:53.600
of elementary OS and for it for that for that alone it's worth investing in that team to

26:53.600 --> 26:57.780
just keep making great stuff and even if I only use it on one of the many computers in

26:57.780 --> 27:02.000
all of the computers that I take care of it's absolutely valuable and if you're an elementary

27:02.000 --> 27:06.520
OS user where you kind of grok what they're going it's maybe worth throwing a few bucks

27:06.520 --> 27:12.640
because they have a flexible goal and they've reached 27 percent and I got I would love

27:12.640 --> 27:15.640
to see them get five thousand dollars because eighteen hundred dollars is not enough for

27:15.640 --> 27:21.080
what they're doing you know and it's kind of our way some of the people you know elementary

27:21.080 --> 27:24.800
has got got a great desktop experience that's something Linux you know we're really fighting

27:24.800 --> 27:29.200
for and the other companies out there that are you know making these competing products

27:29.200 --> 27:33.280
you're they're absolutely paying for team lunches and outings and going to conferences

27:33.280 --> 27:36.400
so if this is a small way the open source community can contribute back and get the

27:36.400 --> 27:41.060
same kind of experience I think that's great mm-hmm so guys anything else you want to touch

27:41.060 --> 27:43.760
on before we wrap up and you know best of luck to you we'll have a link in the show

27:43.760 --> 27:51.480
notes people want to lazy web it not really but thanks for your contribution yeah yes

27:51.480 --> 27:56.920
no problem I'm I'm glad to back and I hope you guys can pull it off and if I if anything

27:56.920 --> 28:00.200
if anything I would love to hear an update from you folks down the road because you're

28:00.200 --> 28:04.200
always welcome to join us in the mumble room and let us know how it's going especially

28:04.200 --> 28:09.600
because one of the things we try to do here on the unplugged show is give every major

28:09.600 --> 28:16.600
viewpoint a good chance and platform to voice it and I don't think elementary OS is the

28:16.600 --> 28:20.720
distro for everyone but for the folks that love it I think they are super happy to have

28:20.720 --> 28:25.200
it and I think it's incredibly important that there is a team out there that is looking

28:25.200 --> 28:29.960
with such a critical eye at how to build a great desktop environment for Linux users

28:29.960 --> 28:34.920
and how to really make a product that is that is whole from beginning to end and that's

28:34.920 --> 28:38.680
something that's desperately needed in the open source community and so that alone I

28:38.680 --> 28:43.320
think makes the project valuable even if I'm not a daily driver of it and so best of luck

28:43.320 --> 28:47.120
to you guys and I hope people out there even if they're not a daily driver of it see some

28:47.120 --> 28:51.560
of the value there so good luck and hopefully we'll hear a report of how it went in Paris

28:51.560 --> 28:58.600
if all goes well okay I got to talk about something if you if you're a patron you might

28:58.600 --> 29:03.660
already know about this but if if you're a Linux user if you like Linux unplugged and

29:03.660 --> 29:10.720
Linux action show that I may have something that pertains to your interests tomorrow actually

29:10.720 --> 29:14.360
as you listen to this it should be available I was just gonna say we have a new show that's

29:14.360 --> 29:20.200
launching on the Jupiter Broadcasting Network what I know I know I'm super excited about

29:20.200 --> 29:25.400
it I'm really really stoked we're trying out a bunch of new technology on the back end

29:25.400 --> 29:33.040
so it's incredibly fun from that standpoint it is really something that we have been kind

29:33.040 --> 29:38.840
of percolating for I don't know two years and it just sort of is all kind of finally

29:38.840 --> 29:45.420
come together in a really really really slick I really enjoyed it and the response has been

29:45.420 --> 29:50.920
super super good and by response he means from the patrons that have subscribed and

29:50.920 --> 29:56.240
got to see it and know about it what a week ago yeah I released it early last late last

29:56.240 --> 30:01.200
week to the patrons and so yeah the show is gonna be called are you ready for this I'm

30:01.200 --> 30:08.640
gonna reveal it for the first time music soundboard something something okay no wow no not that

30:08.640 --> 30:17.440
one no was that the wrong one sorry okay how about this breaking news on the Jupiter Broadcasting

30:17.440 --> 30:22.640
Network we are about to reveal the new show sources familiar with the matter tell us it's

30:22.640 --> 30:30.440
gonna be called get ready dun dun dun dun dun dun user air user air and it is something

30:30.440 --> 30:35.120
that is near and dear to my heart think of it like this everyone makes mistakes we're

30:35.120 --> 30:39.040
just gonna make great show content out of them insightful it's gonna be a little bit

30:39.040 --> 30:43.760
it's not gonna take itself too seriously so I'll be a little relevant irreverent I guess

30:43.760 --> 30:49.680
and we'll take sort of the weekly issues from the community as Linux users ourselves mistakes

30:49.680 --> 30:56.280
we've made and also just things we're doing throughout the week it is a relaxed enjoyable

30:56.280 --> 31:05.040
talk show the first episode is out it is Noah myself and making his network debut the beer

31:05.040 --> 31:14.080
Mr. Rekai as their host yep yeah it's true and it's great and it starts out good and

31:14.080 --> 31:19.640
it stays strong the entire episode and I really enjoyed recording it we're using a bunch of

31:19.640 --> 31:24.600
new technology to do it not only on the on the recording aspect of it but also on the

31:24.600 --> 31:30.520
publishing end of it and it's all Linux based and so episode one you can go check it out

31:30.520 --> 31:35.480
at Jupiter broadcasting.com user air one we talk about kind of a smattering of things

31:35.480 --> 31:42.160
my experience with Linux on the MacBook and getting no man's sky working but also we talk

31:42.160 --> 31:47.640
quite a bit about tiling window managers and Noah's attempt to get into that whole space

31:47.640 --> 31:51.520
and sort of my issues about it we finally give you a tiling window manager review which

31:51.520 --> 31:54.860
I think turned out really great new features that are coming to JBOT and some of the code

31:54.860 --> 32:00.800
that we've been writing to make that possible and Noah has recently got into development

32:00.800 --> 32:05.440
and we talk about that we talk about developing Python and Ruby so the whole show it's about

32:05.440 --> 32:09.920
an hour long and it just was turned out great so you can check it out at Jupiter broadcasting.com

32:09.920 --> 32:15.720
brand new show for you Linux users it's called user air and I'm really happy with the way

32:15.720 --> 32:22.280
it turned out so on last are we going to be expecting to see exponent yeah right actually

32:22.280 --> 32:25.820
I think you have to watch you have to listen to the episode or watch it but I think he

32:25.820 --> 32:31.800
ended up going with awesome and he's very nice yeah yeah it is review was really interesting

32:31.800 --> 32:38.080
kind of got me my interest peaked so yeah there you go I'm excited and yeah the patrons

32:38.080 --> 32:43.080
the patrons have got it and we've gotten a hundred percent positive feedback on it so

32:43.080 --> 32:47.880
far what an exciting thing it's like you know once in a every few years thing a new JB show

32:47.880 --> 32:54.040
yeah yeah and it's super fun for us to do a whole new tech to do it there if there was

32:54.040 --> 33:00.560
no Mac no Mac touch the entire process which is really fun and we used some some back end

33:00.560 --> 33:06.480
scripts that we're hoping we can work with the folks they really great team over at pod

33:06.480 --> 33:12.480
publish to integrate some of the cool things that we're working on with we'll see so yeah

33:12.480 --> 33:20.040
it is it is slick and if you're a commuter or if you if you consume this via YouTube

33:20.040 --> 33:24.920
it's out right now there's RSS feeds you can subscribe to it if all of its published it's

33:24.920 --> 33:28.560
an iTunes is in the Google Play Store it's all ready to go we got everything ready and

33:28.560 --> 33:32.920
loaded to go although we do need to get Aaron to update the drop down menu and the show

33:32.920 --> 33:40.120
menu thing okay but yeah so I'm very excited I listened to the pilot episode let me I was

33:40.120 --> 33:45.640
actually there for it yeah yeah you the secret life the secret yeah the sneaky live stream

33:45.640 --> 33:54.400
yeah I do have a suggestion no considering it's more of a you know a loose conversation

33:54.400 --> 34:00.400
may show why don't you include the mumble room in honor maybe one day maybe one day

34:00.400 --> 34:05.840
I'll tell you what the audio quality of the show is like nothing else we've ever done

34:05.840 --> 34:10.160
I mean it is it is far and beyond anything we've ever recorded before it like I said

34:10.160 --> 34:13.880
like I was saying earlier the new audio the new one some new technology we're using is

34:13.880 --> 34:21.760
also a technology stack that automates double-ended recording which for if you if you know what

34:21.760 --> 34:26.200
that means that's kind of a big deal for us and that kind of makes it harder to do mumble

34:26.200 --> 34:31.360
but we do appreciate a good technical challenge so it's it's not with it's not outside the

34:31.360 --> 34:35.560
realm of possibility I don't know if this would work to give you a sample in the show

34:35.560 --> 34:40.760
that might be kind of weird but I will give you and I'll give you a little sample of the

34:40.760 --> 34:47.480
audit quality is here ideas if you take a more skeptical approach then when in a couple

34:47.480 --> 34:51.720
months you end up running a tiling window manager I'll just have more fun saying I was

34:51.720 --> 34:56.660
right so as somebody that's a run a tiling window manager in the past I'm gonna say that's

34:56.660 --> 35:04.880
not true that I want more fun no that that Chris is not going to end up liking it it

35:04.880 --> 35:12.380
just doesn't suit the the style of desktop that he is used to tell tell me okay let's

35:12.380 --> 35:16.600
start with this in the same way that I both gave you both credit for being able to evaluate

35:16.600 --> 35:21.800
an operating system from a completely neutral no bias standpoint let's try and do that with

35:21.800 --> 35:25.640
with desktop environments and for everyone out there that's there I can I'll stop it

35:25.640 --> 35:30.560
there I'll tell you one of the things that also I really like about this show is I'll

35:30.560 --> 35:33.600
just say now I don't know if I've all really ever mentioned in the show so you only really

35:33.600 --> 35:37.400
know if you ever listen to 159 of Linux unplugged probably but a secret of this show is I'm

35:37.400 --> 35:44.800
going to edit it a bit so with most of our shows they're all live to tape if you can

35:44.800 --> 35:50.760
call it that lives disk and what you get is what you get but we don't generally edit these

35:50.760 --> 35:58.400
at all and that's how I've done it for a decade now that's going to change with with user

35:58.400 --> 36:05.360
error from time to time I will cut it down I will make it more refined I will take the

36:05.360 --> 36:10.200
more insightful and intelligent things we say and focus on those and sort of cut out

36:10.200 --> 36:15.400
some of the extra I haven't done it's not heavy-handed so the original episode of user

36:15.400 --> 36:21.320
error episode one was an hour and 14 minutes long the raw recording the published versions

36:21.320 --> 36:26.400
like an hour and three minutes it is that is that right yeah there you go so it kind

36:26.400 --> 36:30.560
of gives you a sense of I took some stuff I just tightened it up I made it I made it

36:30.560 --> 36:35.600
so that way hopefully we keep your intention your attention and everything we say in there

36:35.600 --> 36:40.560
has a good intention behind it and so that's the that's the idea with user error is it's

36:40.560 --> 36:50.240
got a little different feel it's a little more relaxed a little bit more intentional

36:50.240 --> 36:54.600
and it's it's definitely one of those shows where we're going to sometimes go down a rabbit

36:54.600 --> 36:59.880
hole we're going to sort of let give ourselves license to just let people who are passionate

36:59.880 --> 37:04.560
about Linux and technology have the floor from time to time and and I'm really excited

37:04.560 --> 37:08.800
about we're going to go with that because the combination of that freedom but yet tightening

37:08.800 --> 37:13.200
it up and making what the end product is really something that's solid I think is going to

37:13.200 --> 37:17.280
be incredible so that's user error episode one it's out right now you can subscribe to

37:17.280 --> 37:23.400
it and I'm very excited about it it's gotten 100% positive feedback so far you can be the

37:23.400 --> 37:29.440
first person to crap in my punch bowl if you like and a big thank you to Rekai for finally

37:29.440 --> 37:35.000
after all of these I know it is how many it's been at least six or seven no more than that

37:35.000 --> 37:40.800
more than that it's got a bit I think eight years now yeah and you know what he's brilliant

37:40.800 --> 37:46.560
so I've been why I you know what I thought from the day we set up the studio I thought

37:46.560 --> 37:54.240
one day I'll get that guy on Mike eventually I get everybody on Mike eventually everybody

37:54.240 --> 37:58.360
that's in my daily life ends up on microphone or on camera it just seems to be the way it

37:58.360 --> 38:04.000
goes so that's out now and thank you to our patrons who funded it to make it possible

38:04.000 --> 38:08.280
for us to create a show and the first question that didn't come to our mind is how do we

38:08.280 --> 38:11.600
make it sponsor but how do I sell this the question was what's the audience gonna want

38:11.600 --> 38:17.080
to listen to I think that's huge what is it ang breaking news here yeah what do we all

38:17.080 --> 38:25.320
mr. wimpy go ahead um so I just hit play and I noticed that you've got audio spectrum analysis

38:25.320 --> 38:31.120
running yes against a still image is that produced using ffmpeg or something else so

38:31.120 --> 38:37.840
yes and yes it is there's a and Rekai probably the guy to talk to about this but what we

38:37.840 --> 38:45.120
what we found was there was a a python GTK application that uses fm ffmpeg and I think

38:45.120 --> 38:49.520
AV convert or something on the back end it needed some updates because it was built for

38:49.520 --> 38:57.040
like Ubuntu three four years ago and it uses like a boon to his old hello hello who is

38:57.040 --> 39:01.640
that who is that mr. Mike yeah thank you it uses a boon to his old ffmpeg libraries and

39:01.640 --> 39:06.000
stuff like that but Rekai made some changes to one of the main Python scripts and fired

39:06.000 --> 39:10.760
right up and it gives me a GUI to input the file and the background and the text and then

39:10.760 --> 39:15.720
generates the video file and what we want to do is integrate that eventually into pod

39:15.720 --> 39:19.800
published I believe so they yeah so there you go wimpy Rekai just linked you the plug

39:19.800 --> 39:25.160
in yep perfect and in Python that's just perfect isn't it that's and I that's I guess that's

39:25.160 --> 39:29.600
the other thing to kind of touch on here is if everything goes swimmingly user air will

39:29.600 --> 39:36.760
be hopefully helping make podcasting on Linux easier even more automated and a little visually

39:36.760 --> 39:40.820
richer and that's one of our goals too so it's super fun to be working on a project

39:40.820 --> 39:44.680
like that that also has some wider community and some yeah just pioneering it basically

39:44.680 --> 39:49.520
yeah I mean I I was so happy when I found pod published and and then the fact that it's

39:49.520 --> 39:55.740
a snap wimpy really was sort of the the final nail if you will because it meant that I could

39:55.740 --> 40:00.720
produce the entire thing for my Apollo under arch so thank you for snapping that up and

40:00.720 --> 40:06.560
and continuing that project now did you talk about how often it will be released so our

40:06.560 --> 40:11.560
plan is Wednesday morning over at Jupiter broadcasting we'll see if that goes because

40:11.560 --> 40:17.480
again it's since it's kind of experimental technology things could break but you know

40:17.480 --> 40:21.260
we kind of have a hole as far as technical content on Wednesdays right now on filter

40:21.260 --> 40:25.400
comes out Wednesday evenings BSD now gets recorded during the day but it doesn't get

40:25.400 --> 40:29.520
released so we kind of have a hole there in the schedule if you are a Linux user wanting

40:29.520 --> 40:33.440
some tech content and not politics there's nothing really there for you on Wednesdays

40:33.440 --> 40:38.280
and so our plan is to release it Wednesday mornings if all works to to make it available

40:38.280 --> 40:42.620
so that way on Sunday you'll have Linux action show Monday you have Kota radio and tech talk

40:42.620 --> 40:47.560
today Tuesday you have Linux unplugged Wednesday you have user air Thursday you'll have text

40:47.560 --> 40:53.680
now okay and so then for those that like joining live like the entire Linux unplugged audience

40:53.680 --> 40:57.840
isn't listening right now and participating in the mumble room will it be ever recorded

40:57.840 --> 41:01.840
live or is it all I think so it's you know it's interesting because there are two totally

41:01.840 --> 41:07.520
different shows right oh absolutely yeah so I think so I we recorded the first one live

41:07.520 --> 41:11.160
but don't count on it I guess if you're thinking oh I'm gonna catch a live one I think we'll

41:11.160 --> 41:15.160
always do it live but I'm just you know it just I don't know if always do at the same

41:15.160 --> 41:19.080
time because the whole concept behind the show is I really want all of us to be in a

41:19.080 --> 41:22.520
chill mood when we record it sure I just want us to be able to sit back and talk about stuff

41:22.520 --> 41:26.560
and not be stressed out and that might not be possible for three people but and I hope

41:26.560 --> 41:31.920
in the future to have West join us and bring on yeah yeah and bring on different JB hosts

41:31.920 --> 41:37.040
from time to time and so you'll be able to hear like your hosts from other shows sort

41:37.040 --> 41:42.320
of get in on this show which with I'm hoping super high fidelity audio quality everybody

41:42.320 --> 41:49.080
will have local recordings using Zen caster for that which automates and wimpy if you

41:49.080 --> 41:53.080
guys I don't wimpy what are you what are you using for the Ubuntu podcast for local recordings

41:53.080 --> 41:59.440
there's a utility called audio recorder which is available in a PPA and then mumble for

41:59.440 --> 42:05.240
the real-time chat yes use mumble for the real-time chat and then the the sneaky feature

42:05.240 --> 42:12.440
of audio recorder is that you can set a time at which the recording starts so because all

42:12.440 --> 42:22.000
of our machines are NTP synced we agree we're going to start recording at 2032 and 04 seconds

42:22.000 --> 42:26.680
and all of our local recordings start at the same time so I've been I've been talking to

42:26.680 --> 42:31.480
Josh and he's the gentleman behind Zen caster with I think it's missing an e so it's sort

42:31.480 --> 42:35.600
of web web 2.0 name yeah and I don't think I've had a chance to look at Zen caster it's

42:35.600 --> 42:42.020
like a web RTC front end that does all it one of the things interesting in user error

42:42.020 --> 42:46.440
is Noah was slightly delayed from Rekind I Rekind are sitting here in the studio talking

42:46.440 --> 42:51.680
live Noah was in Grand Forks and he had about a half a second delay so the other thing we

42:51.680 --> 42:57.600
do is we start the recording so audio recorder starts recording and then traditionally Mark

42:57.600 --> 43:05.400
counts us in with a three two one and then when it would be zero all of us say biscuits

43:05.400 --> 43:13.160
because of course because and and then when they do when we do the edit you just line

43:13.160 --> 43:19.320
up everyone saying biscuits together and that accounts for those you know few hundred milliseconds

43:19.320 --> 43:24.720
of of jitter and it's Mark that does the editing right it's either Mark or I I'd say Mark does

43:24.720 --> 43:29.120
about 60 percent and I do about 40 percent well it varies week to week depending on who's

43:29.120 --> 43:35.320
busiest if you ever get a wild hair doing the lamination now I think that was poppy

43:35.320 --> 43:41.360
I think it was poppy that'll happen if poppy is chief laminator yeah if you ever get the

43:41.360 --> 43:47.080
wild hair and you want to try Zen caster it will put you out of business because it manages

43:47.080 --> 43:52.120
the time sync up and it handles all of it also does the VoIP aspects you don't have

43:52.120 --> 43:56.120
to use mumble if you don't want but you can just toggle that and then it will post process

43:56.120 --> 44:01.120
and level and gate all the individual tracks and produce one file for you at the oh it

44:01.120 --> 44:06.480
does the gating as well it does yeah yeah so I it's not you know I so me because we

44:06.480 --> 44:10.600
do all that in post that's what I do too and I'm still doing it that way but I'm beginning

44:10.600 --> 44:16.680
to run two versions and I I ended up for the final published version of user error I went

44:16.680 --> 44:23.600
with Zen casters version of the mix okay I still tweaked it a little bit marked and we'll

44:23.600 --> 44:28.480
have a production also known as going out for a curry at the end of the year and we'll

44:28.480 --> 44:33.960
discuss a a change in production methodology it's fun yeah I'll have the I'll have the

44:33.960 --> 44:38.000
creator on a future show he's working on a big release right now and after he's done

44:38.000 --> 44:45.080
I plan to have him on unplugged or last to talk about what he's doing so mr. Wes you

44:45.080 --> 44:49.020
found that there was an update to a project we have covered in the past and we just touched

44:49.020 --> 44:53.880
on it a little bit it's good I think it's it's good new GUIX is a package manager I

44:53.880 --> 45:00.840
believe oh geeks is that okay thank you good new geeks a package manager that I think promises

45:00.840 --> 45:04.480
reproducible builds with everything am I right can you remind me about what this is and why

45:04.480 --> 45:10.000
it's important yeah good new geeks is kind of an issue they're they they're similar to

45:10.000 --> 45:15.400
the Nix package manager slash distribution and both of them kind of promise a functional

45:15.400 --> 45:19.600
programming like approach to package management and like so today we see a lot of stuff you

45:19.600 --> 45:25.240
know with chef puppet ansible you want systems that are reproducible you want to have configuration

45:25.240 --> 45:29.040
management where you have some sort of you know declarative style so that you can specify

45:29.040 --> 45:33.320
I want these packages I want these sys controls changed you know I want to be able to rebuild

45:33.320 --> 45:37.560
a host on on-command or spin up a new host in the cloud if you need one but they kind

45:37.560 --> 45:40.880
of do it from a top-down approach where you know I can configure whatever on my Ubuntu

45:40.880 --> 45:45.540
machine and then have chef run and if I don't have chef you know know about or specifically

45:45.540 --> 45:48.960
managing resources then those may not get managed and they may be in a state that I

45:48.960 --> 45:53.280
don't know it's very easy for kind of unknown things or weird state to creep in that way

45:53.280 --> 45:58.120
so these programs at geeks in particular they kind of go from the ground up where you have

45:58.120 --> 46:02.300
to specify in basically one config file all of the packages you want all the settings

46:02.300 --> 46:06.960
you want and they provide it in a way where it's it's reproducible oh I like that it doesn't

46:06.960 --> 46:10.200
have a lot of side effects doesn't store a lot of state so that you you basically it

46:10.200 --> 46:13.800
runs it processes to this one file and end up with a configuration of a system and is

46:13.800 --> 46:18.160
the advantage to that then it's super easy to replicate that to other systems yes and

46:18.160 --> 46:21.360
so you get you know they have a lot of dependency management they pretty much for the way they

46:21.360 --> 46:25.960
do it is kind of clever they use a lot of symlinks so that you can have one of the things

46:25.960 --> 46:29.680
this enables is you can have multiple versions of you know what might cause conflicts and

46:29.680 --> 46:33.840
other systems you can have multiple versions of the same package because when it builds

46:33.840 --> 46:38.760
it it has a lot of temporary directories there are not temporary but they're based on a hash

46:38.760 --> 46:42.480
of the file so that they're unique per build and if you've changed you know the dependencies

46:42.480 --> 46:46.960
or you've changed the compiler flags and that will be in a different folder and so you you

46:46.960 --> 46:50.080
really have to manually or not manually but you really have to specify all your dependencies

46:50.080 --> 46:53.680
to get this right but once you do it means that you can have multiple versions it makes

46:53.680 --> 46:57.600
it very easy to reproduce and it lets you know that you know once you've got it configured

46:57.600 --> 47:03.160
you can move it wherever nothing will change it will always be in that state huh you know

47:03.160 --> 47:10.520
so I got bit just this morning it was rough West I said I woke up early and I thought

47:10.520 --> 47:16.200
I'm gonna sneak out it's it's it's it's a technique you learn when you have young children

47:16.200 --> 47:20.160
and you wake up before them rarely and you're like I've got I've got an hour before they

47:20.160 --> 47:23.840
wake up I used to do this all the time and so same thing happened this morning I woke

47:23.840 --> 47:29.200
up an hour earlier than I expected I thought I just got a free hour so I walked out to

47:29.200 --> 47:37.080
the living room fired up the laptop went to launch no man's sky bubkiss didn't start wouldn't

47:37.080 --> 47:43.520
run and I thought to myself oh my what did I update yesterday that broke my game and

47:43.520 --> 47:47.120
this is where I thought to myself gosh you know I'd really love to be able to just pin

47:47.120 --> 47:51.880
the version of wine and just oh just or have have this version of wine installed just for

47:51.880 --> 47:55.600
this application and I know there's exactly there are tools to manage that specifically

47:55.600 --> 47:59.680
with wine but this is something at a package level I could achieve right yes and you know

47:59.680 --> 48:03.020
because of the way it works you can even install it on top of your a lot of people use it just

48:03.020 --> 48:06.440
you know you want the latest version of Emacs and you know now we have some things like

48:06.440 --> 48:09.940
you know snap packages that sort of stuff but this kind of has a different approach

48:09.940 --> 48:13.520
and you can install this whole kind of like a package source you can install this on top

48:13.520 --> 48:17.640
of your existing Linux implementation I think even just all from user land without root

48:17.640 --> 48:21.040
permissions and then come you know get all the packages that you might need built just

48:21.040 --> 48:27.600
for your user oh wow wow so they've just updated here now they're working on getting you can

48:27.600 --> 48:30.040
you can compile it from source that's where you get a lot of the power but they also have

48:30.040 --> 48:34.480
binary packages available so they've been working now on one reproducible builds which

48:34.480 --> 48:37.400
you know we've talked about before a lot of projects are working on you know too they're

48:37.400 --> 48:43.600
working on their own because of the way it's because of the unique properties of this distribution

48:43.600 --> 48:46.840
security updates are kind of hard so they've been working on the technique they call grafting

48:46.840 --> 48:50.660
to keep this functional approach but allow you to have security updates easily applied

48:50.660 --> 48:56.440
without having to rebuild all of your programs well I love that and just super quick reproducible

48:56.440 --> 49:03.400
builds remind me why that's super important even though I know I'm asking for the audience

49:03.400 --> 49:06.160
you know mostly you just want to make sure that the program that you're end up running

49:06.160 --> 49:09.920
as a binary really was compiled from the sources that you can inspect right so if you're running

49:09.920 --> 49:13.720
some eventually unless you're using something totally interpreted you're running a binary

49:13.720 --> 49:17.520
at some point and it's all well and good to have access to the source code but if you

49:17.520 --> 49:22.080
can't actually confirm that that source code would produce a bit for bit identical binary

49:22.080 --> 49:24.520
then you really can't be sure that you're getting those advantages so it's all about

49:24.520 --> 49:29.120
verifying that what you built on your system matches what the source code available for

49:29.120 --> 49:33.560
that upstream project is or or whatever it is you're installing and that seems almost

49:33.560 --> 49:37.360
vitally important like it almost seems like half the information you have to know in this

49:37.360 --> 49:41.260
day and age and it certainly would be you know it's one of the benefits of having access

49:41.260 --> 49:44.800
to the source and and free software and all the right talk about so why not leverage it

49:44.800 --> 49:49.000
because we have we with an advantage we have built in exactly even though it you know it's

49:49.000 --> 49:53.480
not app image it's not snaps but it's still technically extremely interesting and that's

49:53.480 --> 49:57.120
why I think it's fun to talk about here on the show and they have a new release and it's

49:57.120 --> 50:00.320
great because West has been kind of following it so I thank you West for bringing it to

50:00.320 --> 50:06.200
our attention again and we have a link to the LWN post that go check it out and let

50:06.200 --> 50:10.320
us know what you think and also like I was just saying a heads up to those of you that

50:10.320 --> 50:14.680
are running on the development quote unquote branch of wine and you may be running on that

50:14.680 --> 50:18.440
branch of wine and not even knowing it because for some distributions it's just the default

50:18.440 --> 50:25.020
branch of wine they install the new version of wine 1.9.17 breaks No Man's Sky which

50:25.020 --> 50:30.040
is in my opinion and I apparently the entire internet disagrees with me the best game in

50:30.040 --> 50:37.560
the universe but it does work fine on versions 1.9.16 and 1.9.15 I've confirmed myself so

50:37.560 --> 50:42.360
heads up if you are playing No Man's Sky under wine don't update like I did because

50:42.360 --> 50:48.000
that ruined my morning I spent my entire morning fixing that the entire morning I thought you

50:48.000 --> 50:52.040
know and it was West it's funny because my first thought was well maybe it's this MacBook

50:52.040 --> 50:57.440
kernel AUR package maybe it updated you know no it wasn't that it wasn't the Nvidia driver

50:57.440 --> 51:01.560
it was just damn wine and it wasn't until I was looking for news for this show that

51:01.560 --> 51:05.120
I noticed that there was a new version of wine out that I went oh wait a minute that's

51:05.120 --> 51:09.240
what it was it was in preparation for the show I discovered the problem just a quick

51:09.240 --> 51:13.560
super quick update on the MacBook Linux thing I talked about it more in user error West

51:13.560 --> 51:18.760
I've done a couple of kernel updates in the meantime flawless my friend that is awesome

51:18.760 --> 51:25.840
I have I actually I actually clocked it three second boot time it's oh yeah it's it's about

51:25.840 --> 51:33.340
seven seconds total because x11 and the Nvidia driver at about another three to four seconds

51:33.340 --> 51:38.100
to it depending on the day but I don't know could you just could you just super quickly

51:38.100 --> 51:43.040
could you talk about how it's not it's not using grub it's not using lilo we're not using

51:43.040 --> 51:49.140
refine to boot on this MacBook we're using the firmware bootloader and frickin system

51:49.140 --> 51:53.520
D can you talk about that at all yeah you know we just used to be called gummy boot

51:53.520 --> 51:58.840
and then it got eaten up by system DS so many things do for better for worse you can talk

51:58.840 --> 52:05.160
about that later but it's just a really simple bootloader for EFI systems and so the max

52:05.160 --> 52:09.840
for a long time to kind of work on some of the first machines to have EFI enabled bios

52:09.840 --> 52:15.040
is if you want to call them that firmwares and so because they already use that to boot

52:15.040 --> 52:19.760
the Mac OS X operating system if you don't need a fancy menu to pick for them and if

52:19.760 --> 52:23.960
you want Linux to be the default and then have the option to hold the option key to

52:23.960 --> 52:28.240
boot into Mac OS X when you need to say for firmware updates exactly exactly what I want

52:28.240 --> 52:33.400
yep then you can just install it right to the fact partition that already exists that

52:33.400 --> 52:39.520
holds the EFI bootloaders or executables and then it just writes a simple configuration

52:39.520 --> 52:44.640
file that sets it up for you and then the firmware will just hit that default boot file

52:44.640 --> 52:50.080
it will load the kernel and in at RAMFS and away you go just a couple of other notes because

52:50.080 --> 52:53.160
I've always been a huge doubter of Linux on the MacBook and I've always encouraged

52:53.160 --> 52:57.520
the audience not to do it even though they constantly emailing about it I found two packages

52:57.520 --> 53:02.680
in the AUR that were great one was like fan control D or I can't remember what Mac Mac

53:02.680 --> 53:06.760
fan control D or anyways it's a background process yes it's a demon that runs in the

53:06.760 --> 53:11.880
background and actually manages the thermal management on the MacBook so I'm not cooking

53:11.880 --> 53:17.220
the MacBook into hell which was a problem yeah hugely nice West two other packages one

53:17.220 --> 53:22.800
that manages the keyboard backlighting just uses the ambient light sensor in the MacBook

53:22.800 --> 53:28.400
and automatically adjust the keyboard backlighting just as Mac OS X does and then the last one

53:28.400 --> 53:32.640
that has been also great is the same thing using the ambient light sensor to manage the

53:32.640 --> 53:37.440
brightness on the display just like Mac OS does and I a lot of usability wins right there

53:37.440 --> 53:43.400
it really is and I I have to say if you have an old enough MacBook I don't know about a

53:43.400 --> 53:48.600
new model I couldn't afford to people are like people said I cheated because I tried

53:48.600 --> 53:54.880
on a 2013 MacBook instead of a the subreddit and I saw you did they wanted me to buy a

53:54.880 --> 54:01.080
new MacBook to try this I gotta talk folks if I was gonna buy a new computer today I

54:01.080 --> 54:04.320
would not be buying a MacBook I would be I would buy in a machine that just runs Linux

54:04.320 --> 54:09.400
out of the box however buying a new MacBook which is actually a three-year-old MacBook

54:09.400 --> 54:13.240
right yeah exactly and that's why yeah that's actually why I thought it was a valid experiment

54:13.240 --> 54:17.840
was I think that MacBook the one that I have the 2013 is gonna come down to sub easily

54:17.840 --> 54:22.440
sub thousand dollar prices in a month and I think when that happens you're gonna have

54:22.440 --> 54:26.440
a lot more people looking at it for Linux when you can buy the machine that I have which

54:26.440 --> 54:33.440
is honestly a very nice computer it is I've been really impressed with the trackpad with

54:33.440 --> 54:38.140
the keyboard backlighting with the performance but honestly what what what shocks me every

54:38.140 --> 54:43.320
time I open up the screen is that 15-inch retina display with gnome 3 beautiful I've

54:43.320 --> 54:49.800
never seen a I've never ever in my life seen a GUI that looks that good even the XPS 13

54:49.800 --> 54:54.280
which is my one of my favorite computers which has a high dpi display doesn't look as good

54:54.280 --> 54:58.280
it really is amazing too small yeah it's exactly it yeah it looks great on 15 inch so there's

54:58.280 --> 55:02.040
some reasons to run it but I would say if I was buying today I would probably buy a

55:02.040 --> 55:07.760
computer from entryware or system 76 where it was preloaded designed with to run Linux

55:07.760 --> 55:12.040
or even the Sputnik edition from Dell which is also you know meant to run Linux but if

55:12.040 --> 55:16.440
you are in the position of coming across a pre-owned or you have an existing MacBook

55:16.440 --> 55:20.800
and you've been thinking about it you've been on the fence and a gross with the Linux

55:20.800 --> 55:25.320
MacBook kernel which is in the AUR which you have to build every time it updates and a

55:25.320 --> 55:29.940
couple of those packages just search for MacBook and the AUR it really it really is a great

55:29.940 --> 55:33.600
experience it's yeah I would totally I'll just add that the enter grows installer even

55:33.600 --> 55:37.240
it will do the system D boot stuff for you so it'll handle it right there you just need

55:37.240 --> 55:40.160
to make sure you have as we talked about you need to make sure you have the Wi-Fi drivers

55:40.160 --> 55:45.680
or yes USB Ethernet adapter and for more details on that just listen to episode 158 of your

55:45.680 --> 55:46.680
unplugged program.

55:46.680 --> 55:52.480
All right well enough about that I want to talk to Wimpy about LibreVault which promises

55:52.480 --> 55:59.980
to bring what I love about SyncThing and what I love about BitTorrent Sync to a GPL3 licensed

55:59.980 --> 56:04.440
open source project and we've talked about a little bit Wes has done some kicking of

56:04.440 --> 56:08.080
the tires and like a gentleman he even did a screencast of it so we could talk about

56:08.080 --> 56:17.880
it recently and I chewed on it I debated it and then Wimpy convinced me I've installed

56:17.880 --> 56:22.480
on my machines and we're going to talk about LibreVault why it actually matters why it

56:22.480 --> 56:28.040
could fundamentally I think change distribution of open source projects and how it could enhance

56:28.040 --> 56:33.200
the Jupiter Broadcasting Network and how it could replace Dropbox or insert name of sync

56:33.200 --> 56:37.920
application for you it's really cool it's really competitive and in fact it worked perfect

56:37.920 --> 56:43.680
on a DigitalOcean Droplet DigitalOcean.com use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED all one word

56:43.680 --> 56:48.360
lowercase you know I've really boiled the pitch the pitch for DigitalOcean down to one

56:48.360 --> 56:54.520
thing if you need a computer that doesn't have a monitor most of the time DigitalOcean.com

56:54.520 --> 57:00.480
really if you want to just accomplish something on a computer that is super fast has really

57:00.480 --> 57:04.400
great disk I O because it's all SSD and it's connected to the best internet connection

57:04.400 --> 57:10.040
possible DigitalOcean.com they use KVM for the virtualizer running on top of Linux they

57:10.040 --> 57:14.400
got SSD drives for the disk I O and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED you get a $10 credit

57:14.400 --> 57:19.340
you can start in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans $5 a month for 512 megabytes

57:19.340 --> 57:26.840
of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU but actually yeah they break it down hourly if you want

57:26.840 --> 57:29.840
to just experiment with something you can spin up I like like West for the show notes

57:29.840 --> 57:34.080
is like here's Chris's wiki Chris's wiki Chris's wiki now that reminded me of the fact that

57:34.080 --> 57:40.520
for just one day I wanted Chris's wiki you remember that and instead of installing all

57:40.520 --> 57:45.560
of that crud and pulling down all of those dependencies on my laptop and and honestly

57:45.560 --> 57:49.940
doing it over on my vi connection I just spun up a DigitalOcean droplet and within about

57:49.940 --> 57:54.080
two minutes I decided no good destroyed the droplet I don't even know how I don't even

57:54.080 --> 57:58.160
know what I paid for that because they charge at an incredible price when you do it hourly

57:58.160 --> 58:03.800
if you've got something you want to host for yourself to be fast that is really not like

58:03.800 --> 58:07.040
something you want to share with the world DigitalOcean has private networking where

58:07.040 --> 58:10.480
your DigitalOcean droplets can talk amongst each other that isn't over the internet which

58:10.480 --> 58:14.920
is a really nice feature they have data centers in New York San Francisco Singapore Amsterdam

58:14.920 --> 58:22.440
London Toronto Germany and India their interface though oh man back in the day when Angela

58:22.440 --> 58:26.760
and I one of the things for the consulting company that we worked for was they did VMware

58:26.760 --> 58:33.320
hosted machines remember like remember how we sold hosted solutions yes to manage that

58:33.320 --> 58:40.200
I had to run a virtual machine that ran Windows that then ran the VMware ESX management consoles

58:40.200 --> 58:46.200
just so I could manage the Linux machines inside our VMware infrastructure and it was

58:46.200 --> 58:51.960
god-awful slow yeah very convoluted DigitalOcean changes all of it I mean it's not just a good

58:51.960 --> 58:57.360
UI for a desktop application it's a freaking good UI period for a web app for a for a native

58:57.360 --> 59:02.040
app don't matter DigitalOcean's got the best UI I've seen to manage this ever then you

59:02.040 --> 59:05.800
combine that with a great straightforward API you can build applications around it or

59:05.800 --> 59:10.160
you can take advantage of cool open source code already committed check it out it's really

59:10.160 --> 59:16.680
straightforward DigitalOcean.com just use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED big thank you DigitalOcean

59:16.680 --> 59:21.080
for sponsoring the unplug program and by the way check out their block storage that's the

59:21.080 --> 59:25.400
hotness right now they've got the ability now to add storage as you need it at the block

59:25.400 --> 59:33.360
level up to 16 terabytes all backed by SSDs wow yeah isn't that nice DigitalOcean.com

59:33.360 --> 59:37.360
use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED it's one word lowercase you apply that to your account you

59:37.360 --> 59:41.320
get a ten dollar dollar dollar credit over at DigitalOcean.com thanks for sponsoring

59:41.320 --> 59:49.680
the unplug program so LibreVault is promising to fill a very necessary hole in the open

59:49.680 --> 59:54.000
source sync ecosystem and I kind of wanted to open it up to Wimpy to tell me about his

59:54.000 --> 59:58.400
experiments with LibreVault because honestly you're the one that's really got me looking

59:58.400 --> 01:00:06.080
at this again and again Wimpy okay well it's early days it is so in fact it's so early

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:12.720
days that I think it's only packaged for Arch and Ubuntu at this point right possibly it's

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:20.880
definitely packaged for Ubuntu I've seen it in the AUR I've seen some discussion about

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.920
the developer making static builds at some point so that we can run it wherever yeah

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:32.200
if you want to install from the AUR you first have to have qt5-tools installed and then

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:36.560
it'll build properly but yes it is an AUR so leave a comment in the AUR for the package

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:42.040
maintain this they can fix that that's that's what needs to be done there and the project

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:48.240
the project been cooking for about a year now but I only became aware of it about two

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:57.520
weeks or so ago and like you Chris I was really smitten with the bit sync workflow that key

01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:04.160
exchange mechanism worked really well for what I wanted to do and I've never really

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:10.620
been satisfied with anything else that I've tried to replace bit sync with until this

01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:17.440
so what I've got running at the moment is a very small setup but on one of my desktop

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:26.880
machines I have LibreVault with the GUI version running and I have a folder of stuff in a

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:34.120
synchronized folder and then I've got two Ubuntu servers that are in two different geographic

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:42.900
locations and I just have the LibreVault daemon installed on those and that comes with a system

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:51.240
D unit which you can run either at the global system level or you can allocate to an individual

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:57.960
user or many users so I'm using it on a per user basis oh nice and so and that's a so

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:05.560
you start the system D service as that specific user yes so in this case you just sudo system

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:15.880
CTL enable user at oh yeah yeah yeah and that was the business and then from the command

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:23.320
line there's a couple of utilities you can run LibreVault daemon gen config which builds

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:29.440
the boilerplate configuration file and pulls some details from your specific system like

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:37.940
hostname to give it the identifier for that node you can derive the C type key so those

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:44.860
read only keys or the shareable read write keys rather than just the master key using

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:53.120
gen key and then it just has a JSON file for the folder configuration so you can just copy

01:02:53.120 --> 01:03:03.040
paste your JSON folders.json from one box to the other and when you then start the daemon

01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.680
running it just synchronizes and I've got those three machines running now and I've

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:14.400
just been poking at it and lobbing large files in and making lots of rapid changes to text

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:19.260
files in three locations at the same time to see how it handles conflicts and things

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:23.200
like that and so far so good.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.700
I want to address a couple of things and maybe somebody in the audience might be listening

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:33.320
and thinking why does something like this matter so I want to touch on two things first

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:38.060
of all and I want to come back to this one with wimpy I think it could be the next open

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:44.760
source CDN but first of all when you have something like this working what you accomplish

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:50.000
is almost it's like a transparent network file system and once it's all set up and it's

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.440
in that set it and forget it mode you have any arbitrary folder that you choose on your

01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:01.340
system synced across all your devices and that's huge you make a change in one directory

01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:08.280
and it immediately is available on all your other machines and to give you this is a very

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:13.880
maybe off example but the current example for me is no man's sky the configuration folder

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:18.760
I just want that configuration folder synced across many machines in the Dropbox world

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:23.880
to accomplish that I do a sim link and I move the actual folder into my Dropbox and then

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:29.360
I sim link in the in the configuration folder that folder and then I had that I kind of

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:34.000
trick I trick no man's sky into thinking it's accessing the folder when in reality it's

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.960
hitting a sim link and going to my Dropbox but with things like LibreVault I could choose

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:44.500
any arbitrary directory on my file system to sync and that becomes to be that gets huge

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:48.200
that's just great for just one to one users you don't have to share it with them with

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:53.560
many people super handy and and also one of the other things before we get to the open

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:57.320
source CDN is one of the advantages has over something like Dropbox and I think this will

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:03.520
resonate with you Angela is there's no centralized storage it's just whatever space you have

01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.440
on your hard drive so you don't have to worry about getting 20 gigs and 30 gigs or buying

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:13.120
the one terabyte package like we do with Dropbox you just everybody syncs and it's just synced

01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.160
amongst your computers and whatever space you have that's the space you get there's

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:23.120
no limits that's extremely compelling especially for something like unfiltered which is ridiculous

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:28.640
but lastly it kind of and I don't know about LibreVault maybe wimpy you know better but

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:37.100
it sort of has it's sort of the bit torrent sync philosophy brought to a GPL 3 application

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:41.480
that's not going to get shut down it's not going to get put behind a paywall and it allows

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:47.600
the distribution of files in a way that is truly truly unique because like a torrent

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.280
everybody who participates in the sync also becomes part of the distribution network and

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:57.400
it is therefore its own built-in CDN and I'm wondering are you thinking about how to use

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:02.260
this in a way that because it's a GPL because that means a lot of Linux users might eventually

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:07.440
one day just have it in their damn repo could this be a way to distribute to distribute

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:12.760
project images or a large files to a user base what do you think absolutely and that's

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:18.800
one of the reasons why I'm looking at it so looking out into the future what I would like

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:28.120
to do is list LibreVault in the Ubuntu mate software boutique so it's a one-click install

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:34.960
yes and then provide so a new feature in the current build of LibreVault is links so it

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:43.640
understands that this URI construct is a link to a LibreVault key you can click on that

01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:51.020
it will embed it in the application and that way you can then or I can then make available

01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:57.960
images for Ubuntu mate for the various architectures available oh yeah people can just click on

01:06:57.960 --> 01:07:04.160
those and sync them when a new version is available they automatically get the new version

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:14.400
and all of the people that are carrying that LibreVault key are part of the collective

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:19.480
that are synchronizing and sharing and part of the peer-to-peer network that is making

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:24.560
those images available and it is torrent under the hood if you actually go and look at the

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:33.200
LibreVault config file you will see well-known torrent trackers as the trackers that are

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:41.440
used to actually broker the connections between your installations very good you and because

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:47.220
it's torrent trackers of course you could run your own torrent tracker and just change

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:53.720
your config to point your own tracker and you could keep all of your tracking off the

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:58.080
public trackers as well you know you could just use your own torrent tracker.

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:02.780
So Wes you kind of been kicking the tires for us you've been our guinea pig I've also

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:06.780
installed on my machine and Rekai was the guy that had to fall on the sword and even

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:13.120
try installing on Windows Wes what were your take away from it?

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:16.640
You know I mean it is definitely early days but I was I was also impressed I do think

01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:20.440
this you know the just be able to give it a link of a key and then especially having

01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:26.040
the built-in you know write only read only that kind of access control yeah really easy

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:31.040
right there I'm excited to play more with it you know I haven't replaced my sync thing

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:36.040
needs yet but I'm thinking it's on the list of projects to see it's just so it seems so

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:39.120
easy to configure and it seems like a good scale very nicely.

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:43.560
I'll tell you a story that made me realize how important something like sync thing or

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:48.680
LibreVault is and I'm I'll be honest I'm a little more excited about LibreVault and

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:55.040
Janai you know we've got three kids and there's there's new movies that we discover individually

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:59.880
that the kids just absolutely love and if I wanted to back up one of those movies and

01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.200
share it with her so that way when they're at home they could watch that same movie there's

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:10.640
no or I could yeah right don't forget about me yeah up there was there was actually recently

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:16.360
like when Zootopia came out that was exactly the situation and I had it I had backed it

01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:20.120
up I had a copy of it but I had it sitting on a hard drive and when the kids went home

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.560
they couldn't watch Zootopia and it would be really really nice if there was a piece

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:28.800
of software I could use to just send you that file and didn't go through some corporate

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:34.600
server because a friend of ours you and I both know them you know there was a file they

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:38.480
wanted and so their friend put it up on a Dropbox account and sent them the link it's

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:42.600
it here go grab it and Dropbox shut down their whole account just completely terminated the

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:49.600
account shut it down you're banned wow wow yeah and and it's that's ridiculous that you

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.120
know if I go out and I buy Zootopia for 40 freaking bucks or 30 bucks or 20 bucks from

01:09:54.120 --> 01:10:01.640
Costco and I use make MKV to back it up and I and I that's my copy and I want my children

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:04.920
to be able to watch it I should have it there should be a way for me to be able to easily

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.800
share those files with you and that's what Lee I think even if you're just an individual

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:14.200
Lee Bravevault promises that but you know in the term for Jupiter broadcasting we distribute

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:19.400
the unfiltered show notes and all of the clips that we play via BitTorrent Sync right now

01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:23.240
and this is I think absolutely where we're going to migrate to Lee Bravevault looks like

01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:27.800
the perfect replacement for BitTorrent Sync for us and if you're not familiar with BitTorrent

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:32.400
Sync it's kind of it needs to be replaced it's it's kind of things have gone south

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:38.000
let's just put it that way both Wimby and I are we're done we're done so like for

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.360
your for your issue is Zootopia with something like a Plex or MB work yeah you know that's

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:51.020
generally what we use but of course on my end I'm connected to a MiFi yeah yeah so it's

01:10:51.020 --> 01:10:55.600
not like the kids are gonna very easily stream it from from my hard drive so it'd really

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.080
be best for them to have a local copy that just showed up in the kids movie folder if

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.440
I could just have a if we just had on both our servers we had two kids movie directories

01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.920
and every time I put a file in there it showed up on both our servers it's the perfect solution

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:13.760
so that's that's my hope eventually but that all of course Ionic Badger and I were talking

01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:18.080
about it before the show all pulls into kind of pulls into like this ultimate multimedia

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.800
server setup Ionic I know you and I are both excited about a media service have you solved

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:29.160
this moving files between multiple houses problem by chance he's oh Ionic left ironic

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:33.000
oh ironic that's why probably because I called him wrong I called him by the wrong name that's

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:38.000
fine yeah our sink is also how we actually do it now so it's just manual and it's painful

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.720
and LibreSync I think eventually will replace Dropbox Pro for us as a company we have made

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:49.520
the financial decision to buy a Dropbox Pro every year and go ahead and do that again

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:58.520
okay fine turn the camera on she won't do it and we're not happy so so you've talked

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:04.360
about you know wanting to sort of fund open source I'm I'm putting you on the spot a little

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:09.800
bit here by the way I don't mind so good man you know look at look at what you're spending

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:18.560
on Dropbox Pro and turn that into monthly payments and consider contacting the author

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:28.440
of LibreVault and for a year making donations to the project and marking the issues because

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:34.440
he's right sort of the issues on his github are kind of a roadmap of improvements and

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:39.480
sort of direct him at the things you would most like to see implemented and see if you

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:48.320
can you know encourage the developer to focus his his efforts I think the first thing would

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:52.120
be to not limit it to five users you know at the base oh they don't have the LibreVault

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:57.080
doesn't have that yeah yeah that's huge that's an automatic yeah that by the way is a Dropbox

01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:01.320
limitation so I think it's seven hundred eighty dollars a year to pay for Dropbox Pro is that

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:07.400
right yeah and so and from like an expensive standpoint how would we do that as a business

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:12.120
could we could we instead of paying for a service so when we pay for a service is that

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:16.560
a is that a type of write-off that's different than buying a physical good no so when we

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:21.120
pay eight hundred dollars for an internet service that's like buying eight hundred dollars

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:28.060
of something physical well well okay so if it's a if it's a physical thing there are

01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:32.680
there's like an amortization right down process but right but they just raised it to like

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:38.480
fifteen hundred so no in the case of eight hundred it doesn't matter doesn't matter so

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.120
could we as a business could we easily structure paying an open source project so it'd be about

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:49.080
sixty five seventy bucks a month it'd be exactly sixty five dollars yeah I would rather pay

01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:54.000
monthly than get hit with this eight hundred dollars because we we we already have so many

01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:00.680
subscription services mm-hmm and it's just much easier to manage that especially like

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:06.240
with cards that expire but so here's what I did is this is like what three weeks ago

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:11.160
we renewed it and I think we we just we draw a line in the sand and say never again let

01:14:11.160 --> 01:14:14.920
me just let me just point out to that because yeah it's Dropbox professional we have five

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:21.040
licenses I don't have access to my own company's Dropbox no it's because we need the producers

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:27.200
in there dad I know so I am keeping all my all the artwork like for example I made the

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:33.900
artwork for user error but just all the artwork for all the shows is stored in my Dropbox

01:14:33.900 --> 01:14:39.800
on my laptop right so all the assets all the assets and what we need to do is sort of reorganize

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.960
all of it in some sort of Libre vault folder structure but the problem really has been

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:49.160
in the past is own cloud and and sync thing have not been reliable we've tried them yeah

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:53.040
we did I still have on cloud I need to get that off yeah well it's it's like it's there

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:58.460
but it's only for a couple of things and the problem is is in a media production business

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:02.920
you just end up with this crazy amount of data I tried I was gonna get a I was gonna

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:10.320
get an estimate for the show again but the last time I checked we have over 600 gigabytes

01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.400
of files just for one show wow that we sync around so you know like you really got to

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:20.640
have a bulletproof product to move all that stuff around and the one thing I will give

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:26.380
Dropbox is in combination with their selective sync and their web client it has been very

01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:31.000
very very bulletproof and there are literally times where I make a change and then I walk

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:36.200
downstairs and I need to put it on the air within 35 seconds and if it's not there it's

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:42.900
that doesn't work for me that's just the reality of a live production and Dropbox always always

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:48.160
meets that deadline so LibreVault is not going to testing yeah yeah it will need testing

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:53.280
but of course the advantage of LibreVault is it's based on bit torrent technology so

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:59.840
it's syncing blocks not files yeah it doesn't care about files it's just hashes and blocks

01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:05.680
and and that's important because because it handles all of the integrity checking for

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.640
you and small changes at the block level could be synced instead of the entire file exactly

01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:16.920
so yeah yeah that's that is a great point Wimpy so you know I am really I'm really excited

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:21.880
to see LibreVault when do you do you feel Wimpy it's worth addressing that the primary

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:27.560
authors I almost even don't want to say this but I know I know some people listening will

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:31.200
be concerned that the primary author is Russian do you does that concern you at all that your

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:36.240
file syncing solution okay that doesn't bother me doesn't bother doesn't doesn't bother me

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:40.920
in the slightest no some of the smartest people I've worked with in the past were from Russia

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:45.920
so yep exactly the same for me and it's a good reason to have a you know open source

01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:54.000
encrypted supported file sharing great point great point and the the LibreVault blog is

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:00.440
very instructional there's a couple of posts there about the detailed makeup of the config

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:06.920
file so the skeleton config files it makes are really bare bones don't expose all of

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:12.000
the configuration options but there are blog posts to describe all of that in great detail

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:18.640
and there are also some blog posts there that talk about the the crypto libraries that are

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:24.340
used and the other alternatives that might exist and you know talking about maybe changing

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:30.160
some of the underlying technologies because they're more optimized so along with the code

01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:35.720
being open and you can go and look at it and inspect it there's also some open dialogue

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:41.480
through the blog as well I like that a lot and I I feel at the end of the day I feel

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:46.180
a little reassured this gpl3 it's not well we might one day open source it like bit torrent

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:50.200
sync kind of insinuated at the beginning this is just legitimately at the very beginning

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:56.720
gpl3 here it all is here's the goal yeah yeah and I think that is also very and there's

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:00.680
about half a dozen other libraries that it's built on top of as well that are all open

01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:07.520
source and they're all linked in the github now repository um wimpy yeah if it blows

01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:11.760
up in your face and ruins everything will you come back and tell us about it I will

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:17.040
at the moment I'm not moving anything around that's critical but what I'm working towards

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:23.560
I've spoken about it before so I'll be brief I have this roaming profile that I have synchronized

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:29.480
everywhere and I'm working to building up confidence in libre vault so it can take over

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:34.840
that and that is critical to everything I do so when I build up enough confidence to

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:41.320
make that switch it's passed some sort of credibility testing and then if it doesn't

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:46.680
screw those things up then as far as I'm concerned it's good to go wow you know I'll let you

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:52.320
know but I can't wait to hear that that's my dream that is my that is my dream that

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:57.360
I I work on a machine here and I go home and everything's the same so that's yeah whoa

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:02.560
and I have I have that now and I've had to change the sync solutions along the ways the

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:10.400
best solution I had was bit sync and this is really a workflow drop in replacement for

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:19.160
bit sync wow yeah exactly that's really oh boy I you know what after you've been running

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:24.000
a libre vault I say I don't know I don't know what that I don't know what the threshold

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:28.760
is wimpy but after you feel like it's like it's it's meet they this is working for me

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:35.040
threshold I would love to hear I would love to hear your full setup on that okay all right

01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:38.760
well give me a few weeks because it's going to take a while for me to stress test it a

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:42.960
bit and build up enough confidence that I want to make the switch to something I oh

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:48.380
boy do I understand I think pretty soon you'll see us experimenting probably with the unfilter

01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:53.840
show on just because the unfilter audience it's a great it's a great platform because

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.900
we have a backup copy of all the clips so if there was any huge data corruption we can

01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:02.200
recover and it's a huge amount of data and it's a bunch of people to sync so it's like

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:07.760
this perfect scenario for testing so I bet yeah I bet you'll hear more so my plan is

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:16.740
to switch over to handling my profile exclusively but then have a job on my main machine which

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:25.920
makes an r-sync snapshot of my profile like every hour so if it totally screws it up I've

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:31.280
got a recovery point you know so that's my that's my sort of harness that I've planned

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:36.560
for this so I'm not going to just chuck all of my stuff at it and hope it works I do have

01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:42.680
a a recovery point as well yeah it's in my my plan is also to do a phased approach of

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:46.720
more and more critical things starting with things that I absolutely have multiple copies

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:53.560
of and then over time I will slowly move to that really precious data whatever that is

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:58.480
so great I'm all in you convince me yeah really this little process of shaving revolution I

01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:04.360
would love to hear it not even a gradual let's just all in you know what mr. tunnel you are

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:09.440
bold and I hope you come back and report to us because honestly I think it's going to

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:14.760
be if we get there and it gets wide enough adoption it could be a real fantastic way

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:20.800
for enthusiasts to get latest versions of ISO images or packages or whatever because

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:27.020
it's not only not only are you the CDN by participating in LibreSync or LibreVault sorry

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:32.920
but you are also you are also fundamentally part of the RSS feed part of the distribution

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:37.300
swarm part of the notification network it's all of that built into one thing and I love

01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:42.880
it so LibreVault it's super early days you can hear from all of us here we're not really

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.460
quite ready to trust our most important data to it but it's definitely something we're

01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:52.940
checking out and we'll be following up on future editions of the show now I got to tell

01:21:52.940 --> 01:22:02.620
you about my experiences with Android N I believe it's pronounced new gay new gar do

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:08.060
get new get Android N and I'll tell you how that's gone and why I think I need to switch

01:22:08.060 --> 01:22:12.340
to Ubuntu touch as soon as possible but first I'm gonna tell you about our friends at Linux

01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:18.060
Academy go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug take advantage of the Linux Academy shows

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:23.200
continuing sponsorship by the Linux Academy LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug go there to

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:28.620
register your vote for one more episode you want 160 you hear it's a big number LinuxAcademy.com

01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:32.200
slash unplug is one way to do it but also it's a great opportunity for you to learn

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:37.740
more about the Linux Academy platform the place to go really if you have any kind of

01:22:37.740 --> 01:22:42.060
little rough spots around Linux the technology stack that's based around it or you want to

01:22:42.060 --> 01:22:47.500
just put yourself in front of current technologies we were talking in fact speaking of user error

01:22:47.500 --> 01:22:52.300
with Noah about learning Python and Ruby it's a great example of where Linux Academy can

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:55.540
help you bring you up to speed anything that might make you more money get the attention

01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:59.660
of your employer make that client a little more inclined to go with you or just challenge

01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:04.460
yourself they have courseware on the entire Linux platform and all of the cool technologies

01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:10.540
built on top of it self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux topic or really DevOps

01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:15.540
topic to like this they really rest in there they got Azure OpenStack AWS as well learning

01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:19.700
paths which are a series of courses and content planned by instructors for specific types

01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:23.820
of career tasks which I find to be particularly valuable the hands-on experience if you're

01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:29.520
a little test anxious like I am I mean I got to tell you I've never been a good cert passer

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:34.860
because I just get all worked up about these fake scenarios that's why hands-on experience

01:23:34.860 --> 01:23:38.620
with the Linux Academy labs really gives me the experience to move forward like I'm ready

01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:44.740
I've done it I've actually pushed the buttons that's super nice they have practice exams

01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:48.380
and quizzes they have availability planners you can plug in how much time you have even

01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:52.980
if you're super busy you got three kids in a podcast network trust me you can find time

01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:57.740
at Linux Academy Linux Academy.com slash unplug with nuggets you can go into just deep dives

01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:01.600
in specific areas they got search too if you want to go in for the search you just going

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:05.620
all in you got to get that on your resume they got great courseware for you downloadable

01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:09.940
comprehensive study guides instructor help whenever you need it iOS and Android apps

01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:14.380
to help you whenever you need that mobile experience lab service that spin up on-demand

01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:19.340
and cert training that is above and beyond anything you've ever possibly thought of

01:24:19.340 --> 01:24:25.540
I really have to recommend Linux Academy at Linux Academy.com slash unplug go check them

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:29.880
out it's a pretty cool platform backed by the Linux enthusiasts developers and educators

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:34.400
that came together to create something unique in the industry Linux isn't just a checkbox

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:39.980
on their feature list it's what they're all about Linux Academy.com slash unplugged and

01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:46.560
a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring go check them out go try them go log in go

01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:51.680
see what I love about it too stuff that in the past seemed like impossible I could never

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:56.180
actually achieve it I can never spend the time I can break it down individually into

01:24:56.180 --> 01:24:59.780
chunks of time that I can wrap my head around and actually accomplish and that's what I

01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:08.920
love about it Linux Academy thanks for sponsoring alright so this week is the big week Android

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:13.820
N hit our faces and of course everybody's got the write-up Android Authority Android

01:25:13.820 --> 01:25:18.860
police ours Technica everybody's got their write-up on Android N it's good everybody

01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:23.500
loves the new Doze features have been improved of course the multi window tasking all that

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:28.720
stuff the notifications all good we talked about some of it on tech talk today and I've

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.920
been running on the 6p I think it's it's it's definitely an improvement over and

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:38.060
Marshmallow but I some of my primary issues that plagued me with Marshmallow continue

01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:46.860
to plague me with Android N and that is Doze kills Bluetooth audio I'm sitting there I'm

01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:56.180
driving I'm 30 I'm 20 minutes into my drive say all of a sudden I start get cut every

01:25:56.180 --> 01:26:02.740
podcast what's that yeah Doze is the new Android feature they launched in Marshmallow and then

01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:08.820
doubled down in Nougat and that is depending on like if the phone's upside down face down

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:14.140
or if you're walking or if it's like midnight there's all these conditions that Android

01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:18.980
is taking into account and if it thinks it's you're very unlikely to be using your phone

01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:25.660
at this time it goes down yeah yeah wow which has really improved the battery life you'd

01:26:25.660 --> 01:26:30.620
think they would have fine-tuned that for podcasting and audio and Pandora like if it

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:35.940
sucks it just sucks because I'm sitting there listening actually you know it's funny it's

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:41.100
it you know who it you know who it affects the most of everybody I know wimpy wimpy sitting

01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:45.260
there making a great point on the Ubuntu podcast and all of a sudden every other word he says

01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:50.660
starts getting dropped out and I'm not because because you know he speaks at a gentleman's

01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:55.380
pace like I don't like is he like abbreviating his speech like at first I'm like I start

01:26:55.380 --> 01:27:01.020
losing track of the conversation and then I realize it's dropping every few words from

01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:06.180
the Ubuntu podcast this is just as I'm driving in today and I'm like what the hell is this

01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:10.780
and this is the same problem I have with marshmallows ever since does was introduced and I you know

01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:15.700
marshmallow seems to be good Nougat seems to be even better but I think it's just it's

01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:22.060
just time the Chris gets off of Android and so is there no way to disable it yeah I don't

01:27:22.060 --> 01:27:27.100
know like I think I could go in and say like whenever this application is running don't

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:32.300
save battery life but Android has such crappy battery life I was gonna say is it even saving

01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:37.420
you that much battery no it does okay it is effective yeah yeah it does it mean I can

01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:42.260
I can now go like two days without charging my phone if I push it which is oh that's big

01:27:42.260 --> 01:27:48.940
whoa I heard of an Android I know but it kills the Bluetooth audio and so I have been from

01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:57.100
a distance looking at different options I won't lie iOS feels very attractive because

01:27:57.100 --> 01:28:02.600
I've been there before and I know that I get what I get and I don't complain you know you

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:07.660
just get what you get let me ask you're saying you're specifically saying Bluetooth yeah

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:13.380
if you had headphones plugged in that's what I do but then I lose all the controls well

01:28:13.380 --> 01:28:17.200
no I don't have that problem with headphone jack when I that's what I use I got a little

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:21.820
like retractable headphone cable and I use the aux in but then I lose all of the controls

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:26.860
on my steering wheel so I don't get like skip ahead like or any or skip back or falling

01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:31.580
I like I lose all of the controls on my steering wheel it which you know not a big deal so

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:34.940
I just do the headphone jack and that's what I've been doing for months and months actually

01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:41.020
but it has kind of got me going through my head like I think I'm just I don't like the

01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:45.740
way it performs I don't really enjoy some of the interface elements and I don't really

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:50.940
like the fact that they are tracking me like it is like a sensor in my pocket what about

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:57.420
turning on like isn't there a way to make the screen not turn off there are a few apps

01:28:57.420 --> 01:29:03.900
I could use like force it to stay yeah I think I could actually like I think I could exclude

01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:09.300
pocket casts from all those power management but then at the same time I'm while I'm driving

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:12.820
I'll be burning through my battery right I know yeah so it's not like does it does it

01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:18.260
happen when you charge in the car as well yeah the the the dropouts do yeah in fact

01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:24.700
West it almost seems like it happens faster which is oh wow yeah yeah so I'm not gonna

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:29.560
lie I've been looking I've been looking at the MX4 I've been looking I've been looking

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:34.820
at the one plus and there's this guy out there who's been giving me a hard time about it

01:29:34.820 --> 01:29:42.440
for weeks and weeks and I I won't name names but wimpy you've recently switched you've

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:45.700
recently switched to Ubuntu touch I think you've been on for a couple of weeks and I

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:50.620
know that podcasts are a big part of your workflow and and all that I'd be I would really

01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:54.540
love to hear thoughts because I know you and I have reflected on how Android doesn't quite

01:29:54.540 --> 01:30:00.820
fit for us and we Ubuntu touch is sort of the perfect solution because every now and

01:30:00.820 --> 01:30:05.900
then we just want something a little extra we like the flexibility of the platform we

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:10.500
know some of the folks behind it and it's an alternative to Android that is functional

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:13.700
and I and you've been actually living in it for a couple of weeks you've got multiple

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:18.540
devices I'd love to pick your head just go in there sort of like mind-meld style and

01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:25.580
tell me what's it like to live as wimpy with an Ubuntu touch device okay um it took some

01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:37.060
weeks of research to figure out what the apps on Ubuntu for devices were that could replace

01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:43.440
or be alternatives or equivalents to what I was used to on Android yeah I bet and by

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:48.460
and large I've been able to find replacements for that and where it gets a little bit icky

01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:55.500
is things like there are four or five different versions of Google Plus for example for Ubuntu

01:30:55.500 --> 01:31:01.060
touch and are they all kind of repackaged versions of the web app and sort of kind of

01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:06.420
there that so what you're starting to see now is people that are starting to use more

01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:15.960
of the facilities of QML around the web wrapper to introduce more features into what is essentially

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:21.860
a web wrapped version but also doing clever things like using different agent strings

01:31:21.860 --> 01:31:29.860
in that web wrapper to expose modern versions of the Google Plus UI right so what I've what

01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:34.540
I've been doing is as I've been trying out the several different versions of Google Plus

01:31:34.540 --> 01:31:42.140
for example is rating each of them based on my personal requirements so that the one that

01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:48.400
I think is best gets the most stars and the others get diminishing star levels with my

01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:53.660
rationale as to why they're not as good as the other option so I've gone through that

01:31:53.660 --> 01:32:00.820
process and for things like Twitter and Facebook and Gmail and Google Plus and you know all

01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:05.300
of the stuff you need to do obviously I don't have a WhatsApp problem because all of my

01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:12.580
family are on Telegram so I don't have that big you know stopping block that is in front

01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:21.620
of many people I have a completely functional experience I've got a few gaps in what I need

01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:32.220
and I've I've decided at the outset I would find the apps that best met my requirements

01:32:32.220 --> 01:32:35.860
and for example where there where there's an app that isn't quite good enough instead

01:32:35.860 --> 01:32:43.300
of publishing a duplicate app I would reach out to the developer and work with them to

01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:49.020
improve the existing app that's in the store rather than create even more versions of the

01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:53.900
same thing because I don't think that's very helpful right so I've reached out to the author

01:32:53.900 --> 01:33:00.260
of the Pocket Casts app and we're going to work together to make a slightly refined refined

01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:08.100
version of Pocket Casts for Ubuntu Touch now how how much is it actually targeted for Ubuntu

01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:17.000
Touch versus a modified repackage of the web version so the current version of Pocket Casts

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:25.140
is just a wrapped version of the website which is not bad actually which is very good and

01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:32.060
the only drawback to that is that it was created about a year ago so it doesn't have the keep

01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:37.940
the screen on keep the player moving so as the screen blanks the podcast stops so I've

01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:42.580
contacted the author and said these are the improvements I would like to make and we're

01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:48.060
going to work on that and produce a refined version that you know works properly and because

01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:57.500
I'm a Pocket Casts user at the moment it's easier for me to use that than try and move

01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:05.500
to Podbird which is a native podcasting app for Ubuntu for Devices and what I need to

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:11.180
do there is send some feedback to the developers of Podbird to say these are the features that

01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:19.100
I feel need adding refining or improving in order for the native you know Podbird application

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:26.500
to be you know viable because listening to podcasts on my phone is very important to

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:32.340
me so full disclosure right now all of those things I said I can do on my MX4 the one thing

01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:39.260
I don't do is listen to podcasts I still have an Android phone which I keep in the car and

01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:45.940
I'm driving to and from work it is that device that is connecting over Bluetooth to the car

01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:53.100
audio system to play the podcasts and that's for two reasons one I've got a podcast player

01:34:53.100 --> 01:35:00.660
that works and two it's got Bluetooth that compare with the car and I've only got one

01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:05.940
out of the many Ubuntu touch devices I've got there is only one that compare with the

01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:12.380
car and what's curious about that is a few months ago they could all pair with the car

01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:16.580
and now only one of them can so there's been some sort of regression there and I haven't

01:35:16.580 --> 01:35:23.060
had the opportunity to dig around and identify what's going on but you know there are rough

01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:31.480
edges but I don't have Android running anymore about my person on a day to day basis that's

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:38.780
very cool and I'm able to do all of the things that I could do before with a few caveats

01:35:38.780 --> 01:35:44.020
so I'm going to one of the little projects I want to work on is write an app for buffer

01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:49.660
because that's something I used to use quite extensively on Android and I think that that

01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:57.060
can be neatly created using the Ubuntu framework it shouldn't be too complicated and it should

01:35:57.060 --> 01:36:03.780
provide a totally analog experience cool you know I I think this is this is the perfect

01:36:03.780 --> 01:36:10.720
moment because and she's here and she has without equivocation it rejected basically

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:15.620
everything iCloud she still plugs her phone in over a USB cable to sync all the stuff

01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:19.260
over her photos her music and it's a huge part of her workflow and it's she doesn't

01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:23.800
you know she doesn't want to auto update or auto upload her photos to iCloud she doesn't

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:28.420
want to sync her music through Apple music nope and and you're looking at this and you're

01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:34.300
like I be honest do you feel like you're like on borrowed time with that platform to do

01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:39.340
you yeah and and when when I hear wimpy talk about it I what I think about for somebody

01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:44.300
like you is even if like everything else doesn't apply about the freedom or the or the platform

01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:49.480
or or how they design it the fact that you could maybe find a workflow that you feel

01:36:49.480 --> 01:36:55.560
comfortable with when the other platforms are kind of forcing yeah it's kind of appealing

01:36:55.560 --> 01:37:01.100
right yeah and it's early days still but uh you know I'll uh I'll uh I'll let you know

01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:06.340
when when it's ready to switch yeah there's some fixes coming in OTA 13 that I think are

01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:13.180
really really interesting so there seems to be a lot of focus on refining what's there

01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:20.860
at the moment and the last since OTA 10 it's really come on a long way so OTA 9 I still

01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:28.140
wasn't convinced I could actually use it as a day-to-day device from OTA 10 I could because

01:37:28.140 --> 01:37:34.140
in OTA 10 I could copy and paste between applications for example so you know that was three or

01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:39.040
four months ago not being able to do that prior to then was really a I can't use this

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:44.220
day-to-day so that was that was what you might call a game changer yeah so you know I've

01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:49.020
got two apps in the Ubuntu touch store at the moment and one of which is um last pass

01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:56.720
mobile it's by no means as comprehensive as the last pass application on android but it

01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:02.700
does mean that when I need to log into things I can open up last pass bring up the password

01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:07.060
highlight it copy it and then paste it into the thing that I want to authenticate with

01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:12.980
right which I couldn't do four months ago so you know the fact that that's possible

01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:18.120
it is just that that was really that was the moment where I thought right I really need

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:22.960
to investigate this more seriously because I could make this work for me now I've I've

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:29.220
always felt like the place that would be the most successful for me would be on the tablet

01:38:29.220 --> 01:38:34.500
first and then the phone so I want to get to that I also want to mention mini max he

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:39.140
has a question for you wimpy all of that but first before we go any further I got to say

01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:43.080
thank you to Ange for stopping by she's got to run to go pick up the kiddos but Ange thank

01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:47.980
you for stopping by yeah thanks for having me keeping us grounded wonderful to have you

01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:51.500
and all the love I know and you can hear more from Ange in tech talk today go listen to

01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:55.500
this week's episode or boy this week we had a Kickstarter of the week that is gonna sit

01:38:55.500 --> 01:39:00.500
with me for a while it's gonna sit with me I get it get it yeah yeah all right wow thank

01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:06.300
you for being here Ange yep all right so wimpy it's it's not just the phone I mean I know

01:39:06.300 --> 01:39:10.900
the MX4 is your daily driver correct but you're also trying the tablet experience have you

01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:19.300
noticed be honest wimpy does it work better as a tablet um does it work better as a tablet

01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:24.720
it feels like the it feels like that interface that the whole unity 8 interface is begging

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:29.860
for a tablet UI it just it you know a little extra real estate but still mobile seems like

01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:36.580
the perfect combo like maybe something on the BQ no I don't know I mean I I use I have

01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:41.480
used you know when I was using Android I used the phone and the tablets differently and

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:48.780
I continue to use the phone and the tablet differently so I've got a BQM 10 tablet and

01:39:48.780 --> 01:39:57.560
I also have a Nexus 7 that's also running ok Ubuntu touch the BQM 10 I'm mostly experimenting

01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:06.700
with that as I could this be a laptop replacement yeah exactly and the recent advancements with

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:13.900
Libertine make that very plausible now because it's now possible if you've got a little bit

01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:22.500
of knowledge about how to you know exercise come up the command line utilities you can

01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:29.940
create containers of your favorite legacy X application and run them containers on my

01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:36.900
tablet yeah so and there's a there's a nice guide that somebody wrote recently I'll get

01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:44.180
a link in a moment that explains how Libertine is used to create containers of your app so

01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:53.260
for example creating a container of mumble is very straightforward or audacity or gimp

01:40:53.260 --> 01:41:01.020
or whatever it might be that you want to run on your tablet so that you can have a more

01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:08.860
desktop like productivity experience actually create something on on your tablet oh yeah

01:41:08.860 --> 01:41:13.220
it will it will effectively make the container that runs that app with a launcher so you

01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:21.780
can just start gimp or audacity or mumble or whatever with icons you know that so that's

01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:27.540
that's really very interesting the Nexus 7 is kind of my device that I use just for sort

01:41:27.540 --> 01:41:32.700
of browsing and looking at stuff casually in the evenings so you know when I'm sitting

01:41:32.700 --> 01:41:38.860
in the front room or cooking sure that's that's the device that I have to hand because it's

01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:47.420
more convenient to use than a phone and it's easier to you know look at and yeah for for

01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:53.180
that sort of stuff you know looking at YouTube catching up on podcasts dealing with email

01:41:53.180 --> 01:42:00.060
and telegrams and all of the rest of it it all works just fine on the tablet and and

01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:06.660
phone it certainly works better the MX4 is a slightly bigger screen than the Nexus 4

01:42:06.660 --> 01:42:13.780
which I was using before and the bqe5 and certainly having a bigger screen is favorable

01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:20.540
it's certainly much easier to use with a larger screen sure huh you know I I know it's just

01:42:20.540 --> 01:42:25.460
I can't help but think of myself but I picture a day when I could actually publish something

01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:30.360
like user error completely from the tablet that would be awesome right now Wes what would

01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:33.600
it take for you to be able to use something for work like something that could actually

01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:39.260
get your day-to-day job done what do you need from a tablet and do you have a tablet today

01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:43.920
you know not really there there is a iPad I think it's like a couple generations old

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:46.900
by now that kind of floats around the house purely for consumption but it really doesn't

01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:53.100
see very much use I think for work you know that that Liberty and stuff that would go

01:42:53.100 --> 01:42:57.740
a long way sure I think also that you know last week we're talking about the improvements

01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:01.940
to the terminal I think that would also go a long way if I could have a reasonable you

01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:07.660
know a reasonable experience using thumb desktop apps and having you know SSH and just a friendly

01:43:07.660 --> 01:43:11.460
Linux environment right by my side I'd be willing to cut it some slack in other yeah

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:18.220
me too me too exactly and I and I don't think that is it is I mean we can't deny this that's

01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:27.000
a niche that's an that is absolutely but it is an industry now and there is a lot of us

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:32.860
men and women and in the hundreds of thousands that need to do that you think about every

01:43:32.860 --> 01:43:37.460
small business that has more than a hundred employees they have somebody that could qualify

01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:42.220
think of every large corporation I mean that is a massive massive amount of users that

01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:47.740
is absolutely worth targeting and it could just grow from there I you know I tried to

01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:55.660
buy the the BQ m10 when it went for sale I couldn't get it that the page was all kinds

01:43:55.660 --> 01:44:01.700
of errors and it was just impossible and today I sit here with the Android and sick or I'm

01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:08.060
sorry the 6p and I think to myself I would love to be able to take what I would love

01:44:08.060 --> 01:44:13.140
to have the maybe it's maybe this is a 2018 thing but what I would love to have happen

01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:17.740
is sort of like I can download ISOs now for general PC hardware I would love for Ubuntu

01:44:17.740 --> 01:44:24.060
touch for a large range of great Android devices to be available and I and I realize that would

01:44:24.060 --> 01:44:30.660
take a bunch of community commitment and interaction and work but God dang it would it be cool

01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:37.500
if I could just go get the greatest and latest Nexus device and have a have a good solid

01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:43.540
you know bet that within two to three months of the next Nexus 2016 device coming out I

01:44:43.540 --> 01:44:47.700
could probably get an Ubuntu touch image for it and for the life of that device I could

01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:52.980
run it right and then that's all I really think it would take for me or and wimpy I

01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:57.540
know how you feel about this if I could get my hands on that MX5 hardware something that's

01:44:57.540 --> 01:45:02.420
a real flagship device how's performance Chris is stringent stand because I am a bit of a

01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:07.780
performance bigot wimpy so and you're on the MX4 I don't really know but my my rough understanding

01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:12.140
is it's somewhat equivalent to the Nexus 4 and that seems like it would be ancient no

01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:20.940
no no so I've got a Nexus 4 and the bqe5 okay this this MX4 is head and shoulders above

01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:25.540
those in terms of performance when that is running Ubuntu touch but yeah is that is that

01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:31.060
Ubuntu touch or is that is that the hardware because I might be basing my hardware requirements

01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:39.860
on potentially bloated and Android requirements okay so definitely so it's the hardware basically

01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:48.860
that makes it better there there are definitely improvements that could be made to Ubuntu

01:45:48.860 --> 01:45:58.300
touch to improve the performance and perceived responsiveness of some of the UI and I think

01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:03.580
talking to poppy you know there are some wet well understood things that need to happen

01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:08.060
and there are some technical challenges as to why they have been addressed yet so I think

01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:13.260
that will come in due course but the better the hardware gets the better the experience

01:46:13.260 --> 01:46:19.480
get and the MX4 is significantly better than the Nexus 4 and the e5 and my understanding

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:25.980
is that that this pales in comparison to the pro 5 which is rarer than hen's teeth now

01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:34.100
yeah and I I I really I was wanting to get and went on holiday around the time they were

01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:39.060
released and thought I'll get one when I get back and they were all sold out yeah and now

01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:43.420
you can't find them for that no money yeah yeah and if you want to load Android on that

01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:48.060
I mean if you want to get the one that has Android loaded on it it looks like that probably

01:46:48.060 --> 01:46:53.260
works for loading the initial image but there could be over-the-air update issues potentially

01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:57.660
so as best as I've been able to determine reading some of the guides that are available

01:46:57.660 --> 01:47:05.140
for that you can buy a pro 5 with the international firmware version of Android which is required

01:47:05.140 --> 01:47:10.020
because the Chinese versions you can't unlock the bootloader but the international versions

01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:19.580
you can so you have to have one with the international firmware you can then flash Ubuntu onto that

01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:25.260
pro 5 but so far what I've read and I have haven't researched it very carefully there

01:47:25.260 --> 01:47:31.880
seems to be some difficulty in flashing the Ubuntu recovery image onto that device which

01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:37.500
then means that the over-the-air updates right won't apply automatically you have to go

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:43.580
into the recovery and extract those manually that kind of kills the fun so that's why you

01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:50.220
haven't gone that route at the moment unless because it's they're quite expensive and I'm

01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:57.080
not prepared to risk that unless I'm fairly sure of some success yeah it's kind of how

01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:01.940
I feel too I just want to buy with Ubuntu pre-loaded and you were talking about you

01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:08.980
know other devices there's a website called ubports.com yeah it's one of the community

01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:16.060
members runs that site and that's crowdfunded and there's a list of devices there that can

01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:25.680
run Ubuntu touch at various stages of completion and if you want to see Ubuntu come to one

01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:31.580
of those devices then you come back the development effort for those devices and that's where

01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:36.340
he will focus his attention and most of the nexus I think all of the nexus devices are

01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:43.560
in there and some LG devices and the one plus one plus x one plus two so there's all sorts

01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:48.340
in there oh I should talk to that guy because that sounds exactly like what I just got to

01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:53.460
figure out which nexus device is well supported like the 5x would make a great great Ubuntu

01:48:53.460 --> 01:48:59.220
touch device I would think yeah so it's in that it's in on the list hasn't actually started

01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:05.460
yet but it's at priority three and the nexus 6p is also in the list as well hasn't hasn't

01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:10.900
actually started yet so you know but there's someone there who's and he's been sponsored

01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:16.340
by digital ocean I see as well there you go you know I will mention too just as we kind

01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:22.300
of wrap up here I guess ZTE made the mistake of asking people what they want oof never

01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:26.820
do that and now they've heard it and they've even suspected that there was some sort of

01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:32.120
fraud involved so I encourage you not to do yeah I encourage you not to fraudulate this

01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:39.260
but there is a poll going right now over on ZTE which if you've ever looked at new egg

01:49:39.260 --> 01:49:44.220
for example some really nice ZTE devices are out there and and they're asking for input

01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:47.880
from their community about maybe what can next generation projects they should work

01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:53.540
on etc etc and OMG Ubuntu has generated some attention towards this initiative and I think

01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:59.340
that's why they got so many votes and they're looking for possible ideas for 2017 that are

01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:04.860
quote-unquote reasonable and I just want to give a shout out to this community effort

01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:13.080
here because holy smoking crap did this write-up not only is it totally rocking the ZTE voting

01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:20.980
right now with 88 upvotes but I two thousands who created this post did a true legitimate

01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:30.420
like fortune 500 level proposal on why ZTE should create an Ubuntu touch device it's

01:50:30.420 --> 01:50:34.580
really impressive yeah yeah you saw this I mean he goes to the breakdown different scenarios

01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:41.220
different options for them to consider it's yeah yeah yeah and it I would I would I would

01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:44.480
buy the shit out of this device if ZTE to this because I've looked at some of their

01:50:44.480 --> 01:50:49.080
devices on new egg that are unlocked and been kind of tempted by them because they got front-facing

01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:55.100
speakers they've seemed to have reasonable packaging for the price ZTE has consistently

01:50:55.100 --> 01:51:00.380
caught my eye but not quite crossed that threshold for something that actually willing to spend

01:51:00.380 --> 01:51:05.540
my money on but if they shipped a Ubuntu touch device a hands-down would buy one and if you

01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:09.740
want to kind of just vote in that general direction I'll have a link in the show notes

01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:14.700
for you to go voice your opinion I just think this is super important he says a brief summary

01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:18.860
of the idea is ZTE should provide the following options people to choose when selling a phone

01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:23.480
model pre-installed Ubuntu touch is the primary OS pre-installed Ubuntu touch is a secondary

01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:28.760
OS alongside maybe something like Android or new Ubuntu or no Ubuntu touch installed

01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:32.940
and only something like Android installed he talks about also including something like

01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:37.900
a USB type-c connector and the advantages and the advantages of conversions and all

01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:43.500
of it and I think it's a it's a brilliant post and ZTE would be a fantastic manufacturer

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:48.760
and I've heard I don't know wimpy if you've heard these things but I've heard some rumors

01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:53.700
that perhaps BQ might not be doing another Ubuntu touch device have you heard that wimpy

01:51:53.700 --> 01:52:01.060
I've seen it on Twitter I don't know what the authenticity of those claims are so I

01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:05.100
don't either and it seems like it seems like they've sold as many as they can manufacture

01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:09.700
of the Ubuntu devices so I don't I don't know about that either but maybe we'll see yeah

01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:15.260
it's a bummer because at the moment you can't buy an Ubuntu phone anywhere no in fact unless

01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:23.340
unless you go to eBay if if if today the MX5 Pro were available for purchase I think just

01:52:23.340 --> 01:52:27.200
for Linux unplugged Linux action show alone it'd be worth me picking one up just to try

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:35.260
it but every time I go to their site they're sold out yeah yeah they they had a run and

01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:40.700
I my understanding was they had an allotted production run and once they were sold out

01:52:40.700 --> 01:52:46.420
they were gone so sounds like I see one of those experiment type things I mean Mac you

01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:51.660
had a question go ahead yeah my question to wimpy would be what about multitasking do

01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:56.300
they face the problems they had before for example when I was listening to music on the

01:52:56.300 --> 01:53:01.980
Ubuntu touch I tested it on a Nexus 5 and then wanted to open the browser music stopped

01:53:01.980 --> 01:53:08.940
so multitasking at the time I tested this but not really at a good level so that specific

01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:16.820
example of audio playing there are facilities in the SDK now to continue playing in the

01:53:16.820 --> 01:53:24.420
background good and I know pod bird the podcasting client supports that and there's another app

01:53:24.420 --> 01:53:30.900
called cloud player they both continue to play audio when you switch away from them

01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:37.700
and go and do other things so so long as the app has been updated to support those facilities

01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:44.820
yes it can be done and my second question would be are the Ubuntu touch images all based

01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:53.380
on the same Android base or does it depend on the different devices they run on I'm a

01:53:53.380 --> 01:54:03.820
little bit not sure but my understanding is each device has got a slightly different Android

01:54:03.820 --> 01:54:12.620
base origin so this is why some of the devices can support the Miracast wireless display

01:54:12.620 --> 01:54:20.340
and some can't for example and why some can do fingerprint authentication and some can't

01:54:20.340 --> 01:54:26.940
so I believe there is a correlation between the device and the Android version that it

01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:33.100
can support and therefore what the functionality that it can expose is but next time Popeys

01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:39.740
I'll ask him that question I know he's much more up to speed on that than me I've noticed

01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:44.300
that I can say sorry what I can say Chris the Nexus 5 and I think you've got one of

01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:50.980
these the Nexus 5 is normally a good device to test some of these images I run Sailfish

01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:58.860
OS for example for the Nexus 5 and now it's based on Lollipop and this was a huge advantage

01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:04.660
for Sailfish OS and so I guess if they port if they have a Lollipop base now for Ubuntu

01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:10.740
touch it would run rather good you know I think this is more poignant than ever we started

01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:16.380
this segment with the release of Android N and it's a pretty solid release you know

01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:22.020
if you like Android it's just Android even better but if you don't like Android it's

01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:26.420
everything you don't like even worse but at also at the same time if you're a Nexus

01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:32.260
5 user Wes then you just you just got dropped from support where Ubuntu touch has come along

01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:38.100
and they're kind of you know just picking up momentum how do you feel about that yeah

01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:42.020
you know I can understand it but it is a little disappointing I mean there's lots of ROMs

01:55:42.020 --> 01:55:47.260
to try I am kind of just holding out on this phone until the next Nexus line drops we'll

01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:52.140
see when that is but yeah it does make me way more incentivized to try something else

01:55:52.140 --> 01:55:57.580
and I played with Ubuntu touch on here probably like a year ago and I haven't visited back

01:55:57.580 --> 01:56:01.940
so maybe I'll give that a flash here as soon and see what it's like so I just posted a

01:56:01.940 --> 01:56:09.840
link in the chat room which is to the UB ports Nexus 5 build they've got green ticks in everything

01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:15.020
except for Bluetooth support so the Nexus 5 version can support everything except for

01:56:15.020 --> 01:56:21.900
Bluetooth so it is very close and when I got my first Ubuntu touch device it was about

01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:29.340
14-15 months ago and things have improved massively since then yeah you know isn't it

01:56:29.340 --> 01:56:33.260
when you come from Android wimpy isn't it kind of novel all of a sudden just see constant

01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:39.500
improvements to your OS like on a reoccurring schedule it is and you know that's that's

01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:48.660
kind of tainted because you you look at Ubuntu touch having and I've been using Android since

01:56:48.660 --> 01:56:55.780
2010 2011 so you know that's a lot you know Google have got massive resources they've

01:56:55.780 --> 01:57:00.660
been able to throw an Android and make it this dominant platform so you look at Ubuntu

01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:06.140
and you think oh you know there is there is these little paper cut type issues but then

01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:14.540
when you go and look what the upcoming releases are in the next OTA you see so many of these

01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:21.820
paper cuts being addressed now that's exhilarating in a sense it is and you know part of me wanting

01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:29.260
to do this wasn't so much about running Ubuntu touch but it was to really capture some of

01:57:29.260 --> 01:57:37.180
that spirit and enthusiasm I had for Linux way way back when I first discovered Linux

01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:44.780
in the in the mid to late 1990s and that sort of pioneering spirit and it's not perfect

01:57:44.780 --> 01:57:50.860
yet but it could be and you can be part of the solution even if all you do is run it

01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:56.400
and tell the developers yeah it could be better if you did this right that's part of the reason

01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:01.260
why I'm doing doesn't it doesn't it and I okay I want to say two things first of all

01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:05.180
before we go much further here it's not like I'm all of a sudden drinking the Kool-Aid

01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:12.620
but as I have become more comfortable with Antigros and Ubuntu Mate and Fedora as as

01:58:12.620 --> 01:58:20.260
my go-to desktops I'm it is freeing me up conceptually to just let go of the Ubuntu

01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:25.540
default desktop and let them focus on mobile because it doesn't affect me anymore and I

01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:31.140
don't have a horse in this race and so I can now look at the Ubuntu touch project from

01:58:31.140 --> 01:58:39.860
a more dispassionate perspective because in the past I carried my baggage I carried the

01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:45.460
baggage of you sons of bitches are working on this mobile project instead of my desktop

01:58:45.460 --> 01:58:52.100
how dare you and I came with that bias towards Ubuntu touch but now and and wimpy I'm not

01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:56.140
just saying this to blow smoke up your proper butthole it is generally because of projects

01:58:56.140 --> 01:59:01.420
like Ubuntu Mate and honestly the gnome desktop that I just don't give a shit what happens

01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:06.460
to unity really personally that I have been able to step back and just watch this new

01:59:06.460 --> 01:59:11.000
effort of theirs from a completely new perspective and I look at this and it is totally exciting

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:15.900
for me and so that is number one I just want to I just want to mention that's kind of

01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:24.100
my perspective on on this overall but number two we all we all have concerns I think to

01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:30.020
some degree about the privacy of using an Android device or an Apple device we all have

01:59:30.020 --> 01:59:36.580
concerns to some degree about how to install applications on our device outside the channels

01:59:36.580 --> 01:59:40.740
that are pushed by the platform and we all have concerns about being able to modify our

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:46.580
device in a way that suits us and so in that regard as a technology enthusiast Ubuntu touch

01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:52.660
has always managed to check those boxes for me and I now I sit back and I really think

01:59:52.660 --> 01:59:56.060
it's boy it's a matter of hardware for sure and I'm still waiting for the perfect

01:59:56.060 --> 02:00:01.980
hardware but once that comes along for me be it the 5x or you know I'm looking right

02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:08.120
now over at UBports and it appears that if if I were to donate Bitcoin in the equivalent

02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:12.660
of five hundred and ten dollars which for me would be less than one Bitcoin right now

02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:18.020
it would all of a sudden the Nexus 6p would become a priority for them that's less than

02:00:18.020 --> 02:00:23.120
the next smartphone if I were to buy it unlocked for me if I could take my Nexus 6p and donate

02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:27.660
five hundred ten dollars equivalent of Bitcoin to this project and have a and maybe one day

02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:33.320
have a have a version for the Nexus 6p then I could just continue to use my current hardware

02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:38.100
until that comes out but yeah but aside from from all of that I think the point that you

02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:46.420
made wimpy is what excites me the most and that is it feels like the early two thousands

02:00:46.420 --> 02:00:52.780
the late late nineties where it's not ready for everybody but if you're willing to sort

02:00:52.780 --> 02:00:57.620
of get in and get in the mud a little bit you can make this a viable platform one day

02:00:57.620 --> 02:01:02.780
for everybody else by banging on the rough edges commenting giving feedback maybe even

02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:08.900
making bug fixes is sort of what drew me to Linux a decade ago and do you find that to

02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:13.280
be sort of the position you find yourself in now with Ubuntu touch wimpy absolutely

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:18.480
and I'm by no means a pioneer here because there are people that have been running these

02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:27.140
devices as their main phones for 18 months or more now who are far more advanced in how

02:01:27.140 --> 02:01:31.300
they're putting apps together and there's some quite sophisticated apps available now

02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:40.300
so there's one called rockworks which is available from the open store and I have complete support

02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:48.180
for both my pebble watches with Ubuntu touch using and the experience on my pebble watch

02:01:48.180 --> 02:01:56.880
is exactly as I had it on Android with no no shortcomings whatsoever so you know there

02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:03.100
are there are not many but they're the ones that exist the native apps are getting very

02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:10.860
very good now and are solving real problems and it feels like it's really got momentum

02:02:10.860 --> 02:02:15.940
and there's there's some talented people behind it and but yeah there's still some good work

02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:21.900
to be done that you can have maybe yeah some influence in right absolutely I mean like

02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:28.580
I said even if it's just commenting on the apps in the App Store to say this Twitter

02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:35.140
app is better than that Twitter app because you know and up rate the ones that are good

02:02:35.140 --> 02:02:40.460
so that other people don't have this dilemma as to well which of the several Twitter apps

02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:50.300
should I install but also I think there are a few proprietary applications for Ubuntu

02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:57.980
touch but most are open source so there are issue trackers that you can go and find and

02:02:57.980 --> 02:03:02.420
you can actually have dialogue with the developers directly which of course is difficult to do

02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:10.300
on some of the other platforms so just just by sharing your ideas you can have some involvement

02:03:10.300 --> 02:03:18.060
in shaping individual apps and and the device as a whole that is you know for those of us

02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:24.980
who are enthusiasts that's sort of a delightful era for a new platform and it's rare because

02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:30.220
once the platform becomes established and lots of users it sort of passes and you know

02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:36.580
it's your chance to be sort of a hipster before it's famous but in a way that is empowering

02:03:36.580 --> 02:03:41.780
for those of us that want to move away from the Google platform and you know privacy concerns

02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:47.520
and you know pioneering spirit aside obviously the main reason I've done this is because

02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:53.860
I want to be an Ubuntu touch hipster I don't believe you for a second but the other two

02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:58.980
reasons I do believe yeah and I really am thankful that you've joined us again and give

02:03:58.980 --> 02:04:04.340
us an update and it kind of makes me wimpy I tell you if there's a way to make it possible

02:04:04.340 --> 02:04:11.140
if the MX5 becomes available again I think I'm gonna jump on it is or or wait for a Nexus

02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:14.420
5 image to really kind of get Bluetooth ironed out and then jump on that and at least try

02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:22.580
it for a bit because it really is for me the perfect time to jump in I love this phase

02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:28.100
of a new platform as long as it has just enough stuff yeah just enough stuff that I can get

02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:35.100
by day to day I I'll tell you I'll tell you something I I you know using Android N and

02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:43.240
iOS 9 shit ton of problems still tons of problems totally unbelievable the shit that doesn't

02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:47.420
work on these platforms this long into it I sit there and I think to myself how could

02:04:47.420 --> 02:04:52.820
they not have caught this and if I'm gonna feel that way anyways you know if I'm gonna

02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:57.940
if I'm gonna say Aaron shake man go damn it Google why didn't you think of this problem

02:04:57.940 --> 02:05:04.100
I might as well be using something where I can submit bugs I can have some kind of discourse

02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:08.780
in the evolution of the platform and I can at least be there when when there's a rational

02:05:08.780 --> 02:05:12.920
explanation why some of these things don't work and I know that seems like a weird cognitive

02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:20.740
disconnect from but it generally it drives me crazy to use these more modern platforms

02:05:20.740 --> 02:05:23.680
or feature complete platforms or whatever you want to call them and they still have

02:05:23.680 --> 02:05:27.320
some of these fundamental usability issues at the end of the day I just need certain

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:32.780
base functionality and the rest is all gravy and so I just am waiting for the perfect hardware

02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:38.780
device to come along and and maybe maybe I need to reassess my requirements because I'm

02:05:38.780 --> 02:05:42.360
looking at it from a perspective an Android user but I don't know wimpy you tell me do

02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:48.780
I is there a one-to-one performance ratio between Ubuntu touch and Android or can I

02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:54.280
get away with maybe a little less hardware using Ubuntu touch because maybe I'm not running

02:05:54.280 --> 02:06:05.180
Java etc no not really like I said there are some interactions with Ubuntu touch the user

02:06:05.180 --> 02:06:13.980
interface that are slower than the hardware is capable of so you want the best hardware

02:06:13.980 --> 02:06:20.340
if you if you if your Nexus 5 is spare definitely put the current image for the Nexus 5 on it

02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:28.480
it's a community port so it's not as robust as the officially blessed versions yeah but

02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:33.460
it does give you a flavor of where things are now and you know how your Nexus 5 performs

02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:43.540
with Android so you can make that comparison and some of the how do you characterize it

02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:49.300
it's it's just the way Ubuntu works at the moment and I'm sure this is going to get ironed

02:06:49.300 --> 02:06:54.180
out in the not too distant future but when it does you can so there are some apps that

02:06:54.180 --> 02:07:01.620
are just C and they bypass some of the framework and those applications when you start them

02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:07.340
they launch instantly like there's your fingers not off the screen and they're running but

02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:11.700
a lot of the apps that are using the framework they have the little spinner that gets them

02:07:11.700 --> 02:07:16.720
going when they get started up so you have to sort of go into it knowing you're not going

02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:23.140
to have this immediate snap snap snap type experience yeah I think on the pro 5 it's

02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:29.220
much better because that's a super fast much beef beefier machine yeah yeah the hardware

02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:34.980
that's doing that yeah have you just kind of tangently related have you seen the announcement

02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:41.900
from the cute project of cute light I have only in passing not really in detail that

02:07:41.900 --> 02:07:46.460
might that might help with some of that because you know let's be honest if you're if you're

02:07:46.460 --> 02:07:49.900
using cute based applications there's a lot there and if there's something like cute

02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:53.300
light that could come along and sort of they're kind of they're focusing cute light more

02:07:53.300 --> 02:07:57.780
of the Internet of Things type devices but you could also see it working on something

02:07:57.780 --> 02:08:04.420
like Ubuntu touch and perhaps think of think of cutie light as more of a minimal build

02:08:04.420 --> 02:08:10.700
from base up of cute functions whereas the traditional cute environment is huge it's

02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:14.740
got everything you need to do everything you could possibly want including touch support

02:08:14.740 --> 02:08:18.580
which is extremely useful but it also means that when you load the applicant when you

02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:22.080
load I would think I'm totally speculating here but when you load a cute application

02:08:22.080 --> 02:08:25.660
for the first time there's a lot of other things in the background you have to load

02:08:25.660 --> 02:08:32.100
to support that where cute light could sort of tighten that up a bit I don't know a lot

02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:36.520
about it but I was just reading about it today and it seems like it could be the perfect

02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:41.420
thing for Ubuntu touch and then you combine that with the fact that canonical has recently

02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:49.500
become a backer of KDE EV which is the commercial entity behind KDE yeah yeah and and you know

02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:56.900
Ubuntu has also got support for Cordova yes react something or other another Java that's

02:08:56.900 --> 02:09:04.100
the one yeah JavaScript you know libraries for making native apps so that word needs

02:09:04.100 --> 02:09:08.900
to get propagated because there are lots of people that have created their apps using

02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:15.380
those frameworks that could come over directly without any any messing about you know it's

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:23.180
interesting we've talked about LibreVault and Ubuntu touch and they both have the big

02:09:23.180 --> 02:09:31.580
huge you know marquee scrolling or HTML flashing tag warning that this is early days on both

02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:38.420
of these Ubuntu touch and LibreVault at the same time I think for our audience they're

02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:42.740
both getting to the point where if you kind of have a pioneering spirit for this particular

02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:48.580
thing be it your file sync or your mobile device and fully acknowledging that both of

02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:52.700
these things for some people are critical day-to-day devices that must be completely

02:09:52.700 --> 02:09:56.860
flawless but if if some of you out there have that pioneering spirit for either one of these

02:09:56.860 --> 02:10:02.940
types of technologies it's for both of them getting to be time for that type of person

02:10:02.940 --> 02:10:08.700
to jump in and that is super exciting for somebody like me because that's exactly the

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:12.900
type of person that I am and I think of a lot of our audience is to watch this stuff

02:10:12.900 --> 02:10:16.860
from this part and go boy you know I'm really like for me wimpy I'll be completely honest

02:10:16.860 --> 02:10:20.180
I am thrilled that for the last couple of weeks you've been running Ubuntu touch because

02:10:20.180 --> 02:10:24.620
I get updates from you on how it's going and I can I can kind of project how would how

02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:29.300
that would translate for my experience and you're making you're giving me baited breath

02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:34.100
you're making my mouth water you're making me want to switch and I think it's super exciting

02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:38.460
and it's funny because I don't know if either one of you you or myself would recommend or

02:10:38.460 --> 02:10:42.060
probably West would recommend that people go deploy LibreVault or Ubuntu touch for their

02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:47.740
daily driver today but it definitely is ready for a certain class of us or a certain type

02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:54.340
of user and wimpy just to kind of wrap it all up would you kind of give us an idea of

02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:57.940
the range of devices you're trying it just that we kind of a full picture of your experience

02:10:57.940 --> 02:11:02.140
that way when it does blow up and I mean if it ever does blow up in your face we have

02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:05.740
an idea of what you test on because I was kind of impressed when you can share it with

02:11:05.740 --> 02:11:19.500
me. Okay I've got a Nexus 4, a Nexus 7 tablet, a BQE5 HD phone, the Meizu MX4 and the BQM

02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:24.300
10 tablet. Damn son! Whoa! Yeah that's quite a lot of devices. You know if you if you do

02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:30.220
have that pioneering spirit and you want to experiment then consider getting yourself

02:11:30.220 --> 02:11:39.580
a Nexus 7 2013 or a Nexus 4 off eBay because they go quite cheap now and they are officially

02:11:39.580 --> 02:11:45.300
supported devices for Ubuntu touch so they come direct from the canonical channels and

02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:50.160
you can be involved in actually testing these things and trying them out you know that you

02:11:50.160 --> 02:11:54.860
don't have to make it your daily device you know I didn't for over a year I had a you

02:11:54.860 --> 02:12:00.100
know one pound SIM in my Nexus 4 for months and months and months experimenting with it

02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:06.220
before I determined it was time to make the move but you know you can participate at that

02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:13.260
level. Yeah well shoot you're making me want to try it especially on a tablet I know right

02:12:13.260 --> 02:12:18.620
I'm excited. Have you tried on any of your devices? Just the Nexus 5 but oh yeah that's

02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:22.980
right it was a while ago yeah yeah it was it'll probably be a much better experience.

02:12:22.980 --> 02:12:26.540
Yeah maybe when the next Nexus device comes out and you got the 5 sitting around you could

02:12:26.540 --> 02:12:31.300
try it out and give us the unplugged take. I think I will. I like it. Well there you

02:12:31.300 --> 02:12:35.340
go that sort of brings us to the end of this week's discussion we have lots of links to

02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:39.100
all the stuff we talked about. Don't forget if you're like me and you'd love to see a

02:12:39.100 --> 02:12:47.020
Ubuntu touch on the Nexus 6P the ubports.com a devices.ubports.com specifically has a funding

02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:51.460
page on it that'd be pretty damn cool and if you're getting finally to the end of this

02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:57.140
extremely long episode of the unplugged program and you want more go check out user air episode

02:12:57.140 --> 02:13:02.980
one is over at jupitabroadcasting.com right now as we record this very episode. Wes thank

02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:10.220
you for making it despite real life diversity. Hey thank you for I love being here. Absolutely

02:13:10.220 --> 02:13:15.320
absolutely and you know what if the folks at home wanted to join us it turns out we

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:20.740
have a diabolical plan you could join us over at jblive.tv on a Tuesday. Oh what time

02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:27.980
you ask. Clever of you. Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar where we have robots that automatically

02:13:27.980 --> 02:13:33.300
adjust it to your time zone in real time before the page even loads. Thank you robots. Thank

02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:37.260
you right. They don't and I think they probably run Ubuntu touch too. I haven't confirmed

02:13:37.260 --> 02:13:42.620
it yet. Definitely. I just got them on eBay. Also litxactionshow.reddit.com if you want

02:13:42.620 --> 02:13:46.540
to give us some feedback for episode 159 or submit a topic and don't forget you can join

02:13:46.540 --> 02:13:50.220
us on our virtual lug get more information in our chatroom at jblive.tv and we'll see

02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:51.740
you right back here next week.

02:14:20.220 --> 02:14:44.860
All Wimpy's Vault. That's a good title. That's pretty good. That's good though. Oh yeah yeah

02:14:44.860 --> 02:14:48.340
yeah boy look at that look at that text highlighting yeah thanks to Ange for stopping by she had

02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:52.260
to go because we went so long but that was great that was a lot of fun sorry sorry about

02:14:52.260 --> 02:14:57.940
that no no it was a bit of an epic no no you know I love it you know I love it so now we

02:14:57.940 --> 02:15:03.460
just we just have to name this thing over JBtitles.com with the new suggest with the

02:15:03.460 --> 02:15:09.900
new fancy updated website thanks to Rekai and team the JBot has gotten some recent refreshes

02:15:09.900 --> 02:15:16.400
actually and I can actually say this now we go into some quite some detail about the changes

02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:20.260
to JBot and how we do that and the code and the community members involved in user error

02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:25.700
episode one it was really fun so I employ you you have multiple disks that you're going

02:15:25.700 --> 02:15:31.780
to be pulling in and out and mismatched sizes and all that kind of stuff right I don't know

02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:37.180
I probably just because the necessity of budget over time that'll have to be how it works

02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:41.300
but I would like to start with a base and I think storage I think that's overlooked

02:15:41.300 --> 02:15:49.380
with ZFS sorry British ZFS because if there's like a hidden cost to an upgrade when you

02:15:49.380 --> 02:15:54.420
think right I've run out of storage you need to add a whole new pool or replace three four

02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:58.820
five drives all at once and you know I don't know about you but when I fill up a disk I

02:15:58.820 --> 02:16:03.900
just want to buy another three terabyte drive whack it in there and call it good and to

02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:09.780
do that I use something called merger FS which presents all of the drives in my system under

02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:16.340
a single mount point using a fuse files them and I'm running in it on a see you 750 as

02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:21.660
rock board yeah so it's a union file system that sort of brings them all in under one

02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:27.220
mount point huh yeah and all you do is you modify your mount point in FS tab sorry whoever

02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:33.000
I talked over your mount point you modify your mount point with one line or you just

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:39.340
do a mount command and it will add the drive that you've just plugged in into the the fuse

02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:46.780
where that is just a mount and I've been using it for I mean I tried MHDFS or whatever it's

02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:54.300
called I tried another union file system and then after about 18 months of lots of ghost

02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:59.340
files and messing about I settled on merger FS about a year ago yeah and since then Chris

02:16:59.340 --> 02:17:03.460
it's been absolutely perfect no performance penalties really or there must be some right

02:17:03.460 --> 02:17:08.820
because this is a fuse it uses a bit of CPU yeah it uses a bit of CPU but I have a atom

02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:13.220
cause and when I'm transcoding a couple of Plex streams around my house I don't notice

02:17:13.220 --> 02:17:19.180
any difference whatsoever absolutely oh and to dovetail with that there are two plugins

02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:26.780
for open media vault that support those technologies so that you can grow your file system without

02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:32.540
having to employ a traditional raid and you don't have to have matched size disks for

02:17:32.540 --> 02:17:38.620
growth I forgot the best bit merger FS doesn't stripe file systems across the drives yes

02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:43.980
this drive has its own individually readable file system so even if you exceed your redundancy

02:17:43.980 --> 02:17:48.140
level you only lose the data on the drives that failed in excess of that level and you

02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:52.260
can still read you plug that drive into any other Linux box and just read the data you

02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:56.900
know that'd be a perfect way to like have some drives for TV shows that I don't really

02:17:56.900 --> 02:18:01.120
care about on this disk that's not as redundant too because I've thought about doing like

02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:06.780
these are my cheaper disks these are my more important keepsakes on on open media vault

02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:11.380
the plugins you want to look at our gray hole and snap raid they provide those facilities

02:18:11.380 --> 02:18:18.780
that plus one I just just separate huh well this is good stuff yeah you need to set up

02:18:18.780 --> 02:18:24.520
you need to set up a cron job for the sink of the parity to run every night or something

02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:30.420
like that otherwise you're effectively running the data that day doesn't have any parity

02:18:30.420 --> 02:18:37.460
protection or you can force a sink if you like but I spent probably the best part of

02:18:37.460 --> 02:18:42.900
three years getting down to this final docker snap raid and merger FS on top of Debian which

02:18:42.900 --> 02:18:48.260
in my case I chose to roll myself but you know it will work on top of open media vault

02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:52.420
just perfectly with plugins with a gooey I don't need any of that because I can just

02:18:52.420 --> 02:18:58.300
SSH from my phone into my server and it just don't you know I remember now that I'm looking

02:18:58.300 --> 02:19:03.220
at the gray hole website I have also looked at gray hole as potentially doing a segment

02:19:03.220 --> 02:19:10.260
on last about it and I never even thought about setting it up for storage that is slick

02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:15.180
so snap it raid or snap raid or snap raid dot IT if you want to go to the site and gray

02:19:15.180 --> 02:19:19.980
hole dot net for gray hole which is an application that uses Samba to create a storage pool of

02:19:19.980 --> 02:19:23.020
all your available hard drives and allows you to create redundant copies of the files

02:19:23.020 --> 02:19:27.660
you store in order to prevent data loss when part of your hardware fails have you had any

02:19:27.660 --> 02:19:33.140
inclination at all to try out the not sure how you say it in LA s and one email client

02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:41.820
that has the hosted component and is electron ish I did try it when it was first announced

02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:48.300
I created a gash Google account to hook it up to so I could but basically so I could

02:19:48.300 --> 02:19:55.380
just see what the UI was like and use it and all the rest of it and every so often I kind

02:19:55.380 --> 02:20:01.620
of update it and I haven't I haven't done what Wes has done which is host my own middleware

02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:05.740
for want of a better description you know that piece that does the brokering between

02:20:05.740 --> 02:20:10.580
the client and your back end servers I've just used their hosted platform because it

02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:16.540
was a disposable account I'll tell you what I what I found what I what always draws me

02:20:16.540 --> 02:20:24.280
to Thunderbird is how how how much I like the enigma GPG plug-in and whenever I want

02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:31.000
to have a good secure emails setup it's such an attractive easy to use simple straightforward

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:37.040
system that works well with my workflow and I think it's finally been beat by n1 simply

02:20:37.040 --> 02:20:42.140
also because it's been easier for the audience to find me on Keybase and so that tends to

02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:47.540
be what they sign against and and one has one one check integration with Keybase and

02:20:47.540 --> 02:20:52.780
it hit it is it has taken that ease of use to the next level and from what I can tell

02:20:52.780 --> 02:20:56.900
appears to be a pretty secure implementation and all that's being done locally in the composer

02:20:56.900 --> 02:21:02.860
so so the the advantage of Keybase being easy discoverability of your keys yeah so you can

02:21:02.860 --> 02:21:08.060
have seamless email exchanges well and you know I kind of like there they have an interesting

02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:12.360
approach to verifying who you are you know because one of the things that's really kind

02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:16.580
of the weak spot of GPG in reality is the web of trust works best when you can go to

02:21:16.580 --> 02:21:22.440
a con or a fest or a or a live event and you know everybody there can do a little key exchange

02:21:22.440 --> 02:21:27.200
and hi I'm so-and-so it's really me here's my key that works well but it doesn't work

02:21:27.200 --> 02:21:32.140
at scale and what Keybase allows you to do is connect to other online presence that are

02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:37.500
well established and trusted and then by building up several of them and also in some cases

02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:41.660
I think in mine I'm using something Bitcoin related to like there's something there that's

02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:46.100
it's pretty concrete it's like three or four for me different these are obviously really

02:21:46.100 --> 02:21:51.060
Chris Lass's account so it gives the audience some confidence now you have to have certain

02:21:51.060 --> 02:21:55.720
faith in Keybase IO and assume they're setting it up right but those implementation details

02:21:55.720 --> 02:22:02.940
to me seem to be interesting concepts mm-hmm okay yeah I it's just finding the time I'm

02:22:02.940 --> 02:22:09.500
interested in Nihilus because I think it looks like a nice user in base yeah and I like their

02:22:09.500 --> 02:22:14.200
ability to tag emails for follow-up so I can I can technically have read them and process

02:22:14.200 --> 02:22:17.940
them but I don't have to take action on it immediately I can come back another time and

02:22:17.940 --> 02:22:22.140
that's also nice and then it has it has interesting and I didn't even realize it was because I

02:22:22.140 --> 02:22:26.260
just I guess it's just turned on by default and some male clients support it is it does

02:22:26.260 --> 02:22:30.980
read receipts by default and what's interesting about that is it's it's also integrated with

02:22:30.980 --> 02:22:35.040
the desktop environment notification so I'm off doing something else and I just get a

02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:39.340
quick gnome notification that so-and-so has read the email I sent them and then it slides

02:22:39.340 --> 02:22:44.200
away and I you would think that's it's actually kind of neat it makes email feel a little

02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:49.060
more 2016 first of all the fact I'm getting a gnome notification about it but also just

02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:53.380
how seamless that was I didn't really have to do anything yeah that's a good point because

02:22:53.380 --> 02:23:04.540
yeah I I always I emails that have got read receipts with deep suspicion yeah I agree

02:23:04.540 --> 02:23:09.060
I didn't realize it was on by default they also by default put a little a promo for the

02:23:09.060 --> 02:23:12.860
email client and the signature and it's a little tricky to get rid of it because when

02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:16.360
you go to the signatures configuration it has nothing listed if you've never created

02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:20.780
one and the only way to get rid of the default one that puts in there is by creating one

02:23:20.780 --> 02:23:43.780
yeah I like okay very nice guys
