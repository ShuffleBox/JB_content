00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 43 for June 3rd, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:42.160
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that has that fresh, minty flavor.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.480
My name is Chris.

00:43.480 --> 00:44.480
My name is Matt.

00:44.480 --> 00:45.480
Hey, Matt.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.480
So we're going to talk about Linux Mint 17 today.

00:46.480 --> 00:51.000
It was a release that came out over the weekend, and it's an interesting release because this

00:51.000 --> 00:56.320
one is the version that will be supported until 2016.

00:56.320 --> 00:59.000
And technically it will continue to get updates until 2019.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Wow.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Yeah.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.360
So that's a huge, like, they're going to base and continue to push, like, all new versions

01:04.360 --> 01:07.720
of Linux Mint until 2016 off this platform.

01:07.720 --> 01:09.600
This is maybe the biggest release they've ever had.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.600
I don't know.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.600
I don't know if that's maybe overstated.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.800
It might not be, actually.

01:12.800 --> 01:13.800
It feels that way.

01:13.800 --> 01:14.800
I think that's a safe bet.

01:14.800 --> 01:15.800
Yeah.

01:15.800 --> 01:16.800
And so I've had it running here.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.800
I've also been trying out Cinnamon on some of my Arch boxes, and the Mumble Room's got

01:19.800 --> 01:21.880
it installed, so we'll talk with those guys about it.

01:21.880 --> 01:28.400
And then also, if we have time after that, and I think we probably will, Matt wrote up

01:28.400 --> 01:34.160
an article on DataMation about, you know, essentially asking, are Ubuntu derivatives

01:34.160 --> 01:36.500
possibly a bad thing?

01:36.500 --> 01:42.240
And Aaron Saigo on Google Plus today asked the question, what has Mint accomplished in,

01:42.240 --> 01:46.240
you know, in terms of furthering desktop adoption and things like that?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.400
And the two questions are kind of being raised at the same time.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.960
Both are valid points, and I think we'll have a conversation on that.

01:50.960 --> 01:55.080
And then last but not least, developers have been complaining about something that I hold

01:55.080 --> 01:59.000
dearly on the desktop, and that's OpenGL.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.200
And I feel like this is one of those cases where sometimes developers just complain and

02:03.200 --> 02:06.640
complain and complain, and they jump on a bandwagon where they're not fully informed

02:06.640 --> 02:09.680
on a topic, and then it just turns into a giant circle jerk.

02:09.680 --> 02:13.680
And right now, OpenGL's in the crosshairs of apparently every developer out there.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.920
So if we have time, we'll get to that towards the end of the show.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.320
But Matt, I want to start with some feedback.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.120
We got something kind of neat going on.

02:20.120 --> 02:24.720
This is more of an FYI heads up for folks in the Jupyter broadcasting community.

02:24.720 --> 02:29.680
If you're going to Southeast Linux Fest, we have a thread in the Linux Action Show subreddit

02:29.680 --> 02:31.720
where we'd like you to check in.

02:31.720 --> 02:35.480
Our crew is going to be down there, Q5 Sis and Noah and some others.

02:35.480 --> 02:39.400
I don't know who all is going, officially, I think Blaster might be going too and a few

02:39.400 --> 02:40.400
others.

02:40.400 --> 02:41.400
Nice.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.760
And they'll be taking interviews and getting clips for Jupyter broadcasting shows at Southeast

02:45.760 --> 02:46.760
Linux Fest.

02:46.760 --> 02:51.240
So if you're going to go and want to meet up with the guys and say hi, go over to the

02:51.240 --> 02:57.360
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com subreddit and check in in the Southeast Linux Fest 2014 sign-in

02:57.360 --> 02:58.360
sheet.

02:58.360 --> 02:59.360
That way they can kind of coordinate.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.000
That's how they're kind of getting everything put together.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
So that should be fun.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I kind of wish I was going.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.680
We won't be making it to that one ourselves.

03:05.680 --> 03:11.040
Matt and I, we had a good time at Linux Fest, but we can only go to so many in a year.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.040
So true.

03:12.040 --> 03:13.040
So true.

03:13.040 --> 03:14.040
Okay, Matt.

03:14.040 --> 03:17.680
So speaking of Linux Fest, Jared writes in about Texas Linux Fest.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.680
He says, hey, Chris and Matt.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.800
I'll soon be attending my first Linux Fest right here in Austin.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.680
After watching your coverage up north, I decided to look for one near me.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.680
I'm new to the Linux fun and I want to have the most enjoyable time possible while I go.

03:28.680 --> 03:34.240
My brother and father will be along for the ride as I've come from a long line of thinkers.

03:34.240 --> 03:36.660
Please check out the link if you have some time and let me know of any recommendations

03:36.660 --> 03:37.660
on talks.

03:37.660 --> 03:39.760
Additionally, I just started watching a few months ago and I'm hooked on the Jupyter

03:39.760 --> 03:41.720
broadcasting program.

03:41.720 --> 03:42.920
This network is a real treat.

03:42.920 --> 03:43.920
Thank you.

03:43.920 --> 03:48.400
And he said he's got his four-year-old daughter on Edubuntu for her first machine and it totally

03:48.400 --> 03:49.400
rocks.

03:49.400 --> 03:53.240
So let's go take a look over at texaslinuxfest.org.

03:53.240 --> 03:57.240
And they have it in slash content slash event dash schedule.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.120
And I'm looking at this right now.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.520
This looks like a pretty good lineup.

04:01.520 --> 04:06.080
They've got Wellware and Red Hat and Golden Frog and HP and Linux Foundation as sponsors.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.080
Yeah.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.640
I don't know, man.

04:08.640 --> 04:12.560
The graphical ZFS tools would be one for my interest.

04:12.560 --> 04:16.440
And also Linux shaping the future of network file systems would also be one that I would

04:16.440 --> 04:17.440
find to be pretty interesting.

04:17.440 --> 04:19.480
This looks like a pretty solid lineup.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.720
OpenStack for beginners might be good if you've heard a lot about OpenStack but you

04:22.720 --> 04:25.020
don't know where it is, what it is.

04:25.020 --> 04:28.360
This is one of the things that fests are great for is you can go in and sit in on talk that

04:28.360 --> 04:32.080
you might not have originally gone to but since you're there and it's got a good time

04:32.080 --> 04:33.860
and you can always get up and leave.

04:33.860 --> 04:37.760
But I have done that a few times where I'm like I think I might be kind of interested

04:37.760 --> 04:42.600
in this but I'm not sure and I'll go sit in and it's always been a good experience.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.200
So go through that list and check it out.

04:44.200 --> 04:50.040
And if you're going to be at Texas Linux Fest, say hi to Jared, a fellow Linux Unplugged

04:50.040 --> 04:52.040
listener.

04:52.040 --> 04:57.160
We got a few people that wrote in about Manjaro again, defending it.

04:57.160 --> 05:00.760
We talked about Manjaro last week and a little bit the week before.

05:00.760 --> 05:05.760
And I got to say, hats off to pretty much everybody who wrote in some really well-stated,

05:05.760 --> 05:09.320
well-reasoned emails defending Manjaro and why it works for them.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.320
Sam wrote in one of them.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.960
It's a bit long but I'll go through some of these.

05:12.960 --> 05:17.200
Hey, Chris and Matt, just a quick response to the conversation about Manjaro in Unplugged

05:17.200 --> 05:18.480
42.

05:18.480 --> 05:22.960
I use and enjoy Manjaro on all of my laptops and I've installed it for new Linux users.

05:22.960 --> 05:26.680
I think that the benefits of Manjaro's delayed release scheme have recently been proven with

05:26.680 --> 05:28.040
the release of Cinnamon 2.2.

05:28.040 --> 05:32.000
And see, the reason why I wanted to read this one is because Sam, I specifically called

05:32.000 --> 05:35.940
out can anybody tell me a use case where these delayed packages have actually saved anybody

05:35.940 --> 05:36.940
any trouble.

05:36.940 --> 05:42.320
He says, both Arch and Manjaro update their versions of the UPower package to a new version

05:42.320 --> 05:45.200
that changed its API from the typical OSS fashion.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.440
A consequence of that is a lot of Cinnamon's features relating to power management stopped

05:48.440 --> 05:49.440
working.

05:49.440 --> 05:52.480
It was an easy fix for Arch packagers and it took a long time to get Cinnamon 2.2 in

05:52.480 --> 05:53.480
a usable place.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.840
Oh, I'm sorry, it wasn't an easy fix.

05:54.840 --> 05:59.240
During almost a month, Cinnamon 2.2 under Arch was in a really rough shape.

05:59.240 --> 06:03.760
Manjaro, on the other hand, pushed Cinnamon 2.2 and the new UPower package into its unstable

06:03.760 --> 06:08.640
branch and later to its testing repos, where testers did find lots of issues and even worked

06:08.640 --> 06:10.760
with Arch packagers who were quite helpful at fixing them.

06:10.760 --> 06:14.680
But Manjaro users on the stable branch never had to suffer through that.

06:14.680 --> 06:18.760
Even more significantly, at the time, there was no problem with NDM, the default Manjaro

06:18.760 --> 06:19.920
display manager.

06:19.920 --> 06:24.000
That made it completely, there was a problem that made it completely stop working again.

06:24.000 --> 06:29.540
Manjaro and stable branch users saw the bugs and stable users of Manjaro were never affected.

06:29.540 --> 06:33.360
As major security patches, Manjaro occasionally releases out of band off package updates if

06:33.360 --> 06:36.040
security issue is big enough to warrant it.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.760
So please be kind to Manjaro.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.240
It's providing a great service to its users.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.240
What a great response, Sam.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.240
What do you think about that?

06:42.240 --> 06:45.880
Yeah, I think that really nails it because, I mean, you know, most of my computers are

06:45.880 --> 06:48.120
actually, you know, are Arch based.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.360
I mean, they're based, essentially it's just Arch.

06:50.360 --> 06:55.880
However, the machine I call you each week when we do Linux unplugged is a Manjaro machine

06:55.880 --> 06:59.680
because quite honestly, I don't want to roll the dice with Skype every week.

06:59.680 --> 07:03.320
I don't need to, you know, or not just Skype, but any of the backend stuff as well.

07:03.320 --> 07:07.160
I don't need to have an audio library update and potentially have a bug that I didn't catch

07:07.160 --> 07:11.240
when I was combing through various, you know, files and updates and whatnot.

07:11.240 --> 07:16.440
So you know, I like to keep one machine very, very segmented, you know, to where it's like

07:16.440 --> 07:18.160
group updates, nice and clean.

07:18.160 --> 07:19.960
And then everything else I just let roll on Arch.

07:19.960 --> 07:20.960
It's great.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.880
Yeah, very, very well said.

07:22.880 --> 07:29.720
Now speaking of bugs, I know we are actually currently suffering from a little bug in Arch

07:29.720 --> 07:30.720
that's affecting some of us.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.280
Willie, did you have an update about that X cursor bug?

07:33.280 --> 07:34.280
Yeah.

07:34.280 --> 07:38.320
No, right now I'm not actually logged into my Arch box.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.960
I just rolled it back for the mint thing.

07:40.960 --> 07:45.600
But this is a perfect example of where they have the opportunity to fix something that

07:45.600 --> 07:47.560
affects the rest of Arch.

07:47.560 --> 07:50.040
So Matt, you kind of were playing on the pre-show.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.640
You were discovering, we were talking, hey, I just did updates on Arch, Chrome isn't launching

07:53.640 --> 07:55.840
for me, VLC isn't launching for me.

07:55.840 --> 07:59.360
You saw a suggestion in the chatroom about a certain package and you rolled back what

07:59.360 --> 08:00.640
and it did solve the problem?

08:00.640 --> 08:06.400
Yeah, I actually rolled back a libx cursor from dash two to dash one, rather than reading

08:06.400 --> 08:09.080
off the entire version number.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.440
And surprisingly, instantly, no reboot needed.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.440
Everything worked.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.440
Everything was fine.

08:13.440 --> 08:17.720
And so being able to do so, of course, any Arch based distro makes rolling back really

08:17.720 --> 08:18.720
easy.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.800
But I'm pretty sure this probably won't happen on Monjaro.

08:21.800 --> 08:22.800
Right.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.800
And this is a good example.

08:23.800 --> 08:27.560
So if you're on Arch today and you're having problems with your Chromium launching or your

08:27.560 --> 08:34.120
VLC crashing on you or SMP, whatever, whatever is crashing on you, SMPlayer has done it to

08:34.120 --> 08:35.760
faint in our mumble room.

08:35.760 --> 08:40.440
I haven't, I've had, I actually had Nautilus lock, I'm sorry, files lock up, I don't know

08:40.440 --> 08:41.440
if it was related.

08:41.440 --> 08:42.440
So yeah.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.440
It might be.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.440
It might be.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.200
It was like, it was making everything difficult to use there for a few minutes.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.200
I was pretty frustrated.

08:47.200 --> 08:55.080
Hey Matt, before we jump into the Mint 17 discussion, actually, well, no, we'll start

08:55.080 --> 08:57.320
with Mint 17 before we get to the derivative things.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.640
I want to mention today, episode two of Tech Talk today was out.

09:00.640 --> 09:03.080
I announced it last week on Linux Unplugged.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.680
Second episode's out today.

09:04.680 --> 09:10.560
And I took a few shots at Apple for essentially blatantly ripping off Gnome and Gnome client

09:10.560 --> 09:11.560
side direct.

09:11.560 --> 09:15.360
I don't know if you've seen the new OS 10 theme, Matt, but it looked exactly like my

09:15.360 --> 09:16.360
Gnome box.

09:16.360 --> 09:21.800
I purposely avoid as much news as possible, but that did leak into my gates and I laughed

09:21.800 --> 09:23.840
and made some comments on it for sure.

09:23.840 --> 09:26.800
I mean, Safari looks identical to Gnome Web.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.520
It's just a little uglier, but it's almost identical.

09:30.520 --> 09:34.200
It's got those Mac OS 10 color buttons that I'm not a big fan of.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.480
And other than that, it looks like Gnome Web.

09:36.480 --> 09:40.200
And Xcode looks like a Gnome app and the Maps app looks like a Gnome app.

09:40.200 --> 09:44.640
So I went off on it on episode two of Tech Talk today, which by the way, Tech Talk today

09:44.640 --> 09:45.640
is on the air.

09:45.640 --> 09:47.400
So check it out over at JupiterPodcasting.com.

09:47.400 --> 09:52.140
Okay, well before we get into Mint, I want to thank our first sponsor this week and that

09:52.140 --> 09:53.140
is Ting.

09:53.140 --> 09:59.120
It's linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com will take $25 off your first device.

09:59.120 --> 10:03.440
If you already got a device that works on the Ting network, check out their BYOD page

10:03.440 --> 10:06.840
because they're going to give you a $25 credit and if you're like me, that'll pay for your

10:06.840 --> 10:09.280
first month of service, linux.ting.com.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.860
Now why Ting?

10:10.860 --> 10:12.320
Because it's mobile, that makes sense.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.760
No contract, no early termination fee.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.520
Let that sink in for a second.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.920
And you only pay for what you use.

10:17.920 --> 10:21.240
It's a flat $6 plus whatever taxes are applicable.

10:21.240 --> 10:24.000
And then your usage, your messages, your minutes, and your megabytes.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.040
Ting just adds them up at the end of the month and whatever bucket you fall into, baller,

10:27.040 --> 10:28.040
that's what you pay.

10:28.040 --> 10:32.400
You're not paying into like a $120 contract that maybe this month you got $40 worth of

10:32.400 --> 10:35.760
your minutes and maybe $50 of megabytes.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.440
I don't even, how does that even break down?

10:37.440 --> 10:39.280
How do they even decide what to charge you for that?

10:39.280 --> 10:42.600
Whereas Ting is just flat rate and it's all listed out right on their website.

10:42.600 --> 10:47.160
And they have so many great devices now, so many great devices.

10:47.160 --> 10:54.000
But if you go to linux.ting.com, go check out the Nexus 5, $350 shipped from Ting.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.640
This is such a great Android phone.

10:55.640 --> 11:00.000
This is the Android phone where if you're like somebody, either you want the fanciest,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.200
one of the fanciest phones out there right now, this is still a great phone.

11:02.200 --> 11:05.240
But I actually think if you bought this phone, this would be a phone that would last you

11:05.240 --> 11:06.840
for several years.

11:06.840 --> 11:11.020
And I was talking with Fate earlier today and we were talking like one of the reasons

11:11.020 --> 11:14.640
I bought it and one of the reasons he's going to be buying the Nexus 5 is this is also the

11:14.640 --> 11:20.320
phone that all of our favorite alternative mobile operating systems are starting to target.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.360
There's essentially, if you've heard of that operating system, there's either an image

11:23.360 --> 11:25.640
or about to be an image for the Nexus 5.

11:25.640 --> 11:32.640
And why not pair that with a great network who respects you as a customer, linux.ting.com,

11:32.640 --> 11:33.640
go check them out.

11:33.640 --> 11:37.040
They've got no hold customer service, an incredible dashboard to manage your account.

11:37.040 --> 11:40.280
And when you only pay for what you use, the value is incredible.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.040
You might pay a little more upfront for that Nexus 5, although I don't think so.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.520
I mean, that's just what Nexus 5s go for, but you get the example.

11:45.520 --> 11:49.240
You might pay a little bit more upfront for a phone, but because you're not subsidizing

11:49.240 --> 11:52.280
that cost over two years, it's such a great value.

11:52.280 --> 11:57.080
And Rotten Corpse in our mumble room would save almost $4,000 by switching his two lines

11:57.080 --> 11:58.080
over.

11:58.080 --> 12:04.000
So as you add more lines, because again, so if you say you got the nephew on the Ting

12:04.000 --> 12:05.960
plan over there, well, that's just $6 a month.

12:05.960 --> 12:06.960
That's all it's going to cost.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.360
And then whatever he uses, and if he's mostly a texter, that's going to be dirt cheap for

12:10.360 --> 12:11.360
you.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.360
Or if he's on Wi-Fi a lot.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.920
If he's using the Wi-Fi a lot, absolutely.

12:13.920 --> 12:19.240
And a great part of it is that if he gets twitchy and needs to be schooled, hey, you

12:19.240 --> 12:20.240
know what?

12:20.240 --> 12:21.240
I can go to the control panel.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.240
That's right.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.240
I can pull things down a little bit.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.240
You got the dashboard hammer.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.240
That's right.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.240
Linux.ting.com.

12:26.240 --> 12:30.040
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.800
I love my Ting phone.

12:31.800 --> 12:32.800
All right.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.560
So I've got Mint 17 installed here.

12:34.560 --> 12:38.840
I went the Cinnamon route, and I got to say, I think Cinnamon's looking really good.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.400
The new Cinnamon's pretty awesome.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.040
I'll run down a couple of new features, and then we'll talk about it.

12:43.040 --> 12:47.320
So starting with Linux Mint 17, we mentioned this on the Linux Action Show, big updates

12:47.320 --> 12:48.320
to the Update Manager.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.560
It still holds kernel updates back.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.360
I'll get to that in a little bit.

12:51.360 --> 12:55.360
But it makes it really clear if you're a little twitchy about what you're updating, Mint's

12:55.360 --> 12:56.960
kind of there to hold your hand.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.000
So that's good.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.180
The other thing that I thought was pretty nice is they've really taken MDM, which the

13:01.180 --> 13:05.800
rest of the community has just kind of abandoned, and they've made it a really nice display

13:05.800 --> 13:06.800
manager.

13:06.800 --> 13:11.360
System monitor support, animated backgrounds using HTML, high DPI support, all have been

13:11.360 --> 13:16.440
added to MDM, lots of language support, the new welcome screen, which we talked about

13:16.440 --> 13:17.440
in the last.

13:17.440 --> 13:20.400
They've really kind of made the system settings more refined.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.880
The graphical interface for system settings was refined, and settings now look more consistent.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.880
Settings are better categorized and separated into subsections, which make a lot of sense.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.240
I was able to flow through it really easy.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.880
I also have worked on Cinnamon's snapping functionality, which Cinnamon right now has

13:34.880 --> 13:38.360
one of the best snapping systems out of any desktop environment.

13:38.360 --> 13:42.640
Now they admit that they are a bit challenging, so they cleaned up the hot corners UI, which

13:42.640 --> 13:45.760
I have used a little bit, and I think it's really well done.

13:45.760 --> 13:50.720
So again, another where Cinnamon has taken a power user feature, wrapped a pretty good

13:50.720 --> 13:53.840
UI in it, and not made it overly complicated for basic users.

13:53.840 --> 13:58.180
The hot corner module is also less confusing now, and it's more easier to find than before.

13:58.180 --> 14:02.120
That allowed them to disable top left hot corners by default, which had screwed a lot

14:02.120 --> 14:03.120
of people up.

14:03.120 --> 14:04.920
So you can go in there and just turn it right on.

14:04.920 --> 14:09.840
And last but not least, you can now shade windows just by scrolling them with your scroll

14:09.840 --> 14:12.680
wheel on the title bar, which is always important.

14:12.680 --> 14:17.200
And they have better integration with GNOME, so if you have GNOME on the same system, your

14:17.200 --> 14:20.920
system settings won't be bumping heads and conflicting with each other like they had

14:20.920 --> 14:21.920
in the past.

14:21.920 --> 14:28.760
Linux Mint 17, in summary, features Cinnamon 2.2, MDM 1.6, Linux Kernel 3.13, and it's

14:28.760 --> 14:31.880
all based on Ubuntu 14.04.

14:31.880 --> 14:36.000
Linux Mint 17 will receive security updates until 2019.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.280
Until 2016, future version of Linux Mint will be based on the same package base as 17 is.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.280
So that's a huge one, in my opinion.

14:43.280 --> 14:47.120
And until 2016, the development team won't start working on a new base, and will be fully

14:47.120 --> 14:49.000
focused on this as the base.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.520
I don't know of any other Linux distribution that really does it quite like this at this

14:52.520 --> 14:53.520
point.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.380
Matt, why don't we start there?

14:55.380 --> 14:59.260
What do you think of them saying, you know, we're going to be releasing future versions,

14:59.260 --> 15:05.520
but all of the main base packages are essentially going to stay relatively the same.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.160
Is that a good idea?

15:07.160 --> 15:11.280
I think for what they're trying to do and who they're trying to go after, yes, but with

15:11.280 --> 15:13.180
an asterisk.

15:13.180 --> 15:17.320
The asterisk I would put on that is for people that are going straight across from like,

15:17.320 --> 15:22.480
say, you know, the more bleeding edge Ubuntu, specifically to where it's not an LTS release,

15:22.480 --> 15:24.060
they may not find it so awesome.

15:24.060 --> 15:28.440
But I think for casual users that are used to upgrading their Windows install, you know,

15:28.440 --> 15:31.680
every 10 years or whatever it is, I think it's fine.

15:31.680 --> 15:32.960
I think it's an interesting approach.

15:32.960 --> 15:37.240
And if nothing else, even if you're not a fan of it, you got to admit that it does differentiate

15:37.240 --> 15:39.820
them from other alternatives.

15:39.820 --> 15:44.200
So PCWiz, you consider yourself a power user, but you also like this static base, don't

15:44.200 --> 15:45.200
you?

15:45.200 --> 15:48.080
I like not having to worry about my system.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.160
I like code.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.000
I like my system to stay the same.

15:51.000 --> 15:57.480
I don't want to have to worry about updating my system or wake up one day and VLC won't

15:57.480 --> 15:58.480
start or whatever.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.480
Bromium.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.480
Bromium.

16:00.480 --> 16:01.480
Yeah.

16:01.480 --> 16:02.720
It just needs to work for me.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.760
Okay, Rod and Corpse, tell me, it's all about the implementation.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.240
What do you mean?

16:07.240 --> 16:12.720
Well, there's two potentially massive problems with Mint sticking to an LTS.

16:12.720 --> 16:14.780
The first is the package management.

16:14.780 --> 16:18.240
They said they're going to stick to one package base, but are they going to update like the

16:18.240 --> 16:22.720
actual applications or is it just the core structure that's being stuck?

16:22.720 --> 16:23.720
Like how are they...

16:23.720 --> 16:24.720
They've never addressed that.

16:24.720 --> 16:30.680
Yeah, and like when 14.0.1 or 14.0.1 and 0.2.3 and et cetera, et cetera come out, will they

16:30.680 --> 16:31.680
match that?

16:31.680 --> 16:34.320
Will they follow that or will they stay at 14.0?

16:34.320 --> 16:37.360
They'd more than likely match that in the sense of like the kernel and the structure,

16:37.360 --> 16:41.080
but 14.0.4 Ubuntu doesn't update applications either.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.080
So that's the problem.

16:42.080 --> 16:45.400
They'd have to do it themselves and they haven't mentioned whether they're going to do that

16:45.400 --> 16:46.400
or not.

16:46.400 --> 16:51.040
Well, I assume they're going to do user land applications like Firefox and Chrome and VLC,

16:51.040 --> 16:52.040
right?

16:52.040 --> 16:56.520
Yeah, well, I mean the massive packages that Ubuntu does, then they'll bring those in,

16:56.520 --> 17:04.040
but like packages that are just open source apps like MyApp or HTOP or TMUX or something

17:04.040 --> 17:05.040
like that.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.040
That's not...

17:06.040 --> 17:10.040
That's widely used, but not super popular.

17:10.040 --> 17:16.520
So if they have a system that would compensate for that, that'd be great, but they haven't

17:16.520 --> 17:18.400
mentioned whether they do or not.

17:18.400 --> 17:23.640
And the other bigger problem is potentially, you know, Cinnamon is built and they release

17:23.640 --> 17:28.320
it two months before Mint ever comes out because the Arch users are going to beat on it and

17:28.320 --> 17:29.640
make sure that it's good.

17:29.640 --> 17:34.640
And then they kind of get like a, I don't know, not a sneaky, but an easier way to test

17:34.640 --> 17:35.760
their stuff.

17:35.760 --> 17:41.000
The problem with it is that the core system of any LTS is going to stay on one version

17:41.000 --> 17:43.920
of GTK and maybe update a little bit, but not a massive version.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.400
And this is 3.10, right?

17:45.400 --> 17:46.400
Right.

17:46.400 --> 17:52.400
Because if Cinnamon is stuck on a particular GTK base, then the next time it's updated,

17:52.400 --> 17:56.040
it might break in Arch and stuff like that because Arch will always be up to date in

17:56.040 --> 17:57.040
GTK.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.040
Well, and it's not just Arch.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.040
Eventually it will be Fedora.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.800
It'll be all the other distributions too.

18:00.800 --> 18:01.800
True.

18:01.800 --> 18:02.800
Right.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.800
Everybody.

18:03.800 --> 18:04.800
Yes.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.800
How will that...

18:05.800 --> 18:06.800
Wimpy, do you have any insights on that?

18:06.800 --> 18:07.800
A little.

18:07.800 --> 18:15.240
I spoke to Clem about all of this some months ago when he first sort of fielded the idea,

18:15.240 --> 18:18.440
but specifically around GTK.

18:18.440 --> 18:25.720
For example, today I've just built and installed Unity on Arch to do some benchmarking and

18:25.720 --> 18:34.040
that's using GTK 3.12 and I'm not sure what version Unity or rather the Ubuntu desktop

18:34.040 --> 18:37.720
is targeting at the moment, but I think it's either 3.10 or 3.8.

18:37.720 --> 18:41.600
But surprisingly 3.12 with a few patches works really well.

18:41.600 --> 18:47.600
Looks a bit odd in places like other desktops that are moving to the common versions of

18:47.600 --> 18:55.520
GTK 3, but it's not awful and I think one of the reasons why Clem is choosing to put

18:55.520 --> 19:01.960
a line in the sand here is so that he can just target a stable base so that all of those

19:01.960 --> 19:09.000
little features you've just mentioned that are nice evolutions and improvements are what

19:09.000 --> 19:14.080
the Mint team can focus on rather than having to deal with regressions.

19:14.080 --> 19:18.920
Now Heaven's Revenge points out this is already becoming a problem with elementary OS.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.480
Can you elaborate?

19:20.480 --> 19:25.760
Well, only by third-party instances.

19:25.760 --> 19:32.300
Most people or most articles always complain that elementary OS's base is an LTS release

19:32.300 --> 19:36.880
and it diverges from the cutting edge or the leading Ubuntu release.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.360
1204 at that.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.360
1204.

19:39.360 --> 19:43.600
And there's a lot of incompatibilities in why Pantheon won't work on almost anything

19:43.600 --> 19:46.960
else because it's based on the LTS release of so long ago.

19:46.960 --> 19:50.480
Yeah, I mean and a lot could change.

19:50.480 --> 19:55.920
We see within a few years the entire technological landscape can change and especially in the

19:55.920 --> 20:01.440
open source world where things like GTK get updated and a lot of you know quote-unquote

20:01.440 --> 20:03.960
breaking changes happen all the time.

20:03.960 --> 20:14.440
Is it really a good idea to have say a Linux Mint would be based on GTK 3.10 and someone

20:14.440 --> 20:22.360
decides to do some GTK application development on Linux Mint 17 and then they want to deploy

20:22.360 --> 20:28.800
it to say Ubuntu 14.10 at that point or 15.04 or whatever.

20:28.800 --> 20:34.520
There's going to be substantial breakages between those GTK versions.

20:34.520 --> 20:39.920
I mean there would be a problem with just using Ubuntu first place with the Unity compatibility

20:39.920 --> 20:45.680
with Cinnamon because they use different versions of GTK.

20:45.680 --> 20:51.120
The thing about elementary though is that they have only been around for two years so

20:51.120 --> 20:53.760
they've only technically released one time.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.240
Mint's not doing what elementary does.

20:55.240 --> 21:00.500
They release once every two years every LTS whereas Mint plans to use an LTS base to release

21:00.500 --> 21:01.800
consistently.

21:01.800 --> 21:06.400
So if they consistently update the necessary packages there shouldn't be a problem.

21:06.400 --> 21:10.840
Wimpy do you think we're worrying about nothing when it comes to GTK changes?

21:10.840 --> 21:15.040
Well yeah I think the whole point of what Mint is setting out to do here is to pick

21:15.040 --> 21:21.160
an LTS release which has a GTK version and they will target that GTK version for the

21:21.160 --> 21:26.460
next four years so they don't care about the GTK changes that are happening.

21:26.460 --> 21:31.480
When I discussed this with Clem he did make the point that yes you know the Arch users

21:31.480 --> 21:38.720
and the Cinnamon package maintainers for Arch may well find regressions and issues and the

21:38.720 --> 21:43.840
Mint team will address those as it's brought to their attention as they have done for some

21:43.840 --> 21:46.600
time now but it isn't their primary focus.

21:46.600 --> 21:51.920
Their primary focus is going to be revving the Cinnamon desktop environment and bringing

21:51.920 --> 21:56.560
new features and improvements to what is a stable underlying platform.

21:56.560 --> 22:04.560
Well and I could see if there's a transition taking place between traditional Unity desktop

22:04.560 --> 22:08.080
and the new Unity 8 desktop and maybe that's not whatever.

22:08.080 --> 22:11.520
Maybe some people won't like some of the new apps or whatever it is and Mint could come

22:11.520 --> 22:14.920
along and say look we've been here for years we're super rock solid and we've just been

22:14.920 --> 22:18.040
polishing and polishing and polishing the Cinnamon desktop.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.360
I mean they could be in a really really good position and plus like the chat room is pointing

22:21.360 --> 22:26.480
out it's not like Clem can't re-evaluate plans if things don't go swimmingly two years down

22:26.480 --> 22:27.480
the road.

22:27.480 --> 22:31.600
He can look at his outline and go well you know what maybe it's time to re-evaluate or

22:31.600 --> 22:35.040
maybe the Linux Mint Debian edition because that continues on.

22:35.040 --> 22:38.040
Maybe that gets to a point where that's particularly interesting.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.500
Riley I wanted to let you get your point in about Mir.

22:40.500 --> 22:41.640
How do you think that plays in?

22:41.640 --> 22:45.680
Yes because a lot of people a while back were worried about what's going to happen when

22:45.680 --> 22:50.560
14.10 and 15.04 goes Mir.

22:50.560 --> 22:55.320
So like what is like all the other issues based off of what you are going to do.

22:55.320 --> 22:56.960
Maybe that's what Clem's thinking is like you know what I'm going to do?

22:56.960 --> 22:59.120
I'm going to sit down for a couple of years.

22:59.120 --> 23:02.800
A lot of people thought they would just stick like they shouldn't stick with Debian and

23:02.800 --> 23:10.160
do that way and it's focused on that but this keeps the user base.

23:10.160 --> 23:14.580
So there's just two downsides that I see that I think are primarily worrying.

23:14.580 --> 23:19.180
Number one I still believe the number one users of the Linux desktop are of a technical

23:19.180 --> 23:24.000
variety so package currentness is important to what I believe to be the vast majority

23:24.000 --> 23:27.080
of actual people who use Linux on the desktop.

23:27.080 --> 23:31.080
There's probably lots of people there's probably a great percentage of people who drone-lessly

23:31.080 --> 23:34.320
use their machine and don't even realize what operating system it's running.

23:34.320 --> 23:37.960
But people who are actively engaged and want the latest and greatest I believe represent

23:37.960 --> 23:39.780
the majority of the Linux desktop.

23:39.780 --> 23:43.320
So I don't know if Mint's going to be appealing to those people but there is always that the

23:43.320 --> 23:47.060
people who don't care there there's always people from that really technical crowd who

23:47.060 --> 23:50.520
move themselves into that group as life gets busy or for whatever reason so there you can

23:50.520 --> 23:54.960
still you can still satisfy that niche and that user base is always growing as new users

23:54.960 --> 23:55.960
come in.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.960
So I'm not saying it's a failed strategy but I'm just saying it probably won't appeal

23:57.960 --> 24:00.080
to overly advanced Linux users.

24:00.080 --> 24:03.680
The other thing I'm worried about is it seems like the long-term success of Cinnamon would

24:03.680 --> 24:07.480
be dependent on the adoption of Cinnamon in other Linux distributions.

24:07.480 --> 24:13.000
Now maybe that's crazy to me but it seems like if you don't have a relevant desktop

24:13.000 --> 24:17.760
that at least has a large enough user size application developers will never be compelled

24:17.760 --> 24:22.920
to make their applications integrate with your desktop where if you can have like KDE,

24:22.920 --> 24:26.800
Gnome and Unity and these guys are managing to suck out most of the air in the room that's

24:26.800 --> 24:31.200
what's going to have a developer's customization attention and they have limited time so they're

24:31.200 --> 24:35.480
only going to spend their time on the desktops that will really net them the most rewards

24:35.480 --> 24:40.560
and I don't see how Cinnamon can achieve that status unless Cinnamon works on lots of distributions.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.560
Am I wrong?

24:42.560 --> 24:47.640
Well I mean Cinnamon technically has a the extension based system for Gnome so most of

24:47.640 --> 24:51.960
the stuff that's in the Gnome extensions could be pretty much easily ported to Cinnamon like

24:51.960 --> 24:56.480
there's been it there's already been about 40 that been ported and they work perfectly

24:56.480 --> 24:57.480
fine.

24:57.480 --> 24:58.480
All right.

24:58.480 --> 24:59.480
To that point what doesn't work?

24:59.480 --> 25:04.080
Oh okay go ahead Noah and then Dave go after Noah.

25:04.080 --> 25:09.400
Well my question was what doesn't work in in Cinnamon that works on for example Gnome?

25:09.400 --> 25:15.280
Well nothing I mean everything's fine today but as as the GTK desktops move forward and

25:15.280 --> 25:19.480
I mean not that Cinnamon won't be moving forward but if it stays pinned to one version of GTK

25:19.480 --> 25:22.420
eventually you won't it just won't be worth the effort to run it on anything but Mint

25:22.420 --> 25:24.720
it might be possible but it just won't be worth it.

25:24.720 --> 25:25.720
Sure.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.720
Okay.

25:26.720 --> 25:30.680
There's extensions that for example Gpaste that wouldn't that the Gnome extension would

25:30.680 --> 25:34.440
not work in Cinnamon but it was ported to Cinnamon so that works now.

25:34.440 --> 25:37.560
Oh so Dave now you go ahead you were kind of going to challenge the general base that

25:37.560 --> 25:39.320
I was making the argument from right?

25:39.320 --> 25:45.220
Yes you said that Linux is still used by a more technical audience people who want package

25:45.220 --> 25:52.240
currentness and people who are technically inclined to invest in their desktop but I've

25:52.240 --> 25:54.320
been finding that that may not be true.

25:54.320 --> 25:59.480
I mean I went on on a trip a couple of weeks ago and I saw that a lot of people knew what

25:59.480 --> 26:05.240
Linux was and a lot of people had seen Linux desktops people who don't know anything about

26:05.240 --> 26:10.720
computers but they knew what Linux was and they were really impressed they had seen this

26:10.720 --> 26:17.320
before and there are a lot of people that it's easy to install Linux now they use Linux

26:17.320 --> 26:24.320
they know Linux and so I don't think Cinnamon and Mint together are targeting the Arch users

26:24.320 --> 26:30.320
or the hardcore Linux users I think they're targeting Ubuntu's place in the desktop Linux

26:30.320 --> 26:35.760
world because Linux now has a place there I mean I'm in India and people know this people

26:35.760 --> 26:40.800
know that there's something called Linux and it has it has these issues and whatnot but

26:40.800 --> 26:46.400
it works and people have asked me my sister who's a dentist asked me if I if she could

26:46.400 --> 26:52.600
install Linux yeah so yeah I mean it's the world is different now and I think Cinnamon

26:52.600 --> 26:58.920
is trying to make a place in this world by targeting a stable reliable desktop for people

26:58.920 --> 27:03.320
who can install an OS but not do much beyond that.

27:03.320 --> 27:07.080
Well and Wimpy you've noticed at your local Lug that a lot of folks there are using Linux

27:07.080 --> 27:09.920
and it's out-of-date versions at that?

27:09.920 --> 27:18.560
Yeah I was really really surprised by this so at the last Lug meet which is predominantly

27:18.560 --> 27:26.680
populated by Silver Surfers let's say who are finding Linux as an alternative to Windows

27:26.680 --> 27:31.960
mostly because they've heard that it doesn't have the virus problem but they just want

27:31.960 --> 27:36.800
something to install that works that means they can read their email that they can get

27:36.800 --> 27:40.440
on the web and most importantly that they can play solitaire because that seemed to

27:40.440 --> 27:45.120
be the preserve of what they are up to the versions of the Linux distributions they were

27:45.120 --> 27:50.720
running I was kind of amazed what three or four of them were running a version of Mint

27:50.720 --> 27:56.080
and I don't know what the Mint code name was but it was the one that was derived from Ubuntu

27:56.080 --> 28:03.520
Karmic so this is getting on for a five-year-old you know Ubuntu distribution and they're perfectly

28:03.520 --> 28:07.560
fine with it well they installed it and it's got all of the stuff they need and it works

28:07.560 --> 28:13.400
and I can't get my head round that they're satisfied with this but that works it's like

28:13.400 --> 28:16.760
a TV you know what in a sense the TV turns on and the channels come on doesn't matter

28:16.760 --> 28:21.040
if it doesn't have a Netflix app built in exactly and and they were talking about you

28:21.040 --> 28:25.120
know upgrading on what version they were going to move to next and I was explaining well

28:25.120 --> 28:30.120
Mint 17s you know just around the corner oh no no no there's this Mint 13 and that's the

28:30.120 --> 28:33.640
long-term support release version and I think that's the one I'm going to use and I'm like

28:33.640 --> 28:38.200
but that's two years old and they just don't care it doesn't resonate right and Popey

28:38.200 --> 28:41.520
I know you want to look into the crystal ball and talk a little about future desktops go

28:41.520 --> 28:48.360
ahead well it just seems to me that the the the whole rationale for some of these desktops

28:48.360 --> 28:57.520
existing like Cinnamon and Marte is there was a movement some time ago that a lot of

28:57.520 --> 29:03.360
the technical users and existing Linux desktop users didn't like the way the desktop was

29:03.360 --> 29:09.000
going they didn't like Gnome Shell they didn't like Unity that they didn't they may not have

29:09.000 --> 29:15.920
liked KDE 4 as well and it seems that I know I know Mark as Mark Shelterworth has said

29:15.920 --> 29:22.720
before that you know we tried the Gnome 2 way we tried the the two panel traditional

29:22.720 --> 29:29.400
Linux desktop and it didn't work and for our market which is mass adoption you know everyone

29:29.400 --> 29:34.240
buying it in stores and so that's part of the reason why we forwarded ahead with a different

29:34.240 --> 29:42.520
desktop and Gnome have got their own desktop and KDE are working with their new user interface

29:42.520 --> 29:49.880
and it's funny that you know you've mentioned that the Apple announcement at WWDC reflects

29:49.880 --> 29:54.240
some of the changes that Gnome Shell have done it seems that that there's a in the future

29:54.240 --> 29:58.940
there's these desktops that are moving forward and then there's the ones that are holding

29:58.940 --> 30:05.080
back and the ones that are holding back are servicing a requirement from Refuse Nix people

30:05.080 --> 30:09.800
who just flat out don't like that new interface which is fine but they're never ever gonna

30:09.800 --> 30:15.680
get mass market adoption if you're sitting there with something that looks like Solaris

30:15.680 --> 30:21.800
from 19 whatever I can see that I mean definitely one of the things that gives me a little bit

30:21.800 --> 30:27.400
of a chub is the fact that my Gnome 3 desktop looks like it's from the future I used to

30:27.400 --> 30:34.280
KDE looks fine with the proper icon themes and everything KDE looks fine you should tweak

30:34.280 --> 30:40.080
it a bit oh yeah for sure yeah what were you gonna say no okay I was I was just gonna

30:40.080 --> 30:48.520
say I was a CD developer at Sun Microsystems in the late 1990s so Alan I hate you

30:48.520 --> 30:53.040
Myself and Wimpy we're in the same Linux user group so I know I know this group of

30:53.040 --> 30:57.480
people and the Silver Surfers are you know semi-technical and they're the they're the main people who

30:57.480 --> 31:01.120
are still in the Linux user group yeah they're the people who are contributing to the mailing

31:01.120 --> 31:05.680
list and going along because everyone else has moved on and they've got desktops that

31:05.680 --> 31:12.100
work and they don't have to futz around with libfu and you know as some SO file in a directory

31:12.100 --> 31:18.180
somewhere that doesn't match so I can't run my desktop that stuff is just the past let's

31:18.180 --> 31:24.520
move forward I that's kind of how I mean I respect like I guess I'm of two minds because

31:24.520 --> 31:31.080
I've worked with so many just basic staff who really the use of the computer is part

31:31.080 --> 31:35.080
of the job requirement but it's not what they're there to do and so you know you start changing

31:35.080 --> 31:40.280
UI on them and to them it seems it doesn't even seem like annoying it just seems literally

31:40.280 --> 31:44.640
unneeded and it's frustrating for them because like well this is for them it's a hammer it's

31:44.640 --> 31:48.500
a hammer with a lot more buttons and you know and why make why change the hammer if I'm

31:48.500 --> 31:53.080
just nailing the same nail every day and so I understand where there's where there is

31:53.080 --> 31:57.120
room for cinnamon and things like that rotten corpus why don't you take us out and you said

31:57.120 --> 32:01.600
there might be a way for power users to stay on mint and these and and the same mint base

32:01.600 --> 32:06.680
but keep their packages up to date lay it on us right well I was saying because I as

32:06.680 --> 32:14.320
a you know package or a project manager there's a lot of you have to deal with a lot of packaging

32:14.320 --> 32:18.840
for different different distros and one of the easiest thing to do is to build a PPA

32:18.840 --> 32:23.680
so you have support for anything based on Ubuntu and with a PPA you can keep up to date

32:23.680 --> 32:28.680
and the the only problem with the PPA is that when as soon as a Ubuntu release is no longer

32:28.680 --> 32:36.200
being supported the PPAs are killed by launchpad itself but for the LTS as long as they're

32:36.200 --> 32:41.200
they're being supported you can just continuously get updates and updates so if if mint did

32:41.200 --> 32:47.920
some kind of PPA management solution for their packages they could just do that instead of

32:47.920 --> 32:51.880
having to have a completely separate repo well they do have a PPA manager built into

32:51.880 --> 32:56.960
their software sources management it's pretty good I think no I don't I don't mean I don't

32:56.960 --> 33:01.360
I mean I don't mean the user manages oh because that's I mean like the project themselves

33:01.360 --> 33:07.140
the team of men managed what is like like they could go in and see this PPA is trusted

33:07.140 --> 33:10.880
this is an official PPA from the project they're they're good to use that we can put it in

33:10.880 --> 33:15.600
our our default repo have you guys ever noticed and I'm pretty sure I have not downloaded

33:15.600 --> 33:20.840
Chrome from the Google website on a in a very long time but always just get Chromium from

33:20.840 --> 33:25.920
the package manager but on Ubuntu if you download Chrome from like the Google website doesn't

33:25.920 --> 33:32.600
it add a repo to your sources list to get future Chrome updates through the app system

33:32.600 --> 33:39.040
but also Firefox and Chromium have an exception to the package update system in Ubuntu so

33:39.040 --> 33:43.400
they're always up to date unlike you know some other random application that doesn't

33:43.400 --> 33:48.000
get updated they have exceptions so why don't more packages do that though why why why don't

33:48.000 --> 33:51.680
why don't they all do that when I download handbrake overhead someone someone has to

33:51.680 --> 33:58.200
actually update those packages well that's true yes well I'm asking them to get somebody

33:58.200 --> 34:04.240
to volunteer the problem is there's people who would happily like as a project manager

34:04.240 --> 34:10.400
I would happily update my app to be continuously you know recognized as an up-to-date feature

34:10.400 --> 34:14.920
but I have to wait until Ubuntu has the time to do it for one of the maintainers and I

34:14.920 --> 34:21.320
can my testing is not is not enough I think it's wasted effort well that's what he thinks

34:21.320 --> 34:26.240
so I want to pause right here and then let's talk about the whole derivatives thing and

34:26.240 --> 34:30.680
because that kind of dovetails well with our mint discussion and first I want to thank

34:30.680 --> 34:35.080
another sponsor of the unplugged show and that's the awesome folks over at digital ocean

34:35.080 --> 34:39.360
are you familiar with digital ocean head over to digital ocean.com right now and go get

34:39.360 --> 34:44.080
started because we've got a brand new promo code for the month of June which is unplugged

34:44.080 --> 34:49.440
June unplugged you'll get you a $10 credit so what is digital ocean my friends I would

34:49.440 --> 34:53.200
be happy to tell you a little about digital ocean I've been using them for quite a while

34:53.200 --> 34:57.920
now and I've had absolutely rock-solid performance digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider

34:57.920 --> 35:01.840
dedicated offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server users can

35:01.840 --> 35:08.160
create a cloud server well often I say about 55 seconds but the it ranges our audience

35:08.160 --> 35:11.840
I think it's actually dipped down down to the 37 second range and I swear that's without

35:11.840 --> 35:18.360
scripting that's without scripting 37 something before boy that's crazy I know I know I think

35:18.360 --> 35:21.820
it's even like at 43 seconds when somebody was doing it from their Android phone and

35:21.820 --> 35:30.580
here's what you get for $5 a month 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD a blazing fast CPU

35:30.580 --> 35:34.640
and one terabyte of transfer for $5 and it's all locked in right there you know exactly

35:34.640 --> 35:38.260
how much it's gonna cost and if you want to upgrade it you can if you want to shut it

35:38.260 --> 35:42.760
off you can and the best thing is a digital ocean has data center locations in New York

35:42.760 --> 35:48.560
San Francisco Singapore and Amsterdam so I've been able to strategically place a droplet

35:48.560 --> 35:53.320
in San Francisco and a droplet in New York spin up bit torrent sync on both of them and

35:53.320 --> 35:57.720
then seed content from both sides of the United States and it made a noticeable difference

35:57.720 --> 36:02.760
in performance and I think the great thing about digital ocean is that awesome simple

36:02.760 --> 36:06.440
and intuitive control panel which power users can replicate on a much larger scale with

36:06.440 --> 36:11.260
their straightforward API I have to say if you haven't tried out digital ocean yet you're

36:11.260 --> 36:15.800
really missing something unplug June to get a $10 credit then you can try it out for two

36:15.800 --> 36:21.160
months on your own to see what you think fire up a bit torrent sync an own cloud set up

36:21.160 --> 36:25.680
a website over there and try out their backup systems with their droplet create a system

36:25.680 --> 36:29.980
get it all configured just the way you want and then deploy it again and again and again

36:29.980 --> 36:33.320
digital ocean makes so many of these functions that used to be really challenging I used

36:33.320 --> 36:36.600
to be able to charge my clients hundreds of dollars an hour to do they now let you do

36:36.600 --> 36:41.120
it in their awesome dashboard all sitting on top of KVM powered by SSD drives connected

36:41.120 --> 36:46.040
to tier one bandwidth digital ocean.com use the promo code unplugged June and a really

36:46.040 --> 36:53.700
big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the Linux unplugged show I have I have endless

36:53.700 --> 36:58.020
uses for this you guys and you can too you'll be surprised once you get it running even

36:58.020 --> 37:02.580
in the first two months how necessary to your life it becomes it's like if you've ever gone

37:02.580 --> 37:06.080
from like not having a car to then getting a car and you're always like how did I live

37:06.080 --> 37:10.640
but or the cell phone like like do you ever remember a time with or yeah Wi-Fi like there's

37:10.640 --> 37:14.400
like these exactly there's these technologies that come around like wait a minute how did

37:14.400 --> 37:20.220
I ever get any work done without this that's digital ocean for me digital ocean.com unplugged

37:20.220 --> 37:26.800
June okay Matt you had a piece that you wrote for a data mation and you said our drew our

37:26.800 --> 37:30.260
Ubuntu derivatives a bad idea that's the headline and it starts out with when most people think

37:30.260 --> 37:36.300
of Ubuntu derivatives they usually categorize them into Ubuntu with a different with a different

37:36.300 --> 37:40.620
desktop environment than unity category however according to Ubuntu they refer to Ubuntu

37:40.620 --> 37:45.220
based distros with different desktop environments as derivatives as well as distros using their

37:45.220 --> 37:50.900
own tools apps goals and customizations I think that's a great point in fact later on

37:50.900 --> 37:56.740
you mentioned that that a lot of times mint users will go seek help in Ubuntu forms and

37:56.740 --> 38:01.140
the Ubuntu for necessarily very receptive to that so did you kind of make the argument

38:01.140 --> 38:05.240
here that maybe derivatives aren't a good recommendation for new users I think it's

38:05.240 --> 38:09.380
very case-by-case and probably the best use case scenario I have for something is if you

38:09.380 --> 38:13.980
have someone that's let's say they're a Windows XP user and they're looking to make the switch

38:13.980 --> 38:18.060
they're very set in their ways they don't give a flying rip about what's bleeding edge

38:18.060 --> 38:22.060
they want their launcher where their launchers supposed to be they want their Firefox and

38:22.060 --> 38:26.380
they want to get it done that's probably a Linux mint person however if you have a Windows

38:26.380 --> 38:31.700
7 user who is fluent in all desktops been using you know Windows forever doesn't really

38:31.700 --> 38:35.500
care about how the desktop looks want something a little more a little more bleeding edge

38:35.500 --> 38:40.260
a little more robust I guess you might say Ubuntu is probably a better option simply

38:40.260 --> 38:44.820
because of better compatibility a bigger user base and they're able to drill down a little

38:44.820 --> 38:50.340
deeper that is really my underpinnings of it is that if you're looking at PPAs mint

38:50.340 --> 38:55.140
isn't always going to be your best experience I've based that on my own experience and based

38:55.140 --> 39:01.140
that on my own research so on G Plus on G Plus this morning like literally like at 4

39:01.140 --> 39:06.020
a.m. in the morning Aaron Saigo posted on G Plus in the comment threads of one of his

39:06.020 --> 39:12.060
posts he said that you know he does feel like sometimes these derivatives sometimes are

39:12.060 --> 39:17.700
good in some cases and in some cases what they actually do is dilute the talent pool

39:17.700 --> 39:23.100
and reduce our focus as a community and slow us down as a whole from moving forward and

39:23.100 --> 39:27.000
I wonder too if maybe derivatives aren't a bit like that if people instead of working

39:27.000 --> 39:30.780
on the derivatives were working on the main upstream distribution would that not have

39:30.780 --> 39:35.660
made that upstream distribution that much better I think it depends on the viewpoint

39:35.660 --> 39:39.460
I think from a developer's viewpoint I agree with him I think from an end user's viewpoint

39:39.460 --> 39:44.620
I completely disagree so so I think because from an end user's point of view they want

39:44.620 --> 39:48.980
to be able to have choice they want maybe maybe they want to go with the KDE is desktop

39:48.980 --> 39:53.380
in that case you would actually go with a derivative not a customization the customization

39:53.380 --> 39:57.380
would be like elementary OS or Linux Mint with an actual derivative you're looking at

39:57.380 --> 40:03.500
like a XBoon2, LBoon2, KBoon2 whatever it may be that way you're getting that true Aboon2

40:03.500 --> 40:08.060
base you know a much more pure Aboon2 base without all the extra stuff put over the top

40:08.060 --> 40:13.300
of it so Rotten do you think people show up first as a contributor to a distro and then

40:13.300 --> 40:17.780
get put off and go start their own I wouldn't say always but there's a lot of people I've

40:17.780 --> 40:22.220
talked to that I asked them why they'd made their their derivative of whatever base it

40:22.220 --> 40:27.860
was and they said it was too hard to get the people who were in charge to pay attention

40:27.860 --> 40:33.380
to their contributions and then to test them and get them applied for Aboon2 for example

40:33.380 --> 40:39.380
it's very hard to put any kind of community contribution to any core systems like if somebody

40:39.380 --> 40:46.020
wanted to do to fork the USC and then make it better and improve it in any way they can

40:46.020 --> 40:50.220
it's pretty much going to be ignored and Dave I think I agree with you too it's sort of

40:50.220 --> 40:55.180
hard to pin down what exactly is a respin versus a derivative or even a distro right

40:55.180 --> 41:02.780
exactly see Runcops and I have this conversation often and we'll see when you say it's a different

41:02.780 --> 41:07.780
distro like for example say elementary or Pingai is it actually a different distro

41:07.780 --> 41:13.220
is there a very I'm asking is there a core difference between the libraries they use

41:13.220 --> 41:18.580
or is it just Aboon2 with it is it just Aboon2 with a different desktop because that's not

41:18.580 --> 41:26.500
true for Cinnamon, Mint and Cinnamon work very well on a machine where Aboon2 wouldn't

41:26.500 --> 41:31.500
but I think if I put elementary on a machine and Aboon2 on a machine there wouldn't be

41:31.500 --> 41:35.540
too much of a difference except maybe in the Pantheon in how many resources the Pantheon

41:35.540 --> 41:41.900
desktop uses so we need to say that okay this is a derivative and this is its own this is

41:41.900 --> 41:45.620
just Aboon2 with a respin there's a difference between the two is what I'm saying.

41:45.620 --> 41:49.260
So Hopi I want to pick on you because I'm sure coming from the Aboon2 side of things

41:49.260 --> 41:55.740
you guys must see this come up quite a bit folks are running a derivative of Aboon2 and

41:55.740 --> 41:59.540
they come to get support is it a problem do you think it's maybe and I know you're not

41:59.540 --> 42:03.060
speaking on behalf of Aboon2 or Canonical but do you think maybe it's detracted resources

42:03.060 --> 42:07.700
from the upstream project in this case Aboon2 or something like that?

42:07.700 --> 42:08.700
It's tricky.

42:08.700 --> 42:14.020
Because I mean Aboon2 itself is a Debian derivative right?

42:14.020 --> 42:18.540
Yeah absolutely and we're very grateful for the base that Debian have given us to build

42:18.540 --> 42:26.820
upon and just to pick up a tiny nitpick the Kubuntu, Aboon2 and so on are flavors so we

42:26.820 --> 42:33.620
consider those blessed derivatives they're called flavors a derivative is something that

42:33.620 --> 42:38.580
is separate from Aboon2 and you can usually recognize that by the fact that the packages

42:38.580 --> 42:44.220
that they come pre-installed with don't come from the Aboon2 archive so for example Mint

42:44.220 --> 42:50.140
has its own repository with their desktop in it whereas Lubuntu everything that ships

42:50.140 --> 42:53.700
on the ISO image came from the Aboon2 archive.

42:53.700 --> 42:57.220
I don't want to get stuck in the weeds but let me ask you this if I install...

42:57.220 --> 43:00.900
The reason why that's important is because the people who work on those flavors work

43:00.900 --> 43:05.020
together they work together for a common goal even though they're working on separate desktops

43:05.020 --> 43:09.940
so you've got the Aboon2 guys who are working on their KDE desktop and Lubuntu working on

43:09.940 --> 43:14.780
the LXDE desktop but they're contributing to the commons in the archive rather than

43:14.780 --> 43:18.260
creating silos and PPAs all over the place.

43:18.260 --> 43:22.780
So there's some collaboration happening between the projects and notes being passed back and

43:22.780 --> 43:24.420
forth and things like that?

43:24.420 --> 43:30.700
Yeah and they collaborate in team meetings and so on but there is a certainly I would

43:30.700 --> 43:33.980
agree that sometimes you do get people who come along and say I would like to contribute

43:33.980 --> 43:39.060
in this way and the project whatever it might be and in this case yeah okay it might be

43:39.060 --> 43:43.660
Aboon2 might say well actually we don't need that contribution that bit's done we'd like

43:43.660 --> 43:49.700
if you could to contribute in this other way and they say well no and walk away and that

43:49.700 --> 43:56.180
has manifested itself in derivatives appearing and then dying and other derivatives appearing

43:56.180 --> 44:01.300
and then dying so yeah there is a problem that people want to contribute in their own

44:01.300 --> 44:10.460
way and you know their contribution may not be wanted or their eagerness to contribute

44:10.460 --> 44:15.140
might be wanted but not in the way that they think they can contribute if that makes sense.

44:15.140 --> 44:18.260
But don't you think I mean then we'll go back to the main topic but don't you think man

44:18.260 --> 44:24.860
if Aboon2 touch it takes off and a lot of people like it isn't this going to be like

44:24.860 --> 44:29.300
such a bigger problem with that because there's so many crazy phones and different carriers

44:29.300 --> 44:33.420
and manufacturers there could be derivative after derivative after derivative of Aboon2

44:33.420 --> 44:35.260
touch right?

44:35.260 --> 44:39.260
I'm not sure that would happen I mean it's entirely it's entirely possible for someone

44:39.260 --> 44:43.100
to take the code because it's you know it's free software and you could fork it and create

44:43.100 --> 44:48.940
your own your own phone OS but you know is anyone going to run it you know why why would

44:48.940 --> 44:53.960
you run random you know let's say there's a mint touch for example why would you run

44:53.960 --> 44:58.660
mint touch if you've got to look at the motivation for why mint existed it's in large part as

44:58.660 --> 45:04.500
I said earlier there are a few NICs who don't like unity and and so on so if if mint wanted

45:04.500 --> 45:10.140
to make a touch device an OS for touch devices they're gonna have to create a UI that fits

45:10.140 --> 45:12.460
on a five inch device.

45:12.460 --> 45:17.180
I don't know if it's the the USENIX or if it was maybe theming in codecs originally

45:17.180 --> 45:23.620
I mean it might have been drivers and codecs or ironically the early adherence to strict

45:23.620 --> 45:29.020
free software policies might have actually been what was the original spark for mint

45:29.020 --> 45:30.020
in some ways.

45:30.020 --> 45:32.860
Right and I can't remember the last time I had to even bother about codecs.

45:32.860 --> 45:36.860
Yeah yeah it's yeah not it used to be a thing yeah it used to be a thing it's not a thing

45:36.860 --> 45:39.220
yeah remember those days old man?

45:39.220 --> 45:41.220
Automatics remember that?

45:41.220 --> 45:42.220
Seven years ago.

45:42.220 --> 45:48.420
Wimpy you wanted to touch on the the android when it comes android when it comes to forking.

45:48.420 --> 45:53.980
Well yeah only only with what poppy was just saying about who would fork Ubuntu touch.

45:53.980 --> 46:00.260
We just have to look at all of the OEMs that have effectively forked or customized android

46:00.260 --> 46:06.140
with their own skins themes UI enhancements I mean just about everyone releases with their

46:06.140 --> 46:14.220
own take on the android user interface so why why would Canonical think that the OEMs

46:14.220 --> 46:16.740
aren't going to do that again?

46:16.740 --> 46:22.180
Yeah forking and OEMs that's why all of our mobile carriers just suck for updating android

46:22.180 --> 46:25.340
they are its own fork.

46:25.340 --> 46:29.940
It's very difficult for anyone to contribute to android anyone outside of google to contribute

46:29.940 --> 46:35.640
to android so it whereas you know we've got people from all around the world contributing

46:35.640 --> 46:38.700
to Ubuntu it's very open everything's free software it's not like android where they

46:38.700 --> 46:44.260
throw it over the wall when when there's a release ours is ongoing all the time so there's

46:44.260 --> 46:47.260
certainly it's a lot easier for OEMs to get involved.

46:47.260 --> 46:51.220
Also sometimes some of the android forking like and I would say probably Amazon's case

46:51.220 --> 46:55.560
is also a competitive fork they don't want Google to be in control because of the size

46:55.560 --> 46:59.920
of Google and Google's already existing monopoly base which is not really in fact that's sort

46:59.920 --> 47:03.900
of Canonical's advantage we're not Google but we can still pull this off and that's

47:03.900 --> 47:08.520
sort of like that's not a lot of the people gonna answer that so alright but going getting

47:08.520 --> 47:13.700
back to the derivative things moving us back I kind of here's the way I look at derivatives

47:13.700 --> 47:21.940
is to me it seems like like cars like bicycles like cell phone cases there's not one answer

47:21.940 --> 47:26.740
for one person in most cases and so the reason why derivatives come up is because you know

47:26.740 --> 47:33.340
like for me let's look at enter gross I I personally prefer installing enter gross rather

47:33.340 --> 47:38.380
than regular arch even though at the end I accomplished the same task essentially but

47:38.380 --> 47:43.340
for me I prefer going that route because it saves me essentially two days overall set

47:43.340 --> 47:48.180
up as I would slowly poke away at installing packages and I'm I'm I don't know if you would

47:48.180 --> 47:55.100
consider enter gross a derivative but I'm damn happy it's there and you know I'll tell

47:55.100 --> 48:00.300
you a little behind the scenes thing is Chase and I are you know getting ready to shoot

48:00.300 --> 48:04.140
some some of his first episodes of how to Linux and there's just been this discussion

48:04.140 --> 48:08.220
about what distribution does he go with and we've been kicking around a lot of stuff we're

48:08.220 --> 48:12.420
gonna make our announcement of the distribution he picked in the first episode and it is not

48:12.420 --> 48:18.100
been an easy process it has not been an easy process at all and should he go mint came

48:18.100 --> 48:22.300
up several times and we would start at a conversation thread where we'd start at one place and we'd

48:22.300 --> 48:26.660
end up again at mint and I thought that was particularly interesting and I and I think

48:26.660 --> 48:31.340
that kind of got this derivatives things churning in the back of my head because they're kept

48:31.340 --> 48:36.100
we kept coming up with scenarios where maybe mint would be more preferable for Chase and

48:36.100 --> 48:41.000
I don't know I'm not gonna say if we chose mint in the end but to me it does it did illustrate

48:41.000 --> 48:46.420
that when you are genuinely switching somebody over to a new desktop operating system mint

48:46.420 --> 48:53.380
does offer a few nice things and I I think in some ways it's sort of showing Ubuntu hey

48:53.380 --> 48:57.340
if you did it like this it's might be a little bit better like it's not quite competition

48:57.340 --> 49:01.640
it's like hey here's another way to think about deploying this and in some ways having

49:01.640 --> 49:04.900
that having having that to look over their shoulder and go oh that's how these guys are

49:04.900 --> 49:08.620
doing it maybe we'll like the PPA management wouldn't that be great if one day we just

49:08.620 --> 49:13.020
saw something like that kind of show up in in a future version of Ubuntu wouldn't that

49:13.020 --> 49:17.820
be nice update or two yeah and and maybe that code would just come from the mint repos like

49:17.820 --> 49:21.900
wouldn't that be nice and so I could see how there is a solid argument for derivatives

49:21.900 --> 49:26.340
I do think they do create a bit of a support issue but if you look at the industry at a

49:26.340 --> 49:31.120
whole really in most cases there's lots of different derivatives of PCs there's lots

49:31.120 --> 49:35.320
of different derivatives of Android handhelds and and monitors and peripherals I mean we

49:35.320 --> 49:40.780
just live in a world full of derivatives and you know I think it's just something that

49:40.780 --> 49:45.340
it's just the nature of this beast and it seems to be the nature of open source for

49:45.340 --> 49:50.060
better or for worse I think it could be one of our biggest strengths and maybe one of

49:50.060 --> 49:55.100
our biggest weaknesses too though because of the time loss well and one thing I wanted

49:55.100 --> 49:58.460
to touch on just stick and I'm not trying to split hairs with this by any stretch but

49:58.460 --> 50:02.140
I think it's important to mention we were talking a little bit about derivatives versus

50:02.140 --> 50:07.820
customizations my information is based on the derivative team wiki from from Ubuntu

50:07.820 --> 50:13.500
and according to them it's a it's a customization of it's a derivative customization more accurately

50:13.500 --> 50:17.140
so that's where the where the differentiation comes from and then reverting back to what

50:17.140 --> 50:20.460
you were talking about as to whether or not you want to go with just another desktop or

50:20.460 --> 50:24.460
whether you want to actually go a mint direction or now elementary direction I think it really

50:24.460 --> 50:28.580
comes down to the tools that are offered by each option and which set of tools is going

50:28.580 --> 50:34.800
to work best for you yeah and I think too you can't undersell like the the old way of

50:34.800 --> 50:39.340
doing things paradigm you know when you give a Windows user a computer with Linux one of

50:39.340 --> 50:42.020
the first things they decide to do is well I need to go install some of my favorite apps

50:42.020 --> 50:45.260
and they go down they go to their websites they'd like they look for the downloaders

50:45.260 --> 50:51.140
and there's a whole process that they have to become accustomed to and I don't know I've

50:51.140 --> 50:55.980
been using Suniman now for for at least just over a week and I think it's I kind of been

50:55.980 --> 51:06.020
really enjoying it I I like that it I I honestly like how familiar and fast that old I don't

51:06.020 --> 51:10.580
want to call it a start menu but that start menu and taskbar interface is I I don't want

51:10.580 --> 51:13.780
to I don't want Popey to yell at me but honestly sometimes I go back and then I realized oh

51:13.780 --> 51:17.060
geez when I needed to get data from this window to that window this just made it so much easier

51:17.060 --> 51:21.720
to have these right here and not have to zoom out to a full overview of my entire desktop

51:21.720 --> 51:26.500
or switch virtual desktops if I didn't you know I just I'm just saying I just even even

51:26.500 --> 51:29.940
though using known for a long time and using unity for a long time when I sat down and

51:29.940 --> 51:34.140
got in traditional UI I kind of went oh yeah yeah there were some nice things about this

51:34.140 --> 51:38.180
and then it starts to feel a little old after a while Christian you sound like you sound

51:38.180 --> 51:45.240
like the daughter in Jurassic Park this going back to a system that they know and they recognize

51:45.240 --> 51:54.780
and they recognize this yeah I know this it's also very easy to theme cinnamon I couldn't

51:54.780 --> 52:03.060
see or yeah it's fun there's several menus you can get okay you know what I had one more

52:03.060 --> 52:07.660
topic I wanted to cover before we get and this one's about gnome and this one just caught

52:07.660 --> 52:13.700
my eye because it turns out the gnome foundation board elections are going on and there is

52:13.700 --> 52:18.260
a candidate that has caught my attention I want to see what you guys think so here's

52:18.260 --> 52:22.060
the headline a candidate vined to become one of the directors of the gnome foundation has

52:22.060 --> 52:27.380
raised issues of red hats domination of development of the gnome desktop project claiming that

52:27.380 --> 52:32.420
for the last several years this is a direct quote red hat wants slash needs have trumped

52:32.420 --> 52:38.000
what anyone else wants slash needs including the larger user base of gnome this is Emily

52:38.000 --> 52:44.660
and I think you pronounce her last name Goyner I'm not quite sure this was in an email thread

52:44.660 --> 52:48.720
where she was declaring her candidacy voting for the voting for this board of directors

52:48.720 --> 52:53.620
with its 11 people there's eight posts that are open it's ongoing and will continue until

52:53.620 --> 52:58.780
June 8th and then they will declare the elections on June 10th and there's a couple of choice

52:58.780 --> 53:03.860
quotes from this in her candidacy statement she wrote it is my opinion that gnome has

53:03.860 --> 53:08.900
strode too far towards a corporate driven project and away from its community led roots

53:08.900 --> 53:14.260
as of now gnome is in my opinion to beholden to a small handful of large corporations and

53:14.260 --> 53:20.580
forces with the project and forces which forces the project to ignore large swaths of users

53:20.580 --> 53:25.580
preferences to them the end result being that gnome has lost a tremendous portion of respect

53:25.580 --> 53:30.100
and goodwill in the wire free software community as a member of the gnome board of directors

53:30.100 --> 53:35.380
I will actively work against this tide and towards the more open community driven project

53:35.380 --> 53:40.580
that gnome once was and I hope will be again I have been a gnome I have been a long time

53:40.580 --> 53:45.840
user of gnome since the 1.x days and an active contributor for the last two years now how

53:45.840 --> 53:51.620
about that she goes on to say yes you are part of the community but you are being paid

53:51.620 --> 53:56.340
by a large corporation to work on it and as a result you are beholden to them as least

53:56.340 --> 54:01.060
as much to the rest of the community red hat is not the only thing that matters in the

54:01.060 --> 54:06.080
gnome world or it shouldn't be but for the last several years red hats wants and needs

54:06.080 --> 54:10.620
have trumped what anyone else wants or needs including the larger user base of gnome which

54:10.620 --> 54:15.940
is what I believe has driven it to fracture into so many desktops over the last four years

54:15.940 --> 54:20.580
we need to make sure that the people who aren't working for red hat have a say make sure that

54:20.580 --> 54:25.060
people who aren't being paid to work on free software have a voice sure those of us who

54:25.060 --> 54:29.300
are not currently paid to speak up on mailing lists but we are those of us who are not currently

54:29.300 --> 54:34.980
paid do speak up on mailing lists but we're mostly ignored this was driven so many so

54:34.980 --> 54:43.180
much of the community apart this is the problem wow I completely agree actually that was really

54:43.180 --> 54:50.140
well said she's got my vote so how I mean is is is gnome is known being ran into the

54:50.140 --> 54:53.820
ground by the by the red hat why would why would red hat do that is that really what's

54:53.820 --> 55:01.820
going on I would say that happens with most projects yeah does red hat care about a desktop

55:01.820 --> 55:04.660
well they have a corporate desktop that they make a good amount of money on that's you

55:04.660 --> 55:07.860
know a lot of times like when you see people using linux and hollywood production those

55:07.860 --> 55:13.900
are sitting on top of red hat desktops so it's a potential issue right when if a company

55:13.900 --> 55:18.500
gets involved to the point where their needs come before users but it and some would argue

55:18.500 --> 55:21.940
it's a real issue but in the open source community as long as all their code is open

55:21.940 --> 55:26.660
source that you can fork and I don't think forks are a bad thing because in any project

55:26.660 --> 55:30.140
when you get too many developers working on the same thing they have different ideas about

55:30.140 --> 55:35.260
what you should do so having she argues that having known fracture into I'm guessing she

55:35.260 --> 55:39.380
means cinnamon cinnamon is a bad bad thing but I don't think it's a bad thing they're

55:39.380 --> 55:42.180
they're trying to accomplish two different goals that meets two different types of people's

55:42.180 --> 55:46.940
needs and quite frankly love it or hate it gnome does something that none of the other

55:46.940 --> 55:52.300
desktops really do a way of doing things that they just don't accomplish and there is a

55:52.300 --> 55:56.980
set of users like myself that really enjoys it so to say that they're screwing the pooch

55:56.980 --> 56:02.500
on this one just seems a little arrogant like I mean leave some room for some creativity

56:02.500 --> 56:06.660
if they're really trying to brandish their corporate might at this issue then that's

56:06.660 --> 56:12.660
when you start arguing about it but not until then mm-hmm and we wouldn't have gnome shell

56:12.660 --> 56:17.520
if it wasn't for a large part of the efforts done by gnome developers that are backed monetarily

56:17.520 --> 56:22.900
by companies like red hat true exactly and that's I that's what I was going to point

56:22.900 --> 56:28.540
out as well as that if before you can before we harp on red hat too much for saying well

56:28.540 --> 56:31.780
their interests come before the users yet they're also contributing a lot more I most

56:31.780 --> 56:36.340
users contribute to the development and like it or not developers cost money right I mean

56:36.340 --> 56:42.500
we're talking about the same kind of companies that invest you know multi-million sometimes

56:42.500 --> 56:47.940
billions of dollars into funding the Linux kernel development we're not talking about

56:47.940 --> 56:52.940
you know Microsoft sticking its greedy hands in somewhere and screwing with the UI wimpy

56:52.940 --> 56:55.920
you wanted to point out though that it's not just cinnamon that she's probably referring

56:55.920 --> 57:02.300
to right no there's there's a number of candidates in these known foundation elections that have

57:02.300 --> 57:09.940
got similar sort of messages in their manifestos and a common theme is talking about potentially

57:09.940 --> 57:18.060
unifying the traditional desktops so Marte's being thrown in there along with cinnamon

57:18.060 --> 57:24.420
and to some extent XFC also gets mentioned as well and and one of the candidates is talking

57:24.420 --> 57:30.060
about using gnome 3 as sort of the the skunk works they let's go crazy with the design

57:30.060 --> 57:38.500
ideas throw it all at the wall and see what sticks and whilst everyone's over there experimenting

57:38.500 --> 57:46.780
with new design philosophies then have a something more stable and traditional for the corporate

57:46.780 --> 57:52.900
an enterprise market and this is this is really what the discussions about is what's the desktop

57:52.900 --> 57:56.980
that you're going to put in front of enterprise customers going to be what are they expecting

57:56.980 --> 58:03.860
and I think that you know last time around when they they put the the classic extensions

58:03.860 --> 58:11.460
into gnome 3 for rel it was kind of a vote of no confidence in a new and shiny that everything

58:11.460 --> 58:16.900
has been done in gnome 3 in terms of the enterprise market well Willie what do you think do you

58:16.900 --> 58:21.220
think the fact that Apple just pretty wholesaly ripped off gnome 3 design might give a little

58:21.220 --> 58:27.060
extra credibility to those pushing the gnome design forward I mean it's not the most used

58:27.060 --> 58:33.820
desktop for no reason people like it and if people like it is it really that bad well

58:33.820 --> 58:37.380
I don't know if I don't know if I agree that Apple copying the design validates it but

58:37.380 --> 58:41.620
I think it does give those designers another quiver as these right as these elections are

58:41.620 --> 58:46.140
coming up and there's this hey let's integrate more traditional functionality back into gnome

58:46.140 --> 58:51.340
right as all that's reaching a peak boom Apple drops Yosemite on everybody's face and they're

58:51.340 --> 58:56.380
ripping gnome off and it to me seems like a signal that that is probably a good UI design

58:56.380 --> 59:03.100
direction at least another another shop that is well known for its design aesthetics think

59:03.100 --> 59:09.220
so and I think that is a at least a quiver in their cap or whatever you call it and I

59:09.220 --> 59:17.080
think to them it sort of came just at the right time I think it's just an unfair representation

59:17.080 --> 59:24.660
of the break from 2 to 3 and then everybody in 3 is so much better no shell 3.8 was was

59:24.660 --> 59:29.660
getting so much better and then now at 312 it's quite awesome but people are still with

59:29.660 --> 59:34.860
the stigma of when it broke at the first time yeah exactly it feels like it's the unity

59:34.860 --> 59:40.660
thing all over again like you wrong them once and there's no going back from that well it's

59:40.660 --> 59:45.340
not well the weird thing is there's basically every D has done that like a KDE for example

59:45.340 --> 59:50.460
when it switched to 4 and so it hate me and so many people hated it and now everybody

59:50.460 --> 59:57.220
loves yeah I but they they very carefully manage that over time and I unity I feel like

59:57.220 --> 01:00:01.180
that I'm same amount of time now has passed and unity hasn't fully recovered from the

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.420
public perception I'm not saying whether it's right or not but the put the perception of

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:11.300
it I think they should like if they could figure out a way to make the extensions universal

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:20.700
to not break between updates yeah then unity work nobody would be the best that stop yeah

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:24.500
there's still a design phase right now so as soon as they have that that the global

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:29.620
aspect is they're changing so much between every version that that global aspect can't

01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:35.460
really work yet but when they get the foundation solid to where they want it to be they their

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:40.020
goal is to have those global right yeah I'm not really hearing anything from board members

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:45.380
about you know having some sort of plan of like introducing some sort of compatibility

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:51.700
layers for you know extension developers and you know widening it to you know a wider developer

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:57.060
community it just seems to be you know shame or monetary backers and the people that you

01:00:57.060 --> 01:01:02.500
know pay us money to work on this desktop environment so is it weird that I kind of

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:09.900
feel like that the manifesto was more like a politician style no I mean yeah it does

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:13.500
kind of feel like it and I kind of agree with the chat room to I I don't follow it super

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:18.620
closely I I haven't I haven't been there to witness the you know the push that red hat

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:24.820
might give I I don't doubt that that is a real thing though I just I'm not totally sure

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:28.100
if it's a bad thing if it is a real thing and how and how bad it is it does feel like

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:32.940
maybe it's a little bit of a politician spin too I mean hey politicians got a spin that's

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:37.580
their job and something I'll be watching so they'll announce the elections on June 10th

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:42.280
it would be interesting a if the elections happen and some of these folks calling for

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:47.860
let's call it a more conservative desktop do get elected will gnome change or will it

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:52.060
continue on its current course and if what depending on what we see that might be the

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:57.900
long answer to this question is red hat really behind what the gnome desktop is doing because

01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:01.140
if nothing really changes and things continue on even though these folks get elected then

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:05.460
it probably would indicate the red hats really the ones pulling the strings we'll just have

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:08.980
to watch and see what happens right Matt like everything else I think so I think so and

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:13.580
I mean if you actually have like a Star Wars moment where you know the democracy falls

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:17.820
to a sound of applause or something then I might be more concerned about it yeah but

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:21.340
I think at this point it's too early to tell I think at this point we're basically armchair

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:24.580
quarterbacking what we don't really know I think there's some strong candidates that

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:28.980
are going for it and we'll just have to wait and see absolutely and that music means it's

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.900
time for us to go right there Matt I think I think we'll put a put a feather in our cap

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:36.940
right there oh boy oh boy listen to that it's getting us out of here fast it's like the

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:40.500
Oscars like hey guys get off the stage it's time for you to go go get out of here all

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:43.520
right well listen we want you to show up on Sunday we've got a great Linux action show

to get that converted in your local time zone and don't forget to go grab yourself a little

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:04.060
tech talk today where I dug into that whole Apple ripping off the gnome guys hey Matt

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.460
have a great week I'll see you on Sunday okay all right see you then all right everyone
