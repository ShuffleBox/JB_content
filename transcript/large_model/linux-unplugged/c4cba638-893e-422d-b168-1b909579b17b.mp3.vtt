00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
Is anyone using LibreOffice 6.1?

00:02.000 --> 00:05.000
I haven't installed, but I haven't used it that much.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
Hmm, have you noticed the native GTK message dialogs?

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Yep.

00:10.000 --> 00:14.000
And what do you think, does it enhance your experience to have that?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Not really, I haven't used it that much.

00:16.000 --> 00:21.000
It's the kind of stuff that I, you know, there's a couple of blog posts and there's some people talking about it,

00:21.000 --> 00:26.000
but honestly it's like, how many dialog boxes do you get in LibreOffice?

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
And why is that such a concern?

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Even on this article, there's people commenting, even on the article itself, and I'm just, is that a thing?

00:33.000 --> 00:39.000
Is that what we're worried about these days in the Linux community, is the pop-ups of GTK dialogs?

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
The things that ask me to save or not save?

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
We're really glad that those use the native GTK theming, is that a thing that we care about now?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I'm just asking.

00:47.000 --> 00:51.000
Well, at least enough people did, or at least one person did, to make it happen.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Yeah, apparently.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
I suppose that's always one of those things, right, it's not quite a fallacy, but it's always one of those things in open source,

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
where you can argue, like, well, is that the best use of time?

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Does anyone really care?

01:01.000 --> 01:05.000
Would this have been voted on for something to actually try, you know, putting energy to fix?

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
But at the end of the day, people are going to fix whatever they do,

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
and if we have nominally even better software at the end, that's probably a win.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Yeah, I guess that's a good point, Wes.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
So I guess that is what keeps Linux kind of on the cutting edge, right?

01:18.000 --> 01:26.000
When we go to lay out a file system, we have the guy that knows more about file systems than anyone under the sun,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
and that's the guy who makes our file system.

01:28.000 --> 01:36.000
And Apple doesn't put a lot of money or stock into file systems because it's not a sexy product that they can put a bullet point before, right?

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
So to a certain degree, I guess that's our competitive advantage, I guess.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, it definitely can be.

01:42.000 --> 01:49.000
And I agree, like, I hardly use LibreOffice, not that it's not great, just thankfully don't have to use Office software that much,

01:49.000 --> 01:58.000
but I could see a future, perhaps, Chris review where we're lamenting the state of consistency on the Linux desktop,

01:58.000 --> 02:02.000
and that this little change would maybe prevent a future rant.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Right.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yeah.

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
Definitely, in the case of protecting user data, dialogues like this are super important as well,

02:09.000 --> 02:16.000
because users aren't typically very good at interacting with dialogues, and so removing any inconsistencies,

02:16.000 --> 02:20.000
giving them a clear path, things they can expect, helps them get through the information.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Okay, so elaborate on that a little bit.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
So you mean like, are you saying if yes is always on the right, and all of a sudden once it's on the left, then all of a sudden they inadvertently click?

02:29.000 --> 02:31.000
What exactly do you mean?

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
Well, like in elementary we have some rules about dialogues, as far as never ever use yes and no labels,

02:39.000 --> 02:47.000
because then there can be really bad logic conflicts between the messaging in your dialogue and what your action buttons do.

02:47.000 --> 02:52.000
You should have an affirmative action that describes exactly what it does, and it should always be in the same position,

02:52.000 --> 02:57.000
and then directly to the left of that should always be cancel, which is your do nothing,

02:57.000 --> 03:05.000
so that users always have a safe way to back out of this and go, oh no, I don't know what this dialogue even means, I don't want to do anything.

03:05.000 --> 03:14.000
Okay, interesting. So you're saying if I say erase disk, if that's all I'm asking, and I have a yes and a no,

03:14.000 --> 03:21.000
yes, I want to erase the disk, or yes, I want to leave the disk alone, and no, I don't want to touch the disk, or no, I want to erase the disk.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Am I picking up what you're saying?

03:23.000 --> 03:33.000
Right, depending on the messaging in your dialogue, you could unintentionally be unclear to the user about what you're actually asking them to take a decision on.

03:33.000 --> 03:43.000
And then we even go further with using style classes that are available in GTK dialogues for where a destructive action button is going to be styles red.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Oh, yeah.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Right?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

03:47.000 --> 03:57.000
So I like that, and you've laid all of this out in some sort of a specification format, so anyone that is working on the elementary project knows, hey, this is the way we do it.

03:57.000 --> 04:04.000
Right, and I believe GNOME has the same human interface guidelines set up for how they expect alerts to work as well.

04:04.000 --> 04:13.000
Well, it's interesting you say that, because I suppose to a certain degree that is what this whole GTK dialogue thing wraps around, I guess.

04:13.000 --> 04:23.000
The fact that GNOME has set out, here are the dialogues, and this is the way we want to present it to the users, and then LibreOffice, up until now, I guess, is not calling those.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
And so the user is presented with a different experience.

04:26.000 --> 04:36.000
Yeah, and this is a big problem, I think, for cross-platform applications in general, because they have to cater to the different platform conventions of all the different platforms they're trying to ship on.

04:36.000 --> 04:42.000
And it makes it difficult for the end users to have a clear and consistent experience.

04:42.000 --> 04:48.000
So in your opinion, do you think that we should always let the operating system deal with the window decorations?

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah, absolutely. I'm a huge proponent of totally native apps.

04:53.000 --> 04:58.000
Oh, okay, cool. So are you not on the Electron boat then?

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Oh, no.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
Really?

05:00.000 --> 05:06.000
No, not at all. Not for a second. I think Electron's like the worst thing to happen to desktop development.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
Really?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
It's like the antithesis of good design on the desktop.

05:10.000 --> 05:30.000
Now, if the only way to get more users on Linux was to offer them the software they want, and the only way that those manufacturers are going to bring them the software they want is through a common, I guess, application frameworks like Electron, does that change your perspective at all?

05:30.000 --> 05:44.000
I don't know. I think that's kind of like a fallacious assumption because we hear from people that, oh, users will only switch if we have the same apps as Windows, but that's not a compelling reason to switch.

05:44.000 --> 05:48.000
Like, why would anybody switch if they can just get the exact same stuff they already had?

05:48.000 --> 06:01.000
What makes Linux a killer superior thing than just like an alternative is the things you can do on desktop Linux, the apps you can get, the tools you can get that you can't get on Windows.

06:01.000 --> 06:10.000
So the experience is actually, in your opinion, is better on Linux than it is on Windows because the applications we have are better than they are on Windows or Mac OS?

06:10.000 --> 06:24.000
Not in all cases, but in a lot of cases, yeah, and it's getting closer there. And in order to switch Windows and Mac OS users, we need to get to the point where our consumer and productivity applications are much better and not just the same as.

06:24.000 --> 06:40.000
So what if we attacked what Wendell Wilson calls the Lotus 1-2-3 problem and the Lotus 1-2-3 problem was back in the late 80s and early 90s, Microsoft wanted to get more people on Microsoft Office and using Microsoft Excel.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.000
But in order to do that, everyone was at the moment using Lotus 1-2-3.

06:47.000 --> 06:55.000
And so what they decided to do was it wasn't just good enough that they could open those files because they had to be able to save them back out and send them back to the original user.

06:55.000 --> 07:03.000
So Microsoft Office made a calculated decision to be able to actually not only read, but also write to Lotus 1-2-3 format.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
And in doing that, they almost overnight switched users from Lotus 1-2-3 over to Excel.

07:09.000 --> 07:25.000
So using that model where Electron, maybe it's not that maybe maybe Electron isn't the end all be all goal. Maybe Electron is the transition layer, the necessary compromise that we make long enough to get our users over to our infrastructure.

07:25.000 --> 07:34.000
And then we say, if the application is great, go ahead, let's make native development. If the application isn't great, here is the better open source alternative.

07:34.000 --> 07:48.000
Yeah, I think to push the Lotus 1-2-3 analogy further, it's a big problem that users data is caught up in these single companies that control how that data is stored in these silos.

07:48.000 --> 07:57.000
It's a huge problem for us to switch people because we can't really build a client that's compatible with such and such service.

07:57.000 --> 08:05.000
I think Spotify is a bad example. I think they do actually have an API so we could potentially build a Spotify app as long as you have their pro version or whatever.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.000
But then you still have to keep up with it and you're responsible for it.

08:08.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah, and I don't know if you could build a Slack client. I don't know if that API is there for you to even be able to do that.

08:16.000 --> 08:28.000
So there's some problems we have like that, or like YouTube that has these certain restrictions and things with the way that you can't really interact with their API on the same level that Google does.

08:28.000 --> 08:41.000
So it's really difficult, I think, for us when we live in a world where now things are so siloed that you really can't technically be compatible with these other applications.

08:41.000 --> 08:51.000
Right, users just have this expectation that they're using these proprietary services, they expect that they'll provide everything they need, they'll tie it in, and yeah, the operating system integration levels are in some cases non-existent.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
Yeah, so it's kind of a big mess.

08:53.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah, I do think Daniel makes some great points. I sort of see it as like, yeah, Electron may be able to bridge the gap, it may be able to solve some of those just like, I need this to be able to work, I would like to use Linux, this lets me do it.

09:04.000 --> 09:11.000
But that's not a reason that we shouldn't continue pursuing and making desktop development on Linux as good as it can be.

09:11.000 --> 09:28.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 240 for March 13, 2018.

09:28.000 --> 09:35.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's tracking its usual host as he heads back from scale. My name is Noah.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
My name is Wes.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Hey, Wes, happy to be hosting with you again.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh, yeah.

09:39.000 --> 09:47.000
We have an exciting show lined up. We're going to talk to you and give you some audio from what happened at scale.

09:47.000 --> 09:59.000
And of course, we have the latest in Linux news, and we're going to start with a great story about how you can access your desktop remotely, even if you're on Plasma. Before we get to any of that though, Wes, you know what we have to do.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I sure do.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
We have to welcome our Mumbo room.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
We got to say hello.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
Hello.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
Hello.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
Good day to you.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. How y'all doing?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
I'm doing good.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Crazy.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Very good.

10:15.000 --> 10:24.000
That's awesome. So this first story is about screen sharing in Plasma in a Wayland session.

10:24.000 --> 10:33.000
And basically, what the article says is that Plasma using a Wayland session now has the ability to share your screen or record your screen.

10:33.000 --> 10:42.000
However, as most of you, everyone in this room is probably aware, in order to do that under Wayland, you have to have some help with the compositor.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
The thing that like draws all of the pictures.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.000
And then you have to deliver all of that information to the client application.

10:49.000 --> 10:58.000
So, in a perfect world, we would do that in such a way that all desktops talk in the same manner, which lessons.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
That would make sense.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Well, it just lessens the work for the developers, right?

11:01.000 --> 11:13.000
And luckily, Gnome is on the precipice of this with Pipewire and basically Pipewire together with the support from Flatpak means that they have it.

11:13.000 --> 11:22.000
They've created this API that applications can use to access screen content on Wayland sessions or in case they're running inside of a sandbox.

11:22.000 --> 11:40.000
And with the various implementation like xdg-desktop-portal-kde or xdg-desktop-portal.gtk, they just need to support one API and they can target both of those desktops, all desktops, really.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
Wow.

11:41.000 --> 11:50.000
Yeah, so the client needs to create between them this portal backend and then the user will get a dialogue on which screen they would like to share.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
Now, I did some more research on this aside from this article.

11:54.000 --> 12:06.000
And one of the revolutionary things that people are really, really excited about is at the moment, OBS screen capture does not work under Wayland.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
I've been bitten by that myself.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
Have you?

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Yeah, absolutely.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Especially, we were doing the Gen 2 challenge right here on the show.

12:13.000 --> 12:18.000
I don't know how I was going to use that, but we had to come up with some alternative setups.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Okay, well, no more, Wes, no more.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.000
It's going to be solved because now, yeah, it's going to allow you to actually screen scrape and use OBS.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.000
Secondly, it is going to support multiple monitors.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
So that was my next question is, okay, fine.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
They have this this pipeware thing going.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
It's going to talk to all this backend stuff, but is it robust enough?

12:38.000 --> 12:44.000
Because I have six monitors in my computer downstairs and I'm running Wayland and I run into some issues.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
So is it going to support?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
Yes, it supports multi monitors.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.000
I don't have any of those issues.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Is anyone in the mumble room using multi monitor support under Wayland?

12:51.000 --> 12:58.000
Is anyone using Wayland and tried to do any sort of screen capturing or run into problems?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Hmm.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
No, huh?

13:00.000 --> 13:07.000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine of nine Linux users in this room and no one is using Wayland.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
Come on, guys.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
Well, I don't have a second monitor to go multi monitor on, so there's that.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.000
Okay, single monitor though?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Yeah, single monitor on a laptop.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
Okay, cool.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
Anybody using zero monitors?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
Hmm.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
At work I am in several places.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
Strictly yes, at work.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
Well, so interestingly enough, I have machines that I actually do have zero monitors on.

13:32.000 --> 13:38.000
In fact, the machine that I use for this very program is using zero monitors and I remote into it.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
But guess what?

13:39.000 --> 13:44.000
If that machine was running Wayland, it would actually cost me another hundred and some dollars

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
because I'd actually have to physically plug a monitor in because I wouldn't be able to remote into it.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
At least the machines I use at work have no monitors.

13:53.000 --> 14:00.000
You can hook a monitor to them, but really it's made to be used within a web interface anyway, so there's that.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
Sure.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
I like this idea of, and I'm interested to get your take on this, Wes.

14:05.000 --> 14:10.000
I like this idea of using a common API for them to access the screen content.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Oh, yeah, definitely.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
I mean, that just seems like a big win for everyone.

14:15.000 --> 14:21.000
I'm also really impressed that I feel like the first time we even talked about PipeWire wasn't that long ago.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Right.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.000
Looking at the commit history, it's making great progress and it's to the point where, you know,

14:26.000 --> 14:31.000
a diverse set of projects are looking at integrating with it and using it to provide these features.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Yeah.

14:32.000 --> 14:37.000
It seems like that's, you know, none of this is quite there yet, but this is like a huge one of the like,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
can Wayland really even work in practice?

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Right.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.000
It's one of those roadblocks that seems like it's going to get knocked down pretty soon.

14:43.000 --> 14:52.000
Yeah, I think that the development of Wayland alone has easily surpassed my expectations of how fast I thought it would gain adoption.

14:52.000 --> 14:59.000
And, you know, they rolled it out in, I guess it would be 1710 and ran into some issues.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.000
And so they're going to fall back to Xorg by default in 1804.

15:02.000 --> 15:10.000
But having used 1710, it was way more pleasurable than I thought it was going to be.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
I mean, I really hit a lot less roadblocks than I thought.

15:12.000 --> 15:17.000
And so now to see them start to stack some of these newer, cooler things on top is really cool.

15:17.000 --> 15:25.000
And when we were at the Ubuntu Sprint in New York, I had a chance to interview one of the gentlemen that works on the Wayland project.

15:25.000 --> 15:40.000
And one of the things that he was saying was how they are repivoting Mir to be that interconnection part where you have a common thing for developers to target.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
And then that does all the heavy lifting and talking to Wayland.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
And I think that's a really interesting way to not throw a bunch of work away, right?

15:48.000 --> 15:59.000
I think that's a really interesting way for Canonical to take a lot of the work that they're doing and saying, OK, the community doesn't accept this as a whole, so let's pivot on it and let's make this available.

15:59.000 --> 16:11.000
Because when you actually have the technical discussions between Mir and Wayland, Mir was a better choice from a technical perspective because it was less work for people to speak to it because it was end to end.

16:11.000 --> 16:19.000
Whereas in Wayland, you have this middle compositor thing that's sitting there that you have to like Kwin or Mudder that has to sit in the middle in between.

16:19.000 --> 16:25.000
So when I start to see things like this and it supports Flatpak, I'd be interested.

16:25.000 --> 16:31.000
Does anyone know if this could be done with snaps instead of Flatpaks?

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Nobody knows.

16:35.000 --> 16:50.000
I'm just wondering because it seems like that would be, you know, if you're trying to find these common things for everyone to talk to, it seems like in a large way, snaps have much more market penetration than Flatpaks do.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
At least that's my perception of it.

16:52.000 --> 16:58.000
I see Canonical knocking doors down right and left saying, hey Skype, would you package for snaps?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Hey this, would you package for snaps?

17:00.000 --> 17:10.000
And when I take all of those and I try to use them on distros that snaps were never necessarily designed to be used on like Fedora, like Arch, they work fine.

17:10.000 --> 17:15.000
And not to say that Flatpaks don't work, but I find them to be much more cumbersome.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Wes have you played with both of them and where do you fall down on this?

17:18.000 --> 17:21.000
I don't think I've ever asked.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
You know, I'm still trying to watch a little bit.

17:23.000 --> 17:40.000
I definitely have used snaps quite a bit more and it seems like so far there's been more momentum on the third party side, the vendor software side on snaps of, oh yeah, here's your application, doesn't really fit into the distro model, snap it up, we'll ship it out, it'll just by and large work.

17:40.000 --> 17:50.000
And it seems like the Flatpak project has been a lot more involved in a lot of the underpinnings of some of the OS essentials or components or at least the scaffolding right above that.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
Sure.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
And it kind of seems like that's where this fits in.

17:53.000 --> 17:58.000
I don't know, I can't comment as much on the story of, you know, will that be used in the same way as snaps?

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
And I know snaps have some features that could be similar or could be mapped to these, but that doesn't seem like it's really been as much the focus.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Okay.

18:06.000 --> 18:23.000
You know, and I think part of it, obviously I think a part, a large part of it comes into the fact that Red Hat GNOME team are really heavy into Flatpaks and so if they're going to, if they're, you know, leading the development or working heavily with the folks that are developing Pipewire,

18:23.000 --> 18:37.000
then obviously, you know, the natural choice of a quote unquote universal package manager that is now getting segmented into multiple, you know, if you're a universal installer is Flatpak. I think there's an obvious reason that we have landed on that.

18:37.000 --> 18:52.000
But as long, I suppose, as long as, you know, both systems can be supported on a large number of operating systems, then it may be good enough to work. It's certainly not ideal, but we rarely get to ideal here in the open source world.

18:52.000 --> 19:01.000
Yeah. You know, the other thing, Wes, I'd be interested in digging in a little bit is why certain things work and certain things don't. So I'll give you an example.

19:01.000 --> 19:10.000
X2GO obviously doesn't work and I think that's pretty obvious. X2GO is, requires some sort of implementation of X. So if you don't have X2GO, X2GO doesn't work.

19:10.000 --> 19:18.000
But there are other things that don't work. I have had trouble with VNC in Wayland Sessions. I have had trouble with TeamViewer in Wayland Sessions.

19:18.000 --> 19:27.000
I haven't tried the latest version of TeamViewer, but last version of TeamViewer, when I tried it on a Wayland Session, it would just show a black screen. I could see the mouse moving around, but I couldn't actually see anything.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
Oh, well, that's almost what you want.

19:29.000 --> 19:33.000
Almost. Very close. I couldn't click on anything either, which was even further away.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
You just get to watch the mouse.

19:35.000 --> 19:50.000
Right. But the nice thing is, at least so far at the moment, every distribution that has Wayland, you can pretty easily fall back to X and then that allows me to fix it, which is how I know that those specific issues were related to Wayland.

19:50.000 --> 19:57.000
So though, and then like we spoke about OBS has a problem. You know what doesn't have that problem?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Simple help.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Really?

20:00.000 --> 20:13.000
And I don't know exactly what they're doing. I know it's a Java thing, but it works on both Xorg and it works on Wayland.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.000
I wonder if they've updated it for Wayland explicitly?

20:17.000 --> 20:40.000
I'm not sure, but either they have and they're one of the most forward thinking companies ever or the way that they have implemented it, the way that they're grabbing the screen doesn't rely on the traditional display model because it's worked longer than things have been making noise about Wayland shipping by default.

20:40.000 --> 20:47.000
I want to say it was even working before Fedora shipped Wayland by default, but I can't quite remember back that far, so I'm not sure which one came first.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
All I know is I've never had a box that I couldn't connect to.

20:50.000 --> 20:54.000
That's awesome. I mean, that's probably all you care about from your perspective.

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
Yeah, well, for the most part. Anyway, Mumble Room, we all think this is a pretty cool thing.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
I think it is.

21:03.000 --> 21:15.000
I think the API thing is my favorite part of all because I think the API thing sends a message to everyone that we as a Linux community are working together for once and working towards a common goal.

21:15.000 --> 21:25.000
Because if there's one thing I get frustrated with Linux users about, it seems like every time there is a way for us to fragment on something or there's a way for us to take different camps, we do that.

21:25.000 --> 21:37.000
And so the fact that we're targeting this common API and we have XTG Desktop Portal KDE and XTG Desktop Portal GTK, I think that's really cool.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
Yeah, right. If we can do this right. And there's been so much promise. We have this new technology.

21:41.000 --> 21:49.000
We're finally at a point where it's almost ready to be in our hands. And maybe it works for the like of all you do is just, you know, you sit on your laptop, you browse the web, you use a terminal.

21:49.000 --> 21:55.000
Wayland's pretty much already there. And so now we're like reaching the points of, you know, you have a little more complicated use cases.

21:55.000 --> 22:01.000
You're trying to do content creation. So as that bubble grows and grows, it's great to see this actually being picked up everywhere.

22:01.000 --> 22:07.000
So it's interesting you bring up content creation because last week, obviously, we're at scale.

22:07.000 --> 22:12.000
Yeah. And so we're sitting there and I was doing the Ask Noah show live from the show floor.

22:12.000 --> 22:19.000
And the process to actually put us on the air requires me to be simultaneously twenty seven hundred miles apart.

22:19.000 --> 22:27.000
I have to first I have to be in the J.B. one studio outside of Seattle and I need to be able to stop the streaming there.

22:27.000 --> 22:35.000
And then I have to magically teleport myself over to Grand Forks and start my streaming there.

22:35.000 --> 22:44.000
On top of all that, after I've actually streamed out, then I have to establish a connection to myself from the show floor back to my studio.

22:44.000 --> 22:53.000
And so to do that, I was using a remote, a remote software so simple to connect back to and turn these off and on.

22:53.000 --> 23:00.000
And one of the things that was absolutely invaluable was the fact that I had my Ting hotspot.

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
And if you go to Ting.com and use the promo code Linux, you too could have a Ting hotspot.

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
And what's great about the Ting hotspot, it's a dedicated device for using the Internet.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.000
Now, why is that important? Because there's there's people out there and they'll say, well, no, I have my cell phone.

23:15.000 --> 23:20.000
I just toggle the cell phone Wi-Fi or toggle the hotspot on. There we go. I have right.

23:20.000 --> 23:27.000
There were numerous times where I had to get up and I was running to the bathroom or I had to run grab a piece of equipment or had to run grab a bag.

23:27.000 --> 23:33.000
And I couldn't afford to not be with without my communication device, particularly because that particular dad forgot my badge.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
And so I was using Chris. I was saying, hey, Chris, you know, can you come let me in? Can you come get me in? Whatever. Right.

23:37.000 --> 23:48.000
So I wanted to have two separate devices. Well, if I had gone to, you know, whatever big box carrier and said, I want two devices, they're going to say, well, it's a twenty five dollar plan or to add on.

23:48.000 --> 23:55.000
And then you got to pay the device fee and then we don't sell you the device. We like rent it to you at some insane cost.

23:55.000 --> 24:01.000
And so, you know, it's probably by the time you get done with a thing, it's probably fifty five bucks. With Ting, you only pay for what you use.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
So it's just six bucks a month and you pay for your usage on top of that.

24:04.000 --> 24:11.000
What gets better is once you buy the once you buy that particular bucket and I start filling up minutes and I've used fifty one minutes.

24:11.000 --> 24:16.000
If I have four phones, I'm only paying that six dollars per line for those four phones.

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
And if all four phones stand or one hundred minutes, we're great. And if we go over one hundred and one, that's fine.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
We can share that next bucket with everyone. But I'm never paying for more than what I use.

24:26.000 --> 24:31.000
And that meant that days like scale. Yeah, yeah, I did. I use a little bit more data.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
I needed a little bit more data because I needed to be able to stream. But you know what?

24:34.000 --> 24:39.000
Months like this month where I'm going to be in Grand Forks the majority of the month, I'll barely use any.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.000
And next month when we do Linux Fest Northwest, which is the last weekend in April.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
So if any of you can make it, you should. You'll see me there with my Ting hotspot with my Ting phone.

24:47.000 --> 24:54.000
And I carry spare Ting cards inside of my briefcase. So if anyone wants to try Ting, I'll even give you a Ting Sim.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.000
So you don't have to buy the Ting Sim. You can just put it in your phone. No, no.

24:57.000 --> 25:02.000
How can you afford to do that? Because it doesn't cost that much. The Ting Sims, you can buy them on sale.

25:02.000 --> 25:06.000
I think they're like four or five bucks. I activate Ting Sims and give them to people.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.000
I said use it for a month. I don't even care. That's how cheap it is.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
In fact, I was redoing my password manager and I didn't have my Ting account.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.000
And I'm like, I'll just wait till the end of the month and then I'll then I'll turn it off. Why?

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
Because it doesn't matter. Because it's cheap. It's cheap, great service that works really, really well.

25:24.000 --> 25:35.000
And we can use it to do broadcast level recording and production right off of your T-Mobile network or the CDMA Sprint Network.

25:35.000 --> 25:43.000
They're MVNOs of both. So head over to Ting.com and use the promo code Linux and get $25 off your first month of service.

25:43.000 --> 25:51.000
Or your first device. And a huge thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

25:51.000 --> 25:59.000
All right, guys, I want to talk about Ubuntu Mate. Ubuntu Mate 1804 Beta 1 has been released.

25:59.000 --> 26:08.000
What do you say? Oh, boy, I haven't even gotten to the story yet. Ubuntu Mate 1804 Beta 1 has been released.

26:08.000 --> 26:13.000
They are preparing for the distribution on April 26th. I'm sorry, it hasn't been released. April 26th.

26:13.000 --> 26:18.000
With this beta pre-release, you can see what they're trying out in preparation for the next stable release.

26:18.000 --> 26:24.000
Now they have some they have the website gives a little bit of details on the kind of user that might want to try the beta release.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
And they give some examples of the kind of people who might not want to try the beta release.

26:29.000 --> 26:36.000
But some of the things that stand out right off the bat. DPI, auto detection and auto scaling.

26:36.000 --> 26:48.000
Oh, that is huge. And let me tell you, as a person who had to sit next to another guy that was setting up his laptop on a 4K display that did not have that particular feature.

26:48.000 --> 26:58.000
It's real frustrating because what happens is you can't read anything and the windows take up some annoyingly weird proportion amount of the screen.

26:58.000 --> 27:06.000
So you get this window that takes up like 15 pixels by 15 pixels and it's like, I have 4000 pixels for you to choose from.

27:06.000 --> 27:11.000
And you're cornering yourself to the fact that I can see three of my available 15 options.

27:11.000 --> 27:21.000
So the fact that it auto detects high DPI is great. And every display that we are buying here at AltaSpeed for in office use is high DPI.

27:21.000 --> 27:26.000
We're not buying 1080p displays anymore. And I think those are going to stick around for a while in the production world.

27:26.000 --> 27:32.000
But as far as like day to day people, I think more and more laptops are going to become high DPI.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
Certainly more and more desktops are going to be going with high DPI.

27:36.000 --> 27:39.000
And I'll tell you another little secret, Wes. I didn't tell you about my new toy. I got a new toy.

27:39.000 --> 27:46.000
I got a Dell ultra wide monitor. I don't remember exactly how big it is, like 32 inches or something. It's absurd.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.000
Awesome. Yeah. And I put it on a stand up desk and plug my laptop into it and it's fantastic.

27:50.000 --> 27:56.000
But guess what? High DPI. You know what my laptop isn't? High DPI. So you know what's really great?

27:56.000 --> 28:02.000
When you have a distro that automatically recognizes the difference between a high DPI monitor and a non high DPI monitor.

28:02.000 --> 28:08.000
It's really fantastic. It seems like a great win too for like new inexperienced users because you know, you turn it up, you plug it in.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.000
You can't read anything. You have to go try to find maybe where the setting is if you even have a setting for it.

28:13.000 --> 28:19.000
So if it can just work, it goes so far to getting us to like Apple level polish.

28:19.000 --> 28:23.000
It definitely eliminates the need to use binoculars while using your computer.

28:23.000 --> 28:30.000
Exactly. Yeah. And you guys aren't just Whistle and Dixie. I had the Chromebook Pixel and that's not even a 4K display.

28:30.000 --> 28:38.000
That's just a 2K display. And that sucker, when I would install Ubuntu proper, I think the last version I had on was like 14.04, maybe 16.04.

28:38.000 --> 28:47.000
And it didn't automatically scale. Trying to read the numbers was so miserable that I actually resorted to changing the resolution down.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
Then scaling up, then setting my resolution back because otherwise I just couldn't read what I was doing. It was that bad.

28:52.000 --> 28:59.000
So it can be a showstopping problem for new years, especially if you're not expecting it and all of a sudden things are teeny tiny all over the screen.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
But that's not all that the next beta of Ubuntu Mate has.

29:04.000 --> 29:13.000
It also supports hardware acceleration for compositing that dramatically improves 3D rendering, particularly in games.

29:13.000 --> 29:23.000
If you have the support for DRI in your hardware and in your drivers and they have improved global menus.

29:23.000 --> 29:29.000
So I think Ubuntu, Wimpy, is he here? Wimpy is not here.

29:29.000 --> 29:35.000
But Wimpy and his team continue to do a really fantastic job at making a really fundamentally useful desktop.

29:35.000 --> 29:44.000
And I talk to people all the time. A good friend of the program, Chris DeLuca, swears by Ubuntu Mate, puts it on everything.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
And he uses it as his daily driver. And I know that Chris has toyed around with using it as his daily driver.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
My wife played with it for a while using her daily driver.

29:54.000 --> 30:00.000
It's such a great operating system if you just want your computer to work.

30:00.000 --> 30:11.000
And I think these new features, the fact that they are looking at hardware acceleration, the fact that they are looking at global menus, the fact that they are looking at high DPI.

30:11.000 --> 30:19.000
I think all of these things lend itself to being really, really comforting and welcoming to new users.

30:19.000 --> 30:26.000
So the person I go to, Wes, I don't know how closely you follow Chris's fiance, Hadia.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.000
Oh, yeah. So she owns a like she works so hard. That's that's one of the things I really like about her.

30:32.000 --> 30:38.000
She works really, really hard and she has a really deep passion for what you're for what she does.

30:38.000 --> 30:47.000
So if you happen to be in the Seattle, Pacific Northwest area and you're looking for somebody who does acupuncture and really, she can help you with like a variety of things.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.000
I never thought of myself as a person who would need acupuncture for anything.

30:51.000 --> 30:56.000
And I don't really like needles, but she's got all sorts of other little remedies for things.

30:56.000 --> 31:03.000
And so I had I think I had a stuffy nose or something like that. And she gave me this little this stuff in this bottle that I don't even leave home without it anymore.

31:03.000 --> 31:08.000
It's always in my travel bag because it works so well. That's I mean, that's neither here nor there.

31:08.000 --> 31:16.000
But the great thing about her office is if you go to her and use our services, you are supporting a Linux running business because all of her machines are running Linux.

31:16.000 --> 31:24.000
Now, one of them I know is running Ubuntu Mate. The other one is running Ubuntu proper and that machine is getting a little long in the tooth.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
And so they are looking at updating it. And so Chris and I were going back and forth.

31:28.000 --> 31:34.000
We're like, well, maybe KDE, maybe this, maybe that. And one of the things I think is really worth considering is Ubuntu Mate.

31:34.000 --> 31:45.000
Because Wimpy has designed this operating system from the ground up to be the kind of operating system that you're that anyone can use, regardless of their experience with Linux.

31:45.000 --> 31:56.000
And the fact that he is concentrating on what where the next hardware is going to be, if she walks into Best Buy and buys a very nice computer, the chances of that thing having a 2K monitor or 4K monitor are high.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
So the fact that Ubuntu Mate is going to work out of the box, I think is great.

32:00.000 --> 32:11.000
Yeah. And it's such a neat combination to see the you know, you have this combination of a somewhat traditional desktop model, but with all this, like it's not only is it built on good foundations, but it has all this shininess they're able to add on top.

32:11.000 --> 32:20.000
So whether you're coming from Unity, you're coming from Windows, it doesn't really matter. You can craft it into a desktop that works for you and still enjoy the benefits of all these features.

32:20.000 --> 32:33.000
Yeah, I completely agree, especially with that panel layout, being able to switch between Mac OS and Windows or traditional Linux or Unity, all of those things, you know, it brings it all home.

32:33.000 --> 32:41.000
And it's funny when you go to some of these Ubuntu sprints and you look and you're like, how did that guy get Mac OS to run it? Oh, it's not Mac OS.

32:41.000 --> 32:49.000
Yeah, that's it's really something fantastic to see. What do you think Mumpleroom? You guys are being awfully quiet. Am I totally off here?

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
No, I think you're right on Noah.

32:51.000 --> 33:04.000
I mean, you know, you can make it look like whatever you want. And, you know, I'm installing it right now on my MacBook, actually, and I love the way the stock looks.

33:04.000 --> 33:08.000
Actually, I have no complaints at all.

33:08.000 --> 33:15.000
Yeah, I think he does a really good job. I think that if you try to go away from green, that's been my one.

33:15.000 --> 33:24.000
I mean, I do admit it looks a little too greenish, but I'm going to change that once I get it set up.

33:24.000 --> 33:39.000
And actually, I'm half tempted to try out the stock NVIDIA driver versus Nouveau and see, because last time I did that, it broke the high DPI support.

33:39.000 --> 33:47.000
Given this is a little bit more time to get proper and everything, I'm actually going to see if that works. If not, I'll go back to Nouveau.

33:47.000 --> 33:55.000
But either way, you know, I'm half tempted to see how much their high DPI has improved.

33:55.000 --> 34:18.000
And, you know, because I do have dual screens upstairs in my room and I've got a Thunderbolt display and I've got a Thunderbolt to display and a Thunderbolt to HDMI and a Thunderbolt to an HDMI connection on the computer.

34:18.000 --> 34:32.000
I have tended to see how well the dual displays work under that and all that. But like I said, I'm going to change the stock theme because I have to tell you that is way too much green on top of one of those.

34:32.000 --> 34:37.000
Yeah, I guess I don't necessarily agree that it's too much green. I think he actually does a fantastic job making it look great right out of the box.

34:37.000 --> 34:44.000
I guess my point was when you change one thing from green, everything is kind of designed around the green background.

34:44.000 --> 34:55.000
But I tell you what, if you have an inclination, Ben, to give it a shot, I would suggest you head over to Ubuntu-mate.org and download the Bionic Beta 1.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.000
I actually already did.

34:56.000 --> 35:04.000
Oh, you did? Okay, great. Because I'm sure they would really appreciate feedback for that April 26th launch where they actually sent it out.

35:04.000 --> 35:21.000
And that's going to be a big one for them because it's the next LTS, right? So anyone that has an inclination to help, especially if you're the kind of person that can spot problems and are willing to fill out bug reports, willing to file tickets and then follow up and give the developers the information they need to fix it, I'm sure they would really appreciate it.

35:21.000 --> 35:34.000
Oh, I definitely love Ubuntu-mate and how they're doing with the high DPI support and all those different things. Well, I'll definitely let them know about my findings and what I've done with it. So yeah.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Outstanding.

35:35.000 --> 35:44.000
And also I wanted to tell you that it just booted in and it looks freaking amazing, my friend.

35:44.000 --> 35:55.000
That's good to hear. Yeah, I always think it looks really great, especially with that software welcome boutique. I've even used that on other machines that aren't Ubuntu-mate.

35:55.000 --> 36:05.000
I think that definitely helps newbie users unlike a pro user like me, but it definitely helps a new user to Linux or whatever to have that.

36:05.000 --> 36:20.000
Yeah, absolutely. I still, I guess where I always see Ubuntu-mate fitting in the best for me is like where really nothing else works as well as Ubuntu-mate, inside of the cloud. So if you have, Wes, do you have a cloud workstation yet?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
You know, I don't.

36:21.000 --> 36:35.000
I've gotten Chris on this bus. He has, he turned one of his workstations, one of his really powerful ones into his cloud workstation. And in fact, he was, he was extra going into it remotely from while we were on the road over a tank connection, I might add.

36:35.000 --> 36:36.000
Awesome.

36:36.000 --> 36:46.000
Yeah, but that's where I think Ubuntu-mate really shines is in stuff like that because it is so low resource because it works so well with older hardware.

36:46.000 --> 36:56.000
It means you can really drag out the life in some of your older systems. So we have a machine that sits out right by our back door as our technicians come in and leave and they check in and out and check tickets and whatnot.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.000
That's running on a P4, on a Pentium 4.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.000
Really?

37:00.000 --> 37:10.000
Yeah, Lenovo on a P4. I'll send anyone a picture that doesn't believe me. And you put an SSD in that sucker and guess what? For logging into OS ticket and closing out a ticket or opening one, that works great.

37:10.000 --> 37:15.000
There is no reason other than maybe some power consumption why we would ever change that out.

37:15.000 --> 37:15.000
Right.

37:15.000 --> 37:23.000
And I have a Raspberry Pi here that runs the studio clock and the on-air lights and all of that. And that's running Ubuntu-mate as well. I really like it.

37:23.000 --> 37:32.000
You know, overall, the one place that I still will take Ubuntu-mate over every other desktop every single time is on cloud workstations.

37:32.000 --> 37:40.000
When I need a desktop environment that has to run in the cloud and I have to connect to it remotely over X2Go or whatever it is, I use Ubuntu-mate.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
And there's no place I'd rather store my cloud infrastructure than on DigitalOcean.

37:45.000 --> 37:57.000
And if you go to DigitalOcean and use the code DOUNPLUG, they're going to give you $10 credit, which you can use to get one $10 rig or you can do what I do and get two $5 rigs for free for one month.

37:57.000 --> 38:04.000
That'll give you a chance to try it. Or I suppose you could even use the $10 credit and get one $5 rig and run it for two months.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.000
And the $5 rigs are enough to run a cloud-based workstation.

38:09.000 --> 38:18.000
So visit DigitalOcean.com and use the code DOUNPLUG and get $10 credit towards your first Linux server.

38:18.000 --> 38:24.000
Or if you're like me, use two of the $5 servers and you can actually drag that promo code out.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You can actually get more bang for your buck.

38:26.000 --> 38:32.000
And there's a number of HA droplets up in the cloud and they have a ton of nice features like monitoring and stuff to make that even better.

38:32.000 --> 38:36.000
They do. And you know what the other thing they have, Wes, that I really like is their API.

38:36.000 --> 38:41.000
The ability to tie those servers and the control of those servers into a number of other things.

38:41.000 --> 38:48.000
Now, we talk a lot on this show, you and Chris do, and on the rest of the network, talk a lot about being able to tie that into the IRC.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.000
What we don't talk a lot about is the mobile apps.

38:51.000 --> 38:55.000
And again, this is where DigitalOcean sets itself apart from the competition.

38:55.000 --> 39:09.000
If you take, for example, Amazon or any of the competitors, there is an inherent advantage of being able to pull my phone out and restart my server right from my phone.

39:09.000 --> 39:15.000
And there's an inherent advantage of being able to deploy and destroy those servers right from my phone.

39:15.000 --> 39:22.000
And if you listen to the Asanoa show and you check out an interview that is coming up later, actually later today, with Yubico,

39:22.000 --> 39:28.000
we can show you how you can actually tie this hardware-based device into your DigitalOcean account.

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
That is so exciting.

39:30.000 --> 39:35.000
So that when you install a new server, Wes, you never have to worry about getting these passwords emailed to you.

39:35.000 --> 39:40.000
You never have to worry about uploading your key. All of that stuff happens automagically.

39:40.000 --> 39:45.000
And you can do that and you can try it for free. If you're like, yeah, I'm not sure if that's for me, try it.

39:45.000 --> 39:52.000
Duo Unplugged, use that code, digitalocean.com, and a huge thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

39:52.000 --> 40:01.000
All right, so one of the things that seems to be getting a lot of discussion this week is the Ubuntu 1804 GTK theme.

40:01.000 --> 40:09.000
Now, Ubuntu has looked roughly the same for years, I think, since probably right around 1204.

40:09.000 --> 40:15.000
And they've had this traditional orange theme that when you sit down to this Ubuntu box, you know it's an Ubuntu box,

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
over a Windows box or Windows box, right?

40:17.000 --> 40:22.000
And I've always kind of said, like, if it looks blue, it might be Windows. If it looks orange, it might be Ubuntu.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
And if it looks ugly, it's probably a Mac.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.000
You see, you know, in a window in some building, someone you're like, that's probably Ubuntu.

40:28.000 --> 40:32.000
Right. So this is from OMG Ubuntu.

40:32.000 --> 40:38.000
And basically, the article says, as many of you know, the community theme, as it's currently known, is shaping up to do something pretty special.

40:38.000 --> 40:49.000
A canny crop of community creators have carefully adapted the ditch designs of the Unity 8 desktop into an attractive, real and pretty reliable working theme.

40:49.000 --> 40:57.000
But alas, their work will not be part of the 1804 LTS due to release on April 26th, 2018.

40:57.000 --> 41:02.000
Now, the article goes on to say that they believe that this is a sad decision,

41:02.000 --> 41:10.000
that it means that the Ambience GTK theme will continue to live on until 2023, even though that theme was, oh, here it is.

41:10.000 --> 41:14.000
So that theme was first introduced in 2010.

41:14.000 --> 41:22.000
Now, I guess my question, my first question to you, Wes, is, do you care?

41:22.000 --> 41:33.000
I mean, I can see how it's disappointing, but I also have a strong appreciation for, you know, limiting the amount of changes or really getting that polished layer on an LTS.

41:33.000 --> 41:45.000
And while this new theme, you know, might make sense, I don't know if it makes sense to go through all those cycles when it can be something that will be able to be bolted on later for interested users.

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
And, you know, in the future, if it works out really well, then it will show up in later LTS.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
Oh, yeah, no, that makes sense. Mumble Room, what do you think?

41:53.000 --> 41:59.000
You guys, that's my first question is, does anyone care? Does anyone care what theme, default theme Ubuntu ships with?

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
I care about stability.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Okay, what about stability?

42:03.000 --> 42:13.000
Well, lots of, I mean, lots of the time I want, I just want to chuck the OS up and running on some client's machines and I just want it to work.

42:13.000 --> 42:21.000
Especially if they are not Linux savvy, if something slightly weird goes wrong, I don't want a headache of, well, thing doesn't work again.

42:21.000 --> 42:24.000
Okay, so if it works, it's better.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
So for you, it's not an aesthetic thing, it's a functional thing.

42:27.000 --> 42:34.000
Pretty much, yeah. I mean, I would like to see a new theme and it does, the new one does look really nice.

42:34.000 --> 42:39.000
But at the end of the day, less calls for me is better.

42:39.000 --> 42:44.000
There's a reason I'm pushing you on that.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
And the reason is I agree with you implicitly.

42:46.000 --> 42:54.000
I agree with you that the priority should be in the user experience, not necessarily in what we subjectively think is pretty.

42:54.000 --> 43:02.000
And we have to remember us Linux users are going to have a predisposition to think that the current Unity theme isn't pretty because we've seen it for so long.

43:02.000 --> 43:05.000
Right. And so we're probably a little bit sick of it.

43:05.000 --> 43:12.000
But I would challenge you because the Internet, I went to, I think I was in three or four different telegram groups and this particular article came up.

43:12.000 --> 43:21.000
And people are saying, why aren't we taking the reboot of Linux as an opportunity to say this new GTK theme could be really great.

43:21.000 --> 43:27.000
We could come up with a new GTK theme that really shines, that really shows what GNOME is capable of.

43:27.000 --> 43:31.000
You know, maybe something that's a really nice dark theme, something like that. Right.

43:31.000 --> 43:34.000
And I agree with all of that. I think that eventually we should get there.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
However, I want to play a piece of audio that we captured while we were at scale.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
If I turn my volume slider up.

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
Are you getting a lot of questions? Are you getting a lot of concern?

43:48.000 --> 43:52.000
Are you getting a lot of excitement for Canonical's decision to switch to the GNOME desktop?

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
People are looking saying, oh, that doesn't look so different at all.

43:55.000 --> 44:00.000
I said, no, we've worked really hard to make, we haven't implemented Unity on top of GNOME Shell.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
We want it to be a GNOME Shell experience.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
But we want to provide an easy transition.

44:04.000 --> 44:10.000
So when people, when someone has 6.0.4 and they do their upgrade in July, they're not surprised new interface.

44:10.000 --> 44:19.000
Okay, so what he's saying there is that they have had concerns from users that they're going to have the rug pulled out from under them.

44:19.000 --> 44:25.000
And he's saying that user after user is walking up to this demo machine with GNOME installed.

44:25.000 --> 44:34.000
And they're looking at GNOME with the current Ubuntu theme that people are used to and saying, yeah, actually, you know what?

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
That really doesn't look too bad.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
That actually looks a lot like to what I'm used to.

44:38.000 --> 44:42.000
I mean, I can see a couple little changes here and there, but roughly things are how I would expect them to be.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
What do you think, Wes? Is that a logical reason?

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
Yeah, I mean, I think there is.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
I think it ended up being kind of disparate communities, too.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.000
And here we talk a lot about news and exciting stuff of what's coming up.

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
So it's really easy to get super excited and want all that latest shiny stuff.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
And of course, we want Ubuntu's awesome.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
They've done a bunch of great work here.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
We want it to look really good and appetizing to users.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.000
We want to try to bring to our favorite platform.

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
But I do think there is a lot to be said about limiting that change.

45:11.000 --> 45:21.000
And there's even some consternation here about, well, couldn't you have shipped this theme just as an extra or somewhere as an option in the menu?

45:21.000 --> 45:22.000
And yeah, sure.

45:22.000 --> 45:28.000
But even that feels like there's a certain amount of blessing, official blessing from the distribution maker.

45:28.000 --> 45:38.000
And if you really can't stand by it versus having that stability for users new or old, knowing that it just works, it's what you've been trained on.

45:38.000 --> 45:44.000
And that from there, once we get this, you know, it's a big transition going to GNOME.

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
It's a big transition building this new infrastructure.

45:48.000 --> 46:00.000
So if we can do that in a way where change happens, but at a pace that is enough to keep it going, but not enough to drive people away, like maybe that first Unity transition, I think that's a good thing.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.000
I completely agree.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
I completely agree with basically everything you just said.

46:04.000 --> 46:10.000
And that is kind of where I think Nathan was going. That is where I think the Ubuntu design team was going.

46:10.000 --> 46:14.000
And that's what I would suggest if somebody were to ask me for my opinion.

46:14.000 --> 46:21.000
Let's make GNOME all it can be. Let's make GNOME shine. Let's show off all of the shiny bells.

46:21.000 --> 46:30.000
Let's just do all of that after we have made this absolute hurdle of a transition where we are changing the desktop experience.

46:30.000 --> 46:34.000
Because I think as geeky Linux users, we underestimate this.

46:34.000 --> 46:47.000
And I have some unique insight because my company deals directly with this very issue where we are taking desktop Linux and putting it in front of users who they don't care what the desktop environment is.

46:47.000 --> 46:50.000
They don't care what the operating system is. They just want to get to work.

46:50.000 --> 46:52.000
And I think you start to lose perspective.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.000
For us, we don't care because we've tried KDE, we've tried GNOME, we've tried Unity.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
It doesn't matter to us.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
We know how to switch if we need to. Not a big deal.

47:00.000 --> 47:05.000
I can't count the number of times, Wes, that I have heard a Linux user say to me, I don't really care what desktop is on top.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
What I really care about is what's underneath.

47:07.000 --> 47:16.000
Now that can either be I want the bleeding edge of Arch or that can be I want the stable security mountain of the Ubuntu LTS.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
But I don't care what desktop is on top of it so much as I care is what's underneath.

47:20.000 --> 47:36.000
And I will tell you, as a person who puts food on the table by catering to users, the vast majority of computer users that aren't geeks look at their computer working environment the exact opposite way.

47:36.000 --> 47:42.000
They couldn't care less if Arch is underneath or Ubuntu is underneath or Fedora is underneath.

47:42.000 --> 47:48.000
What they care about is that the close button is in the same part of the screen every single time.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
What they care about is that the file menu is easily findable.

47:51.000 --> 47:56.000
What they care about is that the doc that was over on the left and that's how they launched their applications for the last five years.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
That doc is still there.

47:58.000 --> 48:03.000
What they care about is when the computer boots up that it has roughly the same look.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
So they feel like they are at the same computer.

48:05.000 --> 48:10.000
That's what the average Linux user is thinking.

48:10.000 --> 48:16.000
And at least the average Linux user that was not necessarily put there by choice because most of us choose our desktop.

48:16.000 --> 48:24.000
Now, I'm sorry, Mimic, you had a comment about people just changing the wallpaper?

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
Yeah, it is interesting.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
I switched a lot of people to Linux and everything.

48:28.000 --> 48:35.000
But what they do is they change their wallpaper and nothing else after years because they like to use their desktop.

48:35.000 --> 48:41.000
As you said before, as always, as they used it before, they don't want to change.

48:41.000 --> 48:46.000
But the only thing they change is the wallpaper. The rest has to stay as it was before.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
That's a good point.

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And so they can work like that, yeah.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
No, that's an excellent point.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.000
I really agree.

48:51.000 --> 48:52.000
And I'm sorry, Wes, I cut you off.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
What were you going to say?

48:53.000 --> 48:57.000
Oh, no, I think you covered it.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
Yeah.

48:58.000 --> 49:08.000
I was just going to say, Noah, that, sorry, I meant to say that, you know, I have to say the Ubuntu stock theme is fine.

49:08.000 --> 49:16.000
But in my experience, it doesn't really play that well with, what should we call it, other apps.

49:16.000 --> 49:20.000
And I've noticed this very well, a lot.

49:20.000 --> 49:28.000
And I think that maybe if they shipped something like Numix or something like that, like a different theme,

49:28.000 --> 49:36.000
then maybe some normal users, like non-average Linux users would probably be happy.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
That's my opinion, but I don't know.

49:38.000 --> 49:40.000
Yeah, I guess I can kind of see that.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
I just keep coming back to it.

49:42.000 --> 49:45.000
It seems to be I don't see a lot of dissenting opinion on the Internet.

49:45.000 --> 49:49.000
I'm not seeing a lot of people saying, oh, this isn't really a bad thing.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.000
This is fine.

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
And I'm not seeing a lot of people saying it's a theme.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
I don't really care if I didn't like it.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.000
I'd change it.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
I am seeing a lot of disappointment.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.000
I guess that's the word I see keep coming up.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
But we're disappointed.

50:01.000 --> 50:04.000
We're disappointed about this theme.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.000
We're disappointed in Canonical's decision.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.000
We're disappointed that they're not making GNOME look like GNOME.

50:08.000 --> 50:10.000
They're trying to make it look like Unity.

50:10.000 --> 50:11.000
And you heard it in the clip.

50:11.000 --> 50:15.000
Nathan said himself, we are not trying to reinvent Unity on top of GNOME.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
We want GNOME to be GNOME.

50:17.000 --> 50:27.000
We just want people that have been using Unity for the last 10 years to not feel totally lost on their computer when they click an update button and everything moves.

50:27.000 --> 50:33.000
Literally, the entire interface that the user talks to is going to get ripped out from under them and replaced with a different one.

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
We need to make that transition as smooth as possible.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
So I think Canonical's absolutely on point.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
I think it's a great way to go.

50:39.000 --> 50:49.000
And it's also it seems to me it also speaks a little bit like it's you know, Canonical's doing a lot, especially if you're going to compare it with something like, you know, with Mac OS X.

50:49.000 --> 50:57.000
1804 is not just, you know, there is this this workstation desktop environment, but they're, you know, they're working on the back end and a lot of the core that still gets on the server as well.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
And their cloud distributions.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
There's a lot going on here.

51:01.000 --> 51:09.000
So, you know, if they can't commit, if there's not enough resources to polish this theme, especially with, you know, it's really like a community thing that does into it, too.

51:09.000 --> 51:12.000
And we're really, you know, we want to shine on every platform that we're going to do it on.

51:12.000 --> 51:15.000
Sometimes that means things just take a little longer.

51:15.000 --> 51:22.000
And I don't want to get too sidetracked, you know, and I'd rather concentrate on what we're doing right instead of what they're doing wrong kind of a thing.

51:22.000 --> 51:32.000
However, I will say this since you bring up Mac OS, you know, Apple users are perfectly OK with their desktop staying basically the same for 45 years.

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
I mean, Apple has not really significantly changed the desktop layout.

51:37.000 --> 51:40.000
I mean, I've still got the little Apple. I still have the file menu up top.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.000
I still have the you know, I mean, little things have changed.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
There's less brushed metal now, but OK.

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
Yeah, right, right.

51:47.000 --> 51:53.000
But but yeah, no, I just I feel like there is something to be said about familiarity and stability.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
And you see this in all sorts of places, right?

51:55.000 --> 52:01.000
Like one of the reasons that I always stay at a particular hotel brand is because I know where the beds are.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
I'm used to the paintings on the wall. I know where the bathrooms are.

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
Everything's kind of laid out in the same way.

52:05.000 --> 52:12.000
And anybody that travels a lot for a living and I became particularly aware of this because we were I was just in L.A.

52:12.000 --> 52:18.000
And one of the things I enjoyed was we went to Target and I kind of had a rough idea of the layout of the store.

52:18.000 --> 52:26.000
We were able to find the things except for a towel that we needed because they're roughly laid out the same way that they're laid out in Grand Forks or Seattle or New York.

52:26.000 --> 52:31.000
And I think that kind of familiarity is sometimes taken for granted.

52:31.000 --> 52:38.000
So for those all of those reasons and everything we just discussed, that's I think canonical is making a great decision.

52:38.000 --> 52:45.000
Dan brought up a pretty good point in Discord and I guess we could let him chime in on that if he's there.

52:45.000 --> 52:46.000
Sure. Hey, Dan.

52:46.000 --> 52:55.000
Yeah, I think something a lot of people don't realize is that like back in the old days when we had like GTK2, we had themes.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.000
And the thing was that themes were super limited.

52:59.000 --> 53:04.000
You could change some colors. You could change a little bit of styles.

53:04.000 --> 53:09.000
You could change like some very surface things, but it was super constrained.

53:09.000 --> 53:15.000
And nowadays we don't really have thieves anymore. We have style sheets and the difference is huge.

53:15.000 --> 53:20.000
And style sheets are incredibly powerful and they can also be incredibly dangerous.

53:20.000 --> 53:27.000
And if you went to any random website and you copied their CSS style sheet and tried to apply it to a different website, it just wouldn't work.

53:27.000 --> 53:31.000
You would think that was insane. Like you would never expect that to be a thing.

53:31.000 --> 53:40.000
But for some reason like Linux users still think that we have themes and it's easy, you know, but style sheets are really hard to get right.

53:40.000 --> 53:46.000
And it's absolutely a good thing that they said, hey, we need to test this. We need to look for corner cases.

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
We don't know if this is actually going to physically work. It could really break things.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.000
So to that point, have you looked at some of the CSS style sheets in GNOME?

53:56.000 --> 54:06.000
Yeah, we reference Adwaita all the time just to see what they're doing, because in a lot of cases we kind of have to chase GTK when there's API changes.

54:06.000 --> 54:12.000
Okay. If you were to rate it on a scale of one to ten, ten being everything is perfectly documented all the way through.

54:12.000 --> 54:18.000
And I never have any questions of how what this style sheet does or what this thing references or if I change this color, this is what's going to happen.

54:18.000 --> 54:23.000
And one is I basically change it, save, reload the desktop and see what it looks like.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
How would you rate the documentation?

54:26.000 --> 54:30.000
Somewhere between one and I really use Inspector a lot.

54:30.000 --> 54:36.000
Yeah. And so anyone that has dug in, I'm serious. Anyone can check this.

54:36.000 --> 54:44.000
I've heard this from a number of developers that the style sheets inside of GNOME are horrendously documented.

54:44.000 --> 54:51.000
And so one of the issues that we are going to run into if we start willy nilly changing all of this stuff, what are we down to?

54:51.000 --> 54:55.000
The date is the let's see, are we are less than OK, we have a little over a month.

54:55.000 --> 54:58.000
We have like a month and a week before the LTS ships.

54:58.000 --> 55:09.000
Yeah, we have a month and a week before the LTS ships and LTS that follows a somewhat less than perfect LTS that came out last time.

55:09.000 --> 55:14.000
Right. We had wireless issues. We had a couple issues that came out.

55:14.000 --> 55:21.000
But this is the opportunity for canonical to get the desktop right. And they have restructured the company.

55:21.000 --> 55:27.000
They're going back to this old desktop. They have pared down to just the eight players.

55:27.000 --> 55:31.000
This is an opportunity for canonical to shine.

55:31.000 --> 55:40.000
And the worst possible thing they could do at the 11th hour is go in and say, well, we don't really know what these hex codes do.

55:40.000 --> 55:47.000
So we change them and we reload and then hopefully we run into all of the places that it didn't change so that we can go and fix those two.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
That is a ridiculous model, I think.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.000
Yeah. It's like someone asking you to write the entirety of Bootstrap in a couple of months.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.000
Right. Yeah. Right. Exactly. Yeah. It's really it's a month and a week.

55:57.000 --> 56:03.000
So let's get through the transition. Let's go with the thing that works, the thing that we know.

56:03.000 --> 56:10.000
And then from there, let's move on to making it a totally different theme.

56:10.000 --> 56:14.000
That's that's kind of where I want to leave it.

56:14.000 --> 56:22.000
If you want to learn more about how to change things, because there's going to be somebody out there and they're going to say, how does how does how does Noah learn that stuff?

56:22.000 --> 56:27.000
Because I'm an I.T. admin, right? I don't have time to be I don't develop. That's not what I do. That's not what you do, Wes.

56:27.000 --> 56:30.000
Right. Neither one of us develop desktops for a living.

56:30.000 --> 56:34.000
But what I do do what I do is I go to Linux Academy dot com slash unplug.

56:34.000 --> 56:42.000
That's what I do. And when I do that, a promo code is applied and I am able to get a discount on my Linux education.

56:42.000 --> 56:50.000
Now, this is you have to understand something. You have to understand that I have I approach Linux education from the old school model.

56:50.000 --> 56:56.000
I have O'Reilly books. I don't use them anymore other than to set them up behind my desk so that clients are impressed.

56:56.000 --> 57:01.000
They're like, oh, you have O'Reilly books. You are well, that's essential. Yeah, right. Exactly.

57:01.000 --> 57:11.000
There's some people that still judge me on that. But I was the guy that spent five, six thousand dollars in tuition to go to a Red Hat training course.

57:11.000 --> 57:17.000
And then plus hotel expense, plus I'm away from work, plus I'm paying for, you know, eating out every night, which is really a lot of people don't understand.

57:17.000 --> 57:20.000
That is probably one of the most expensive things about traveling. Not anymore.

57:20.000 --> 57:26.000
Now I go to Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged my route, my Red Hats. I let my Red Hat certification expire.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.000
I'm not proud of that because I liked being read.

57:29.000 --> 57:37.000
But the truth is, I am a small business owner and I don't have to certify myself for myself to understand that myself understands what to do.

57:37.000 --> 57:42.000
I just need to know the technology. And with Linux Academy, I'm able to do that.

57:42.000 --> 57:48.000
I was able to learn everything I needed to know to get my clients up to speed on rail seven.

57:48.000 --> 57:51.000
And again, this is coming from somebody who paid for the course in rail six.

57:51.000 --> 58:01.000
And I don't feel like I got anything more out of the actual Red Hat course for the thousands and thousands of dollars I spent than the discount than the discounted course that I got from Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged.

58:01.000 --> 58:06.000
And here's why the people that work at Linux Academy and I met them at scale.

58:06.000 --> 58:14.000
These are true dedicated Linux users. These are people that have passion for Linux passion about the projects that they are presenting on.

58:14.000 --> 58:27.000
And one of the fantastic things, one of the fantastic benefits that you get when you're working with a true dedicated professional that understands and cares and has a passion about what they're doing is they are excited to answer your questions.

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
They are excited to watch that light bulb go off when you learn something.

58:30.000 --> 58:37.000
And that two way communication, that two way learning, that ability to say, yes, I get this and no, I don't get that.

58:37.000 --> 58:40.000
That's what leads ultimately to success.

58:40.000 --> 58:47.000
Right before I got on the air, I was having a discussion with another gentleman I met at scale and he was asking me, no, I want I'm working at this particular job.

58:47.000 --> 58:56.000
No technical relation whatsoever. I don't have any sort of technical skills that I'm using at this job, but I like Linux and I want to move into a Linux job.

58:56.000 --> 59:03.000
How do I do that? My first answer was Linux Academy Linux Academy dot com slash unplug and start your new career.

59:03.000 --> 59:13.000
They're going to take care of all the hard stuff, spinning up the lab, spinning up the AWS instances, spinning up the servers, setting up the you know, the you know, the minutiae on top of it.

59:13.000 --> 59:18.000
You need again, go back to a lamb stack. You need to set up a lamb stack. They're going to set all of that up for you.

59:18.000 --> 59:22.000
And even if you don't want even if you don't want to change career, maybe you're very happy.

59:22.000 --> 59:27.000
Maybe you're like me and you just want to learn something about something because knowledge is the one thing nobody can take away from you.

59:27.000 --> 59:35.000
So go to Linux Academy dot com slash unplugged and make sure to check out their Linux courses and find your passion and get started today.

59:35.000 --> 59:41.000
And a huge thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program.

59:41.000 --> 59:49.000
So this I have two things that I want to get to this one, I don't want to spend a lot of time on it, but I just want to talk about it briefly.

59:49.000 --> 59:54.000
Are any of you familiar with Simon from the KTE project? Yes. Sorry.

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
No. OK. Whoever said yes. Tell me. Yeah. OK. Talk to me about Simon.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:06.000
So are you referring to Simon Quigley? No. OK. No. OK. Then I don't have any idea where he is.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Almost as cool as Simon. It's not quite as cool as Simon Quigley, but it's very close.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Simon is an open source speech recognition program that replaces your mouse and keyboard.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And the system is designed to work with any language or dialect. Now, here's why I was so excited when I first saw this.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I get people all the time that write into the Ask Noah show and they'll say, I have a hearing impairment.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I have a visual impairment. I have a speech impairment. I know for a fact I have one listener that has all three.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:45.000
And accessibility on Linux is usually not is something that I would have not thought a lot of developers had a lot of time for.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I would have thought we had bigger fish to fry, bigger fires to put out.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:56.000
But it turns out there's some really passionate people that are working on these accessibility options.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:04.000
And what this does is it legitimately enables us to switch people to Linux.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:11.000
So I'm over at KDE.org and you can it's Simon.KDE.org and you can you can click on for a short demo.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I don't have any way to show that to you, but the screenshots look absolutely fantastic.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:25.000
And I have reached out to one of the viewers of our shows, a listener of our shows that I know for a fact would really benefit from this.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:33.000
And I'm hoping that he can get back to us with a more in-depth review from somebody who actually relies on tools like this to use his computer.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Because I would feel a little weird trying to give you my opinion about an accessibility tool that I don't really have a use for.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000
I don't really have a need for it. And I wouldn't really notice if it was I mean, he can't if these tools don't work for him, he can't use his computer.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.000
If they don't work for me, I just go, well, I didn't quite get it, but I just typed it anyway, you know.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
So Simon.KDE.org, I'd check that out and see what you think.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
And yeah, I'm not bringing on Simon Quigley. He's a great guy.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:04.000
But as far as I know, as far as I know, having a Simon Quigley in your computer will not will not aid you in your...

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.000
It just doesn't scale the same way. He might be able to type some things for you for just you, but he can't help everyone.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Yeah, he's not replicatable. That's what it is. You can't r-sync him.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:22.000
It does seem really important for us to have this sort of technology, though, especially if we want to be, you know, the open source operating system for the masses.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:29.000
You know, we talk a lot about that with things like LibreOffice and others, but if we can't reach, you know, all kinds of people, it's just not as good.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It goes back to what we were talking about in the pre-show, really.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.000
The we have to have not only we can't just have the same apps that exist on Windows and Mac OS.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
We have to have better apps. We have to have more accessibility.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:47.000
We need to be able to say to the person who's struggling with accessibility features, this is why you should use Linux, because it's so more flexible.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
It's so much more accommodating of your disability.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Exactly.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
That's great. So we'll...

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Go ahead.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000
I actually met the lead developer once in Berlin at the Desktop Summit three years ago.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Oh, no kidding.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
It's from Austria. It's a project from an Austrian university.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:12.000
The problem is at the time it was very difficult to install because you have a lot of underlying technologies, open source technologies, so you have a lot of dependencies and everything.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.000
So I guess by now the installation process is better, but at the time it was very difficult.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Yeah, it looks like it's pretty straightforward.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Again, I haven't played with it myself, mostly because I don't think I could do this justice as a review.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
But that's interesting that you spoke to the developer.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000
So does he have a passion for helping people with disabilities, or does he have a passion for making Linux more accessible, I would assume?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Well, it started as a university project for him, and then they had a group around with a professor that was interested in that kind of technologies.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:49.000
And so they developed, they started, and they're also successful, it seems.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Excellent.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
That is so encouraging to hear.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:04.000
And I'm really happy that there are people out there that are working on projects like that, and I think that it really goes to speak to the Linux community as a whole and how we come together and work together.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I think that's a really cool message.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
So we'll keep an eye on that.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:13.000
And again, if the gentleman is willing to share his experience, we'll have him participate in Linux Unplugged.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Otherwise, we'll play with it a little bit and let you know.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:29.000
So I don't want to spend a lot of time on it, but just take a look at it and see what you think and be thankful that there are people that are working on things, even if they don't affect a large, proportionally speaking, a large number of users.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Wes, you sent me one of the coolest articles I've read today, and this comes to us from Hackaday, and it is about ThinkPad culture.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Now let me explain, I have to go in a little bit to ThinkPad culture before we can talk about this article.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Yes, there's some background and context.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
A little bit of background.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:50.000
So ThinkPad back in the day, back when it was owned by IBM, was largely regarded as the best business laptop out there.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:59.000
And then they sold to Lenovo, and most would argue that the quality of the laptop didn't go down, but the quality of customer service would go down.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:15.000
I worked with a gentleman who literally had a semi truck come pick up a entire office load of ThinkPads, this is back when they were owned by IBM, because they were having some small minute little issue, and that's just not how IBM operated back in the day.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:20.000
They wanted to make sure that you had a class A computer you were paying for, and they were going to make sure you got it.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000
My first computer was a ThinkPad, and I've used them, you know, really ever since.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:31.000
But basically a couple of years ago, they retooled the ThinkPad and they made a number of changes.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Prior to the changes, the ThinkPad had everything was built around functionality.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:44.000
So the keyboard was built around somebody who bangs on it, you know, for 15, 16 hours a day, all of the function buttons that you would need.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:53.000
When I say function buttons, I'm talking about, you know, insert, home, delete, all of those things were laid out in a way that basically resembled a regular desktop keyboard.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And around three, four years ago, maybe five, Lenovo decided that they needed to imitate Apple.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And so they went away from the functional great keyboard that worked perfectly and went to this chiclet style keyboard.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And they took away, they remapped the home, insert and end keys.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:20.000
So that end and insert is a single key that you have to use function a lot, which is frustrating because you know what I use?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You know what I use a lot? I use end to get to the end of something. Exactly.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.000
You know what the key I've never once used on a keyboard for anything intentionally? Insert. I've never I've never wanted the insert.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000
No one no one no one uses that. It's like scroll lock back in the day.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000
But yet they have they have that's that's the kind of idiotic things they've done.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
There used to be a way I could seek tracks by hitting function and the arrow keys.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:46.000
They've taken all of that away. And because of that, ThinkPad users were understandably very upset because they made these changes.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000
They there's no improvement. The laptops haven't gotten smaller. There's not any more space.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
There's absolutely no reason that we couldn't have left the old keyboard.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:05.000
And in response to that, Lenovo created a retro ThinkPad that went back to the old keyboard, that went back to the old, you know, layout.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Basically, everything was kind of the same as it was in the in the quote unquote good old days, except it had newer specs.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000
But they weren't new enough. They weren't fast enough.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.000
They didn't put enough into it. And consequently, a lot of people didn't buy the retro ThinkPad.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:28.000
So this article from Hackaday talks about the ThinkPad culture that is literally taking these older ThinkPads that are designed basically perfectly.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And they are replacing the motherboards, the processors and expanding these laptops and making them into laptops that can be used in 2018.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
So tell me about this, Wes.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Oh, yeah. I mean, it seems like they've got a lot of they have some of the modernization stuff, right?

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:55.000
The biggest one for me is just there's there's like way more USB 3.0 and 3.1 and Thunderbolt 3.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And it seems like they're embracing that in a first class way.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Right. So they added the USB 3.0, they added Thunderbolt, they updated the RAM to DDR4.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Now, if you're interested in doing this, the motherboard that they are, the model that they recommend that makes it easy to swap these motherboards out, I believe is the X60, X61, X62, X200, X201, X210 and T60.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Now, if you're not familiar with Lenovo's lineup, product lineup, the X series is kind of the ultra portable and light.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:37.000
The T series is kind of the hybrid in between portable desktop and super, you know, super light laptop.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And the P series is the I don't know what you want to call a mobile workstation, I guess.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:49.000
And so they have a couple different options for you to choose from.

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:56.000
It's interesting that they have they have been able to get these newer motherboards into these older chassis.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.000
And with the heat sinks and getting them to fit and getting the ports to stick out without looking terrible.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Because if you look at some of these pictures on the Hackaday site and we'll have it linked in the show notes for you, this laptop looks really good.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:18.000
This looks like it was actually produced at Lenovo, and yet it is produced by a community of hackers, a community of hardware tinkerers, right?

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Yeah, it really it really does, and I think there is a strong contingent of Linux enthusiasts out there or even just ThinkPad enthusiasts who have that love of the classic ThinkPad shape.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:40.000
But we're really getting, you know, for a long time we talked about, especially if you're fans of not using proprietary firmware or other things, you're probably already checking out some older ThinkPad models for that reason.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:49.000
But that hardware has really been showing its age, especially if you do stuff that isn't just, you know, a terminal and a web browser. But you want you want more high DPI stuff.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:59.000
You want modern USB, you want PCI Express, all those good things that, you know, a lot of people these days depend on, especially if you're trying to give presentations, you're trying to create media.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Having that in this little being able to have that in a classic package, it seems like maybe the best of both worlds. Is that possible?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:15.000
No, absolutely. You're absolutely right. Mumbo Room, is anyone else in here using the is using a ThinkPad?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Oh, I wish.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Mimic?

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I have a 230.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
You have a 230. OK, so the 230.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
I love that guy.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:32.000
So the 230, if I'm not mistaken, is the last ThinkPad that was that was produced from the X series before they switched to the new layout. Is that correct?

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Nope. And it was a 220 was the last 230 is the first that has a new layout.

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
OK, all right. So you have that.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.000
I love the keyboard is not bad as I didn't know the layout before. For me, it was no problem.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Did you? Well, yeah, that does explain a lot. So you never use the old ThinkPad layout?

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Nope. Nope. I have I bought one X220 for my sister afterwards, and she's loving it. But I never used the page down page up keys that you have on the old IBM layout.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Yeah. And, you know, it's not so much that I use the you know, the page up page down.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:16.000
It's really not even one particular key that I used a lot. I guess what bothered me was we didn't gain.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:22.000
We didn't have any meaningful gains by getting rid of that stuff.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Well, as I said, as I didn't use the thing before, I cannot really see the difference.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:33.000
Yeah, sure. But as far as your 230, though, you're happy with it. It's worked very well. I assume you have Linux on it.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
This is a solid horse. I use it every day.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
And you have Linux on it?

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Oh, certainly. Yeah, yeah. I have a dual boot and I you have these slots. You have an M2 slot in it so you can add a different an SSD in it and still have a normal slot for another hard disk.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:12:03.000
So you can do whatever you want. And if you don't want it, you take out the M2 SSD and you make a SIM card in it and you can use it even with GSM.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Yeah, I had that on my X250, I want to say, or X260, whatever the one I had before this.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Now I have the X270 and I'm actually in the process of perhaps upgrading to the X1 carbon.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000
And Lenovo has made some design decisions that I'm a little frustrated with.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
You can hear more about that in in user and ask Noah.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:28.000
But suffice to say, this is a really neat article and I'm glad to see that there is a community popping up around ThinkPads.

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:35.000
If you go to any of the grassroots Linux conferences like Self, you'll see a lot of ThinkPads.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:41.000
You'll see a lot of ThinkPads. In fact, at Self, for example, they actually require you to present on ThinkPads.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:51.000
And so for a long time, ThinkPads have kind of been known as the, I guess, the computer that Linux enthusiasts kind of rally around.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:03.000
And that is where Red Hat has chosen to purchase all of their computers. And now Google, I understand, is actually purchasing X1 carbons for their employees and putting Linux on them.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
So it's a really good choice. And that's not to demean Dell. Of course, Dell makes really excellent computers.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000
If you want the XPS, it's a fantastic developer's machine. In fact, I think that's going to be my wife's next computer.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:19.000
My dad purchased one. He's been very happy with it. That's not to demean System76. They make great machines, too.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:25.000
It's just that Lenovo just, because of my roots, I guess, Lenovo has a special place in my heart.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
So to see a kind of community pop up around it, I think that's really cool.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:38.000
And the fact that we are, I have a passion for older hardware, too. So the ability, the thought of being able to use a really old T60, that appeals to me.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:48.000
It does look like maybe there's a few complications here. Some people who've reviewed them have not had the best battery life in the world and some issues with firmware updates and that sort of thing.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
But for what you're getting, it seems like a great deal.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Yeah. In fact, I would argue, I think I still have a T60 around here. Maybe that'll be a project for Linux Fest. Wouldn't that be cool if we rehabbed a T60?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
I'd love to see that.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
Would you?

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Hell yes, Noah. I got to tell you, I mean, I loved my T60 when I had it, but unfortunately it died on me and I'm like, oh my God.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:30.000
So, you know, I've been craving to get my ass another thing, Pat. I just, I just can't, you know, afford one right now because I'm a broke college guy.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Yeah, I hear you.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I'm just like, ah, you gotta be kidding me. So, you know, I would love to see this thing in action at some point.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Actually, when I finish my classes, I'm thinking of coming up to Linux Fest Northwest if my dad permits and I might bring him along with me.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:55.000
And, you know, I got to tell you, IBM, the company he works for is big supporters of Linux.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000
And I was thinking of, you know, bringing him and I up there and checking this thing out.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:07.000
And, you know, he actually uses a ThinkPad T420, which is unfortunately still running Win 7.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:15.000
But, you know, I'm actually thinking of bringing my Mac, which is running Ubuntu Mate on it and having that with me, actually.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Yeah, well, I'll tell you what I have. I tell you what I'm planning on doing.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:21.000
I'm going to pick up my excellent carbon. I'm going to get Linux loaded on that.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Then I'm going to talk Chris into using my old X270 and then we're going to rebuild.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Maybe we'll build a T60. And Wes, are you up for doing that with me?

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000
Heck, yes.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Well, that'd be great. So maybe that's what you can look forward to. I don't know. We'll see what happens.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:41.000
But anyway, thanks so much, Mumble Room, for being here. We really appreciate having you. Wes, it's always fun to host with you.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Heck, yes.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000
Absolutely. If you want to check out more of this great content, go to JupiterBroadcasting.com.

Chris on Twitter at ChrisLES. At Wes Payne for you, Wes. I'm at ColonelLinux.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Anything else, Wes?

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:03.000
Go check out the TechSnap program. We should have some exciting new episodes coming real soon.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
And of course, stay tuned for Ask Noah.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:34.000
And we'll see you next Tuesday.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:17:01.000
I promise you, wherever Chris is, whether he's in his RV, wherever he is, he's sitting there and he's like,

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:09.000
Noah just mazed multiple times over the weekend. He was making a point about coming in right at the right spot in the music.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:16.000
And then this is the problem with guest hosting is I don't know the music well enough to know right where that spot is.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000
Perfect spot.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Yeah, I didn't quite milk the sweet spot.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Whereas I see Chris, you just hit play and he'll start jumping into it.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:35.000
He was talking about when he's in the RV, he's like, there are times when somebody will be playing something and I'm like, show mode.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.000
And then he's got to call me. He's like, no, no, no, it's not show mode. It's just if he hears Ronald Janky somewhere.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000
That's amazing.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Yeah, I know. I would do it too, actually. I just I don't ever have my theme music anywhere.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Right.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:18:00.000
I meant to tell you, there is actually now in the Ubuntu Mate installer a minimal installation option where it only does like the minimal GUI and then with a browser and a bunch of utilities.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
That's all it includes for you.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000
It's awesome.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:08.000
Yes, I'm actually half tempted to check that box and see what it gives me.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:18.000
And I will say that, like I said in the show just a few minutes ago, that this actually scaled my Mac screen right down to the proper setting.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:28.000
And I am really amazed at this. And it didn't pick up my Wi-Fi, but it did pick up my Thunderbolt to Ethernet jack almost instantly.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:33.000
I was really impressed with that. And all I did was plug it in right from the router.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Boom. Done.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Nice.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
It worked just fine.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Yes.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Yeah, the wired stuff tends to work, you know, actually pretty well.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Yes, and I am unfortunately going to have to install the proprietary Broadcom driver after the install.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Maybe it'll pick up during the updates, but I don't know.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:19:01.000
But I always download updates while installing Ubuntu because that way I'll have my Wi-Fi and all that other stuff working.

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:09.000
And I'm actually planning to stick around for the Ask Noah show because there are certain things that I need to talk to you about during the show and maybe afterwards.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.000
Awesome.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Yeah.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Well, I'm planning to stick around for that.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:19.000
And like I said, I wish to God that I could afford a ThinkPad right now.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
But unfortunately, I just can't.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
You know, and it really sucks.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Yeah, I hear you.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Hey, guys.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Hey, guys, can we go to JBLive.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Can we go to JBtitles.com?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Do we pick titles from JBtitles or do we pick them from Discord now?

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000
I have both up.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
I think normally we do both.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000
We'll do a search in Discord to see what people throw there and then also look at what's up.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
I did put Discord on my laptop just to do this show today.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Oh, look at you.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:54.000
But Noah, another thing I meant to talk to you about was the thing that I'm on Sprint right now with my family and there's such a pain in the neck.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:20:06.000
So I've been thinking about maybe getting a Tim Sim card and just throwing it in there.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000
And I don't even have five bucks to throw towards that.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
And I'm like, you gotta be shitting me.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:17.000
So I'm thinking about, you know, waiting till Friday this week and chucking out five bucks and getting one.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Yeah, for sure.

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Now, Ben, you're more than welcome to call into the Ask Noah show.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000
But just make sure you make sure to keep a family friendly.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:34.000
I will. And I forgot to do that during during which we call it on love.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Love doesn't matter. Love.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Well, I mean, I suppose I suppose I suppose they should have.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000
We should probably always try to be family friendly, but it doesn't.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.000
The thing is, the only thing you have to worry about is you just have to not offend Chris or the audience to the point that Chris gets upset.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000
That's really all you have to do.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000
My show, you say a bad word, I get a ten thousand dollar fine.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:21:21.000
So don't do that.
