WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
Now, before we start, we have a listener in the virtual lug

00:03.080 --> 00:05.520
who's joined us in the metaverse.

00:05.520 --> 00:06.960
Is it the metaverse that you're in right now?

00:06.960 --> 00:07.800
Where are you?

00:07.800 --> 00:10.920
Not quite, I'm just apparently hovering above the ground

00:10.920 --> 00:12.320
in Oculus Home.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.320
But you got Tmux.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.720
Yes, I have Tmux on one side

00:15.720 --> 00:17.120
and I've got Mummla in the middle.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.880
Tmux, so to explain this, what is this that you're seeing?

00:19.880 --> 00:22.240
Is this some sort of, how are you doing this?

00:22.240 --> 00:24.600
If you've ever used a Quest 2 and you've opened the store,

00:24.600 --> 00:26.640
it's up in that little window down at the bottom

00:26.640 --> 00:28.600
and you can set it on each side.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.040
You can have multiple windows.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.040
It's pretty neat.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.200
So on my right, I've got my settings panel.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.200
In the middle, I've got basically just a standard window

00:36.200 --> 00:37.040
with Mummla in it.

00:37.040 --> 00:39.240
And then on my left, I've got Tmux.

00:39.240 --> 00:42.280
And these are floating in like a virtual lounge

00:42.280 --> 00:43.120
or something?

00:43.120 --> 00:46.880
Yes, I'm just in the little cabin in the woods studio

00:46.880 --> 00:49.080
and they're just floating midair.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.880
How many NFTs did you have to trade in

00:51.880 --> 00:55.920
to experience this view of the internet?

00:55.920 --> 00:58.640
None other than just threatened Facebook

00:58.640 --> 01:00.120
to give me ADB access.

01:00.120 --> 01:01.160
Just your soul to Facebook.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.680
That's all you have to trade.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.360
They had it anyway.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.400
But you know what?

01:05.400 --> 01:07.000
It's pretty cool.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
My name is Chris.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
My name is Wes.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.000
My name is Brent.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
And my name is Alex.

01:12.000 --> 01:25.000
Hello gentlemen, coming up on the show today,

01:25.000 --> 01:29.520
I have hit my first major snag in the Nyx OS challenge.

01:29.520 --> 01:30.520
Oh no.

01:30.520 --> 01:31.640
We'll check in with the other boys

01:31.640 --> 01:33.640
and see how their Nyx OS challenge is going.

01:33.640 --> 01:37.120
Plus, we've got a fair amount of follow-up on 2204

01:37.120 --> 01:40.560
and a look at the mate flavor of 2204.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.280
Then we'll round out the show with some great booze,

01:42.280 --> 01:43.360
some pics and more.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.320
So before I go any further,

01:45.320 --> 01:48.080
let's say time appropriate greetings to that virtual log.

01:48.080 --> 01:49.280
Hello Mummleroom.

01:49.280 --> 01:50.520
Time appropriate greetings.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.840
Hello, hello, hello JB1.

01:52.840 --> 01:56.800
And for extra fun today, listener Eric is joining us in studio.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.080
He's here for the virtual Linux fest.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.080
Hello Eric.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.080
Hi guys.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.080
Hey, hey there.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.080
Thanks for joining us.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.960
So, you know, we have a few things to talk about today on the show.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.840
There's like a whole lot to cover.

02:07.840 --> 02:11.000
Brent, you're still over at Alex's place doing projects.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
I'm sitting in his desk chair right now.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.520
I think at this point you've proved too useful

02:14.520 --> 02:16.000
to be allowed to leave, right?

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
That's true.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.560
These handcuffs are starting to get a little uncomfortable.

02:18.560 --> 02:20.080
I knew we should have checked on them.

02:20.080 --> 02:21.080
Rescue me?

02:21.080 --> 02:22.080
The other problem is,

02:22.080 --> 02:23.200
the handcuffs gives you slivers.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.200
Not that I would know,

02:24.200 --> 02:26.600
but I'm just saying they give you the slivers.

02:26.600 --> 02:27.600
It's true.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.560
And Wes, today you brought steaks to the studio.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.520
So we're gonna do a little barbecue and after the show.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.720
Yes, on a beautiful Pacific Northwest day like this,

02:33.720 --> 02:34.720
I think we have to.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.200
A little grilling, really, let's be honest.

02:36.200 --> 02:37.400
I brought some chicken.

02:37.400 --> 02:38.720
So we've got some marinated chicken.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.140
We've got some steaks.

02:40.140 --> 02:43.320
It's gonna be a hell of an after party after the show today.

02:43.320 --> 02:46.320
And I've launched a new show this week.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.320
Pretty excited about that,

02:47.320 --> 02:49.560
office hours.hair if you want to check that out.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.160
I'm gonna do another live stream on Tuesday,

02:52.160 --> 02:53.760
this coming Tuesday as we release this.

02:53.760 --> 02:58.640
We'll be doing some sack giveaways to help people charge up their wallets for the podcasting

02:58.640 --> 02:59.640
2.0 boost.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.640
What time are you doing that?

03:00.640 --> 03:03.400
Noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern Westpane.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.860
You know what I want to do after today too is I want to sit down and have a little record

03:06.860 --> 03:15.000
sesh with you and Brent and Alex and chat about our JB summer project plans that we

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
have.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.440
So that kind of stuff I'm gonna feature in office hours.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.900
And I'll have the mobile room going too so if you got any questions for me, pop in there

03:21.900 --> 03:23.280
and ask them.

03:23.280 --> 03:28.800
Personal Matrix stuff, I don't know, JB stuff, show stuff, go ahead and put it in there.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.040
And we'd love to chat.

03:31.040 --> 03:40.360
Also FYI, you got like a few days after this here podcast comes out to register at the

03:40.360 --> 03:41.860
JB Matrix server.

03:41.860 --> 03:44.640
After that we're gonna shut down registration for a while.

03:44.640 --> 03:45.920
And it doesn't mean you can't participate.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.860
You can go still create a free account at matrix.org.

03:48.860 --> 03:57.560
But if you want a Matrix account with a jupyterbroadcasting.com domain, you have got until let's say Wednesday,

03:57.560 --> 04:02.840
Wednesday of April, which would be the 27th, 2022.

04:02.840 --> 04:06.640
If you'd like to have an at Jupiter Broadcasting domain name for your Matrix account, sign

04:06.640 --> 04:10.440
up now because after that we're gonna shut it down because of spam or problems while

04:10.440 --> 04:11.920
we reengineer a few things.

04:11.920 --> 04:16.920
We'll probably eventually open it up one day, maybe, but I'm not guaranteeing that and we

04:16.920 --> 04:18.120
may not either.

04:18.120 --> 04:22.800
So if you want to get in while you still can, we have linuxunplug.com slash matrix and our

04:22.800 --> 04:26.320
Matrix server is colony.jupyterbroadcasting.com.

04:26.320 --> 04:27.320
Limited time only.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.320
I gotta go fast.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.320
That's right.

04:29.320 --> 04:33.340
All right, so let's get into the Ubuntu 2204 leftovers that we have.

04:33.340 --> 04:36.160
There's some really interesting things that landed in this release and everybody's now

04:36.160 --> 04:40.840
finally gotten their hands on it that wants it in that first kind of early window.

04:40.840 --> 04:46.160
And I think this is the one where we're seeing a lot of the work land in GNOME 42 for the

04:46.160 --> 04:48.360
new dark style changes.

04:48.360 --> 04:53.700
And there is a post over at discourse.ubuntu.com that really digs into all of the changes they

04:53.700 --> 04:58.720
had to do and the different implementation details to get this working in 2204.

04:58.720 --> 05:02.280
And so if you're just interested in the kind of plumbing stuff, I want to put that in the

05:02.280 --> 05:04.840
show notes so you can check it out.

05:04.840 --> 05:09.180
But a couple of other things that are in this release that I think are worth mentioning

05:09.180 --> 05:11.360
that we didn't cover last week.

05:11.360 --> 05:14.520
And I think number one for us here on the show, because we've talked about that Mars

05:14.520 --> 05:16.600
copter, that Linux copter so much.

05:16.600 --> 05:17.600
Yeah, we have.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.600
Still going strong, by the way.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.600
Still going strong.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.200
They just hit their one year anniversary.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.320
I sent Tim a congratulations email about it because they're super excited.

05:25.320 --> 05:26.320
It's so great.

05:26.320 --> 05:31.160
And you know, one of the things that Tim told us to make Linux work on that helicopter on

05:31.160 --> 05:34.600
Mars is they had to patch the kernel for real time support.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.980
It's just something they absolutely need.

05:36.980 --> 05:44.040
And so 2204 LTS is actually offering a real time kernel beta that users can install.

05:44.040 --> 05:48.240
Designed to quote, meet telco network transformation needs for 5G.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.440
Hopefully it's also useful for our little Mars copter.

05:51.440 --> 05:58.280
Yeah, you know, maybe not surprising, but real time kernel patches and the preempt RT

05:58.280 --> 06:00.800
stuff can actually be a little controversial in our community.

06:00.800 --> 06:01.800
Surprise, surprise.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.360
It's come a long way.

06:03.360 --> 06:08.120
It's kind of wild to see it get to this level and, you know, finally reach some real integration,

06:08.120 --> 06:12.260
some ongoing maintenance, more widespread use, perhaps.

06:12.260 --> 06:18.640
It was a topic that was discussed within Canonical for many years prior to, you know, actually

06:18.640 --> 06:20.680
shipping as a thing.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.360
What was the big holdup, Wimpy?

06:22.360 --> 06:27.920
The fact that there's a large misconception in the wider world as to what real time actually

06:27.920 --> 06:36.540
means, what the definition of real time means, and, you know, an oversimplistic summary of

06:36.540 --> 06:45.640
that is real time does not mean now, it means within a reproducible latency window.

06:45.640 --> 06:52.960
That's what real time actually means, you know, does it happen within a determinable

06:52.960 --> 06:53.960
window of latency?

06:53.960 --> 06:57.240
Right, you don't want those unbounded spikes that mean your machine didn't respond in time

06:57.240 --> 06:59.040
for some safety critical features, say.

06:59.040 --> 07:00.040
Right.

07:00.040 --> 07:05.640
And, you know, lots of people have, I think there's a lot of placebo effect among enthusiasts

07:05.640 --> 07:12.680
have been using real time kernels for in conjunction with things like Jack, for example, for audio

07:12.680 --> 07:13.680
processing.

07:13.680 --> 07:18.240
And, you know, when well implemented, you know, a real time kernel can play a role there

07:18.240 --> 07:19.240
for sure.

07:19.240 --> 07:25.200
But I think some of it was actually making sure that there were some measurable assurances

07:25.200 --> 07:28.400
around what a real time kernel can deliver.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.400
Fair.

07:29.400 --> 07:34.680
I also wondered if perhaps we're seeing it land now just because in February Intel acquired

07:34.680 --> 07:38.640
the folks behind the real time preempt RT kernel patch stuff.

07:38.640 --> 07:39.640
Linutronics.

07:39.640 --> 07:40.640
Yeah, Linutronics.

07:40.640 --> 07:43.000
And now it's an Intel outfit.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.920
Maybe Canonical already has a better relationship there.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.600
I mean, maybe that made things a little easier.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.600
Is that just wild speculation you think Wimpy?

07:48.600 --> 07:55.000
I've not been part of those discussions, so it would be wild speculation on my part.

07:55.000 --> 08:02.000
I got I got a real spicy matrix message this morning that was quite upset because the user

08:02.000 --> 08:08.160
had just finally made the leap to the 2204 LTS and they discovered that the Firefox package

08:08.160 --> 08:10.920
has been replaced as a snap now.

08:10.920 --> 08:14.040
And they also discovered that when they install certain things from the command line, even

08:14.040 --> 08:18.320
though they did an apt install for a dead package, they end up getting the snap.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.520
And they were they were quite upset about this.

08:21.520 --> 08:25.900
And this is something that we've talked about before on the show, but just to remind people

08:25.900 --> 08:30.040
that, yes, there are certain packages now that are snap packages in here.

08:30.040 --> 08:34.560
And that is not necessarily because Canonical just wants to make everything a snap.

08:34.560 --> 08:37.640
In the case of Firefox, this is something that Canonical and Mozilla had to work out

08:37.640 --> 08:39.240
at Mozilla's request.

08:39.240 --> 08:42.880
There's other things in here that are snaps that you wouldn't expect, like the UFW firewall

08:42.880 --> 08:47.440
is also a snap in 2204, which is pretty surprising, but it makes you wonder if maybe that means

08:47.440 --> 08:51.860
they could update individual sub components of the Ubuntu 2204 system without having to

08:51.860 --> 08:54.520
update all of the packages on the system.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.460
So it'll be interesting to see where that goes.

08:56.460 --> 09:01.200
But our buddy Popeye has released unsnap, which I will mention on the show, which is

09:01.200 --> 09:06.400
essentially a fancy script to help you migrate from snaps to something else.

09:06.400 --> 09:12.240
And I mention this because I think this is this is probably the way it's going to be

09:12.240 --> 09:15.600
for a while, is there's going to be more and more things that are snaps just simply because

09:15.600 --> 09:19.160
that makes it simpler to maintain across multiple versions of Ubuntu.

09:19.160 --> 09:23.640
In some cases, it means it can be maintained directly by the software creator themselves.

09:23.640 --> 09:28.840
And for most users out there, the quote unquote average users that are using Ubuntu, they're

09:28.840 --> 09:30.760
not really going to care much.

09:30.760 --> 09:34.320
But for the people that understand what a snap is or have an opinion, there's going

09:34.320 --> 09:38.080
to be community solutions like this unsnap script that Popeye has created.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.160
UFW is not exclusively a snap.

09:41.160 --> 09:49.320
Like it is available as a snap, but it's not shipped as a snap by default in Ubuntu 22.04.

09:49.320 --> 09:53.080
It's still a deb that's in the standard base system.

09:53.080 --> 09:58.400
So I'm curious where that commentary comes from.

09:58.400 --> 10:02.300
And yes, Popeye did make unsnap.

10:02.300 --> 10:11.400
And if I may be so bold, I have a project called get deb, which is apt get functionality

10:11.400 --> 10:19.800
for installing deb packages that reside outside of the Ubuntu app repository ecosystem.

10:19.800 --> 10:23.320
I will paste a link to that.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.320
It's brand new.

10:24.320 --> 10:25.320
It's super fresh.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.840
I've only I've only published it like a couple of days ago.

10:28.840 --> 10:34.240
But it means that you can install things, for example, that only exist in GitHub releases

10:34.240 --> 10:39.700
pages, for example, and other third party app repositories.

10:39.700 --> 10:46.240
So it's a very handy way to get software that is only available via deb from other means.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.240
Yeah, that's great.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.680
Because I imagine a lot of people that are moving away from snaps probably would prefer

10:49.680 --> 10:50.680
the deb.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.680
As far as UFW, I didn't mean to imply that it was the default way it's configured.

10:53.680 --> 10:57.120
I just mean that there's a lot there's a lot of components you wouldn't expect can actually

10:57.120 --> 10:58.120
be snaps.

10:58.120 --> 11:02.280
In fact, very core components of the OS can actually be snaps.

11:02.280 --> 11:06.520
And I think Mark Shuttleworth recently made comments about flat packs and snaps.

11:06.520 --> 11:10.960
And I think when you parse what Shuttleworth was saying, he's implying that snaps have

11:10.960 --> 11:13.000
functionality that flat packs do not have.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.440
And I think this is kind of one of the things he's talking about is these individual sub

11:16.440 --> 11:20.840
components of the Ubuntu operating system, or distribution can be replaced with snaps

11:20.840 --> 11:24.840
that traditionally flat packs I don't think could replace, which is an interesting idea,

11:24.840 --> 11:25.840
right?

11:25.840 --> 11:31.440
You could have a 2204 LTS, and then have these individual sub components of the distribution

11:31.440 --> 11:34.960
updated independently of all of the other deb packages on the system, which I could

11:34.960 --> 11:37.960
see being compelling for some people that are into that.

11:37.960 --> 11:38.960
Yeah.

11:38.960 --> 11:39.960
And I think that's accurate.

11:39.960 --> 11:46.040
And that's been accurate for a couple of Ubuntu releases now that, you know, you can get applications

11:46.040 --> 11:55.160
as snaps, and they basically they're rolling applications on top of a stable Ubuntu base.

11:55.160 --> 12:00.360
And that's been the case since, well, it was first introduced in 1604, but it wasn't fully

12:00.360 --> 12:06.920
baked then, I think it's fair to say, but certainly by 1804, it was, and that's a means

12:06.920 --> 12:10.320
by which, you know, you can get those applications.

12:10.320 --> 12:17.480
And I think, you know, Mark's comments about the security, particularly the security capabilities

12:17.480 --> 12:25.360
around snaps stands up, like, you know, there are particularly that story resonates with

12:25.360 --> 12:26.360
IoT vendors.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.040
Yeah, if you have app armor, it stands up, I agree.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.040
Yeah.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.600
Yeah, that's the kind of the critical piece is the the snap security stories best with

12:33.600 --> 12:36.120
a system that is fully app armor compatible, right?

12:36.120 --> 12:40.600
And so it's a nuanced thing, really, I mean, I'm splitting hairs at that point.

12:40.600 --> 12:44.060
But you know, the feedback I got this morning, that kind of brought this whole conversation

12:44.060 --> 12:50.080
up was sort of the shock that there had been this transition to the snaps.

12:50.080 --> 12:55.600
And I think it really underscores that a huge majority of the Ubuntu user base is on these

12:55.600 --> 12:56.600
LTSs.

12:56.600 --> 13:00.960
And they don't even bother with the interns, because if they've been trying the interns,

13:00.960 --> 13:02.880
they would have known this was coming.

13:02.880 --> 13:06.320
Because we talked about it in our reviews of the interim releases.

13:06.320 --> 13:12.280
And it's not even that they're not on the interims, but they are not actively engaged

13:12.280 --> 13:17.160
in the news around Ubuntu itself.

13:17.160 --> 13:21.840
Because otherwise, they would have been well aware that this change was coming because

13:21.840 --> 13:24.800
it was made in the last release.

13:24.800 --> 13:29.080
And we did notice there's a couple of after release things to adjust.

13:29.080 --> 13:33.640
I think probably the most well important, not surprising, surprising would be the wrong

13:33.640 --> 13:34.920
descriptor.

13:34.920 --> 13:41.080
But Nvidia has requested the canonical roll back to using Xorg rather than Wayland when

13:41.080 --> 13:43.400
the proprietary driver is loaded.

13:43.400 --> 13:47.580
So hybrid users are still fine, Intel users, AMD users, you're all getting Wayland.

13:47.580 --> 13:51.680
But if you have the proprietary Nvidia driver, and that's your primary video card, Nvidia

13:51.680 --> 13:53.240
asked them to roll that back.

13:53.240 --> 13:54.240
Hmm.

13:54.240 --> 13:55.240
Yeah.

13:55.240 --> 13:56.240
What is that about?

13:56.240 --> 14:00.760
You and I have been, Wes and I have been following a lot of interesting Nvidia Linux related

14:00.760 --> 14:02.920
trends on Linux Action News.

14:02.920 --> 14:04.880
This almost feels like it's fitting into that.

14:04.880 --> 14:09.360
I mean, I don't buy that Nvidia downloaded the beta and did some testing beyond maybe

14:09.360 --> 14:10.600
a couple of people doing it.

14:10.600 --> 14:11.600
Maybe it happens.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.600
And if anybody was going to do it, it would probably be Nvidia.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.760
But most of these companies, most of these commercial companies, despite how much it

14:18.760 --> 14:22.540
would benefit them and how much hassle it would save them and how much user frustration

14:22.540 --> 14:27.720
it would save them, most of them can't be bothered to even begin the testing phase until

14:27.720 --> 14:31.720
sometimes multiple months after the primary release is out.

14:31.720 --> 14:36.160
And so I find it odd that Nvidia has made this request of canonical.

14:36.160 --> 14:40.240
And I wonder if there isn't another shoe to drop, like perhaps some other explanation

14:40.240 --> 14:42.480
for this is yet forthcoming.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.480
We shall see.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.720
But that's a bit interesting.

14:45.720 --> 14:50.360
And also 3D acceleration for guests in VMs with GNOME boxes has been and vert manager

14:50.360 --> 14:52.380
has been disabled, which is a shame.

14:52.380 --> 14:53.380
That's a bit of a bummer.

14:53.380 --> 14:54.880
But it is what it is.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.960
And it really probably deserves to be tested on hardware anyways.

14:57.960 --> 15:01.640
And you know, when you've got an LTS coming out, I get it like these things are going

15:01.640 --> 15:03.440
to perhaps stick around for a while.

15:03.440 --> 15:05.680
So you do want to be a little bit careful.

15:05.680 --> 15:06.680
Yeah.

15:06.680 --> 15:11.920
I mean, I wonder if that's sort of commercially motivated that there are solutions that, you

15:11.920 --> 15:17.840
know, provide those capabilities outside of open source solutions and that, you know,

15:17.840 --> 15:24.280
Nvidia may be supporting their partners in in their endeavors on that front is wild speculation.

15:24.280 --> 15:25.280
I do not know.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.280
It is wild speculation.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.760
I'm bringing that proper British bacon to us.

15:29.760 --> 15:30.760
I love it.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.760
Tasty bacon.

15:31.760 --> 15:35.640
So let's talk about Ubuntu Mate Wimpy because I'm running it right here on the live stream.

15:35.640 --> 15:38.440
And I'm showing it to the people that are here live today.

15:38.440 --> 15:41.440
And this feels like a real refined release.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.120
The theming is just on absolute point.

15:44.120 --> 15:47.460
Of course, it's based on the 2204 base.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.160
This is like a one of the feels like one of those Mate releases that you could install

15:50.160 --> 15:51.920
on a machine and just use it for three years.

15:51.920 --> 15:52.920
Yeah.

15:52.920 --> 15:53.920
Well, thank you.

15:53.920 --> 16:00.080
That's kind of kind of where I was headed with this and and the rest of the team of,

16:00.080 --> 16:06.960
you know, been supporting the development of Ubuntu Mate over the last two years.

16:06.960 --> 16:14.360
But yes, you know, I consider myself now an intrinsic part of the Yuru team.

16:14.360 --> 16:20.640
I was first acquainted with them as a result of putting together, you know, a sprint when

16:20.640 --> 16:28.440
I worked at Canonical when I was leading the Ubuntu desktop team, and we sort of reinvigorated

16:28.440 --> 16:32.760
the significance of Yuru within the Ubuntu project.

16:32.760 --> 16:39.480
And ever since then, I've been, you know, a contributing member of that team, and I've

16:39.480 --> 16:45.680
worked very hard to make sure that all of the good work they've been doing for Ubuntu

16:45.680 --> 16:51.000
and GNOME was reflected in Ubuntu Mate in this release.

16:51.000 --> 16:58.360
And so that's why there's a very firm commitment behind making the Yuru themes front and

16:58.360 --> 17:00.680
center in this release.

17:00.680 --> 17:07.040
So I've been thinking about loading this on my Pi 400 as sort of my standby, always ready

17:07.040 --> 17:08.600
workstation machine.

17:08.600 --> 17:14.360
And I'm wondering if with 2204, is it the case that we're refining the experience and

17:14.360 --> 17:18.280
we're eking more and more performance out of these types of devices, or have we kind

17:18.280 --> 17:21.400
of hit the wall and it's going to be kind of the same as it was for the last couple

17:21.400 --> 17:22.400
of releases?

17:22.400 --> 17:23.400
What are your thoughts?

17:23.400 --> 17:28.520
Again, my information is a little bit out of date, but I can tell you what I know of

17:28.520 --> 17:34.760
the relationship as was between the Raspberry Pi Foundation, or specifically the Raspberry

17:34.760 --> 17:43.240
Pi trading organization and Canonical, which was Raspberry Pi trading and their engineers

17:43.240 --> 17:52.320
were working towards supporting what we would consider the contemporary APIs in the Linux

17:52.320 --> 17:59.640
ecosystem for exposing GPUs, GPU acceleration and cameras.

17:59.640 --> 18:07.080
So you know, traditionally, those are exposed through proprietary APIs and wrappers and

18:07.080 --> 18:08.080
shims.

18:08.080 --> 18:12.840
And they've been moving ever closer to using, you know, the things that we recognize, you

18:12.840 --> 18:19.240
know, drive three, video for Linux, and so on and so forth.

18:19.240 --> 18:25.600
And I think what you're seeing with this release is not just that relationship between Canonical

18:25.600 --> 18:31.280
and the Raspberry Pi Foundation bearing fruit, but the Raspberry Pi Foundation, you know,

18:31.280 --> 18:35.520
following through on their commitment to support those open standards.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.520
I like it, though.

18:36.520 --> 18:39.320
It is nice to see it slowly but steadily get better there.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.320
Absolutely.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.800
So we talked about the artwork.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.880
The AI generated wallpapers have been getting a lot of attention in our audience.

18:44.880 --> 18:48.040
That's what I've been seeing people talk about in our chat rooms.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.920
But I think also the significant thing in here is a pretty solid version of MATE itself,

18:51.920 --> 18:52.920
right?

18:52.920 --> 18:53.920
Yeah.

18:53.920 --> 19:00.080
You know, it's interesting what's happening upstream in MATE Desktop itself, in that the

19:00.080 --> 19:05.400
last sort of two releases, and I can see this when I go and look in.

19:05.400 --> 19:10.880
So there's a service in Ubuntu called errors.ubuntu.com.

19:10.880 --> 19:14.520
You know, when you get those pop ups that says something crashed, blah, blah, blah,

19:14.520 --> 19:16.440
do you want to submit these results?

19:16.440 --> 19:17.440
That's where they go.

19:17.440 --> 19:25.240
And what I'm seeing is the good work that's happening in upstream MATE Desktop to find

19:25.240 --> 19:35.660
and resolve use after free bugs or memory leaks and things of that nature, a number

19:35.660 --> 19:42.960
of those bugs you just see drop off a cliff as you move between like 1804 to where we

19:42.960 --> 19:44.440
are now.

19:44.440 --> 19:52.720
So yes, MATE Desktop in of itself is now looking extremely robust.

19:52.720 --> 19:59.360
And that's not to say the code base that we inherited when it was forked from GNOME 2

19:59.360 --> 20:02.480
was in some way substandard.

20:02.480 --> 20:11.800
You need to remember that that code base was refactored from GTK2 to GTK3 and a whole bunch

20:11.800 --> 20:20.800
of different underlying technologies in order to keep it contemporary and up to date.

20:20.800 --> 20:25.640
And those initial ports were functional, but maybe a little bit rough.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.600
And now we're seeing a refinement of that work.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.600
We sure are.

20:29.600 --> 20:34.440
And it is really noticeable just almost immediately when you fire it up.

20:34.440 --> 20:37.880
So I also kind of want to talk about something that touches on a previous conversation we

20:37.880 --> 20:39.920
just had in the show.

20:39.920 --> 20:44.720
And I want to talk about this from a couple of angles, but it seems like you're cautiously

20:44.720 --> 20:49.320
setting up Ubuntu MATE to be a bit of Switzerland when it comes to packaging.

20:49.320 --> 20:50.880
If users want to use DEBS, fine.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.600
If you want to use a SNAP, fine.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.080
If you want to use a flat pack, fine.

20:55.080 --> 20:57.640
And I feel like that part's a little bit new.

20:57.640 --> 21:00.480
Is that controversial for a flavor to do?

21:00.480 --> 21:02.320
And could you just share some of your thoughts there?

21:02.320 --> 21:03.320
Yeah, sure.

21:03.320 --> 21:09.900
So I will say, I'll prefix this by saying your friend of mine, Joe Ressington, I record

21:09.900 --> 21:16.360
it a podcast with him and Adam earlier this week, which is out now called Linux Downtime.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.760
It's episode 45.

21:18.760 --> 21:23.800
And we dig into the whole, how do you make a distro?

21:23.800 --> 21:26.560
What is involved in making a distribution?

21:26.560 --> 21:27.560
All about.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.340
And we dig into that in more detail.

21:29.340 --> 21:35.600
So that's definitely sort of, you know, homework for listeners to go and have a listen to that.

21:35.600 --> 21:44.360
But on that particular point, this wasn't my individual decision to include flat pack

21:44.360 --> 21:46.360
support in Ubuntu MATE.

21:46.360 --> 21:53.840
In fact, I sent out a tweet earlier today from the Ubuntu MATE account, sort of poking

21:53.840 --> 21:56.240
fun at the very idea.

21:56.240 --> 22:02.280
But it came from the core team, the rest of the team that helped support and make Ubuntu

22:02.280 --> 22:09.360
MATE said to me some weeks ago, well, months ago, in fact, we should include flat pack

22:09.360 --> 22:12.400
support in Ubuntu MATE.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.200
My initial response was, well, I think that's going to be complicated.

22:16.200 --> 22:20.360
It's going to have all sorts of, you know, dependency collisions.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.840
I'm not sure that's viable.

22:21.840 --> 22:27.160
But when I actually looked into it, it was, as I said in the tweet earlier, it was super

22:27.160 --> 22:30.840
simple, barely an inconvenience.

22:30.840 --> 22:37.440
So, you know, steered by that impetus from the team around me, I implemented it, you

22:37.440 --> 22:43.920
know, I did the due diligence around it, made sure that that was a safe technical decision.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.240
And we delivered that.

22:46.240 --> 22:54.720
But that's kind of the expression of Ubuntu MATE as what it's always been, which is really

22:54.720 --> 23:02.920
Ubuntu MATE is a utilitarian distribution, you know, you can make it into the thing you

23:02.920 --> 23:10.880
want it to be, we don't want to overly constrain the options that are available to the people

23:10.880 --> 23:12.640
that use it.

23:12.640 --> 23:20.240
And by making every contemporary packaging format available in Ubuntu, an option for

23:20.240 --> 23:27.320
our users was, you know, in keeping with that, you know, original goal of the project that

23:27.320 --> 23:30.160
we outlined eight or nine years ago.

23:30.160 --> 23:36.300
I like that way of thinking about it, because it often was you turn to a flavor or a derivative

23:36.300 --> 23:41.480
that maybe wasn't an official flavor to get some of the things that maybe Canonical couldn't

23:41.480 --> 23:42.480
bundle, right?

23:42.480 --> 23:48.020
Maybe it used to be codecs, or maybe it was even a kernel with CFS by default.

23:48.020 --> 23:51.280
And that's always been a role out there that these other distributions have served for

23:51.280 --> 23:53.520
the audience that wants that.

23:53.520 --> 23:59.120
And you're right, it is just that only now instead of the MP3 codec, it's Flatpak.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.120
Right.

24:00.120 --> 24:06.240
And you know, you need to understand that, you know, the Ubuntu project is made up of

24:06.240 --> 24:09.560
the significant effort that Canonical put into it.

24:09.560 --> 24:16.280
And again, this is something that I outline in Linux downtime, definitely have a listen.

24:16.280 --> 24:26.000
But more so the different flavors of Ubuntu, we all agree that Ubuntu is a fantastic platform

24:26.000 --> 24:30.320
to develop on and innovate on.

24:30.320 --> 24:40.720
And where we respectfully disagree is how that Linux desktop experience should be presented.

24:40.720 --> 24:48.960
But we are all working together in order to deliver that Linux desktop experience, regardless

24:48.960 --> 24:53.980
of our differences of opinions about how we think that that should be done.

24:53.980 --> 24:58.040
And there's an enormous amount of crossover, you know, especially now, you know, you look

24:58.040 --> 25:05.520
at Ubuntu MATE and Xubuntu, there's a significant proportion of Ubuntu MATE that's delivered

25:05.520 --> 25:07.760
via the Xubuntu desktop.

25:07.760 --> 25:13.600
You look at Ubuntu Chilin, and again, a lot of the underpinnings of Ubuntu Chilin come

25:13.600 --> 25:16.320
from Ubuntu MATE.

25:16.320 --> 25:23.080
And that kind of reciprocal collaboration exists throughout the flavors.

25:23.080 --> 25:30.220
And it's not competition, it's very much a collaborative, you know, feel that happens

25:30.220 --> 25:37.400
between the developers and the development communities around those flavors.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.200
Linode.com slash unplugged.

25:39.200 --> 25:43.600
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, and you go there to support the

25:43.600 --> 25:44.600
show.

25:44.600 --> 25:45.600
I mean, that's really how this works, right?

25:45.600 --> 25:49.080
It lets you know, it lets the sponsor know that you heard about it here.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.960
So that's what the URL is for, it's linode.com slash unplugged.

25:51.960 --> 25:54.840
And it's one we can enthusiastically endorse.

25:54.840 --> 25:58.080
Linode started in 2003, it's one of the very first companies in cloud computing because

25:58.080 --> 26:00.320
they just saw what Linux could do.

26:00.320 --> 26:02.040
And then they built a business around that.

26:02.040 --> 26:06.440
19 years later, they have the absolute best business in the space.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.880
They make cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible to all.

26:09.880 --> 26:14.140
And they've just rolled out Ubuntu 2204 support.

26:14.140 --> 26:15.140
So they have that up there.

26:15.140 --> 26:18.440
Now if you want to go try it out and play with it, go create a go create a system.

26:18.440 --> 26:20.520
That sounds like a great new server to play with.

26:20.520 --> 26:21.520
Absolutely.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.520
Right.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.520
And you get $100 to do it when you go to linode.com slash unplugged.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.320
You know, they also have all the other districts you probably want to try.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.280
It's pretty impressive, actually.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.680
But I mean, now is the season of Ubuntu 2204, right?

26:32.680 --> 26:37.160
So go experiment with one of their one click deployments, get an entire server in one stack

26:37.160 --> 26:39.200
or go build something up yourself.

26:39.200 --> 26:42.680
And if you ever get stuck, the audience tells me I've never actually had to use the support

26:42.680 --> 26:44.700
as far as oh, no, that's not true.

26:44.700 --> 26:45.700
Just once recently.

26:45.700 --> 26:46.700
That's right.

26:46.700 --> 26:48.520
I know it actually was a great experience.

26:48.520 --> 26:52.020
I had my first after a couple like two and a half years, I finally had like my first

26:52.020 --> 26:53.420
Linode support experience.

26:53.420 --> 26:55.920
And it was as good as all of the audience is always telling me.

26:55.920 --> 27:00.480
Now we use the heck out of things like their S3 compatible object storage, cloud firewalls,

27:00.480 --> 27:04.760
DDoS protection and VLAN support for some fanciness that Westpain gets into every now

27:04.760 --> 27:05.760
and then.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.640
Most of the time, though, I'm just muddling my way through trying to keep the DNS working.

27:08.640 --> 27:12.680
And thankfully, they have a powerful DNS manager that lets you do all of that.

27:12.680 --> 27:16.000
And with pricing 30 to 50 percent cheaper than those major hyperscalers, they have these

27:16.000 --> 27:20.880
esoteric platforms and these crazy UIs where they just want to lock you in forever.

27:20.880 --> 27:25.520
Unlike them, they got great pricing and they'll scale for something you want for yourself.

27:25.520 --> 27:29.600
Like maybe maybe you want to go set yourself up a GitLab instance now that they're getting

27:29.600 --> 27:32.800
a little bit grabsy with the user count there.

27:32.800 --> 27:33.800
Could be a good opportunity.

27:33.800 --> 27:34.800
Yeah, right.

27:34.800 --> 27:35.800
It really does.

27:35.800 --> 27:36.800
You can use it for personal things.

27:36.800 --> 27:37.800
You can use it for your small business things.

27:37.800 --> 27:41.240
Or I mean, if you get more successful than that, Linode will be there right there with

27:41.240 --> 27:42.240
you.

27:42.240 --> 27:43.240
Scales right up.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.240
And it does just a great job.

27:44.240 --> 27:46.360
And they're always there to help you out if you ever need it.

27:46.360 --> 27:50.040
That's why you got to go check it out for yourself and take advantage of that $100.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.160
It's just the perfect opportunity.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.720
They're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud computing.

27:54.720 --> 27:57.760
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

28:05.560 --> 28:09.200
That's linode.com slash unplugged.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.820
All right.

28:11.820 --> 28:16.800
Now that we've talked about Ubuntu, we're going to talk about NixOS, which is actually

28:16.800 --> 28:17.800
Wimpy's fault.

28:17.800 --> 28:22.560
I think it was when Wimpy came on here weeks ago, a couple of months ago, and he's like,

28:22.560 --> 28:23.760
you got to look at NixOS.

28:23.760 --> 28:24.760
It's the future.

28:24.760 --> 28:25.760
You're welcome.

28:25.760 --> 28:26.760
And made me think about it again.

28:26.760 --> 28:27.760
Really?

28:27.760 --> 28:28.760
I know I respect your opinion, Wimpy.

28:28.760 --> 28:30.320
When you say like, this is really something I'm noticing.

28:30.320 --> 28:34.560
I thought, you know, I've had a lot of people tell me it, but Wimpy's on here and he really

28:34.560 --> 28:36.000
sounds convinced.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.080
That's why you keep handing me that Mate ISO.

28:38.080 --> 28:39.080
I was wondering.

28:39.080 --> 28:41.480
I should have tried Nix packaging on Mate.

28:41.480 --> 28:46.040
If I wasn't making Ubuntu Mate, I'd be building a desktop around this NixOS.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.040
Really?

28:47.040 --> 28:48.040
A desktop?

28:48.040 --> 28:49.040
Oh, for sure.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.040
Yeah.

28:50.040 --> 28:51.040
Why?

28:51.040 --> 28:58.360
Because NixOS is the best expression of where the Linux desktop and that intersection of

28:58.360 --> 29:02.120
the desktop and container technologies exist right now.

29:02.120 --> 29:03.800
I can see where you're coming from.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.320
I've been very impressed.

29:05.320 --> 29:10.520
However, I did hit my first like, oh, maybe Nix isn't the right choice for this snag.

29:10.520 --> 29:13.400
And I kind of am a little demotivated and discouraged.

29:13.400 --> 29:14.520
I'll tell you guys about that.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.880
But Wes, I'm curious, I know you've been doing a lot of reading recently about Nix, kind

29:17.880 --> 29:19.400
of getting into the backstory about Nix.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.320
Like, where are you at right now with the challenge?

29:21.320 --> 29:25.840
Yeah, you know, I haven't switched everything over to Nix, let's say, but I've been having

29:25.840 --> 29:30.080
fun just kind of poking around the various places because there's a lot to play with.

29:30.080 --> 29:33.680
I was looking at like trying to understand where flakes are going to fit in a little

29:33.680 --> 29:34.680
bit better.

29:34.680 --> 29:37.780
I was also playing with Home Manager a little bit.

29:37.780 --> 29:42.440
And then I've also been poking around just in my dev side of my life, like, well, yeah,

29:42.440 --> 29:44.160
because, you know, Nix is a build system.

29:44.160 --> 29:45.420
So where does it fit there?

29:45.420 --> 29:50.780
So I was playing with Poetry to Nix, which Poetry is a cool new dependency manager for

29:50.780 --> 29:55.020
Python to help you set up and build and maintain Python projects.

29:55.020 --> 29:59.100
And because it's quite declarative itself, there's some neat wrappers that can help you

29:59.100 --> 30:01.960
just like take your Python project, get it all building with Nix.

30:01.960 --> 30:05.520
And then once you've got it into Nix, you kind of like lift it up and then all the facilities

30:05.520 --> 30:09.960
that Nix has for building you a VM image or just building a nice, really clean little

30:09.960 --> 30:13.380
Python Docker image for you, it can just take that.

30:13.380 --> 30:14.380
So that's been fun.

30:14.380 --> 30:20.480
And just recently, someone made CLJ Nix, which is some Nix helpers for Clojure projects,

30:20.480 --> 30:23.240
which is really in the same vein, but even more niche.

30:23.240 --> 30:26.560
So it was right up my alley, I had to dive right in.

30:26.560 --> 30:31.360
And then just to keep down that track, I don't know how you say it, but there's a version

30:31.360 --> 30:40.160
OS inspired by Nix, Geeks, I think, GNU Geeks, it's quite similar to Nix, except the syntax

30:40.160 --> 30:41.160
is Lisp.

30:41.160 --> 30:42.160
So it's even better somehow.

30:42.160 --> 30:45.520
Now, it's a GNU project, so it's a little more limited.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.800
It's in the GNU ecosystem.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.900
The packages that it has are all free software.

30:49.900 --> 30:54.280
So I don't think I would actually, even though I love anything Lisp, really, I don't think

30:54.280 --> 30:55.520
that I would do it.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.600
But they have been celebrating like 10 years, I think, of the project recently.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.760
So we've got a link in the show notes if you want to hear about some of the stories behind

31:01.760 --> 31:03.680
what it takes to make a project like that.

31:03.680 --> 31:05.400
Yeah, that is really neat.

31:05.400 --> 31:09.240
Okay, so this poetry stuff looks absolutely fantastic.

31:09.240 --> 31:11.760
Link to all of that in the notes.

31:11.760 --> 31:12.760
That's great.

31:12.760 --> 31:19.080
Now, I know, Brent, I know that you had some time recently to play around with Nix on a

31:19.080 --> 31:21.560
Raspberry Pi, which is the direction I want to take this.

31:21.560 --> 31:25.720
I'm curious how your Nix OS challenge is going so far and what your experience has been.

31:25.720 --> 31:30.920
Yeah, I was able to, if you remember last time, use a VM to run a desktop and such.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.460
So I had a good time there.

31:33.460 --> 31:39.140
But I figured I would try, this entire month has been trying to convince Alex that maybe

31:39.140 --> 31:45.720
there's something to Nix, so recently he and I both jumped on a Raspberry Pi to get things

31:45.720 --> 31:46.720
going.

31:46.720 --> 31:51.400
That was a nice opportunity to get me working on a Raspberry Pi for the very first time.

31:51.400 --> 31:55.920
So wait, wait, so this is your first Pi and I think you said you guys are tag teaming

31:55.920 --> 31:56.920
that?

31:56.920 --> 31:57.920
How did this work?

31:57.920 --> 31:59.080
Let's hear a little bit more about that.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.720
Well, we had to cut the Pi in half, you see.

32:01.720 --> 32:05.800
No, Alex has a drawer of trinkets here and there are many Pis there.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.960
So we figured we would get one set up.

32:07.960 --> 32:13.000
He's got a nice corner here that's like dedicated to Pi playing with.

32:13.000 --> 32:17.680
So he let me sort of wipe the system on there and just have a go at it.

32:17.680 --> 32:21.460
And I thought that would be a great way to experience the Pi for the first time.

32:21.460 --> 32:24.400
We ended up sharing a team up session for a little while too.

32:24.400 --> 32:28.680
So we could both SSH in from our laptops and sit comfortably rather than hunching over

32:28.680 --> 32:29.680
the same screen.

32:29.680 --> 32:30.680
Nice.

32:30.680 --> 32:31.680
Which was a nice trick.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.680
That is a good way to do it.

32:32.680 --> 32:33.680
Like gentlemen.

32:33.680 --> 32:36.160
I assume Brent was already in the recliner and just didn't want to get up.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.160
That was your solution.

32:37.160 --> 32:38.160
That was my spot.

32:38.160 --> 32:42.320
That's exactly where he's sitting now.

32:42.320 --> 32:43.760
So what was the experience like on Raspberry Pi?

32:43.760 --> 32:44.760
Is the performance OK?

32:44.760 --> 32:45.840
How did all of that operate?

32:45.840 --> 32:47.280
I was very impressed.

32:47.280 --> 32:54.440
The memory footprint of a freshly booted Raspberry Pi is 100 meg or so on Nixos.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.440
127.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.080
That was with Tailscale and Docker services running.

32:58.080 --> 33:02.760
So I'm subtracting a little just for those as a guess.

33:02.760 --> 33:08.360
But we got to the end of the evenings messing about and I said to Brent, which USB stick

33:08.360 --> 33:09.360
did you use?

33:09.360 --> 33:11.240
And he was like, I didn't.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.240
I used an SD card.

33:13.240 --> 33:14.240
I didn't know better.

33:14.240 --> 33:18.160
Oh, so the performance was better than you expected, I take it, if you didn't notice.

33:18.160 --> 33:23.440
Compared to what I'm used to with like apt install, whatever, and how long apt takes

33:23.440 --> 33:28.640
to do what it does on Raspberry Pi OS and Ubuntu, which is what I'm familiar with.

33:28.640 --> 33:36.640
The Nixos rebuild switch command took about, I don't know, 20 seconds, 25 seconds each

33:36.640 --> 33:37.640
time.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.640
Yeah.

33:38.640 --> 33:41.840
Which gets a little laborious when you're making a one line config change.

33:41.840 --> 33:47.960
But overall, we were left with what a 40 line configuration file which declared the entire

33:47.960 --> 33:48.960
system.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.280
It's very elegant, I've got to say.

33:51.280 --> 33:54.360
And I know Brent said a few minutes ago, he's been trying to convince me.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.220
And there was a few light bulbs went on last night.

33:56.220 --> 34:00.160
And I remember feeling that way about Docker about eight years ago.

34:00.160 --> 34:06.920
I remember a specific moment, Alex, where you got quite excited while we defined Docker

34:06.920 --> 34:07.920
virtualization.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.240
Yes, I did.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.600
Because they spell virtualization correctly.

34:11.600 --> 34:15.720
We tried to spell virtualization with a Z, and it didn't work.

34:15.720 --> 34:19.800
And then I read the documentation properly, and it spelled it with an S. And I was like,

34:19.800 --> 34:20.800
hey, British.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.280
Well, Europeans is what they are.

34:23.280 --> 34:31.120
I think that's a really astute observation, though, about the Docker experience on Nix.

34:31.120 --> 34:39.840
Because in my experience, what I do now is very much entrenched in the container ecosystem.

34:39.840 --> 34:46.920
And I am increasingly finding industries, people, and organizations that are deeply

34:46.920 --> 34:55.800
invested in producing, developing, working on containers on a daily basis that are not

34:55.800 --> 35:05.160
desktop Linux nerds, but that are absolute advocates for Nix and NixOS as the platform

35:05.160 --> 35:11.240
where they curate, develop, and produce their production containers.

35:11.240 --> 35:13.000
It's not perfect, though.

35:13.000 --> 35:17.120
For example, why are there three manuals for NixOS?

35:17.120 --> 35:18.200
I found that as well.

35:18.200 --> 35:23.360
The documentation can be a bit almost too complete, but spread out in a bunch of different

35:23.360 --> 35:24.360
places.

35:24.360 --> 35:27.160
So that can, I don't know, eat up a little bit of time and frustration, but once you

35:27.160 --> 35:28.160
get it.

35:28.160 --> 35:31.960
And quite contradictory, sometimes even the same Wiki page contradicts itself with a little

35:31.960 --> 35:37.440
headline saying, this bit's out of date, when three lines above is the actual correct answer.

35:37.440 --> 35:38.620
That can be quite confusing.

35:38.620 --> 35:41.040
I think that's fair observation, right?

35:41.040 --> 35:49.560
And for everything that I see as potential with NixOS, I'm going to try and frame this

35:49.560 --> 35:52.280
in a way that isn't too incendiary.

35:52.280 --> 36:01.840
But if you think about Debian as being a project, Ubuntu was very much the product, right?

36:01.840 --> 36:09.460
So it took all of the best bits of Debian and productized it, which is why Ubuntu sort

36:09.460 --> 36:12.920
of soared to success.

36:12.920 --> 36:22.560
And I'm not advocating for somebody to create a derivative of NixOS in order to turn what

36:22.560 --> 36:30.120
is an extremely interesting and high potential project into a product.

36:30.120 --> 36:39.120
But I would absolutely love to see the shoulder of the community behind NixOS as it is now

36:39.120 --> 36:46.000
to turn it from exciting project to viable product.

36:46.000 --> 36:51.380
Wimby, what you just said, you put exact words to my thought process here.

36:51.380 --> 36:55.960
In my experience of using Linux distributions, this is very much in like the proto-Debian

36:55.960 --> 36:56.960
stage.

36:56.960 --> 37:01.920
I recognize it's been around for a decade, but it clearly would benefit from a canonical

37:01.920 --> 37:05.960
type organization coming along and making a product out of this thing.

37:05.960 --> 37:06.960
Maybe it's not for that.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.640
It's for people who want to build infrastructure, and maybe that makes sense.

37:09.640 --> 37:13.040
But I am honestly surprised nobody's given a go at it, or if they have, I just haven't

37:13.040 --> 37:14.040
found it yet.

37:14.040 --> 37:24.880
And I agree, but I would dearly love for us to learn from our Linux past and not be the

37:24.880 --> 37:36.360
Manjaro to Arch or the Ubuntu to Debian and just invest in what is NixOS now and get buy-in

37:36.360 --> 37:42.240
and help that existing vibrant community to be more successful.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.600
Yeah, right.

37:43.600 --> 37:44.600
That is the way to do it now.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.500
In 2022, that's the way to do it.

37:46.500 --> 37:47.600
That's the way you got to do it now.

37:47.600 --> 37:48.600
And there is that.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.960
I mean, I have been impressed with the community just on our own matrix and just around, you

37:51.960 --> 37:55.680
know, I think it's true that it's at the stage where the docs don't necessarily always match

37:55.680 --> 37:59.360
and it's kind of living and you really have to be able to figure out the next Nix expression

37:59.360 --> 38:02.080
language to be able to debug what's going on.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.760
But there are a lot of people who are willing to help get you on board if you're willing

38:05.760 --> 38:09.280
to take the step to step over the line and start asking those questions in one of those

38:09.280 --> 38:10.280
spaces.

38:10.280 --> 38:14.680
We had another little odd experience where we were trying to create a user for the first

38:14.680 --> 38:15.680
time.

38:15.680 --> 38:19.440
We actually, funnily enough, managed to lock ourselves completely out of the OS three,

38:19.440 --> 38:20.440
four times.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.440
Well done, gentlemen.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.440
Well done.

38:22.440 --> 38:28.080
This is an essential experience for Brent, I think, on his journey to being an admin.

38:28.080 --> 38:32.000
We deleted the NixOS user, of course, without realizing it, without reading what was right

38:32.000 --> 38:35.400
in front of us, rebooted and went, actually, no, we couldn't reboot.

38:35.400 --> 38:40.800
Because suddenly I typed sudo and it said this user account is disabled or whatever.

38:40.800 --> 38:43.440
So then we had to hard power off the Pi.

38:43.440 --> 38:47.800
Eventually we ended up getting to the point where we created the user of, you know, Alex

38:47.800 --> 38:48.800
or whatever.

38:48.800 --> 38:49.800
But we couldn't log in.

38:49.800 --> 38:51.320
It said this account is disabled.

38:51.320 --> 38:57.200
So we could log in as root and we looked and the default shell was set to Sbin no login.

38:57.200 --> 39:01.780
So we thought, OK, cool, we'll just set the default shell to bash and call it good.

39:01.780 --> 39:07.040
For some reason, setting the default shell for all the users did nothing.

39:07.040 --> 39:11.960
And we had to explicitly specify per user the shell.

39:11.960 --> 39:12.960
And that was quite frustrating.

39:12.960 --> 39:13.960
Oh, yeah, sure.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.840
Couldn't log in because there's no shell to log into.

39:16.840 --> 39:23.360
Yeah, my my discourageness, I guess, discouragement that I've been feeling recently is because

39:23.360 --> 39:26.320
I think I picked the absolute worst project.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.840
It does kind of seem that way, unfortunately.

39:28.840 --> 39:33.440
Yeah, I mean, you guys know that I kind of came into this thinking what I would ultimately

39:33.440 --> 39:41.000
like to do is either rebuild my Raspberry Pi Pi's in my home set up in lady tubes with

39:41.000 --> 39:49.600
Nix or kind of like Moonshot was maybe take a Mac Mini M1 and get Nix OS running on that

39:49.600 --> 39:54.800
and replace three Raspberry Pi's with one M1 Mini running Nix OS.

39:54.800 --> 39:59.520
However, the primary job, I mean, there's a lot of there's a lot of jobs that this thing

39:59.520 --> 40:02.840
would have to do, but the one that actually automates and runs the RV is Home Assistant,

40:02.840 --> 40:07.280
like the absolute mission critical application is Home Assistant.

40:07.280 --> 40:13.040
And it seems like maybe I picked the absolute worst candidate for a Nix install.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.040
Maybe that's good.

40:14.040 --> 40:15.040
I don't know.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.040
And there's more I need to solve.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.640
But I'm kind of disappointed right now in my options.

40:18.640 --> 40:20.560
And not all of it is really Nix's fault.

40:20.560 --> 40:23.080
Some of it is actually the Home Assistant project's fault.

40:23.080 --> 40:29.240
For an example, on an ARM platform, I can install Home Assistant as a Nix module, but

40:29.240 --> 40:32.160
I get less than everything I need.

40:32.160 --> 40:36.600
And what I do need, it's a manual process to add things, even things that like just

40:36.600 --> 40:40.480
are small tweaks to add a component to the Lovelace dashboard.

40:40.480 --> 40:45.360
I have to manually define and configure all of it in Nix configuration files.

40:45.360 --> 40:50.040
And so that means like I can't just do that sort of like I'm in the UI, I'm browsing,

40:50.040 --> 40:53.480
I get inspiration, and I just want to add a module and just try it.

40:53.480 --> 40:55.040
It means no, I have to stop what I'm doing.

40:55.040 --> 40:59.060
I have to SSH and I have to find the right syntax, which I have to find somebody else

40:59.060 --> 41:01.200
who's done an example of this for me.

41:01.200 --> 41:05.560
I think you are running into one of the sort of inherent pain points of taking this approach

41:05.560 --> 41:09.600
of the plus side is it means you've totally specified it and you can make it happen again

41:09.600 --> 41:10.600
instantly.

41:10.600 --> 41:11.600
Right.

41:11.600 --> 41:12.680
But it is not the same.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.640
Now, sometimes you can get the best of both worlds there.

41:14.640 --> 41:18.360
But you're right in this case, like you got to you got to get there quite painstakingly.

41:18.360 --> 41:24.960
And if this was Samba, if this was Nginx, if this was sync thing, this wouldn't be a

41:24.960 --> 41:25.960
total non-issue.

41:25.960 --> 41:26.960
Right.

41:26.960 --> 41:30.960
But the Home Assistant project has what really makes it great.

41:30.960 --> 41:35.140
Our community add ons are these additional add ons that have been created that are easy

41:35.140 --> 41:39.960
to add when you have the entire Home Assistant experience.

41:39.960 --> 41:46.080
I could install Home Assistant as an OCI container, which is probably ultimately what I'll do.

41:46.080 --> 41:51.720
But that uses Podman, which is great, but not my core skill set at the moment when it

41:51.720 --> 41:53.800
comes to container management.

41:53.800 --> 42:00.880
And when it is this home system that actually runs my RV, I'm not super thrilled about that.

42:00.880 --> 42:05.320
You know, I went down a path that went a little closer to more of the Docker compose path

42:05.320 --> 42:06.320
that you're familiar with.

42:06.320 --> 42:07.680
So there might be something to play with there.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.360
But you're right, it is it is different.

42:09.360 --> 42:13.520
And as you say, right, like anything but running the whole sort of expected Home Assistant

42:13.520 --> 42:17.900
experience is a little bit outside the mainstream and limits you on what exactly you can do.

42:17.900 --> 42:20.680
And in that configuration, we're just talking about Home Assistant core.

42:20.680 --> 42:24.800
We're not talking about all the community bits and the supervisor management to get

42:24.800 --> 42:25.800
that.

42:25.800 --> 42:26.800
I basically have to go with a whole VM.

42:26.800 --> 42:27.800
Right.

42:27.800 --> 42:32.160
Is Podman a requirement or, you know, because we got Docker running in a couple of minutes.

42:32.160 --> 42:33.660
Oh, no, you absolutely can do.

42:33.660 --> 42:38.420
It's like the version that's packaged by the community that uses this whole OCI container

42:38.420 --> 42:40.600
process that set up to use Podman.

42:40.600 --> 42:43.960
I think Wes is probably right is I probably could just go the Docker compose route and

42:43.960 --> 42:44.960
go that way.

42:44.960 --> 42:49.880
But, you know, that's me kind of coming to like a new goalpost because the goalpost originally

42:49.880 --> 42:56.420
was a totally orchestrated home automation system that is 100% reproducible and only

42:56.420 --> 42:58.560
changes when I mandate it to change.

42:58.560 --> 42:59.760
That was the goal.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.880
And now I'm kind of basically just getting back to exactly where I'm at now.

43:02.880 --> 43:07.400
I tell you, when you started this NixOS challenge and you set those goals about having like

43:07.400 --> 43:14.080
a standardized JB build for our VPSs and, you know, maybe some of your pies and stuff,

43:14.080 --> 43:15.560
I thought you were mad.

43:15.560 --> 43:21.080
But after doing this last night, genuinely, some light bulbs went on for me and I there's

43:21.080 --> 43:23.140
a real elegance to doing it this way.

43:23.140 --> 43:28.960
You declare everything and you solve a problem one time and then it's solved forever.

43:28.960 --> 43:29.960
Yeah.

43:29.960 --> 43:33.440
And you could see how for a guy like me who like every now and then I get these bursts

43:33.440 --> 43:37.520
of inspiration where I've got project time and I create some great stuff.

43:37.520 --> 43:41.000
It's the one time you can focus, you get really deep in, you'll learn all the stuff, you get

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
that in your head.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.160
And it's becoming more and more rare because I got, you know, I got young kids and they're

43:46.160 --> 43:47.160
getting older.

43:47.160 --> 43:48.160
I got limited time.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.320
That's where some of my extra time goes now.

43:50.320 --> 43:52.480
So you also have to run a business.

43:52.480 --> 43:56.800
Like Alex says, it's like now that I can solve it once and it also self-documents.

43:56.800 --> 44:01.240
It's self-documenting in how it works too, which is for a guy who never gets around to

44:01.240 --> 44:03.960
the documentation, just beautiful.

44:03.960 --> 44:08.840
So I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to find some sort of like middle ground here.

44:08.840 --> 44:15.200
Part of what makes this tricky is home assistant, the project and many projects do this.

44:15.200 --> 44:18.400
They don't release just a generic arm 64 image.

44:18.400 --> 44:20.800
They have raspberry PI images.

44:20.800 --> 44:26.040
They have maybe, you know, like a Synology image or a pine image, right?

44:26.040 --> 44:33.960
But they don't, for most projects, they don't just offer an effing arm 64 image.

44:33.960 --> 44:39.960
Even though there's more and more just arm 64 systems out there and the Mac M1 systems

44:39.960 --> 44:42.200
are a great example of this.

44:42.200 --> 44:45.760
And not only that, but there's more and more of us out there that might have a Mac with

44:45.760 --> 44:50.340
virtualization and we want to run Linux and we need arm 64 images.

44:50.340 --> 44:55.400
But our community still has it in their little heads that the only people that are using

44:55.400 --> 45:00.400
arm are on raspberry PI's and the home assistant project is included in this group.

45:00.400 --> 45:06.600
And so I can't just download a home assistant arm VM image that I can run on arm 64.

45:06.600 --> 45:08.720
I can get a raspberry PI image.

45:08.720 --> 45:11.080
I can get a raspberry PI three image.

45:11.080 --> 45:16.760
I can get a Synology arm image, but I can't get an arm 64 image and it's so frustrating,

45:16.760 --> 45:17.920
but that's what it is.

45:17.920 --> 45:22.240
So the next stuff has been really great and like my Bitcoin node.

45:22.240 --> 45:26.240
Oh man, I could totally see why I'd want to run Nix on that.

45:26.240 --> 45:31.000
But for my home assistant system, I have to just live with the fact that I'm not getting

45:31.000 --> 45:33.640
all the benefits that Nix and NixOS offer.

45:33.640 --> 45:36.240
It's really the next package manager that offers and it's just going to be the way it

45:36.240 --> 45:39.360
is because that's how the upstream project decided to operate.

45:39.360 --> 45:40.780
And I realize it's not their target, right?

45:40.780 --> 45:43.420
They want people running their own via.

45:43.420 --> 45:51.240
But what I have discovered is some of the absolute best conversations I've had in Linux

45:51.240 --> 45:56.320
recently and just geeking out about Linux stuff have been with other NixOS users.

45:56.320 --> 45:58.280
They're really a clever bunch.

45:58.280 --> 46:00.800
They're solving problems in really cool ways.

46:00.800 --> 46:04.360
And kind of once you start working your way through using Nix, you start thinking about

46:04.360 --> 46:06.480
how you could build systems differently.

46:06.480 --> 46:08.560
And I think it changes the way you think about stuff.

46:08.560 --> 46:13.280
I've been impressed too that, you know, especially for some, you know, a purely functional, you

46:13.280 --> 46:16.480
know, declarative environment, you'd think it might be kind of a little, a little hardcore

46:16.480 --> 46:18.320
or everyone's like really focused.

46:18.320 --> 46:21.520
Kind of like sometimes we see with some of the dogmatism on the free software side of

46:21.520 --> 46:22.520
things.

46:22.520 --> 46:23.520
That's really not, not been my experience.

46:23.520 --> 46:27.200
You know, I think they, they recognize it's a weird way to do things.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.640
It's not what you're used to.

46:28.640 --> 46:29.640
It's not perfect.

46:29.640 --> 46:32.600
There's lots of areas that don't quite work as well as you'd like or have areas that are

46:32.600 --> 46:36.280
lacking polish, but it seems like that's, that's pretty upfront to people like, oh yeah,

46:36.280 --> 46:39.260
that's not perfect, but here's how I might solve that or here's a workaround that could,

46:39.260 --> 46:40.260
that could work for you.

46:40.260 --> 46:44.140
That's exactly been my experience and it's been very positive and it has, it has made

46:44.140 --> 46:47.500
the community, even though it's probably just a portion of the community, right?

46:47.500 --> 46:51.740
But it has made that portion of the community who is on matrix just seem very welcoming

46:51.740 --> 46:54.600
and it has not made me afraid to ask silly questions.

46:54.600 --> 46:57.520
I've not once been told like RTFM you noob, right?

46:57.520 --> 47:00.440
That people have walked me through it and it's been, it's been a good experience and

47:00.440 --> 47:01.440
not just myself.

47:01.440 --> 47:02.440
Okay.

47:02.440 --> 47:04.760
So one of the things that came up in these discussions when we launched the whole next

47:04.760 --> 47:07.940
challenge is should we just be doing this with Ansible?

47:07.940 --> 47:11.020
And I know that was a, that was a position that Alex felt pretty strongly.

47:11.020 --> 47:14.480
So now that you've played with a little bit Alex and had some time, what are your thoughts

47:14.480 --> 47:18.940
now where, where we started this with NixOS or Ansible, is this similar?

47:18.940 --> 47:20.460
Are they solving the same problem?

47:20.460 --> 47:21.460
What's your takeaway?

47:21.460 --> 47:28.140
Both are declarative configuration mechanisms and Ansible requires a reasonable amount of

47:28.140 --> 47:32.580
learning, a couple of days worth of learning, I would say to be proficient in the basics.

47:32.580 --> 47:37.060
And I kind of wanted to equate that to what Brent and I spent last night doing of maybe

47:37.060 --> 47:40.500
what, three or four hours of hacking around.

47:40.500 --> 47:44.780
And we had a fully functional declarative system.

47:44.780 --> 47:49.860
One thing we don't have with the NixOS config file as it stands right now is a way to automate

47:49.860 --> 47:54.340
that with, you know, a Git repository, which Ansible kind of automatically pushes you towards

47:54.340 --> 47:58.140
because there's so many different files to manage, but essentially they're solving the

47:58.140 --> 47:59.140
same problem.

47:59.140 --> 48:05.220
And the learning curve between the two is, I'd say Ansible is probably a bit easier and

48:05.220 --> 48:09.300
using my experience and Brent's experience between the two of us, we could actually solve

48:09.300 --> 48:13.300
quite a lot of problems more quickly than either of us individually, which I thought

48:13.300 --> 48:14.300
was interesting.

48:14.300 --> 48:21.700
But, you know, Nix does take a bit of a, you've got to, I think what you said Brent was forget

48:21.700 --> 48:24.060
everything you've learned about Linux in the last decade.

48:24.060 --> 48:25.060
Yeah.

48:25.060 --> 48:27.740
I wonder if it'd be easier to teach a newbie, someone who hadn't already, you know, dealt

48:27.740 --> 48:29.540
with the standard Linux distros.

48:29.540 --> 48:31.700
Sometimes it is when you don't have all the bias of the past.

48:31.700 --> 48:35.660
Well often we did run into issues that were like, well, I can't, I can't log in because

48:35.660 --> 48:36.660
there's no user.

48:36.660 --> 48:41.220
This is such a strange thing, but it's only because we've assumed that that stuff was

48:41.220 --> 48:42.220
defined.

48:42.220 --> 48:46.180
You know, and once you do it, it's very, very, very, very, very, very easy.

48:46.180 --> 48:49.900
But it took us, you know, a few moments to be like, oh yeah, that is what's happening.

48:49.900 --> 48:52.740
We have to actually tell it that we want it to exist.

48:52.740 --> 48:56.500
So you just kind of have to forget about the assumed defaults.

48:56.500 --> 49:01.380
And you found the GitHub community about NixOS pretty interesting too, right?

49:01.380 --> 49:07.860
Well, we did set up a little GitHub Jupiter broadcasting GitHub discussions where we encouraged

49:07.860 --> 49:14.140
everyone who, you know, thank you for joining us on this NixOS challenge this month.

49:14.140 --> 49:19.260
And we were able to gather a whole bunch of screenshots from the community.

49:19.260 --> 49:26.180
And also there are some amazing discussions on different configurations that people used

49:26.180 --> 49:28.420
and different ways they solve problems.

49:28.420 --> 49:33.620
There's a whole bunch of like additional bonus goals if you want extra meaningless points

49:33.620 --> 49:36.740
on like manager and things like that.

49:36.740 --> 49:37.740
Exactly.

49:37.740 --> 49:42.900
So I would encourage, you know, even if we're sort of softly celebrating the end of the

49:42.900 --> 49:47.320
challenge here today, I think there's a lot of great resources there.

49:47.320 --> 49:51.020
It's worth diving in and reading what the community has shared there.

49:51.020 --> 49:57.420
I was blown away by the knowledge of and, and the knowledge and also the willingness

49:57.420 --> 50:00.460
of our listeners to jump in on this experience with us.

50:00.460 --> 50:01.460
So thank you.

50:01.460 --> 50:02.460
Yeah.

50:02.460 --> 50:03.460
I want to just echo that.

50:03.460 --> 50:07.980
I am very thrilled that so many people were willing to just play along with us on this

50:07.980 --> 50:11.500
just to have fun and that so many people that didn't necessarily engage, they're just willing

50:11.500 --> 50:13.660
to listen to see how our experience went.

50:13.660 --> 50:18.820
And I think we should keep it going because this is going to be something that is ongoing.

50:18.820 --> 50:23.940
And I think the NixOS challenge matrix room should keep going too, because I'm going to

50:23.940 --> 50:24.940
have more questions.

50:24.940 --> 50:31.020
I think what is now sort of the awkward elephant in the room is what do we do about these new

50:31.020 --> 50:35.080
physical servers we have here in the studio that we haven't fully deployed yet?

50:35.080 --> 50:38.260
Do we pause and go with Nix on them?

50:38.260 --> 50:39.260
Like it's-

50:39.260 --> 50:45.140
I think we would do a new poll for the community, but it just has one option.

50:45.140 --> 50:46.140
That makes it legitimate, right?

50:46.140 --> 50:47.140
Right.

50:47.140 --> 50:48.140
Yeah, totally.

50:48.140 --> 50:49.140
You want to hear, let's do that.

50:49.140 --> 50:50.140
That's a dictatorship.

50:50.140 --> 50:51.140
Not democracy.

50:51.140 --> 50:52.140
Let's see.

50:52.140 --> 50:53.140
We'll put it together.

50:53.140 --> 50:54.700
Maybe we'll let the people decide.

50:54.700 --> 51:00.580
May I just add a little summary to what you were just saying about like the GitHub community?

51:00.580 --> 51:01.580
Please.

51:01.580 --> 51:06.380
I think it makes perfect sense that you've got good support and information from the

51:06.380 --> 51:13.140
GitHub community surrounding NixOS, because the people that are using NixOS to get stuff

51:13.140 --> 51:18.860
done are professionals that are using NixOS to get stuff done.

51:18.860 --> 51:23.380
And they're not partisan Linux desktop users.

51:23.380 --> 51:31.740
By and large, they're industry professionals that want great tooling to solve problems

51:31.740 --> 51:38.340
and you get that stack overflow experience from that community.

51:38.340 --> 51:46.380
And it's a bit sad that after all of these years, the partisanship that exists within

51:46.380 --> 51:52.260
the Linux desktop community is still so toxic and unhelpful.

51:52.260 --> 52:00.100
And yet when you look at where work happens and, you know, effective deployments need

52:00.100 --> 52:07.220
to be, you know, illustrated, maintained, documented and helpful support exists, that

52:07.220 --> 52:12.100
exists outside of what we would call mainstream desktop Linux.

52:12.100 --> 52:13.980
Yeah, I think it could make a lot of sense for us.

52:13.980 --> 52:14.980
So here's what I'm going to do.

52:14.980 --> 52:16.860
I'm going to make a poll and I'll put a link in the show notes.

52:16.860 --> 52:20.100
Should we use NixOS as our cloud and local server OS?

52:20.100 --> 52:21.540
There's two options.

52:21.540 --> 52:22.540
Yes.

52:22.540 --> 52:24.020
And stick with Seuss, you lizard haters.

52:24.020 --> 52:28.700
We'll put a link in the show notes at linuxunplug.com slash four five five.

52:28.700 --> 52:33.200
And keep in mind, a vote for yes means that a lot of times we're going to have to come

52:33.200 --> 52:39.300
up with some way to get NixOS running on a VPS because we've managed to do it on Linode.

52:39.300 --> 52:44.740
But I don't know if other VPS providers are going to let us replace their images with

52:44.740 --> 52:45.740
NixOS.

52:45.740 --> 52:46.740
So keep in mind.

52:46.740 --> 52:51.100
But for our local systems and for all of that going forward, I can see a real healthy setup

52:51.100 --> 52:52.100
here.

52:52.100 --> 52:57.340
I'm not trying to backtrack on the tumbleweed, but I could see a healthy setup here of Proxmox,

52:57.340 --> 53:01.460
which has maybe some tumbleweed systems and has some Nix systems.

53:01.460 --> 53:03.980
And we have all of these systems working together.

53:03.980 --> 53:08.980
And what I would possibly see us doing is just moving more and more and more infrastructure

53:08.980 --> 53:10.100
over to these three boxes.

53:10.100 --> 53:15.020
And as we do that, some of them are going to have audience critical facing features

53:15.020 --> 53:20.220
because word has it they are deploying fiber in this neighborhood.

53:20.220 --> 53:23.540
And if they start deploying fiber here, I'm probably going to start spinning up more and

53:23.540 --> 53:24.540
more services.

53:24.540 --> 53:26.540
JBDC becomes a real thing.

53:26.540 --> 53:27.540
Yeah.

53:27.540 --> 53:30.740
So we better get that cooling installed because we're going to have brand.

53:30.740 --> 53:31.740
I heard you.

53:31.740 --> 53:32.740
I heard you.

53:32.740 --> 53:40.580
Totally plus one to Proxmox and also putting the JB community shoulder behind popularizing

53:40.580 --> 53:50.100
Nix OS so that it might become more widespread and a supported option in the, you know, the

53:50.100 --> 53:52.060
VPS and cloud providers.

53:52.060 --> 53:53.580
We may create a little market demand.

53:53.580 --> 53:58.760
I've been quite impressed with the whole Nix OS lustrate and just the ability to get Nix

53:58.760 --> 54:02.300
running just about anywhere and then further Nix OS to take over a box.

54:02.300 --> 54:04.100
There's a lot of potential there too.

54:04.100 --> 54:09.700
Also it feels as bare minimum as an Arch install or a Gen 2 install, but is a fraction of the

54:09.700 --> 54:10.760
time to get it up and running.

54:10.760 --> 54:14.220
You basically got to partition your disk, add a couple of config options, and then you're

54:14.220 --> 54:16.420
good to go and mount a few things, right?

54:16.420 --> 54:22.620
Like it's, Wes and I now on multiple occasions have just stood up a quick Nix OS box to try

54:22.620 --> 54:26.180
something just after a show or something like it's not a big deal to get it going.

54:26.180 --> 54:31.020
I'd just like to add that, you know, working with the Nix community, we invited them to

54:31.020 --> 54:32.500
a snap cross summit.

54:32.500 --> 54:33.500
What's this now?

54:33.500 --> 54:34.640
Three years ago.

54:34.640 --> 54:39.780
And the quickest, easiest way to make a snap is to use Nix, the packaging platform.

54:39.780 --> 54:41.340
I hadn't even thought, but of course.

54:41.340 --> 54:42.340
Yeah.

54:42.340 --> 54:43.340
Wow.

54:43.340 --> 54:44.340
Yeah.

54:44.340 --> 54:47.540
They added it as just a can, another container platform to, you know, create your apps and

54:47.540 --> 54:49.780
it works extraordinarily well.

54:49.780 --> 54:50.780
I like it.

54:50.780 --> 54:51.780
Thank you, Wimpy.

54:51.780 --> 54:54.220
See, this is a perfect episode to have Wimpy with us for this, right?

54:54.220 --> 54:55.220
All right.

54:55.220 --> 54:58.600
Well, so we'll have links to the GitHub if you'd like to still participate.

54:58.600 --> 54:59.600
It's going to go on.

54:59.600 --> 55:00.600
We're going to keep it up.

55:00.600 --> 55:01.600
We're still, we're still going.

55:01.600 --> 55:02.600
We're still learning.

55:02.600 --> 55:06.340
The whole process is really just beginning with this challenge, but I hope that the month

55:06.340 --> 55:08.860
of April was an opportunity for us to get rolling.

55:08.860 --> 55:12.900
This is our last episode in the month of April, if you can believe it.

55:12.900 --> 55:17.100
So let us know what you think and find that Nix challenge room in the matrix.

55:17.100 --> 55:20.800
If you want to chat with other folks and find that GitHub link at linuxonplug.com slash

55:20.800 --> 55:30.780
four 55 bitwarden.com slash Linux, get started with a free trial of teams or an enterprise

55:30.780 --> 55:36.100
plan at bitwarden.com slash Linux, or go try it for free as an individual user.

55:36.100 --> 55:41.220
I am so stoked to have Bitwarden here as a sponsor, you know, like this is way better

55:41.220 --> 55:42.580
than telling you about a mattress, right?

55:42.580 --> 55:45.620
This is telling you about a way to keep your online accounts secure.

55:45.620 --> 55:50.220
And if you're in the enterprise, there's a lot of great options here now too, as well.

55:50.220 --> 55:54.500
You know, you can share and sync your sensitive data, of course, but Bitwarden is fully customizable.

55:54.500 --> 55:59.280
You can turn features on and off with enterprise policies and it's open source.

55:59.280 --> 56:01.220
They have had their core code audited.

56:01.220 --> 56:05.940
They've had people look at it, you know, Bitwarden started in 2016 and they've just been iterating

56:05.940 --> 56:09.060
on this idea to make it better and better and better.

56:09.060 --> 56:13.100
A few years ago, I decided to switch to Bitwarden and I have been absolutely happy with the

56:13.100 --> 56:14.100
choice.

56:14.100 --> 56:16.220
I like the command line option to tell you the truth.

56:16.220 --> 56:20.260
That's been really handy on my SSH boxes, but also I have it installed in my browser

56:20.260 --> 56:22.780
as an extension and on my mobile devices.

56:22.780 --> 56:26.580
So when I bring up something on my mobile device, I can log in with a really long, complicated

56:26.580 --> 56:32.100
password and it supports two-factor authentication on the internet phones from the Apple Corporation.

56:32.100 --> 56:36.300
It supports the face ID for unlocking, like all of that, and of course other biometrics

56:36.300 --> 56:37.300
as well.

56:37.300 --> 56:40.900
And one of the things that gives me confidence in Bitwarden is that they do have a self-hosted

56:40.900 --> 56:41.900
option.

56:41.900 --> 56:46.340
So if I ever get to the point where I'm like, you know what, time to go this way, I can.

56:46.340 --> 56:50.220
But if you also just want to get up and running in minutes, Bitwarden Cloud is a fantastic

56:50.220 --> 56:54.360
option and they have a large active community that's always available on their forums and

56:54.360 --> 56:56.820
Reddit plus support as well.

56:56.820 --> 57:00.580
And I think one of the things that I didn't really understand, but now I can kind of grok

57:00.580 --> 57:04.420
as just maybe a game changer for a lot of you out there, is Bitwarden has introduced

57:04.420 --> 57:09.100
account switching for your personal stuff, your work stuff, your open source project

57:09.100 --> 57:10.300
stuff, you know, all that kind of thing.

57:10.300 --> 57:15.740
You can now isolate it out, you know, separate it out between the different jobs, which is

57:15.740 --> 57:16.740
really a nice feature.

57:16.740 --> 57:17.740
That's perfect.

57:17.740 --> 57:18.740
Yeah.

57:18.740 --> 57:19.740
Right.

57:19.740 --> 57:20.740
You move on from one place.

57:20.740 --> 57:21.740
I don't need, I mean, they're going to change the passwords anyway, right?

57:21.740 --> 57:22.740
Those don't work.

57:22.740 --> 57:23.740
I don't need them cluttering things up.

57:23.740 --> 57:24.740
That's what I used to do.

57:24.740 --> 57:25.740
I used to have it all.

57:25.740 --> 57:26.740
Like that database.

57:26.740 --> 57:30.340
One, that's not a great practice to start with and two, yeah, it's bad for you as well.

57:30.340 --> 57:31.340
It's not good.

57:31.340 --> 57:32.340
It's not good.

57:32.340 --> 57:33.940
And really, let's be honest, you may already know all this.

57:33.940 --> 57:38.540
You might be already using Bitwarden even, but maybe friends, maybe family, maybe others

57:38.540 --> 57:40.140
out there aren't.

57:40.140 --> 57:43.980
Maybe the place you work at hasn't really figured out their password management strategy

57:43.980 --> 57:44.980
yet.

57:44.980 --> 57:45.980
Yikes.

57:45.980 --> 57:50.100
Well, tell them to go to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

57:50.100 --> 57:54.380
Go try it out for yourself or your business and you'll support the show and you're going

57:54.380 --> 57:55.380
to do something.

57:55.380 --> 57:58.180
Just this one thing could really help protect you online.

57:58.180 --> 58:03.380
You know, there's a lot of stuff, but good passwords that are individual for each website,

58:03.380 --> 58:04.380
that's key.

58:04.380 --> 58:08.460
That really makes a big difference and support the show and do that at bitwarden.com slash

58:08.460 --> 58:09.460
Linux.

58:09.460 --> 58:10.460
It's easy to get started.

58:10.460 --> 58:17.020
You just go to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

58:17.020 --> 58:19.980
As usual, we received some great feedback this week.

58:19.980 --> 58:25.060
One of which David wanted us to play with a welder that he works on.

58:25.060 --> 58:28.340
Now normally we don't kind of consider that kind of adult request on the show, but this

58:28.340 --> 58:29.340
one time.

58:29.340 --> 58:30.340
It's true.

58:30.340 --> 58:31.340
Thank you, Wes.

58:31.340 --> 58:36.700
He writes, David writes, if you want to weld with a full feature state of the art welder

58:36.700 --> 58:39.660
running Linux, I can make that happen.

58:39.660 --> 58:43.040
I work as a professional on the equipment in tech support.

58:43.040 --> 58:49.260
The front panel, which is a seven inch touchscreen and many of the boards run Linux.

58:49.260 --> 58:54.580
The front panel is nearly a full Linux stack, including Wi-Fi, NFC and Bluetooth support.

58:54.580 --> 59:01.740
It also hosts a website to manage the hardware, OPC UA server and MQTT for generating metrics.

59:01.740 --> 59:02.740
No way.

59:02.740 --> 59:03.740
I know.

59:03.740 --> 59:04.740
This thing's amazing.

59:04.740 --> 59:10.820
It runs a fairly modern kernel and the R&D guys call the distribution Weld OS internally.

59:10.820 --> 59:12.140
Oh my gosh.

59:12.140 --> 59:14.180
How cool is that?

59:14.180 --> 59:15.180
Weld OS.

59:15.180 --> 59:16.180
What?

59:16.180 --> 59:19.900
I mean, you know, for Linux action show, I used to have this bit at the beginning of

59:19.900 --> 59:22.260
every show where I'd say, this runs Linux.

59:22.260 --> 59:28.860
I never once ever in hundreds of episodes had a welder there, but I mean, is there another

59:28.860 --> 59:31.340
operating system you trust in that kind of environment?

59:31.340 --> 59:33.780
You know, back in the day it would have been Windows CE.

59:33.780 --> 59:37.420
Remember that period of time when CE was just like all kinds of horrible stuff.

59:37.420 --> 59:41.140
They're building a new light rail stop near my house and I can see like it's not operational

59:41.140 --> 59:42.140
yet.

59:42.140 --> 59:43.140
I can see one of the TVs.

59:43.140 --> 59:44.140
It's running Windows.

59:44.140 --> 59:45.140
Oh God.

59:45.140 --> 59:46.140
I know.

59:46.140 --> 59:47.140
I know what you're saying, but.

59:47.140 --> 59:48.140
They need an intervention.

59:48.140 --> 59:52.540
He mentions that licenses and source code are available if you look hard enough or ask

59:52.540 --> 59:54.140
kindly enough.

59:54.140 --> 59:57.040
And Chris, did you do any image searches of this thing?

59:57.040 --> 01:00:01.500
It's the Fronius TPSI to get a sense of sort of what it looked like.

01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:02.500
I had to go take a look.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:03.840
I'll put a link in the show notes.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:09.120
It does have what it kind of just looks like a tablet behind a piece of plexiglass installed

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:10.420
at the top of this thing.

01:00:10.420 --> 01:00:19.540
I grew up with a family member who was a welder by trade, and these things they they sit out

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:20.540
in the rain.

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:21.940
I mean, they try not to, but it happens.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.140
It's like on the back of their truck.

01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:26.540
It gets rained on or they're at a job site and the weather changes.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.220
They get cement on them.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.540
They get dust on them.

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:32.860
They get sawdust like they this is.

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:39.460
You really got to appreciate like this is a computer that is going to live through hell.

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:42.900
Hell doesn't do it justice when you talk about the kind of thing it's going to go through.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:44.060
So David, thank you.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:48.620
I think also worth mentioning is that downtime is darn expensive if you're running one of

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:49.620
these.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:51.380
So I would imagine they put a lot of effort into that.

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:52.380
Also, I appreciate that.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:58.380
David said that if we're ever in the Chicago area, that he'd totally give us a tour of

01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:59.380
the lab that he works at.

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:01.460
Well, you were just talking about that Chicago meetup.

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.460
Right?

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:03.460
Yeah, let's do it.

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:04.460
Yeah, let's do it.

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:05.460
All right.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.420
Well, this next bit of feedback wasn't directly sent into the show.

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:14.600
I was listening to the podcasting 2.0 show, which is a fantastic production by Adam Curry

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.600
and Dave Jones.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.300
Dave Jones has been on the show before.

01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.340
And they talk about all of the developments and happenings in the podcast world, which

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.420
of course I'm always fascinated by.

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:26.020
And Adam Curry, the pod father was listed.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:29.740
He now listens to Linux Unplugged, which welcome into the show, Adam.

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:30.740
Thank you for listening.

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.020
Glad to have you as one of our audience members.

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:34.020
Absolutely.

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:38.940
I had what I would imagine is a very legitimate question that most new listeners have when

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:39.940
they tune into the show.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:44.220
And that is, how the hell do you guys try out so many Linux distributions?

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:48.800
They're always testing out new Linux installs.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:52.580
That's a lot of what they do, or Linux upgrades and distros.

01:01:52.580 --> 01:01:58.580
And I'm wondering, does anyone have, you know, so I have, I'm running Linux Mint as my daily

01:01:58.580 --> 01:01:59.580
driver.

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.980
Now, if I wanted to migrate, I'd be in trouble.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:04.260
I mean, I have stuff installed.

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:07.420
I sure have some PHP version.

01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:08.420
What do these guys do?

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.620
They have one laptop that is really their laptop and they use it and they don't mess

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:12.620
with it.

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:16.540
And they have another junker that they change all the time, or is there a simple way to

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:25.260
move your environment over in the Linux environment where you move a lot of stuff over or just

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:26.820
wind up reinstalling everything?

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:31.940
Well, if you use on next shell, you'll see, next shell, you can just load it and go.

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:33.660
No, this is a fair question.

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:37.500
And Adam has it close, but just slightly backwards.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:42.700
Like one of my nicest machines, which is a ThinkPad, is my distro hopping box most of

01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:43.700
the time.

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:49.180
And my workstation that I never really reinstall very often, maybe once every four or five

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:52.460
years, that's an old clunker.

01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:54.580
That's the one that doesn't get any love.

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:56.260
And that's my way of doing it.

01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:59.740
It's just, I have a separate machine, but each of us has our own approach.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.940
Wes has some crazy approaches that he uses.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:06.900
Well, yeah, I mean, I'm an animal, so I use QEMU on the command line powered by Kexec

01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:10.060
to install things and then reboot to, you know, because sometimes you want to try like

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:15.000
native graphics drivers, but if you don't want to be crazy, I mean, Wimpy has a wonderful

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.820
project out there, Quick EMU that, you know, that'll do all the work for you.

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:24.740
Yeah, that's actually my method of choice is, you know, I don't have 27 machines laying

01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:27.740
around like most of you do or seem to.

01:03:27.740 --> 01:03:30.220
And thus, Wimpy, thank you, thank you.

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:34.760
I've been using Quick EMU a ton, been loving it to do a bunch of, you know, participate

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:39.300
in some testing weeks for the new Ubuntu release and things like that.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.500
So it's been a wild ride and I've loved it.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.500
You're welcome.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.060
And it wasn't invented by accident.

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:50.140
It is the non-animal approach to what, you know, Wes does.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:52.620
I wouldn't want my experience to be had by anyone else.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:56.620
So I'm glad that you've sanitized it for the civilized world.

01:03:56.620 --> 01:04:01.900
We'll put a link to Quick EMU in the show notes, but it's basically just a project that

01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:05.300
is absolutely something we've all wanted forever.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.360
And now it also has a GUI component as well.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:10.900
So it's not just a command line thing you got to do, but it lets you quickly create

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:14.220
really optimized VMs on a Linux box.

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:17.840
And what Wimpy has done and the people that are working now on the GUI have done is made

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:21.860
it super simple to just say, I want to run this distribution or Windows or whatever it

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:27.060
might be, and then it sets up all the back end, like fiddly stuff for the virtual machine

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:32.020
to make it run at absolute best possible speed and graphics and all that kind of stuff.

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.940
Yeah, we just tried it out for the first time the other week and it was nice.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:35.940
It's great.

01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.940
Yeah.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:42.580
There's even a sister project that sets up a GPU pass through and what was I going to

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:43.580
say?

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:44.580
I've forgotten.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:48.180
But there's, you can do GPU pass through now through a sister project.

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.780
Very nice.

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.820
And now it is time for the boost.

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.580
We got some amazing boosts this week.

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.140
Thank you very much.

01:04:57.140 --> 01:05:00.860
Tomato deer writes in with 5000 sats.

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:03.100
Thanks for RSS hub recommendation.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:09.860
I wanted to give honorable mentions to Mini Flux for articles, Wallabag for archival.

01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:12.460
So those I think would be considered two picks.

01:05:12.460 --> 01:05:13.460
Yeah.

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:14.460
Right.

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:15.460
I think Alex uses Mini Flux, right?

01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:19.660
I did for a little while, but the requirements to get it set up were a little bit onerous

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:23.780
and like a compose, like there's a lot of database stuff to futz around with and.

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.780
Gotcha.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:26.180
It works, but it's not for the faint of heart.

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:31.540
It does seem really sweet as far as like if you were somebody who consumes a lot of news

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:36.820
and you bring a lot of different feeds in and you want something that's clean and manageable,

01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.100
Mini Flux looks great for that.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:42.260
But he also linked in here Wallabag, which is a web application that lets you save web

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:43.260
pages for reading later.

01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:46.460
So it's sort of like an Instapaper or pocket, but one you can self host.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:49.500
Oh, now that looks handy and what a fun name.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:53.420
We also covered Wallabag in LUP 378 if you're interested.

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.420
Very good.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:58.540
We got a boost from DFJ 225 four days ago with 4000 SATs.

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:02.840
I was inspired by the show to give the value for value model a try using decentralized

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.620
technologies right on, brother.

01:06:05.620 --> 01:06:08.700
Thanks for putting out the interesting show to the world.

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:13.060
And you know, something else I've noticed is we're not getting as many boosts, but we're

01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:16.940
getting more people who are just streaming SATs as they listen.

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:20.780
And so this has us talking internally about ways that maybe we could expose some of the

01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:25.520
membership features to people who are doing this because that's incredible.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:28.360
It's such a neat thing to open up helipad and see people there as they listen, some

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:30.100
SATs are coming in.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:35.060
And as part of the value that I want to return to the audience who is sending this boost,

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:39.060
I have set up an old monitor in my office that I've turned on its side with a Raspberry

01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:44.120
Pi and I just have the boost up on that screen all the time when I'm in my office.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:48.620
So it has now become like the fastest way to get a message in front of my face and make

01:06:48.620 --> 01:06:49.620
me smile.

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:53.260
These, they come in pew pew and you know, I have it up all the time.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:57.660
I came in, I came in my office today before I even sat down at my desk.

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:02.100
I heard a pew as a, as a boost came in and it's just so awesome because I actually turned

01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.620
out, it turned out to be kind of a rough morning.

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:07.580
And so as I was sitting down at my desk, I got a boost and it just, I don't know, it

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:08.580
makes me smile.

01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:09.580
Yeah.

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:10.580
Chris smile button.

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:11.580
We could all use one of those.

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:16.380
I have been chatting about ways to maybe automate tooling around those boosts, like capturing

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:19.660
them from the backend of helipads and perhaps putting them into the chat rooms of various

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:20.660
shows and stuff.

01:07:20.660 --> 01:07:21.660
Right.

01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:22.660
I mean, we like seeing them.

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:23.660
Why not make it easier?

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:24.660
Yeah.

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:27.220
Well, what's cool is when you put all of this stuff behind open source software, right?

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:31.140
You build it with open source software and you put it on an open decentralized network.

01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:33.020
Well, guess what we can do?

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:36.640
We can build tools around that because anyone can participate.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:40.640
So we could build tools that bring all the different boosts into the individual show

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:44.820
docs automatically or put them in front of the host in a way that you could never really

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:49.240
do with email without some sort of really crappy rickety filtering.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.460
And that's why I think boosts are an important part of value for value going forward.

01:07:52.460 --> 01:07:57.220
Now value for value is a separate thing that could be any payment system or it could be

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.220
your time.

01:07:58.220 --> 01:07:59.220
It could be effort.

01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.380
It is a concept where listeners are asked to share their value.

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:05.020
They get from listening to the podcast and its producers.

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:08.860
In most cases, that means like a dollar amount because that's just what we all have available.

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:12.480
We don't have a lot of time, but it could be other things, too.

01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.980
It could be one off help.

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:19.940
It could be maybe participating in our mumble room on a Sunday and helping people get their

01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:20.940
mic working.

01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:23.740
It could, it could be coming up to the RV and helping with your time.

01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:26.660
It could be creating a piece of artwork that we use for something.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:29.780
It could be participating in a show and adding a bit of information.

01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:32.360
Like there's so many ways to contribute value back.

01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:37.300
It could be giving us a ride in your Tesla or just showing up to our meetup.

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:38.300
I mean, gosh.

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:39.300
Yeah.

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.980
All these guys got to think they had a listener come give them a ride this week in their Tesla.

01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.980
Well, that's extra special.

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:43.980
I'm jealous.

01:08:43.980 --> 01:08:49.180
He showed us the full self-driving mode and it was an experience, hey Brent?

01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:50.180
It was.

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:51.260
Anyways, it was interesting.

01:08:51.260 --> 01:08:54.340
Thank you, Lucas, for giving us the best coffee of the week.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.340
Yes, very much.

01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:56.340
Ah, very nice.

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:57.340
Yeah.

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:02.700
So if you'd like to send us a boost, go grab a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com.

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:08.180
If you don't want to switch podcast apps, I have been experimenting this week with the

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.180
Breeze wallet, B-R-E-E-Z.

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:16.220
It is a, it's a lightning destination is essentially what they're trying to create.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:20.240
It's worth checking out for you antenna pod users out there because I don't know if the

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:25.220
antenna pod project is going to integrate boost directly right now, but they are investigating

01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:27.260
integrating with the Breeze wallet.

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:28.900
So you could kind of get ahead of the curve there.

01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:32.820
If you're on antenna pod and grab Breeze, you listen in antenna pod, you add one of

01:09:32.820 --> 01:09:35.180
our shows to Breeze, and then you just send the boost that way.

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.740
It's a pretty great way to do it.

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:39.020
And then, um, breeze itself is open source.

01:09:39.020 --> 01:09:42.760
In fact, most of it's GPLed, so it's pretty great.

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.940
And what I'm going to do, and Wes let's remember to, let's remember to put this like in the

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:47.940
description.

01:09:47.940 --> 01:09:51.260
I'm going to add our lightning node address directly.

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.900
So if you want to use something like the boost CLI or some other tool that isn't necessarily

01:09:55.900 --> 01:10:00.260
a podcast app, you can, or if you want to open up a channel to us, you absolutely can.

01:10:00.260 --> 01:10:04.620
We'll have a link to that, but we'll also put our lightning node address in the description.

01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:05.620
And you know what?

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:10.260
Let's build out that peer to peer network because I believe after having done this for

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:16.200
15 years, this is probably going to be a component of the next 15 years of content creation.

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:20.540
And when you combine what Adam and Dave and the team are working on with podcasting 2.0,

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:21.860
you're getting incredible features.

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:27.040
We're going to add real actual new things to podcasting that is needed for a decade.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:32.340
We're not there just yet for everyone, but we are there for early adopters and it's very,

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:33.340
very exciting.

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:38.340
So if you'd like to participate in that, we'll have all of that information in the show notes.

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:44.060
But we do have an interesting, perhaps risque pick before we get out of here.

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:45.140
I chose this one again.

01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:48.680
I guess this is the second week in a row where I have the pick, but really abusing your show

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:49.680
runner privileges.

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:53.460
So I just came across this and I haven't tried it yet, but this is more like a hasn't even

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:54.460
tried it.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:55.460
I know.

01:10:55.460 --> 01:10:56.460
I normally don't do that.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:57.460
I normally don't.

01:10:57.460 --> 01:10:58.660
But I wanted to get the word out there and collect feedback.

01:10:58.660 --> 01:10:59.660
So send us a boost.

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:05.500
And if you've tried this, it's Proxmox V7 or the Raspberry Pi, of course.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.560
So it converts.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.240
This isn't something they release as a project.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.500
You can't go get Proxmox for arm boxes.

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:18.520
See my earlier rant in the show, but you can install Raspbian and then use this script

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:25.960
called Pymox to convert that Raspbian install into a full Proxmox node, which can be fun

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:29.820
for like backup testing or maybe you just want to run a couple of things like the gosh

01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:33.300
darn Home Assistant VM on your Raspberry Pi.

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.300
I know.

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:39.720
Or maybe you want to build more of that arm 64 software goodness that you were missing

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.720
out on earlier.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.160
I love to see that, too.

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:44.460
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:47.160
Pymox 7 is the project name.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:51.480
And if you've tried this or if you do try it, please let me know what you think, because

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.400
I almost did it to one of my production pies this weekend so I could report it on the show.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:58.400
But I chickened out.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.200
I totally chickened out.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.160
I just didn't want to break the Internet.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:05.500
I was doing I was doing a lot of projects this weekend, and it was one of those where

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.740
like, OK, I got 10 minutes in and I got to go look up like the next step on YouTube.

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.000
You know what I'm talking about?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.920
However, I am happy to report that I think I have figured out what has been causing me

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.960
some issues in Lady Jups' water system.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:18.960
Whoa.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.480
I'm feeling like, you know, empowered and shit.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.360
So there's that.

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.640
And I got my tires filled up and I got my solar panels clean like I got some work done,

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.640
but I just didn't get this.

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.440
So your tech life is in disarray, but your physical life looks pretty decent.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.640
But maybe this could be a solution for me.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:34.880
Maybe this could be a solution.

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.420
Maybe I could have my home assistant cake and eat it, too.

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:43.220
And I could have a Proxmox Raspberry Pi 4 compute module that has a Nix OS system that

01:12:43.220 --> 01:12:47.360
runs like all of my services except for home assistant and then a separate home assistant

01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:48.360
VM.

01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:49.360
I just want two VMs.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.400
Let me know if you've tried Pymox.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.720
Send us a booster and email Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.840
Well, let's see.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:56.840
Let's wrap it up.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:57.960
Wimpy, it's been forever since you've joined us.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.200
Is there anywhere you want to send folks any websites or, you know, social accounts you

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.200
want people to check out?

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.200
Two places.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:12.040
I would like to encourage people to have a listen to Linux Downtime Episode 45 where Joe

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:19.000
and Adam and I have a discussion about what goes into making a Linux desktop distribution.

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:23.160
And if you want to learn more about making Linux desktop distributions and the other

01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:29.040
projects I work on, I mentioned DebGET earlier, then head to Wimpy's World and you can find

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:34.920
the places where I stream and you can join me live as I cut some code and work on this

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:35.920
stuff.

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:36.920
Cut some code.

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:37.920
I like that idea.

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:38.920
Thanks, Wimpy.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.840
Alex, should we send people to self-hosted show?

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.680
I think that's a pretty good place to send people.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:45.680
All right.

01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:47.400
And Brent, I'm going to tell people what?

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.320
Check us out right here.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:50.320
Okay.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.360
I think is, uh, no, no, no, no.

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.360
You should plug now, Brent.

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:55.520
You should go into like, you should go into plug mode and be like, oh, check me out on

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:56.520
Office Hours.

01:13:56.520 --> 01:13:58.000
I was on the recent Office Hours episode.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Yeah.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Yeah.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.000
Office Hours number.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.000
Is it one?

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.000
No, it's two.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.000
It's two.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.440
Check Chris and I out on Office Hours episode two.

01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:08.120
And what's that domain, Brent?

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:09.120
Office dot hair.

01:14:09.120 --> 01:14:10.120
Office Hours dot hair.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.120
Oh!

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:12.120
All right.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.120
We're going to have.

01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:14.120
Office dot hair is surprisingly taken.

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:15.120
We're going to, yeah.

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.120
We're going to.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:21.240
We obviously need to have a production meeting here because clearly we got to get our plugs

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.240
down.

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:23.240
All right.

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.200
Well, you can find this here podcast at Linux Unplugged on the Twitters.

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:30.840
We do this show live and we'd love to have you join our mumble room or chat room or just

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.640
watch, watch and enjoy.

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.320
We do it on Sundays at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.320
See you next week.

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:40.120
Same bat time, same bat station.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:43.280
And of course, don't miss Linux Action News.

01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:48.440
If you're not catching Linux, you're not getting everything, which I'm so, I'm so frustrated

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:49.440
with them, Wes.

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:50.440
Yeah.

01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:51.440
Cause we saved the best stuff.

01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.440
We save it for land.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.440
We don't put it in this show.

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.440
No.

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:57.080
Anyways, linuxactionnews.com for that.

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.280
And uh, you know, go get a little more stuff, Linux stuff.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.480
And of course we always encourage you to keep the conversation rolling.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:07.660
We've got the contact page, we've got the matrix info, the mumble info, all of it.

01:15:07.660 --> 01:15:11.640
Even the links, even the RSS feeds, that's over at linuxunplugged.com.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.760
It's real simple.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:15.120
It's just linuxunplugged.com.

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.340
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:43.160
We'll be right back here next Sunday.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.560
All right.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.560
Let's go boat.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.560
JBtitles.com.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.600
These are the final days of the IRC before we all switched to discord.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.600
So let's go.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:00.600
Let's go.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:01.600
Yeah.

01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.600
It's a wise decision that I fully endorse.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:07.040
And also I'll offer my professional services to help you make that transition.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:10.440
You should launch Wimpy's matrix to discord conversion services.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:15.480
No, I've been asked to do that and I've shot that down from the sky every time it's come

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.480
up.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.840
I don't need those three extra users on the top of the two and a half thousand users we

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.080
already have in the Wimpy's world discord.

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.480
What we need is a, we need a good old classic race and whichever title bot gets finished

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.280
first for the matrix of the discord.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:32.280
That's the way we go.

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:33.280
Right?

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.320
Oh, well, I mean, Gamma's got a pretty sweet bot going.

01:16:35.320 --> 01:16:50.440
Well, the race is on.
