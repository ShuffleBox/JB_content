1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
let's see should we do a tech story of the of the week before we get into any

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,420
Linux stuff hmm let's see here let's see here scanning scanning jiffy launches a

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:16,900
new gif maker tool hey hey big news everybody hey I use that today she's

4
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,380
really dude did she really listen listen it's integrated into Facebook Messenger

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,440
and my mom sent me a gift so I had to send something and the value of this is

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:37,800
negative. This is Linux Unplugged episode 207 for July 25th 2017

7
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,860
Welcome to Linux Unplugged with your host freshly back from Montana my name is

8
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,780
Chris Mr. West is actually in route I think he's battling some sort of

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,780
five-headed monster in Seattle traffic but back from last week because you

10
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,420
demanded more beard is Mr. Rekai himself hello beard hey guys hey so you'll be

11
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,620
sitting in for with with us at least for a little while especially it's kind of

12
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,540
perfect since apparently we can only fit two hosts and then one has to pop out

13
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:20,420
anyways we got a really really fun show I a new season is upon me after years

14
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,220
and years of running arch I'm beginning a new journey I'm distro hopping for the

15
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,980
first time in years we'll talk about where I've landed initially and the kind

16
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:33,740
of things I'm getting into new release it's really great so much works got into

17
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:38,220
it kick the tires we're talking about it just a little bit on the show also huge

18
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,980
news today breaking as we go on air we'll cover that fedoras got some big

19
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,740
news we kind of hinted at it when we talked last what two weeks ago about

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,020
fedora 26 guess wasn't last week mm-hmm then there's a vulnerability that's

21
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,980
actually a problem with Windows MSI files still manages to screw up your

22
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:58,600
Linux box still but yeah yeah it's it's actually kind of adorable it's not a big

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,300
deal but we're still gonna talk about it then we're gonna talk about what they

24
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:05,540
say is the most beautiful Linux distribution ever no other distro is

25
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:11,500
more beautiful and it's based on the plasma desktop I'm in yeah yeah so we'll

26
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:16,860
be talking about that plus adapting gnome for ADHD users like myself it's

27
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,740
true I have to admit it you may have noticed it yourself and of course my my

28
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,940
just my I was gonna say my perilous journey but I hope at the other end of

29
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:31,180
it will be a golden rainbow as I switch from arch I'll tell you why I'm what I'm

30
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:34,500
going to but before we go any further I've missed him you probably miss him by

31
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:41,420
now it's our virtual log time appropriate greetings mumble room hello

32
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:44,540
everybody good to see you in there good to hear from all of you music to my

33
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,460
ears yeah good group in there too good to see everybody so I got I gotta say

34
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,580
right now even though he's not here I just want to say at the top of the show

35
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,980
before I forget thank you to Wes for filling in and thank you to the beard

36
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:03,500
for stopping by and and people like you I'm not exactly sure why turns out when

37
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,740
we get you off the show the show just gets better I think they just like you

38
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,860
in general we put you on user and they like you we put you on Linux unplugged

39
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,780
and they like you so that's okay I'll launch like 15 shows maybe they can tell

40
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,020
maybe they can tell the impressiveness of the beard through the podcast like

41
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,640
you know maybe it like shows up on like something adds a certain warmth to the

42
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,940
broad that's what it is dude so anyways thank you guys for filling it how did it

43
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,580
go did it go okay pretty smooth did the soundboard machine crash on you guys no

44
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,940
because when I got back like the soundboard stuff was all reset I think I

45
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,780
might have restarted the app okay well I managed to restore the soundboard files

46
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,900
and it's just fine like hmm I wonder what happened but yeah otherwise place

47
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,500
was in pretty good shape I gotta say shows went out on time the trains kept

48
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,420
running I'm just gonna take off more often good in fact I just posted about

49
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:55,060
what two three hours ago the Montana fix it is the vlog post of my trip to

50
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,060
Montana ended up going down there with Noah and his family and had a great time

51
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,140
and hit a technical snafu which of course no one I had to spring into

52
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,380
action to solve so that sort of ended up in the vlog too unexpectedly it's pretty

53
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,780
I think it's a pretty good vlog I think it sets the bar now for the vlog it's

54
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,020
vlog 48 the Montana fix you can just find it over at Jupiter broadcasting

55
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,940
comm and while we're doing kind of admin II stuff here at the top of the show

56
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,940
probably worth mentioning that we've announced the winner of the XPS 13

57
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:29,420
developer edition sweepstakes in user air 18 indie there's some other big

58
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:35,260
announcements in there there are user air 18 and I begin the conversation it's

59
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,900
a really good conversation we have mr. chase Nunes stopped by and he gives us

60
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,260
his perspective of somebody who watches Linux from afar and we talk about some

61
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,380
I think compelling Linux II stuff in that episode like really good good yeah

62
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,380
I really enjoyed having chase on there yeah me too and it was like the

63
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,940
conversation was great because you and I we have our long held positions on some

64
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,420
of these topics and Chase is coming at it with a fresh eye and because he's

65
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,020
dabbled with a certain amount of understanding so it makes for a really

66
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,820
interesting he's a noob that knows things yeah he's an informed a noob

67
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,180
exactly and without bias so it brings a fresh interesting perspective to it so

68
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,500
that's user air 18 plus the winner of the XPS 13 sweepstakes which is pretty

69
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,660
cool all right so you let's start with the big news that I was teasing this is

70
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,340
what really is it's it's like tangently Linux related definitely affects us

71
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,700
Linux users and it's the big news from Adobe today as we go on air that they

72
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,020
are and announcing the end of life for the flash player I don't get like crazy

73
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,420
excited it's 2020 isn't this like the third time they've announced that though

74
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,940
feels like it is this one though has a different weight to it so they're first

75
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,660
of all they're being specific they say specifically we will stop updating and

76
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,620
distributing the flash player at the end of 2020 and encourage content creators

77
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,980
to migrate any existing flash content to new open formats like they mentioned

78
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:58,740
HTML 5 and WebGL earlier Adobe will continue to support flash on a number

79
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,960
of major OS's and browsers that currently support flash content through

80
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,540
the planned end of life this will include issuing regular security patches

81
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,020
maintaining OS's brow and browser compatibility and adding feature

82
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,780
capabilities as needed now there was a there was a line here that they said

83
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,300
Adobe will continue to support flash on a number of major OS's and browsers so

84
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:23,860
I was like is Linux in that list and it is it is it is it is actually it is

85
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,260
actually in that list Linux x86 is in that list so we will continue to get

86
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:36,620
updates 32 and I think just 60 the real question is is the ending of Adobe

87
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,860
handling that also going to be the end of like pepper flash because that's

88
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:46,660
handled by Google mm-hmm well so the chromium blog announced I went so I

89
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,980
went a little digging I was like well what's WebKit got to say what's

90
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,740
chromium got to say and what's Mozilla I haven't I haven't seen any post from

91
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,460
Mozilla yet but I did get a couple from chromium and WebKit and so they sort of

92
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,980
they have like a nice guy sort of like yay flash is dead they're like flash

93
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,300
really helped pioneer our rich web experience also it's an 80% usage

94
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,300
decline dropping like a rock well that's that's still not quite answering pepper

95
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,820
flash though because chromium did flash through the native stuff right pepper

96
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,300
flashes Google I don't know I so it sounds like they're going to continue to

97
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,860
Chrome will increasingly require here's what here's what they say so chrome

98
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,100
itself this is of course on the chromium blog so it's a little confusing but

99
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:31,020
chrome itself will increasingly require explicit permission from users to run

100
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:37,100
flash content until it is completely removed at the end of 2020 that makes

101
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,460
sense so that's at least the chrome story of course I actually already ran

102
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,420
into that where I couldn't figure out why a website wouldn't work but it turned

103
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:50,060
out that flash was disabled in that website by default oh and the chrome do

104
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,820
that for you yes but it also didn't tell me that I needed to allow it so I had to

105
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,980
go digging to find the setting so Safari's been starting to do that too I

106
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:05,060
believe and so WebKit sort of where Google had like this really really nice

107
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:11,460
sort of flash has helped enrich the web for years WebKit had more of a dance on

108
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,220
its grave kind of approach it's interesting to see the different tones

109
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,640
and in the projects and in fact they sort of promote the fact that they've

110
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,020
essentially been pushing this direction since 2010 and highlight the fact that

111
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,940
they've been making flash harder and harder to use in WebKit essentially

112
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,820
well really they've been they've been pushing this direction since they

113
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:37,340
launched the iPhone yeah yeah without flash mm-hmm yeah they actually kind of

114
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:41,140
call that out here they say they say Apple users have have experienced the

115
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,580
web without flash for some time iPhone iPad and iPod touch have never supported

116
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:50,860
flash for the Mac the transition from flash began in 2010 when flash no longer

117
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,420
was pre-installed today if users install flash it remains off by default Safari

118
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:02,060
requires explicit approval on each website before running the flash plug-in

119
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,260
interesting so what do you think of him then yeah well so what do you think

120
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,660
poppy I think it's surprising it took this long it's sad that there's loads of

121
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,700
little games and stuff that won't work and any more but yeah goodbye good

122
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,420
riddance agreed hmm bashful fruit you have a comment about 2007 as in this

123
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:28,780
should have happened in 2007 pretty much I mean they were in denial for three

124
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,100
years it sounds like I mean you could already see the writing on the wall and

125
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,540
the way it sparked up in the developer community at the beginning yeah although

126
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,940
you know you talk to folks and they'll tell you that flash is still best at X

127
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,300
and you know like it's true nothing fully replaces its entire set of

128
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,860
capabilities and and it seems to be the most capable live stream player like

129
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,140
we've played around with a lot with that what are your thoughts on that because I

130
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,340
know you know I think it's mostly able to be replaced now yeah stuff like video

131
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,020
JS and right you know kind of stuff yeah but that's what that's like in the last

132
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,300
how long has that been good a year a year or two yeah yeah oh you think too

133
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,260
maybe a year yeah yeah so to me it's like it's we're getting there but

134
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,020
there's still areas there's still like parts of it that aren't quite there yet

135
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,180
but I think with the announcement of the end of flash that it's gonna accelerate

136
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:22,980
those those things that are missing mm-hmm also the the announcement of DRM

137
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:29,460
for HTML 5 although that upsets a lot of people will probably probably helped

138
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:34,700
right I sure this in interesting that is a silver lining I suppose because that

139
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,620
was the one big thing for live streaming that was missing is the ability to do

140
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,180
DRM yeah yeah I suppose you could put that way

141
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,140
bashful robot you think it's gonna be like IP v6 well yeah no one's really

142
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,340
gonna touch it until they have to or until there's a better alternative which

143
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,020
you know everyone mentioned it's taken this long and maybe it's because there

144
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:56,660
isn't something there but until you have to do it no one's gonna do it it's extra

145
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,140
work it's debt I don't agree like most of the the major things that have used

146
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,220
flash have already transitioned to HTML 5 like YouTube and Twitch they're they're

147
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:11,660
massive and they didn't have to switch to HTML 5 but they did one twitch still

148
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:15,380
is heavily in flash this is why we're gonna transition Jupiter broadcasting

149
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,580
over to silver light it's an obvious direction of the future right I mean

150
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:25,740
silver lights really the streaming platform a choice for users you know

151
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,380
what I hate is frickin dependency hell hate it and I'm gonna be honest it's one

152
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:35,580
of the reasons I was initially drawn to Debian is because the app get command

153
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,100
would figure out tons this is back and this is back before yum and DNF where

154
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,060
you would just go raw dog and rpm onto a redhat box and then go figure out all

155
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:48,720
the dependencies yourself and use rpm just it was awful and now you just use

156
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,460
Docker well yeah and Debian went a step further but it's still one system

157
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,780
there's things like the depend specifically on other things you know

158
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:02,220
you could use Apache and PHP for example here and when we talked last don't I

159
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:06,820
can't do that I gotta remember when we talked two weeks ago about fedora 26 we

160
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,180
discussed a little bit with Matthew Miller a bolt Ron which as the name kind

161
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:15,540
of sounds is kind of like bolt on it's it's a modular server system that

162
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,700
they're working where you could have individual components of fedora be

163
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,340
replaced or upgraded without causing this crazy-ass dependency help and I

164
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:28,580
wasn't quite sure how this worked but Langdon white did a post over at fedora

165
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,900
magazine org that gives us some of the technical details of how fedora is

166
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,700
going to be pulling this off so the fedora modularity working group yes

167
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:40,540
there is such a thing has an objective and the objective is to generically work

168
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,340
towards modularity its crux is to allow users to safely access the right

169
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:49,500
versions of what they want so imagine some hotshot web developer needs a very

170
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,060
specific version of whatever they use Ruby on rails I don't I you know I you

171
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,700
can you can imagine your own scenario the working group took the requirement

172
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,260
that they they they took on the requirement to impact fedora infrastructure

173
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,740
user base and package community as little as possible the group also wanted

174
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:12,220
to increase the quality and reliability of fedora itself the distribution and

175
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,660
drastically increase the automation and speed of delivery I think this is one

176
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,100
of the reasons why rawhide is getting to a more usable point too as a result the

177
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,500
group didn't treat this as a greenfield experiment sort of like how butter fs

178
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,580
was created instead they took a rational approach that took years towards working

179
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,060
towards something like you know I mean they instead of taking like that kind of

180
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,340
which is like a more rational approach instead of working for years they took a

181
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:36,980
more rational approach and they just tried to keep the tool sets pretty

182
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,860
minimal and implement them as they need and then make slight adjustments to

183
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:45,340
existing systems and that eventually in totality provides something new the

184
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,060
result is a package set that can be sort of thought of as virtualized separate

185
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,780
repositories that's how they're doing this so this is in other words the

186
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,940
client tooling treats the traditional flat repo as if it was a set of repos

187
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:07,060
that are only enabled when you want that version of a component virtualizing out

188
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:13,180
the repos is I think and package set is pretty smart and so bolt on or bolt Ron

189
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:19,340
sorry is sort of this NF is this this effort this initiative and they have

190
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:24,580
stuff ready to try right now and they're looking for feedback I think this to me

191
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:30,340
is a pretty important part of if you if you're going to use the package

192
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,540
management system to deliver software this is what has to be fixed if you're

193
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,740
if you're good if you're not using Docker or flat pack or snaps and you

194
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,020
want to deliver software to a server distribution or something like that this

195
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,980
is what you got to fix but I kind of feel like it might be it's sort of like

196
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,980
fixing the barn door after the cows have gotten home speaking of the barn door

197
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:01,220
mr. West pain is joining us hello hello so we were just going over bolt Ron the

198
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,420
modular server preview of fedora it's getting out there and they're asking

199
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,080
people to try it out right now the whole idea is you know they're gonna do

200
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,340
virtualized repositories and package set so you can overlay like very specific

201
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,460
things and upgrade individual components without dragging the entire OS of

202
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,300
dependencies with you I love it I gotta say like we when we talked about it on

203
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,960
the earlier show I was excited but after having read about it a little bit in

204
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,340
between I'm this seems like it's gonna be great I kind of tried it yet but I

205
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,020
kind of want to pick wimpy's brain but I'm gonna ask you first right on since

206
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:38,540
you just sat down isn't this kind of solving last year's problem isn't kind

207
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,420
of the future snaps and flat packs for this kind of thing or Docker even

208
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:50,660
possibly um but I some of those seem like they they fit different use cases

209
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,940
this kind of excited me in a way that kind of more reminded me of things like

210
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,380
Nix OS and where does it give some more flexibility on the you know the open

211
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:04,980
source sort of how we craft the bulk of our packages and I mean maybe we'll go

212
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,700
to a place where everything is in a snap and that such but it seems like that

213
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,820
it's certainly going to take a long time and is in many ways kind of a drastic

214
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,460
shift in other ways not but this seems like it's a little bit more you know it

215
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,260
would let me maybe much more easily install three different versions of Ruby

216
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,340
or something right exactly but without like having a snap for each one which

217
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,700
would maybe break more of my you know current deployment strategies okay all

218
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,780
right so that's good that's good I like that that's okay now you got me

219
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,740
reconsidering I kind of wanted to so mr. wimpy I believe is a pretty big fan of a

220
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,940
universal package formats like snap and I'm wondering if you think there's space

221
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:44,780
for both like major reinnovation in how the underlying OS handles packages for

222
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,860
software delivery and universal package formats on top of that that's a lot

223
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:59,860
of questions I think I think Voltron is probably a result of the fact that

224
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:06,940
Flatpak is not ideally suited for distributing command-line applications

225
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:12,820
languages and services and things like that so I think it's it's not competing

226
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,380
with Flatpak in that regard it's complementing what what Flatpak offers

227
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,780
hmm okay fair enough anybody else want to jump in on the mobile room before we

228
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:25,380
move on I I look at it as in the back of my mind I run this fantasy scenario

229
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,700
where Chris last runs Fedora for a year and he runs it on the desktop and on the

230
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,020
server this guy's crazy obviously not real Chris last cuz that'd be crazy but

231
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,020
if he was gonna do it this would probably be a something like this and a

232
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:40,820
Fedora OS trees stuff would probably be a good way to pull it off yeah I if you

233
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,740
want to read more about it and try it out you can find a link to the Fedora

234
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:50,140
magazine in the show notes so there was a vulnerability going around that uses

235
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:57,020
Windows MSI files to exploit the Linux desktop well what that seems crazy see

236
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,860
this is what happens when a boon to switches to gnome if they hadn't no I'm

237
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,340
kidding yeah right so it's called bad taste and this is this is so funny I

238
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,860
want to talk about it obviously you know if you don't know if you've noticed but

239
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,300
I'm not covering on vulnerabilities as much these days because by the time we

240
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,980
talk about it it's old news everybody knows there's been the disclosure and

241
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,580
everybody but this is a fun one so this is a vulnerability that actually resides

242
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:24,660
in Nautilus gnome files but it's exploited by MSI files so it's kind of

243
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,580
funny the third-party thumbnail er that's bundled in with gnome files tries

244
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:38,300
to look into an MSI file and extract out like a thumbnail and somebody was poking

245
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,540
around and discovered that they could hide malicious VB scripts inside the

246
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,540
names of MSI files when the user accesses a folder on his or her computer

247
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,060
where the malicious MSI files just saved you don't even click on it it's just you

248
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,700
go to that folder so maybe you know yeah somebody downloads something I heard a

249
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,420
story recently about somebody's mom or aunt that was trying to watch streaming

250
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,760
movies and kept downloading exe's and if it weren't for on being on Linux they

251
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,460
would have been infected oh yeah so you can have these things just show up in

252
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,780
your downloads folder when you don't even expect it especially for average

253
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,860
users so the gnome files would try to automatically parse that file to

254
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:15,260
extract an icon from its contents and they would display that in your window

255
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:19,180
but the problem is once you parse that MSI file looking for the icon the

256
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:25,140
thumbnail er script also reads the file name and executes the code found within

257
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:32,920
there you go so it's there's little tricks you can do right now like you go

258
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,700
to new thing the user share thumbnail er's file if you want but I think that

259
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,580
was just that was our that was the funny exploit of the week MSI files that are

260
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,860
screwing over gnome files users that's I mean yeah you'd see that you'd be like

261
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:48,260
well whatever okay that I don't even have to scan that now everybody proceed

262
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:52,500
to be scared freak out and I've seen a number of these kind of things though

263
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,220
where specifically different file types that we're trying to create previews

264
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:03,060
from or sound or window it happens to Windows too we are not alone but it does

265
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,540
seem to be the act of parsing a file but I you know I suppose anytime when you

266
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,180
have an a program executing code and it's taking input if you're not super

267
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,420
careful about the sanity of that input it's just something like you know how

268
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,580
they'll mark downloaded files sometimes or you know don't let you run down but

269
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,340
even if the file isn't marked executable because the Nautilus thumbnail

270
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,340
I was proposing is like you do we need like some you know in the metadata on

271
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,900
this file that we need to specify something that the system then like

272
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,420
don't thumbnail don't preview don't don't interact with unless approved I

273
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,980
mean a really obvious stupid hack would be just disabled thumb nailing on the

274
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:47,460
quote-unquote downloads folder containerized thumbnail generation you

275
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,180
know that's actually the route it would go to like a whole fake file system

276
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,420
would mount up a Linux system would be spawned X would be started your browser

277
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,500
be executed the file be downloaded man that sounds very Apple II yeah that's

278
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:05,820
pretty much an Apple would do and it might just work oh man that is so there

279
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,620
you go that is your cyber attack of the week everybody you could just use

280
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:15,940
dolphin oh or sonar I'm sure we also be a or the command line yeah just use LS

281
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,620
because those inferior ones aren't capable of generating thumbnails that's

282
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,020
true I guess it could it could happen there too although I have not seen this

283
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,260
story for dolphin I don't you know what I don't I don't ever have my

284
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,940
directory in big icon view anyways I'm always list view I need as much

285
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,820
information in there yeah totally that's how I roll that is how you know if you

286
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:40,220
if you're like me if you like a lot of information you might like ting huh go

287
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:43,740
to Linux dot ting comm they give you all the information you need right there in

288
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,540
their dashboard they hide nothing from you one of the things that made it

289
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,740
really simple for me with our business account is I can name the lines in the

290
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,180
web interface and then on our bill reporting everywhere throughout the UI

291
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,420
and the apps on the phones those nicknames show up and when you have

292
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:01,540
multiple lines and why wouldn't you it's six dollars for a line so it makes

293
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,340
giving phones out to staff and family members economical especially if you

294
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,420
already have a CDMA or GSM device to check their BYOD page then it's just

295
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,020
your usage it's six dollars for the line whatever uncle Sam's cut is and then

296
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,240
your usage it's brilliant so if you got like the beard over there on the Wi-Fi I

297
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,060
mean like that's forget he pays for me that's like that's very true actually

298
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,980
and if I didn't have like beard labeled and I know I just look at that I see

299
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,540
beard never uses hardly any data like you know maybe makes a couple of calls

300
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,180
it's not a big deal it's not a big deal and I love that about ting because it's

301
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,020
approachable for small businesses it's perfect for families and it scales to

302
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,300
large businesses you can get started by going to Linux dot ting comm take $25

303
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,820
off a device or save $25 if you bring one check out their Twitter page to at

304
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:54,540
ting FTW they're doing a giveaway right now of the moto e4s and $250

305
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,100
in credit which would last a really long time since the average bills $23 a line

306
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:05,740
when you add everything up also great deal right now on the moto g5 plus this

307
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,900
is a CDMA and GSM phone so it's really nice on ting since they have both

308
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,380
networks you can pick what works better two hundred and seventy four dollars you

309
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,700
can get it unlocked it's new it's a great Android like they just made like

310
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,100
small tweaks to Android they're generally good and it's a solid well

311
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,740
built phone from Motorola for $274 no contract nor the termination fee you can

312
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,500
get started by going to linux.ting.com to get it at that price or bring your

313
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,260
own device linux.ting.com thanks to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

314
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:42,660
damn that's a good URL mm-hmm linux.ting.com so I was looking at the

315
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:47,300
world's most beautiful Linux distribution ever staring at it really

316
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,680
it's a little uncomfortable about it this is one of those things where I've

317
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,980
never heard anybody say it out loud before so now I'm gonna be the first

318
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,140
guy to say it out loud I'm gonna sound like a jerk or you'll be the taste

319
00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:01,660
maker for this I hope so I think it's nitrex what do you think nitrex n-i-t-r-u-x

320
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,580
nitrex nitrex nitrex anybody in the mumble room checked out nitrex the

321
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:10,300
world's most beautiful Linux to distribution ever that's apparently

322
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:15,180
according to this review they say it's a Linux distribution focused on design it

323
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:20,900
introduces the Nomad desktop which is built on top of KDE Plasma 5 and cute

324
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:27,380
it's based on Ubuntu actually Ubuntu 17.10 to be in specific and it is

325
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,980
obviously because of that still under development although they say it's close

326
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,380
enough this is a quote from the devs it's close enough to a rolling release

327
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:40,460
model I am

328
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,900
that's that's no that isn't that no that is using the beta of Ubuntu does not

329
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:51,380
make it does not make a rolling release that is not how that works that's not

330
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,980
the math I agree okay all right we don't need to we don't need to go okay so it

331
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:59,660
does say I mean you're like focused on portable universal app format really

332
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:02,940
you're gonna disagree and say that using the beta is like I mean if you go from

333
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,180
beta to beta to beta like some sort of hooker then yeah it's are they saying

334
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:13,180
they're not doing that because you know when they say they're using the beta

335
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:19,260
they could just be moving to the next beta when they have the the freeze man

336
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,940
that sounds like the kind of desktop I want to roll but then I don't get why

337
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:28,220
they just wouldn't be using Debian unstable as their base yeah yeah that's

338
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,740
well because a bunch of does a lot of hard work that's why they got those

339
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,460
repos man they have you seen how fast those repos are I'd love to re-host you

340
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,500
those repo I'd love to just reuse those repos are you over here crapping on

341
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:46,100
Debian now ouch I just it's funny how many distros are coming up based on 1710

342
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,700
when 1804 is clearly around the corner and and aren't you excited so clearly

343
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,540
the better way to go one thing I noticed about this is they're saying it's a

344
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,140
reincarnation of the old district I didn't even know they had yeah they had

345
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,740
an old one based on 1510 back in the day oh yeah they stopped development because

346
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,300
of a problem with system D and network manager they gave up I don't mean to

347
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,500
laugh at them because you know because they were using beta for that they were using system

348
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,580
they were using system during the system D transition they were you on the beta

349
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,820
huh which was like you mean they were on the rolling release is that what you

350
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:19,260
know they were on they were on the they're they're rolling beta ish thing

351
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:26,140
that was like right before the transition happened so it just started

352
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:29,620
it was boy that was a bad time I say they were beta testers yeah only they're

353
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,700
trying to build a distro at the same time it's kind of confusing to have an

354
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,380
ex.org which is like almost nix or an ex OS org it's really simple to be fair to

355
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,660
be fair even people that just normally use their desktops have problems with

356
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,980
network manager I feel like what this really is and they're not saying it is I

357
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,420
think it's neon I think it's repackaged neon with a nice theme because they say

358
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:57,300
the current version of nitrix is based on the dev branch of Ubuntu on top of

359
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,460
that we're getting continuous updates to plasma provided by neon devs for which

360
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,220
we enabled both git repositories and finally our homebrewed software like

361
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,380
nomad desktop all right you know what I mean I think it's I think it's it's if

362
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,100
you are a cute fan and you like the plasma desktop are looking for maybe a

363
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,180
different take on it it might be worth the look I mean we're having some fun

364
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:21,020
here but you know maybe something it's a hybrid concept maybe something that's

365
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:27,660
lighter than full KDE but isn't LXQT that's not finished yet well I mean it's

366
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,980
how I'm saying it's lighter when it adds more stuff and also you KDE plasma is

367
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:36,820
not heavy at all so that's oh there's a separation between plasma and the rest

368
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,980
of KDE now is my point so yeah cuz KDE is a community in a project not plasma

369
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,500
well so it's sort of like why I sit around and fantasize about what the

370
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,420
budgie desktop might be once Aiki stops fixing absolutely everything else in the

371
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,780
distro and focuses on the new I want my new desktop damn it well I I hear budgies

372
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,220
complete Chris well no it turns out that there as when a distro grows there's

373
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,740
there are things that legitimately need to be replaced and so I understand you

374
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,140
know some fine plumbing is being done but I do fantasize about it about a

375
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:12,140
desktop that Aiki and team have worked on that is cute based but not plasma 5

376
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:18,900
itself but still uses kwin and GTK apps look like first-class citizens it just

377
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:22,500
seems like a perfect world and this actually looking at the screenshots I

378
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,500
gotta say it's pretty it kind of very flashy website I actually used nitrates

379
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,540
a little bit oh give me the new version oh yeah tell me what you think it is

380
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,180
interesting you know and those things that they're doing there the

381
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,060
customizations they're doing are kind of interesting like one of the most

382
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:41,900
annoying things for plasma for me is the notification structure because it

383
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,780
doesn't keep track of a history of notifications anymore and that is

384
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,700
incredibly irritating and has been for over a year for me and to the point

385
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,020
where there's like a telegram group for it and there's big bug threads for it

386
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,020
and all this other stuff anyway they built their own solution to that and I

387
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,500
think they did it pretty well it's there's some bugs in it is in the

388
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,140
structure because they kind of built all their system tray everything that's like

389
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,780
a system tray widget would go into this new system tray they built so their

390
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:16,140
notifications are stored into that so that it's pretty cool overall but it

391
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:25,340
feels like a like a Mac elementary style like menu launcher and then then Mac

392
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,740
everything else so they have like global menu and if the dock installed by

393
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,860
default and things like that so it's interesting concepts and I do like the

394
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:38,100
fact that they have they've built some cool stuff one of the things that I

395
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:45,900
wish that plasma distros had was a more cute based graphical firewall

396
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:52,020
and they built one for their nomad thing it's called the nomad firewall and it's

397
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:58,560
basically a system settings module that is front-end GUI for ufw interested you

398
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:03,820
know do you have you happen to seen what the licenses for that that particular

399
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,500
one I haven't looked at that no but they seem to be gpl3 on everything I've seen

400
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:17,740
boy it's I'm still kind of trying to figure out where this this is nice but

401
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,620
yeah without with the world that has Alex cute what do you think would be with

402
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:26,900
the world that has Alex cute where does this fit I'm not sure where that this

403
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:32,180
fits in it I can't tell enough from the website as to what it is exactly yeah it

404
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:37,060
seems like when if it's if it's something on top of neon or kabuto or

405
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,260
whatever does seem to be their own custom desktop I don't want to say it's

406
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,700
an entire environment but it's not a stiff it's not the typical plasma shell

407
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,740
I will yeah I will say that at least from what they showed their their

408
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:55,180
settings interface looks way better than Katie I think it is the Katie one it is

409
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,340
the same I think it is it's just different yeah they the icons are way

410
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,980
clear and then they're the borders between each segment are more I guess

411
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:08,020
it's just more clearly defined yeah the borders are more defined the hover

412
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,260
effect isn't doesn't it doesn't have that same margin padding structure so it

413
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,740
looks awkward but like there's certain things about it that are really cool and

414
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,820
there's other parts that it looked like they there it's not finished yet and it

415
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:23,780
is it looks looks like it's on a beta so there's this the interesting thing about

416
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:28,620
it is it feels like an enthusiast that doesn't want to edit anything that wants

417
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:34,300
a Mac approach so like you can start with this Mac approach and then customize

418
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,300
it however you want because it does seem to be built on plasma I looked at the

419
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,780
widgets and they're all very they they all seem to be plasma widgets so it

420
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,220
looks like they took plasma and then like made modifications to plasma itself

421
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:48,660
and then also installed the latte dock and some other things so oh and the the

422
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:53,900
menu that's in nitrix is as a custom menu they built is a custom applet so

423
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:57,300
that they are doing some modifications to plasma but it does feel like plasma

424
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:03,900
and it seems like they're doing an Ubuntu like rolling beta thing with the

425
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,820
neon packages on top of it which is kind of interesting and also to me kind of

426
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:14,200
scary to me because the those packages are made for the 1604 release of the

427
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:20,140
stack so it's kind of you know that could be a problem you know if any of

428
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,060
you looked at Alex cute seriously I was like actually this I was just gonna say

429
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,060
this story is making me want to give it another go cuz it's been it's been since

430
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,980
it was in it was earlier in an early stage of development since I looked at

431
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,940
it I haven't looked at it you've got an LXQ expert in the chat room at the

432
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,660
moment I was actually gonna suggest that maybe Simon should chime in it's you

433
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:40,920
know from from his perspective of somebody who works with Alex cute what

434
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:44,820
he thinks about this distro and Simon could can I throw a random tech question

435
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:51,260
at you too I is Kaywin in LXQ does that part of and how can you explain that to

436
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,820
is that like advice if I set up LXQ on my system can I use Kaywin as a

437
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:02,900
back-end window manager or whatever I believe you can I've done it in a VM

438
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,500
just to test but I mainly use it with open box in fact I'm running Alex cute

439
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:13,100
on my system right now with open box that's right yeah so yeah I can use

440
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,780
Kaywin on the back ends like I said I played around with it in a VM the main

441
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,980
reason why why somebody would want to use Kaywin with Alex cute is for Wayland

442
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:25,580
support and the only reason why why yeah the only reason why Alex cute hasn't

443
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:31,340
gone to 1.0 yet is Alex cute 1.0 is Wayland complete that's why that that

444
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,540
hasn't gone to 1.0 and we don't have any we don't have an ETA for you know I've

445
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,940
recently been doing some upstream Alex cute development and we don't have an

446
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:46,780
ETA for 1.0 but I know they're gonna do what was it that is I think it was 0.12

447
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,380
they're gonna do upstream within the next month or two okay okay well I guess

448
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,060
I'd put this out there to the audience if anybody's tried nitrix and wants to

449
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,620
write in and tell us what it's like mm-hmm no I it's like for me though I

450
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,580
like I think my time would probably be spent better with Alex cute you know

451
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,780
this I don't really want to bring it up again but this approach is kind of the

452
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:10,260
approach I was talking about when we were talking about pop OS I feel like

453
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,220
this is an approach that makes more sense they're doing significant

454
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,500
customization but they're basing it on top of the right distribution instead of

455
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,660
spinning it off into its own thing yeah from what I can tell I don't know if

456
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,300
it's a if it's a fork of plasma or if it's just something that sits on top of

457
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,180
plasma with some themes that's I haven't been able to tell that from looking at

458
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:30,820
the website I based on what I've experienced it looks like it's just

459
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,340
sitting on top yeah that's my guess too by looking at it it is the difference

460
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,620
there's the things I've used on it it just seemed like it's on top but there's

461
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,740
there are there are things that are customized that are not plasma at all

462
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:45,260
but it seems like they've they they changed it looks like they're just

463
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,300
replacing applets I wouldn't necessarily compare it with

464
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:54,700
neon because neon is is like plasma on top of the LTS Ubuntu and they're

465
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:59,500
trying to do I believe like a whole different experience with this and like

466
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,760
I said neon is just from what I can tell it's a it's a plasma testing ground

467
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,620
right I think the reason the only reason the neon thing comes up is that they say

468
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:14,800
specifically that they use neon packages okay gotcha so it's an it's an

469
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,420
interesting the desktop but they're doing things that are cool that they're

470
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,340
basing on an existing distro with some existing packages already built for them

471
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,980
then just making modifications but at the same time they are using a beta

472
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,540
release of a distro that's that's a weird it's if you're gonna provide a

473
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,860
package that's like all set up for you out of the box why would you base it on

474
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,260
a rolling beta thing that and then that that's sort of something I don't know why

475
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,220
would they do why would they not do it on you you know why would they not wait

476
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:51,140
for 1804 or why not 1704 I mean I'm just curious to see why if there's something

477
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,500
new in 1710 that they that they need or something along those lines there is one

478
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,740
more thing I wanted to point out that it's really cool that they have a they

479
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,480
built a custom module for system D inside of system settings so you can

480
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,460
make all your modifications to system D straight in the system setting so that's

481
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:11,660
pretty cool that's pretty nice all right so we got to put it I got to put the

482
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,820
call out there to see what people think I I'm tempted tempted but I got a

483
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,980
greater story to tell today and I'm already on a journey I can't I can't

484
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,360
deviate now otherwise I might give it a look myself this is where the community

485
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:30,220
can help you guys give me a hard time about slackwear last week actually was

486
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,600
thinking about taking a slackwear challenge you should I was thinking

487
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:36,060
about it it's just I'm really on a journey right now like I'm like on a I'm

488
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:42,100
on a path to a new distro for our production equipment is that and all my

489
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,740
all my systems upstairs my laptop and so I'm on a journey of a process of

490
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,620
elimination right now and I don't want to I don't want to get too distracted

491
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:54,420
you know Chris cuz I can distro hop for days girls last time people told you to

492
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,460
take a journey you ended up switching the entire studio to that distro so

493
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,180
maybe you should take another journey well see this is the thing this is why

494
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,780
I'm taking it slowly and methodically so I'll tell you more about it later but

495
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,060
first stretch your middle fingers out for a moment because it may be time to

496
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,180
point them once again in NVIDIA's general direction I don't maybe you guys

497
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:16,660
can talk me down from the ledge here but an NVIDIA developer who works on the

498
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:22,740
Linux graphic side so Aaron you shout out to Aaron Platner I think is I think

499
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:28,780
that's his name thank you for your hard work and now please accept this accept

500
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:34,280
this plea from your humble Linux podcast please consider supporting x wayland it

501
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,940
appears right now that NVIDIA has no plans to support applications running

502
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,900
under x wayland with the NVIDIA proprietary graphics driver which to me

503
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,460
seems like a bad thing since that's pretty much almost anything that's using

504
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,660
the proprietary driver today and it's not like we're gonna get games rebuilt

505
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:56,260
with Wayland support tomorrow and I just the amount of applications that would be

506
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:01,580
f'd in the a you might say seems great unless I'm misunderstanding the dramatic

507
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,420
impact this is going to have well doesn't that mean that Alex QT 1.0 won't

508
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:10,700
work on NVIDIA as long as you're in under Wayland with k-win right I don't

509
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,660
know because it's no because that would be innate no because that'd be talking

510
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,980
way anything that communicates Wayland will be good anything that's talking X

511
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,860
anything is talking through X Wayland that's sort of X translation

512
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:27,720
translation compatibility layer it seems like and this is oh man check out

513
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:35,540
architect oh every single time we talk about this oh everybody always brings up

514
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:40,740
AMD you know I actually think that NVIDIA position is a good position

515
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:46,460
because at some point you need to just make a hard break and stop supporting

516
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,700
legacy stuff all of the games that have ever been written ever well then you can

517
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,420
just go run them on X maybe one of my misunderstanding here this I guess yeah I

518
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,540
guess I mean so the thing is right it's like if they're not doing this thing but

519
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:03,900
no one's making any Linux gamer uninstall their X server I think X is

520
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,780
gonna be abandoned at some point anyway so those games will eventually not work

521
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,780
anyway well I don't know I mean well I'm sure are we that X isn't gonna be

522
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,260
around for another 10 I'm sure something still be around I'm just saying like

523
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:18,700
eventually if the argument is the things that are gonna be that currently

524
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,660
available are not gonna be available like well that will happen eventually

525
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,860
anyway I'm sure there'll be one distro just like didn't de novo that does that

526
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:31,100
doesn't use a system D that'll continue to use X until the end of time but I

527
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:35,780
think it's pretty clear that the future is Wayland well the chat room and

528
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,020
everybody listening right now shutting up their podcast player will tell you

529
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:43,740
the future is AMD and open-source drivers the problem is there are millions

530
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,340
of GTX cards already bought and paid for and one of the reasons people like to

531
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:50,740
use Linux is because they get value out of their existing hardware and now all

532
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:53,980
of a sudden we're gonna come along and say hey welcome to Linux go get an AMD card

533
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:59,060
I don't think that's gonna work so I appreciate that maybe AMD has a better

534
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:03,020
path forward driver wise but it's it's like that's like telling people have

535
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,180
battery life issues to switch to Cyanogen mod or whatever also just

536
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,240
because the Nvidia proprietary drivers won't support X-Wayland doesn't mean

537
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,340
that something like Novio won't that's that's fair oh by the way a real-time

538
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,620
update here in the show Simon just chiming in saying the next version of

539
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:23,060
LXQt release will have nice things like high DPI support that's really great and

540
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:26,900
tons of more polishing including compatibility with the latest Qt that is

541
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:32,200
awesome I I will be checking that out so what do you think bashful fruit is there

542
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:38,880
gonna be like a groundswell to fix this problem I don't necessarily think it'll

543
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,700
be a groundswell is more of making a smart ass client that someone will just

544
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,860
fork it and go back because they didn't want to keep go to the new one well

545
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:51,820
rumor has it the Debian project is working on rootless X right so maybe we

546
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:56,300
just solved the problem of X's security issues and you could be sitting there

547
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,500
running Wayland all day long and then when it comes time to game you just

548
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,620
launched rootless X somehow and switch over to a different different terminal

549
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:08,980
exactly I mean that's that's a hack but it would seems like would something

550
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:14,500
prevent you from running Wayland and a rootless X server on another console at

551
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:19,300
the same time I actually don't know that one technically seems like that would be

552
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:24,940
a plausible fix yeah becomes almost compliance like in some ways I just

553
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,420
can't really understand can anybody I mean so is it are we doing all of this

554
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,460
work I mean if we set the security stuff aside are we doing all of this so that

555
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,780
way we have tear-free flash video because I just I'm gonna just mention

556
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:40,020
we're gonna be flashing gonna be dead before we're all using Wayland that's my

557
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,500
prediction that's for sure I think it's more tear-free anything GPU accelerated

558
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:50,380
ever yeah I get tear I get tearing it is hard though I will say I mean like

559
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,180
especially when we were you know niche to begin with and then after like 20

560
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,940
years of X we're like yeah all right people are kind of supporting us now

561
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:04,700
great mm-hmm so it's probably gonna be a long time huh so anyways I guess you

562
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:11,940
know it's not time to get the pitchforks yet because it seems like the the Wayland

563
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:16,820
the big switch to Wayland I don't know I think 2020 would be optimistic I just I

564
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:21,180
just don't see it at this point yeah I would say five years probably yeah and

565
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:24,700
so it this might be a non-issue there might be other ways to run these

566
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,020
applications there may be some sort of compatibility layer that has a stable

567
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,780
API set created by a company that's experienced in this area that works in

568
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:36,460
open-source who knows who knows there may be other solutions to this problem

569
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,900
maybe in video will become open source at some point who knows maybe mark

570
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:46,020
shuttleworth can sit down with Aaron Platner over at Nvidia and espouse the

571
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:54,180
great benefits of mirror and it'll just get we'll just get this ball rolling so

572
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:58,820
wimpy I'm glad you are here sir because for about an hour and a half before the

573
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:03,940
show I got to play around with the latest alpha of Ubuntu Mate 1710 holy

574
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:09,820
smokes holy smokes and I have a couple questions couple couple grave concerns

575
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:16,100
and a few observations so that I am very very much looking forward to talking to

576
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:21,140
because holy cow what a release there may be some patreon leaks involved I

577
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,580
mean it's it's some good stuff I know prepare your bodies prepare your minds

578
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,060
West have you ever been into a candle store that's like super strong with

579
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:32,620
smells yeah and you know how they have those jars of coffee and you sniff that

580
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:37,100
jar of coffee and it resets the palate digital ocean comm go over to digital

581
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,620
ocean comm and use our promo code deal unplugged after you've created your

582
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:45,300
account once you sign up you go in there like a boss you make your account and

583
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,100
then you apply that promo code deal unplugged and you get a $10 credit it's

584
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:52,860
like digital oceans like here here's a credit card with ten dollars on it go

585
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:57,020
cray now that's nice because they have a five dollar a month rig which you could

586
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:02,580
run two months for absolutely free or go the even more like sophisticated on top

587
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:08,020
of it route and do their hourly yeah so great I'm even I don't even know what

588
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,300
the like lower prices are cuz like three cents an hour like I'm like that's

589
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,700
better that's fine that's I've literally only need it for a couple of hours that

590
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:21,780
is it's so fast it's so so stinking fast it was a actually a topic of

591
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:26,500
conversation recently just how how stinking fast there their systems are

592
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:32,340
because first of all it's SSDs throughout everything and it's massively

593
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:36,060
taken advantage of I'll just put it that way then they have Linux as the host

594
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,420
system we all love that KVM for the virtualizer 40 gigabit networks to

595
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,980
ensure uptime and throughput highly available block storage you can get your

596
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:48,620
systems deployed in seconds the entire stack or just a base system monitoring

597
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:52,220
alerting so you can collect metrics and monitor performance and get alerts so

598
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,500
you can look like a ten-person team even when you're one or two people the

599
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,460
pre-built open source apps to are done right it's not like magic config scripts

600
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:02,340
that don't make any sense it's like if you hired a really good sysadmin you

601
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,220
went in there and he built a system and then they took an image of it I wonder I

602
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,900
wonder and then you top that all off with a really great documentation

603
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,860
incredibly straightforward pricing dashboard they even offer images for

604
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:20,900
those crazy BSD folks yeah I know I know they even they have the audacity to work

605
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,500
with the projects upstream to can you imagine such a thing that's insane

606
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:28,480
providing free hosting for many in the open source community and giving API so

607
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,860

to you out in the audience for using do unplugged when you do sign up apply to

611
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:49,300
your account do unplugged man it is super useful I was on a network over the

612
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:53,460
weekend that was not so friendly for a little bit so I had to do some you know

613
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:56,740
tunneling over DNS what was that was perfect I didn't want to mess with the

614
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:03,380
servers I already had new do droplet boom back online yep yep yep so there is

615
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:10,100
there's a lot to cover in Ubuntu land these days and so you could say thank

616
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,820
you if you if you're not an Ubuntu fan because I could have made this entire

617
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:17,860
show about it so I'm saving really the best right now and I want to talk about

618
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,700
Ubuntu Mate 1710 they're actually I think a new alpha release just came out

619
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:26,300
today I'm I'm being sneaky on patreon two days two oh oh in two days oh okay the

620
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:30,540
paint the patrons got the release notes early access but the download it's gonna

621
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:38,860
be on Thursday oh teasing teasing wow so this is a huge release the the I would

622
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:42,460
say the number one thing that stood out to me when I tried it is how tight the

623
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:47,380
the mutiny tweak option is when you run the Ubuntu or the Mate tweak and you go

624
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,580
into the different layouts and you choose mutiny I mean it it really looked

625
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:55,900
like unity 7 with after I made a few small tweaks and I turned on compass I

626
00:46:55,900 --> 00:47:00,460
was pretty much I was pretty much it back in unity 7 so it that was the map

627
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,940
that was the mode that I played around with with this new release the most I

628
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:08,820
think my favorite feature wimpy and I didn't even notice it until I went to do

629
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:13,700
it was the complete super key support which I didn't realize how much that

630
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,140
have bugged me until I tapped it and it worked and I went oh yeah that used to

631
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:22,000
be a problem yeah oh that's that's huge for me too wow that yeah and and me you

632
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,980
know that's not there by accident right but it's funny though because it's one

633
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,780
of those things where it's not just touching one project to make that work

634
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:33,500
right yeah I mean there are so many people that have been involved in making

635
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:40,820
that happen so in earlier releases the Marte menu which used to be called the

636
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:45,980
advanced menu in Marte tweak had super key support but it was like super key

637
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:51,620
support in a lot of the smaller desktop environments and launches in that you

638
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:57,140
could press super to open a menu but it swallowed the super key so if you had

639
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:02,460
any other key bindings that used the super key they just didn't work out so

640
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:09,660
Aiki obviously cooked up Budgie and then he Budgie the brisk menu for Marte yeah

641
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:15,180
and we I added a goal in there to add super key support and somebody from the

642
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:19,660
community stepped in Victor Carra I think his name is or Carra I'm sorry

643
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:24,940
Victor if I've butchered your name and he actually landed the fixes in brisk to

644
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:31,100
make it work but then he went around and started adding the same patches to the

645
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:35,340
Marte menu and when he started doing that he realized that the underlying

646
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:39,380
libraries weren't implemented properly and Marte settings demon wasn't doing

647
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:44,060
the right thing and Marte doc applet wasn't doing the right thing so he has

648
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:50,420
been laying down patches all over the place so that super key works but more

649
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:56,060
importantly if you've got other key bindings they work as well and it sounds

650
00:48:56,060 --> 00:49:00,100
like such a simple thing but it's been a heap of work and I'm I'm really indebted

651
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:07,300
to him because he's turned Marte from a thing that had kind of janky super key

652
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,420
support to to real first-class super key support and it makes a huge difference

653
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:16,780
to the way I use my computer now because I just mash super key type enter and I

654
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:20,380
am off I think there's several more systems that will now be on this next

655
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,920
release I think is a direct result I can't tell you to me it's like if for

656
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,140
some reason it's muscle memory smash super key ter enter and that has to be

657
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:33,380
smashed you know delicate nothing it's I'd command this thing okay so I know

658
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,780
something else has been getting polished really for several releases is the

659
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,100
heads-up display which was one of the really kind of cool features when I was

660
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:45,660
using unity heavily I drifted away from using it but I do remember during my

661
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,380
heyday of using unity 7 the HUD was handy and for those of you that aren't

662
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:56,420
familiar I I think at least in the unity world essentially it was this tool that

663
00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,540
you could execute with a keyboard command and like alt super or whatever

664
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:03,460
whatever I can't remember what the command was and I think just all okay

665
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,300
alt and I think it talked D bus and it would read all of the menus on an

666
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,140
application over D bus and then it would expose them as a command like so you

667
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:16,580
could type in if you wanted to do file export you could just type in export

668
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,940
into the HUD and it would just pull it up instead of having to dig around so

669
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:23,540
you didn't have to take your hand off the keyboard to use the menus mm-hmm is

670
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:27,300
it would be am I getting this right and is that what's coming or at least

671
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:32,700
getting even better in Matei yeah so we we started that journey in Ubuntu Mate

672
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:39,060
1610 and it was not ready so we we pulled it and in this cycle it's now

673
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:45,420
ready for use so this works hand-in-glove with the global menus that have also

674
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:50,700
been reworked and it means that yes just as you've described you can open your

675
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:54,060
application and in in Ubuntu Mate it's a slightly different keyboard

676
00:50:54,060 --> 00:51:00,500
combination it's super alt to activate the HUD although Victor is determined he

677
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:06,860
tells me to make the necessary changes throughout the various places so that

678
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:11,220
you could activate it with just alt as well so he's he's like a dog with a bone

679
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,080
at this at the moment chasing these issues down but this is a really

680
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:19,060
powerful feature and it's one that I really valued what I obviously been

681
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:24,180
using unity for quite a while on a day-to-day basis and have recently

682
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:28,580
switched back to Marte on my main machine and one of the features I loved

683
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:34,020
was the HUD particularly like editing podcasts and you're in audacity and you

684
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:38,420
want to find the appropriate effects and filters using the HUD makes actually

685
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,580
digging out those effects and filters really fast oh yeah and also in things

686
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:46,940
like libre office and GIMP where you know image processing things are

687
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:51,700
scattered to the four corners of the UI you know it's really useful for just

688
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,540
quickly accessing stuff so I love that yeah yeah me too in fact I was just

689
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,660
sitting here thinking about how handy that is when I'm on air cuz it makes

690
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:02,380
things so friggin quick also improvements to indicator support which

691
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,620
is something that seems like it's a lot of work on every release what is there

692
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:12,180
still work to be done on indicators no we're done now this congrats yeah that

693
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,580
is good just in time to really I mean this is yeah this is looking like one of

694
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,980
those releases where if I was if I was really if I was really a big fan of

695
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:24,620
unity and I wanted a home to move to that reminded me a lot of it and that

696
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:29,020
workflow with the mate tweak tool you just it's like one drop down away you

697
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:34,700
choose mutiny and also I turned on compass is my compositor and it it

698
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:39,340
really felt a lot like home because we have a I was doing an AB test cuz I have

699
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:43,180
a unity 7 system right here that I'm running mumble on to talk to you guys

700
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:48,020
and so I ran it on the system right next to it my main presenter machine and was

701
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:54,380
doing sort of an AB and it's it's pretty great it's close yeah it'll get closer

702
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:58,460
in time as well but it's it's done without sacrificing some of the more

703
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:03,660
traditional things about about a bunta mate that I liked so I it was a really

704
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:06,620
it was a pretty salt I have to ask you that would be grave concern over this

705
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:12,460
one grave concern okay Firefox 50 what is going on here can you just somebody I

706
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:16,900
mean this is one of these 54 is out now this is one of those things who it could

707
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,740
who it canonicals in charge of this this is just this this is what happens in the

708
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,100
in the dev cycle you'll find that packages that are being revved you know

709
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:34,460
regularly in the in the released it is your fault I tease I tease I install

710
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,900
chrome immediately anyway so it's fine as does everyone else yeah yeah that

711
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:45,860
software but yeah okay well that's what you know you're that user are you oh the

712
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:49,980
best browser ever I was gonna give it a go but it was it was it was so old I was

713
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,780
like why does this feel so slow like Firefox has gotten fat oh oh that's what

714
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,340
so then I just you know what here's my tip for you

715
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:02,260
Ubuntu dash but a dash welcome space tack be you hit that right boom software

716
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:05,820
boutique flies right open cue up a couple of things and you go to the main

717
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:09,300
screen the new I like that cue animation that it does there's like there's like

718
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:15,020
a yeah there's like it's just tops it really is like I I opened up I knew I

719
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:19,700
went in there I saw the internet section there was chromium there was a brave did

720
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:23,620
fail to install a live bug report there but I figure that probably that'll

721
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:28,020
probably work later on I do want to give brave ago mm-hmm and then and then I use

722
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:33,500
that a lot now really are you liking it yeah I it's the only browser I use on my

723
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:38,780
phone and I'm using it about 50% of the time on my desktop now huh all right I'm

724
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,900
gonna give it a go come back to there's anybody to some that they remove ads

725
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:47,860
from specific websites and put their own ads in no I like that feature why

726
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:52,620
because it removes all of the privacy invading ads and replaces them with

727
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:58,900
sanitized versions hmm so people don't worry about the privacy guarding you

728
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:03,260
know capabilities getting rid of all sorts of stuff that's buried in pages

729
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:06,940
that you you really don't want so there's no need for things like privacy

730
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:11,740
badger and stuff like that yeah but then there's all of the idea that the ads

731
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,100
being put in are their ads and not the people who you're going to the website

732
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,620
for and they don't get anything for it yeah I've signed up to their scheme to

733
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:27,740
pay pay back the money to the sites that I want to support right hmm yeah that

734
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,300
scheme that sounds interesting it's almost like they thought about this

735
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,700
before they implemented it the browsers of today are broken they've been

736
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,580
overtaken by a barrage of sneaky and annoying ads trackers that follow your

737
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:44,460
habits and cookies that build profiles and all sorts of other internet clutter

738
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:48,660
that's taking precedence over the content that you want to see in fact

739
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:53,700
these useless bites can take up to a whopping 50% of page load times with a

740
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:59,860
third of it anxiously trying to learn more about you to make matters worse

741
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:03,740
some ad blockers are even letting the ads through and large advertisers pay

742
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:08,860
them but do you really want a leaky ad blocker it's because of these very

743
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:12,900
reasons that we developed brave a new browser that kicks internet crud to the

744
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,100
curb and makes it faster safer and better to surf the web than your

745
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,540
current browser

746
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:24,580
with brave everything you need is built right in

747
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:30,060
we integrated technology that automatically blocks trackers annoying

748
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:33,580
ads and shields everything that can cramp your style and destruct your

749
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:37,860
privacy wow I don't want you can expect increased speeds nearly two times faster

750
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:43,100
on laptops and up to four times faster on mobile so there you go that's the

751
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:47,940
pitch on brave it's it's a Mozilla project so that's you know sort of

752
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:52,060
interesting it's not no it's not it's the guy from Moses the founders of

753
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:58,500
Mozilla founded this okay I see that was the confusion so is it web kit based

754
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:05,100
then yes I think it's linked it's a bit more complex than that but yes

755
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:09,580
essentially well now I'm like I'm like half as excited but I'll still get with

756
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:13,100
a go I was way more excited when I thought it was Mozilla realizing that

757
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,580
the Firefox was dead and they were starting a new product and that they

758
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,820
were gonna revitalize gecko and a new more competitive browser but now that's

759
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:23,260
what they're already doing the Firefox though yeah that's what the web

760
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:27,980
extensions are for that's what servos for yeah yeah yeah and web extensions

761
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,820
are coming in three releases like they're gonna be like the the main thing

762
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:36,300
in three releases right now you can already use them and they've already got

763
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:40,500
electrolysis out and all this other stuff it's good yeah you should use

764
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:46,580
Firefox already has all these things Chrome you know I really am so I'm so

765
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,620
depressed about this topic I don't think I want to talk about it much check out

766
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:55,340
Linux action news 11 I mean we covered a story it's just it's devastating

767
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:02,220
devastating for Firefox it's just so sad it's so sad and there's just nothing

768
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:05,820
they can do about it because it's you know and I make this I make this pitch a

769
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:10,300
lot here on the show but as open source enthusiasts we are a particular kind of

770
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:14,500
techie crowd and we are particularly susceptible to getting into arguments

771
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:21,180
about things on their technical merits and we are less capable often I don't

772
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,820
know I'm trying to put this nicer but we are less likely to have a better

773
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:29,820
understanding of market dynamics and the market dynamics are such that a monopoly

774
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:34,540
in search and in web services is contributing billions of dollars worth

775
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:40,420
of advertising space ie the top of YouTube Google search Gmail calendar

776
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:47,180
all the Google's premier products if you are not running Chrome constantly nag you

777
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:51,340
to upgrade to Chrome and that's the terminology they use is upgrade to Chrome

778
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,660
and they do Google Google Docs works better offline if you upgrade to Chrome

779
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:57,980
Google Calendar works offline if you upgrade to Chrome having problems

780
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,500
watching this video this is why I've seen this one on YouTube are you having

781
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:04,020
problems watching this video try upgrading to Chrome can you imagine how

782
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:07,180
many users must fall for that that's interesting see I use Firefox to work

783
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:10,420
but I don't I only use it really for like for working so I don't watch

784
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,660
YouTube I don't check my personal email or any of those so I don't see that

785
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:17,340
that's it's literally invaluable ad space because Google doesn't sell that

786
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:24,540
to any Adsense customer only and and the thing is is that Firefox isn't

787
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:29,860
competing against Internet Explorer anymore mm-hmm when when Firefox was

788
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:35,100
truly taking over they were being innovative and competitive in a way that

789
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:42,380
the consumer base was hungry for the issue is is that like the beard just

790
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:47,300
jokingly said oh that's nice you know it also has that is Chrome Google has not

791
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,980
stood still at all they are not the stagnant monopoly that Internet Explorer

792
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:57,460
was they are hungry as hell to shape the web and they are moving at a breakneck

793
00:59:57,460 --> 01:00:03,660
pace continuing to outpace Firefox and finally say that Firefox's release

794
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:07,460
schedule is fast know what I just mean is in oh I'm sorry I mean they're

795
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:11,340
continuing to get more users to like they're they're they're down velocity

796
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,780
yeah their momentum with their momentum is continuing to grow and they're

797
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,420
continuing to develop the product like it's it's just not the same not like

798
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:22,140
what IE was right yeah exactly they have a vested interest in getting as many

799
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:27,620
users as possible so it's just you know it's just a plus Firefox had a had a had

800
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:32,420
a had an unlikely ally in the US justice system which was beating

801
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:36,700
Microsoft over the head about bundling IE which slowed things down yeah I mean

802
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:39,820
it's it's harder the the argument between Chrome and Firefox is really

803
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:43,980
hard because both are very good browsers to use and it's purely a technical

804
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:48,260
aspect that but see brave would be new and shiny and a chance at new branding

805
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:51,740
and I mean look at the attention Braves getting already like if this was a

806
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,540
Mozilla project they're only getting attention because of the ad thing if

807
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:58,380
most if Firefox did the same thing and added an ad thing it would be the same

808
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:06,540
effect well there is a big problem with Braves though it doesn't work on porn

809
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:11,540
sites that's the big problem oh really why is that everything just is black

810
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:18,060
because it blocks everything so I'm told right these websites my friends that

811
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:22,580
tell me I know a lot of unsavory characters use brain for that's what

812
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:26,460
Firefox focus is for well maybe they'll just start working in 2022 when these

813
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:30,940
drop flash okay hold on I'd actually now this works so you use brave for

814
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:41,940
everything else and you use focus for porn and oh wow hey so I guess a flash

815
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:45,660
flash update again another real-time update here on the show breaking news

816
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:50,060
mr. wimpy reports that brave is now installable via the software boutique

817
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:54,900
good job with me that was like you're welcome so there's a bit of a patreon

818
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:59,420
leak rumors are spreading and you know I just I wanted to give you an

819
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:03,300
opportunity to address the rampant speculation that the Ubuntu matei

820
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:07,180
project is moving to github that just seems seems like that's just rampant

821
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:11,500
speculation yeah we have in fact we've moved all of our projects to github

822
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:18,020
wow we're integrated to the max now we've also got slack going for the core

823
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:23,380
team and we're expanding the team quite considerably so at the moment we've got

824
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:27,580
Etienne who's come in he's been doing good work behind the scenes for some

825
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:32,540
time and he's now heading up the QA team and there and whilst I'm here having an

826
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:37,460
evening of podcasting they're busy doing the ISO testing for the new release

827
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:41,780
thank you so really good yeah we've got a lot of improvements that streamline

828
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:45,340
our processes and there'll be more tooling just coming along just to make

829
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:49,140
sure I'm clear though this means the project is essentially migrating from

830
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:55,020
launchpad right we have moved the few packages that we were maintaining on

831
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:58,500
launchpad to github and that isn't required to be a flavor to be on

832
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:02,900
launchpad well we need to have our bug tracker on launchpad and what have you

833
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:07,260
and that's still there okay you know so that's more about if there's a bug

834
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:11,660
reported we're able to close the bug by uploading new package directly in

835
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:16,100
launchpad but in terms of source code hosting that's all on github now that

836
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:20,660
makes plus there's also the mirroring to launchpad thing no we've we've just

837
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:25,100
exported everything to github the only thing that we've left on launchpad are

838
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:28,940
the seeds because they have to be there and do you do you suppose that this

839
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:33,580
might lead to more more contributors to the project people that me that's yeah

840
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:38,420
yeah without a doubt we've already seen it with the day after we migrated we

841
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:41,460
just dumped you know just might run a load of migration scripts and moved

842
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:45,820
everything over and we knew there was a load of like URLs and things that needed

843
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:50,420
changing in the code before we could repackage them and the next morning

844
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:53,420
there was a load of pull requests where people had just come in and changed all

845
01:03:53,420 --> 01:04:01,300
of those URLs for us and that's the github effect right so yeah you know

846
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:05,660
open source code hosting and all the rest of it github is where most of the

847
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:10,660
eyeballs are and you get more drive-by commits there it's as simple as that

848
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:15,340
yeah it makes sense that does and if they if it leads to more open source it

849
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:18,340
seems to me a net to be a good thing and if it leads to more people writing

850
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:22,180
open source then in that it's a good thing this seems would be like it's oh

851
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:26,740
go ahead I was just gonna say it's it's so much better now that it's on github

852
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:30,820
because it's a lot easier to just do a pretty much everything because like just

853
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:34,860
by creating a launchpad account and trying to commit to a contribute to a

854
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:39,060
project is so difficult that most people just give up I've had an account with

855
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:46,340
launchpad for I don't know like ten years I think I've used it maybe yeah

856
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:50,300
okay so this is just my impression I'm not saying this is wimpy's position but

857
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:56,380
to me what looking at this alpha I mean it's a freaking alpha it first of all I

858
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:59,860
don't really I don't know it's so damned it's to feel so damn ready I it sort of

859
01:04:59,860 --> 01:05:04,140
blows my mind but this feels like this is the release it's really like this is

860
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:08,620
ready for the masses it's ready for people look at unity refugees I mean

861
01:05:08,620 --> 01:05:12,860
this really feels like it's polished to the next level for this desktop release

862
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:19,740
yeah so it has been a ton of work it's been three months we literally started

863
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:24,780
working on this the day after 1704 was released we were the first people to

864
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:33,220
commit anything to 1717 awesome and it's been late nights and long nights for

865
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:38,880
three months and we've pretty much landed at this point everything that we

866
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:43,460
wanted to get on the desktop for the final release that's three months from

867
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:50,420
now so we're done in terms of features except we've got another three months so

868
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:54,300
now we're going to go and circle back to something so you will you will have heard

869
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:58,660
the news about our new software boutique which is not in this release it's the

870
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:04,460
old one slightly refreshed so now work will start on finishing up the new

871
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:08,460
software boutique and there's a few other little skunk work projects that

872
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:12,740
some of the other project they're helping us with and they should trickle

873
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:18,220
along between now and October so we're kind of done with the desktop and now

874
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:21,420
we're going to really start adding some more polish and improvements on top of

875
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:25,300
what we've got here that's a good position to be here that's going to make

876
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:29,820
for a this release so it sounds so damn good you should have saved it for the LTS

877
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:35,740
no kidding I guess this is just we're one step away right so I've not been

878
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:40,020
doing you know the flavors in a bunty for very long but I have done one LTS

879
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:45,740
before and I remember what it was like when we were making 1510 and then the

880
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:51,980
effort that was involved to get 10 to 1604 yeah and that was hard work and I

881
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:59,500
realized that really 1710 needs to be your 1804 and then it's all about

882
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:04,620
improving the quality and the stability in that 1804 cycle that's landing those

883
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:09,940
last few features but really making sure it's solid yeah totally that is that's

884
01:07:09,940 --> 01:07:13,180
gonna make for a good song and we're well ahead of where we wanted to be

885
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:19,380
because this time last year we were transitioning from GTK 2 to GTK 3 and I

886
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:24,580
had originally planned we would finish that GTK 3 transition about now about

887
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:31,100
this time but we finished that last October so we we got like a cycle ahead

888
01:07:31,100 --> 01:07:36,820
of ourselves so I'm really an Ubuntu Marte now is really starting to be the

889
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:43,540
desktop platform that I wanted to use because simple things like super key and

890
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:47,820
and the HUD and global menus I don't use the global menus myself but I know lots

891
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:51,300
of people like those these were all things that were niggling at me that I

892
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:55,380
knew weren't quite right and it wasn't perfect and it's really feeling like

893
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:58,880
it's falling into place now and it's all coming together and the indicator

894
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,180
support it's got the same indicators that you'd expect to find in Unity 7 so

895
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:07,260
everything that you'd expect to find in a unity desktop you'll find here now so

896
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:11,100
I'm really pleased with how it's shaping up yeah it really comes through as a

897
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:15,300
great release just even trying out the the latest that I got the daily build

898
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:19,500
and it was it was pretty great if you you know if you want to know about this

899
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:24,780
stuff first the people who support the Ubuntu Mate project learn about it from

900
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:32,060
the horses fingers I guess patreon.com slash Ubuntu underscore Mate I'll have a

901
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:35,540
link in the show notes too if you want to support the project not only do you

902
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:40,260
get news but you help help the news keep on coming yeah there is there's a poll

903
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:43,780
over there right now about which video player should be the default in Ubuntu

904
01:08:43,780 --> 01:08:49,260
Mate obviously it should be GnomeMPV it is the greatest just saying with in my

905
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:55,100
humble opinion I completely agree well when we voted let me go yes yes I did

906
01:08:55,100 --> 01:09:00,620
yes I did good yeah yes we need more GnomeMPV needs more love it's such a

907
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:06,060
team GnomeMPV yeah it is a great media player and it's somebody who does a lot

908
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:12,940
of media editing and work and then also uses that really pushes it for unfilter

909
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:17,580
it's just such MPV such a great tool are you saying GnomeMPV or just MPV well

910
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:20,420
MPV in general and if you're gonna use GnomeMPV if you're gonna use a

911
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:24,660
wrapper around it GnomeMPV is the way to go it really is great okay I was just

912
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:28,740
wondering like is it I've always never noticed the reason why would somebody

913
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:32,940
want to use GnomeMPV versus MPV like it's just you could just right-click

914
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:36,700
and load the video with MPV so I'm just curious if the I could tell you why I

915
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:42,340
because I'll go ahead with me well I was gonna say I like it because it adds the

916
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:48,300
typical interfaces to manipulate it that you'd expect to be there yeah the users

917
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:53,700
doesn't feel like an odd duck right but I like it because so I use it exclusively

918
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:58,660
to play back all of the crazy types of file formats we have for unfilter clips

919
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:03,260
it's just a whole range that we get stuff in whatever you can real player I

920
01:10:03,260 --> 01:10:06,700
mean I'm telling you it's a whole range and then that's an MPV thing right right

921
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:10,340
no I know but let me just say so the nice thing about GnomeMPV is it gives

922
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:15,780
you a super clean minimal but always available play bar indicator pause

923
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:21,320
button I can only see where the play position is and it is one of the it's

924
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:26,540
probably one of the best designed gnomes in the sense that it's almost nothing to

925
01:10:26,540 --> 01:10:30,700
it except for just barely what you need and it's just enough that I can look

926
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,700
down I know exactly where it's at play wise and if I want to go full screen

927
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:37,340
it's like f11 or you know a click away or whatever it is so it's kind of like a

928
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:41,480
perfect balance for me in that sense so I guess it's more like it's a user in

929
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:44,540
our user experience is easier to get you because you don't have to learn all the

930
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:48,740
specific shortcuts that MPV there's that and it's like I while I'm playing

931
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:53,820
something on the stream I can't keep putting my mouse over the video to see

932
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:56,420
where the play positions that have that display over the video because that's

933
01:10:56,420 --> 01:11:00,580
tacky so having it just below the video where I can still see where the play

934
01:11:00,580 --> 01:11:02,820
positions at but don't have to show anything on screen makes for a better

935
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:07,500
presentation okay I understand there's always weird you know use cases I always

936
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:10,580
have a weird one so it's very much a tool it's where it's regular MPV works

937
01:11:10,580 --> 01:11:14,100
great if I'm gonna put on some you know MP MPV file and just watch it for an

938
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,820
hour yeah like if I'm gonna do a live stream I just MPV and then the URL I

939
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:21,340
don't bother with dome MPV like if it's because and there's really MPV I in my

940
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:25,740
opinion has done such a good job at giving you information that is readable

941
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:29,140
on the command line output when you use it from the command line that even if

942
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:32,420
you're not like a pro user you can see like it's trying to fix it'll try to

943
01:11:32,420 --> 01:11:35,980
fix a video and audio sync for you and tell you what it offsets it's using like

944
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:40,500
it's just brilliant there's another thing that I found in recently MPV does

945
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:45,460
that a lot of people don't you think that they would do this but you can take

946
01:11:45,460 --> 01:11:51,340
videos that are like awkwardly slowed down or have weird cropping issues and

947
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:54,620
you can like resume and recrop I use that all the time automatically yeah I

948
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:58,620
use all the time yeah that's really nice VLC is a great tool as well we do use

949
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:02,180
that in production here at studio but you know if I could only have I'm on an

950
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:06,940
island and I can only have one package MPV or no MPV all the way mm-hmm it's

951
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:10,380
it's so great all right so I there's a couple more things I want to talk about

952
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:13,980
before we wrap up for the day and we also have I think we have I think we're

953
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:17,380
gonna get some more Alex cute info out of Simon in the post show yeah more to

954
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:20,460
come a more to come but I want to take a moment and I want to talk about

955
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:23,100
something else I take on that desert island with me and that's the Linux

956
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:27,380
Academy then I could sit there and train my mind Linux Academy calm slash

957
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:31,860
unplugged go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial

958
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:35,860
Linux Academy comm slash unplug a platform by Linux I'll say it again a

959
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:40,220
platform a platform you see I got a little pop there a little bit a platform

960
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:44,100
by Linux enthusiasts for Linux enthusiasts people that wanted to spread

961
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:47,540
the adoption of Linux and kind of began to think about this project from there

962
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:51,460
then got together with real-world educators people with experience

963
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:56,180
developers that came together as a group like a holy trinity you might say I mean

964
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:59,980
they probably wouldn't say that but I might say that of Linux education and

965
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:03,460
they built a system they started and they started in a reasonable like

966
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:07,580
approachable like actually accomplishable product and then it just

967
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:11,700
took off like wildfire and they've been able to grow it and it just adds so much

968
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:14,620
value to the platform if you've been a subscriber now for like a year you've

969
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:17,940
just seen it take off like nuts self-paced in-depth video courses

970
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:21,980
hands-on scenario based labs to give you real experience on servers you get to

971
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:25,780
SSH into those bad boys and use them like you really would and man is that

972
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:28,660
nice because it gives you confidence to actually work with the stuff oh you're

973
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:32,100
busy yeah I know about that they have a course schedule that worked with your

974
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:36,180
busy time to make it all fit in there they have learning paths too if you just

975
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:40,140
want to go into a specific career track maybe you've got some type of type of

976
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:43,740
certain mind well they also have courses created specifically to prepare you for

977
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:48,300
that they also have a vibrant community that's packed full of Jupiter broadcasting

978
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:51,900
members and study tools that you can download offline and take with you and

979
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:55,700
iOS and Android apps if you have some downtime and want to do a little study

980
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:59,900
gosh that's cool yeah that's really cool Linux Academy calm slash unplugged

981
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:05,060
go there to sign up get a free seven-day trial and support the show and then dig

982
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:09,020
in and I think probably you know I gotta say my favorite feature is the human

983
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:13,340
beings the instructor mentoring like the actual help because that's that's really

984
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:16,620
what takes them up to the next level because instead of just throwing on

985
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:21,020
Linux as a feature that they have as well as plumbing and Adobe After Effects

986
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:24,260
and Final Cut oh and then they have your Linux stuff over here and your

987
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:27,380
developer stuff because you got to have those checkboxes you got to check those

988
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:31,660
boxes then they're not gonna have anybody passionate about that stuff in

989
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:34,180
their company that's not like their core focus that's not what their missions

990
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:38,220
about so Linux Academy they focus on Linux open source and all the stuff

991
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:42,580
around it which means they can hire people professionally well not just

992
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:45,660
professionally trained but passionate yeah passionate about it means you can

993
01:14:45,660 --> 01:14:48,300
count on them that you know they know what they're doing and if you get stuck

994
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,580
or you know it just sometimes you need two or three different ways of hearing

995
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:54,780
something to learn it the other way that the other way that it manifests

996
01:14:54,780 --> 01:14:57,780
itself in a way that is valuable to customers is that since they're

997
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:01,420
following trends because they're enthusiasts they they're on to stuff

998
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:04,980
that is valuable like when containerization started becoming a

999
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:08,140
thing Linux Academy was having court it was having the best courseware on it and

1000
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:11,980
the stuff like you could immediately go and apply to a job kind of stuff really

1001
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:16,100
practical good stuff always giving you value Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

1003
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:26,740
and it got me missing gnome already and it was from a metanova over in the

1004
01:15:26,740 --> 01:15:30,980
unplugged subreddit Linux unplug dot reddit comm and he says greetings

1005
01:15:30,980 --> 01:15:34,260
unplugged I recently have made the switch back to arch and gnome 3 and for

1006
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:38,420
the most part I'm pretty happy with the switch however I'm distracted easily huh

1007
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:43,980
what would you say oh I'm sorry you distracted you weren't listening and so

1008
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:47,540
I try to do my best to adapt my desktop environment to account for this my

1009
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:52,700
biggest problem with gnome or good gnome as you say is that the activities window

1010
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:56,740
overview is really disorienting for me I use dash to dock for switching windows

1011
01:15:56,740 --> 01:15:59,740
but I still have problems when I open the overview to launch applications

1012
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:03,700
seeing every single window I have whoosh onto the screen is really distracting it

1013
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:06,140
can really knock me out of my flow well I could see that like you know your

1014
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,780
telegram window comes up and you see you got a shit ton of chats that you haven't

1015
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:15,140
answered in 15 minutes or with slack or the IRC or your email what was that oh

1016
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:18,740
the easiest solution to this problem is to use another application launcher like

1017
01:16:18,740 --> 01:16:22,060
no I'm doing anyways it goes through his goals here to sort of make gnome a less

1018
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:26,420
distracting UI and I it dawned on me that this was the problem I ran into when I

1019
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:29,900
switched to plasma for a while is that there was just so many things for me to

1020
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:33,940
play with widgets that tell me my CPU stuff and my new messages and there's

1021
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:38,220
different ways to set up the panels a ton yeah he's doing he's doing a plea

1022
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:41,720
for help he says does anyone in the unplugged family to fam the unplugged

1023
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:46,140
fam know about this is there an extension I'm missing I like that

1024
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:50,020
alternatively if anyone here is familiar with developing gnome extensions

1025
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:52,820
creating extensions that hides window previews and activities etc it'd be

1026
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:55,540
greatly appreciated ultimately I'm looking for an activities

1027
01:16:55,540 --> 01:17:01,060
tweaker or other ideas and experiences that the audience has had and we have a

1028
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:06,540
link to metanova's thread if you want to toss in there what about us are you do

1029
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:10,060
suffer because you you probably get in cut type of work that requires that you

1030
01:17:10,060 --> 01:17:14,140
get into a flow and maintain that flow for a while do you suffer from

1031
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:20,740
distracted UI you know thankfully not especially not on on gnome I don't

1032
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:25,420
usually you know if I if I am even using dash to dock it's hidden so there's

1033
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:28,780
always the problem of notifications but that's you know usually a per app thing

1034
01:17:28,780 --> 01:17:32,300
so as long as I'm you know divide my screen in half I got a terminal I have a

1035
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:36,620
web browser I can get in the groove hmm but I do know you mean like playing with

1036
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:39,460
plasma in the past especially for me when it might be something that like

1037
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:43,420
I've been using it over ages now so it might just be used to anything that

1038
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:45,940
would have distracted me as a new user I think that's probably part of it

1039
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:49,380
ww you seem like a nice rational gentleman do you have the problem of

1040
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:57,420
distracting UI right now no not really cuz and like I don't have any like any

1041
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:01,900
background wallpaper forget about asking me for what's it look cool because I

1042
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:08,420
have a billion windows up I have tabs yeah so tabs is pretty much my life

1043
01:18:08,420 --> 01:18:16,020
yeah I know what the beard solution is full screen all the things oh yeah if you

1044
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:18,980
just run everything full screen then you can only look at one thing at a time I

1045
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:22,340
don't have we ever talked about that the fact that you're a full screen maniac I

1046
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:26,740
don't think so he's all in on the full screen every app I have is full screen

1047
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:30,780
yeah I have like 20 to 30 apps oh yeah and then you know Chris ever a split and

1048
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:34,160
and then like my browser that has 200 tabs yeah so I can only ever see one

1049
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,540
thing at a time so I'm never distracted that is a it's an intense way to

1050
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:42,260
operate but you do seem to make it work for you for me like I get claustrophobic

1051
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:46,180
in that setup like I'm like I gotta I gotta be able to like I need an overview

1052
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:49,260
and all I need windows that's for me I need to be able to move stuff around I

1053
01:18:49,260 --> 01:18:52,860
just oh yeah see I agree with architect if you can see your background you're

1054
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:57,540
just being lazy all right that's it that's not a bad note to end it on I'll

1055
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:00,300
just I just want to talk really quickly then about this journey that I'm

1056
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,100
starting it's it's fun for me and I won't go on and on about it so I put it

1057
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:06,700
at the end of the show but it's something it's different for me

1058
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:11,180
personally with my Linux use in a long time is I'm I'm making I've talked about

1059
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:14,180
this on user a little bit so I'll just give you the cliff notes I'm switching

1060
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:20,540
away from Antigros and arch love arch I think it's a great great great desktop

1061
01:19:20,540 --> 01:19:27,340
workstation OS super stable despite what all the haters say Antigros has been

1062
01:19:27,340 --> 01:19:31,060
difficult for me recently and they it's a good project it's a great way to get

1063
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:36,340
your hands on but I just have I just constantly having package

1064
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:39,420
keys package key problems that prevent me from updating my system and it's only

1065
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:44,620
about a five minute fix each time but it happens about once a month now and when

1066
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:47,900
you multiply that across like five systems it gets frustrating and it's

1067
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:52,420
even the same commands to fix it and all that stuff but it just feels like well I

1068
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:57,640
don't want it I like the project a lot but it's it's just what happens is is it

1069
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:01,420
makes me skip updating which is that only makes it worse that's when you

1070
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:04,820
start going down a slippery slope with arch and you start you start not

1071
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:07,700
updating and you start running into problems so it's kind of changes the

1072
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:10,660
value proposition for the whole thing in some ways the other thing that's been a

1073
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:19,020
big change for me is post Linux action show I don't do desktop app pics and a

1074
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:23,540
project spotlight and a distribution pic like I don't have the pics and so I

1075
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:28,580
don't have to try out so the pics look we talked about one app that week but

1076
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:32,660
we tried five or six other ones other contenders so it means installing five

1077
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:36,140
or six or seven or eight or sometimes ten different things to try out which

1078
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:39,140
one really works and which one is generally available to the audience and

1079
01:20:39,140 --> 01:20:44,140
applicable and the AUR was just a slam dunk if you want to try out all the

1080
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:49,180
different yeah it's always there and so it made it it literally made it was

1081
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:52,100
part of my workflow you know go into the AUR find the application try it out

1082
01:20:52,100 --> 01:20:57,080
review it for the show probably uninstall it maybe not and that will you

1083
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:01,500
know rinse repeat every single week and now I don't really have like I've kind

1084
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:04,620
of have my stable set of applications I use I'm just getting my work done now

1085
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:10,100
I'm not I'm not like sitting there trying to find new stuff constantly and I

1086
01:21:10,100 --> 01:21:13,320
don't know so it's changed it's changed what I need from my distributions

1087
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:17,660
package manager to write and I would say like when you first switched to arch you

1088
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:20,640
know snaps were not flat pack they're not in the place that they used they

1089
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,500
aren't they weren't even a thing yeah so you have a lot more options even on you

1090
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:27,140
know it wasn't a thing yeah right so there's also that's the other thing is

1091
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:31,380
is there's like I was experimenting with solace and there was software I wanted

1092
01:21:31,380 --> 01:21:34,580
that wasn't available I was like oh yeah talker mm-hmm and I'm gonna have a whole

1093
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:38,420
system running if you want one of the things that so it's funny cuz now I'm on

1094
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:42,540
the other end of this one of the things that's that's true is for me is I don't

1095
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:46,220
I wonder if it tells me right here I don't I don't make it a priority to

1096
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:53,660
update yeah so there's 231 package updates for the OBS machine I don't make

1097
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:58,300
it a practice to constantly upgrade the OBS machine because that makes a

1098
01:21:58,300 --> 01:22:02,340
production machine less reliable I need newer versions of everything underlying

1099
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:07,300
OBS and I need newest versions of OBS but I don't need my gnome shell to

1100
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:12,660
change I don't really need my new tools to change my kernel updates unless you

1101
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:15,460
know except for security I don't I mean everything's working as it is in fact we

1102
01:22:15,460 --> 01:22:20,420
have some customized drivers for these capture cards so an LTS is starting to

1103
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:23,500
make a lot more sense to me than it used to you're just gonna make Noah's day

1104
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:27,380
aren't you you're making the what I like to call the Rekai to Noah transition

1105
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:31,820
yeah right exactly how so well cuz I like the bleeding edge of everything and

1106
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:35,220
Noah likes the LTS so you're making the transition from one to the other yeah I

1107
01:22:35,220 --> 01:22:38,460
don't see this it makes sense on the production equipment but it sounds

1108
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:41,860
boring snot for my desktop it just really it's like it sounds like it's

1109
01:22:41,860 --> 01:22:46,820
sucking some of the fun out of using Linux but I think you're also some maybe

1110
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:50,260
in a place where you're very busy and you're doing a lot more content

1111
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:53,900
production yeah that makes it this is what I was thinking too I mean you can

1112
01:22:53,900 --> 01:23:00,740
always leave have you heard of the Church of neon oh you know I that's so

1113
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:03,380
that's the other that's the other wrinkle isn't it because you've we've

1114
01:23:03,380 --> 01:23:12,620
got we've got a true blue gnome desktop coming from Ubuntu very soon and I'm

1115
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:16,940
very interested in that we just talked about the super slick snot stuff in

1116
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:22,020
Ubuntu Mate that really makes it a contender then you you do have the

1117
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:29,140
plasma desktop as well I just like the whole field is open to me again I feel

1118
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:32,700
myself I'm beginning to distro hop in a way that I haven't done for two and a

1119
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:36,740
half two and a half three years so I've I've been trying out right now I've been

1120
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:40,020
trying out mostly Ubuntu based stuff because I keep thinking if I'm gonna go

1121
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:44,060
this route it seems like I should probably rebase on Ubuntu but there's

1122
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:47,500
like this I key on my shoulder that keeps talking about all the cool shit

1123
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:50,620
that solace is doing about how clear boot manager would be great for us for

1124
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:54,540
you some production here and and then fedoras got this fedora workstation OS

1125
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:58,980
tree release that they're working on and I'm like oh my goodness so many good

1126
01:23:58,980 --> 01:24:02,020
options it's it's it's so much harder than it ever has been to pick a

1127
01:24:02,020 --> 01:24:06,140
distribution right now and then Rika is saying slackware off in the corner you're

1128
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:09,580
so that's why I was gonna do a slackware challenge but I'm right in the middle I'm

1129
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:13,900
in the throes of this like my guess is Chris is gonna he's not gonna be able to

1130
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:18,380
decide and he's gonna compromise and end up on a boot to budgie there we go well

1131
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:21,380
that's reasonable what do you think bashful that might be a good way to go

1132
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:32,660
huh yeah I'm kind of a little one-sided on this you use it as a dick you could

1133
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:37,620
speak from as a from the perspective of a daily user over there you get you get

1134
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:40,700
you get your work done every single day right and you're running you're running

1135
01:24:40,700 --> 01:24:45,540
it on the last release right now I don't know but I mean you're using it every

1136
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:50,220
day as a daily driver yeah I'm running 1704 and I'm actually running it at work

1137
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:54,420
too so and that's over a remote session as well and I haven't really had any

1138
01:24:54,420 --> 01:25:00,380
issues with it at all I got it another option is nitricks good callback good

1139
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:08,900
callback nitricks I see budgie is a great desktop but it's so why would I

1140
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,620
switch to that just so that way I can switch again in a year or whatever like

1141
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:15,020
I don't know yeah but you're gonna run into that with almost any destroy you

1142
01:25:15,020 --> 01:25:19,260
pop in if you're not entirely happy no I just I just mean like that I think that

1143
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:22,260
desktops gonna be going through a transition where right now it seems like

1144
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:26,620
the time to you know get in on gnome 3 if things are shaping up like Mike Mike

1145
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:30,060
Mike when's the last time we crashed it's been it's been like two weeks right

1146
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:33,660
since we've had a gnome 3 crash yeah so the last time the last round of updates

1147
01:25:33,660 --> 01:25:38,900
I did manage to apply did seem to improve stability so that's good yeah

1148
01:25:38,900 --> 01:25:43,060
until the next issue crops well there's that there is that yeah so anyways my

1149
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:47,060
distro my distro hopping ways have returned like it and of course it's

1150
01:25:47,060 --> 01:25:50,660
happening fun it has to be happening right around the 1710 release cycle too

1151
01:25:50,660 --> 01:25:56,540
so and you know you say that that that's a reason not to use budgie but don't you

1152
01:25:56,540 --> 01:26:00,180
think that gnome is probably about to go through a huge transition as well no I

1153
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:05,260
think GTK 4 is gonna be more evolutionary well I was more talking

1154
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:09,860
about the effect that Ubuntu might have on gnome oh boy well so far I like all

1155
01:26:09,860 --> 01:26:14,700
those effects I gotta say I mean I'm really this is this is the thing is what

1156
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:17,900
I was trying to boom to mate and I rebooted this system like I realized as

1157
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:23,060
I was hitting the restart button like I really like gnome like I really like

1158
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:27,420
gnome 3 it's really good it's just I don't like it when it runs like dog poo

1159
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:30,420
and crashes a lot but other than that I really like alright Chris you can run

1160
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:34,300
gnome on your desktop upstairs and then down here in the studio we'll run Katie

1161
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:37,540
everywhere well okay so if you're gonna go this is then we can have both then

1162
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:40,060
we can wrap this up we got it we got a move we got to wrap it up for the day

1163
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:45,300
but if just just if you take it to its practical logical conclusion why not go

1164
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:53,140
Ubuntu LTS with unity 7 because this is this is a seriously this other than the

1165
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:56,900
few problems we've had with the sound interface this this this mobile system

1166
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:02,260
that's running unity 7 and Ubuntu is like 100% yeah yeah and I guess by the

1167
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:06,100
time that it's end of life will probably have moved on to something else and

1168
01:27:06,100 --> 01:27:10,660
we've even done a couple of update batches on this thing so it's managed to

1169
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:15,460
take its updates and not shit the bed and it runs until we have some cocky

1170
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:20,940
many reason to reboot it and I mean it's just been rock-solid and unity 7 opens

1171
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:25,180
windows real nice it has nice like borders to grab my windows to resize

1172
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:29,580
them all the things I like about a desktop maybe 87 on some stuff too it

1173
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:34,180
does randomly inexplicably spin up our GPU though that is true that did start

1174
01:27:34,180 --> 01:27:36,940
happening that did start happening I've been getting a lot of crap for saying

1175
01:27:36,940 --> 01:27:40,740
nice things about unity people are really angry that all of a sudden I have

1176
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:43,900
positive things to say about unity now that it's end of life and it's I think

1177
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:47,460
it's I think it's funny because if you look at the the majority of the

1178
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:52,940
community that the transition has been much more positive for unity now that

1179
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:56,340
things like all of the features that unity had that people didn't even know

1180
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:00,740
existed they're going oh wow that's great you know too bad unity's dead now

1181
01:28:00,740 --> 01:28:04,260
like well yeah good job yeah but those same people just you know a couple

1182
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:07,300
months ago we're crapping on unity because why is it moved to do in their

1183
01:28:07,300 --> 01:28:12,220
own of course anti canonical rhetoric yeah just this is the canonical hate and

1184
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:16,460
then that's I don't I never understood then and I always they're always pointed

1185
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:20,540
out how unity has a lot of cool features and now that it's gone it's kind of it's

1186
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:24,540
kind of sad in a way it's still there like it's a saying it's like no that's

1187
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:27,700
gonna mean I mean as far as like the innovation is all dead like the fact

1188
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:31,360
that the HUD the concept of the HUD is just being is was abandoned and then

1189
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:34,780
people and other people were trying to like rebuild everything and bring back

1190
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:39,620
the global menu and like what the global menu has like every single gold menu

1191
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:44,100
implementation so far has these weird massive holes like the CSDs don't work

1192
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:52,940
and well I'm kind of not in a bunch of math a 1710 might drop canonical will

1193
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:57,620
bring some of those improvements to know and make it a desktop that I like

1194
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:01,940
more because I don't really like no right now yeah yeah that's I am not

1195
01:29:01,940 --> 01:29:06,740
ruling out plasma either so it's supposedly not changing that much except

1196
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:10,580
for like already made extensions well initially but who knows what they're

1197
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:16,780
gonna do down the road I think it's I think it's I think it's too obvious I

1198
01:29:16,780 --> 01:29:21,960
think it's not about it's not about changing the direction of gnome because

1199
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:26,600
that's sort of the whole point of making this switch was to not have to to be

1200
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:30,860
that to be that to be that player now you're now the idea is you ride with

1201
01:29:30,860 --> 01:29:36,800
upstream and you can spend your time fixing so we got to go we let Dan know

1202
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:42,020
we're just gonna be five minutes so here's the thing the hard stuff isn't

1203
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:45,980
getting done in open source and a lot of us know it a lot of us know that the

1204
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:49,780
stuff that's really really tough to fix requires people that are working in

1205
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:53,660
teams that have a coordinated development standards practice that maybe

1206
01:29:53,660 --> 01:29:56,700
have a PMO that's managing the things they're working on and telling them

1207
01:29:56,700 --> 01:30:01,020
instead of them choosing by what happens to fit their fancy the really hard stuff

1208
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:04,620
is they underline stuff like the hundreds of bugs and Bluetooth and

1209
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:09,180
things like that that require a real development focus and team to work on

1210
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:14,220
them and that's an area where canonical can really and is already adding a ton

1211
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:20,220
of value without having to fork the file manager or anything like that and I think

1212
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:24,620
that is fundamentally going to be the long long term impact to the gnome

1213
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:29,820
desktop isn't so much about them dictating the design future of gnome 3

1214
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:34,700
but more about letting the gnome project make a great desktop making

1215
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:38,420
modifications via the extension systems where it's appropriate and working on

1216
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:42,380
the underlying underpinning stuff that makes using like a Bluetooth speaker

1217
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:46,500
with your Linux box actually usable and that's I think going to be the big

1218
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:52,820
benefit end of rant there's just a quickie well I I agree with that but I

1219
01:30:52,820 --> 01:31:00,940
also think that the fact that Ubuntu is settling on gnome now lets you work

1220
01:31:00,940 --> 01:31:06,180
better with upstream while also making changes so it's more like it's not

1221
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:09,300
necessarily you're changing the direction of gnome it's you're just

1222
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:13,060
helping improve the gnome experience right which is I think what was why some

1223
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:16,900
people it's though some of the unity haters didn't like unity yeah is the

1224
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:22,580
mixed resources thing oh we got a we got a fire fair unity 7 was way unity itself

1225
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:28,300
was way better for not with a gnome for years like a gnome for three to four

1226
01:31:28,300 --> 01:31:32,980
years was utter garbage yeah all right well there you know what on that positive

1227
01:31:32,980 --> 01:31:37,120
note because that's you know that is that is a story for another time we could

1228
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,980
you know we were thinking about it we should do like a history edition like a

1229
01:31:39,980 --> 01:31:44,340
gather around story version where we go back through the good and bad old days

1230
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:50,060
of all of this but not for today that is a project for future Linux unplugged if

1231
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:53,220
you'd like to participate in the conversation join us live on Tuesdays

let's go pick a title before we get a mumble room thank you very much Simon

1241
01:33:18,220 --> 01:33:21,260
had a couple of I know he had several points you want to get in about Alex

1242
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:24,460
cute so let me say this really quick go over to JB titles calm let's see if we

1243
01:33:24,460 --> 01:33:28,100
can't make our quickest title pick yet that way Dan and West can get started

1244
01:33:28,100 --> 01:33:32,700
ASAP Simon you wanted to jump in there real quick on a couple of things that

1245
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:41,820
was yeah so alpha 2 is gonna be released on Thursday and both me and and bashful

1246
01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:47,860
robot we're doing the checklist tracking so so we're we're just wondering if

1247
01:33:47,860 --> 01:33:50,660
anybody can help test you you know if you're if you're installing boot to

1248
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:54,100
Montana machine or if you're installing you know the other flavors are kaboom

1249
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:57,780
to which they have I believe they have the latest plasma on this release you

1250
01:33:57,780 --> 01:34:01,580
have the little into the boom to next flavor which it's the experimental

1251
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:06,380
image and you have a boon to budgie and we do chillin so if you install any of

1252
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:10,380
those on your machine if you happen to do that within the next day or two it'd

1253
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:13,980
be great if you could at least you know let us know that it works that sort of

1254
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:18,180
thing because we're right now in a lane sort of like a testing phase for alpha

1255
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:23,300
2 return of the distro hopper I think Chris switches to BSD we should save

1256
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:27,100
that one in case that ever actually happened I doubt it but boy so many

1257
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:29,820
people since I've mentioned this are like dude you should try out BSD and I'm

1258
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:35,060
like uh-huh I think I would rather run slack where then run BSD maybe I'm not

1259
01:34:35,060 --> 01:34:38,980
sure BSD is like the greatest thing you should possibly want if you don't want

1260
01:34:38,980 --> 01:34:46,420
to run a desktop swap your hosting duties there Chris yeah I mean I could

1261
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:52,180
fill in now yeah let's see scratch by a thumbnail keeping keep killing flash I

1262
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:57,180
still think return of the distro hopper might be better so long and thanks for

1263
01:34:57,180 --> 01:35:01,860
all the flash yeah that's good too but I've already that was taken by chromium

1264
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:07,620
you know I want to you know maybe one day somebody you know what

1265
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:10,300
somebody actually pitched it to me as somebody actually suggested I should

1266
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:14,620
switch to BSD so that way when I use Linux it's emulated and it's consistent

1267
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:17,940
and so I'll have a more stable Linux experience because I'll be using an

1268
01:35:17,940 --> 01:35:25,100
emulated Linux experience under BSD there you go somebody around here made

1269
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:29,940
that argument this neck of the woods and I that one really got me JB titles.com I

1270
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:32,700
think we're gonna go with return of the distro hopper just in like that in the

1271
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:37,780
order of expedience here flash dance you know I get a flash dance is good too I

1272
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:42,980
gotta say wimpy made me happy and then he immediately made me sad what happened

1273
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:47,660
because he's talked about moving Ubuntu mate to github yeah and he moved

1274
01:35:47,660 --> 01:35:52,700
everything to github except for the part that I hate about launchpad the bug

1275
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:58,900
tracker oh yeah that bit of infrastructure you can you can raise

1276
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:03,620
issues on github that's no problem we'll deal with issues in github okay that's

1277
01:36:03,620 --> 01:36:08,060
fine as well oh that's a good trackers are open but we need we also need the

1278
01:36:08,060 --> 01:36:12,220
one in launchpad to actually close project milestones and stuff yeah you're

1279
01:36:12,220 --> 01:36:17,020
welcome that's brilliant just just work on Chris explaining needs a stable

1280
01:36:17,020 --> 01:36:21,540
operating system for his production machine point him at the he'll walk in

1281
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:49,300
with the green one and mate will be on every system
