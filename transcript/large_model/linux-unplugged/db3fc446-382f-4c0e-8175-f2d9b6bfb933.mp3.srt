1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
You're a Star Trek fan, Wes.

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,120
You know about synthohol.

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,040
It seemed like an impossibility.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,600
You could have a beer that was made with synthohol,

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,160
and you could feel the effects of booze

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,400
without actually getting fully drunk.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,280
Well, yeah, it sounds amazing.

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,240
I want that.

9
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,240
I enjoy a drink from time to time.

10
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,640
But we all have to admit, like, there are consequences,

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,360
both personal and social.

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,280
But how many times do you hear, like,

13
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,440
in the open source and free software community,

14
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,360
free isn't beer, or let's go have a beer.

15
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,520
Like, everybody's always talking about beer.

16
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,160
It's pervasive in our society.

17
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,520
It really is.

18
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,400
Yeah, well, there is a guy out there whose last name is Nut,

19
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,000
really.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,760
David Nut.

21
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,760
Yeah, we'll have this linked in the show notes.

22
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,960
He's got an ambitious plan to bring, like,

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,480
a synthohol to the market.

24
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,040
Safe synthetic alcohol substitute called Alkarell.

25
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,240
He's kind of actually been playing with this for a long

26
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,400
time with the so-called holy grail of molecules,

27
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,280
at least if you really want to develop

28
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,960
this one specific molecule.

29
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,440
It's also called AlkaSynth.

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,040
And really, what they're aiming for

31
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,480
is something that provides the relaxing and socially

32
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,520
lubricating qualities of alcohol that we all know and love,

33
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,520
but without the hangovers, health issues,

34
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,360
or the risk of getting paralytic.

35
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,800
If that was really true, especially

36
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,320
that social lubrication there, I think

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,960
we would all have to drink this before we

38
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,440
start doing the show, you know?

39
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,520
Absolutely, why not?

40
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,800
I mean, right now, all I have is this damn whiskey to sip on.

41
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:27,520
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 294 from March 26, 2019.

42
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:40,880
Oh, hello there, and welcome to your weekly Linux talk show

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,120
that might be a little too ambitious this week.

44
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,920
My name is Chris.

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,800
My name is Wes.

46
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,520
I don't know, Wes.

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,720
I'm looking through this list, and I'm saying it's too much.

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,560
But this week, on your Unplugged program,

49
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,320
we'll go through some community news,

50
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,440
including the release of the most important text

51
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,720
editor ever created, and an OS.

52
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,440
Well, a distro?

53
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
They call it an OS.

54
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,360
It's really a distro that seems to be getting

55
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,800
a little bit of controversy.

56
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,160
When's the last time you've heard

57
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,520
about a controversial distro?

58
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,920
Oh, it's been a while.

59
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,120
That's funny, because the press is calling it

60
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,400
a controversial OS.

61
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,120
But no, no, it's a distro, and we'll tell you more about it

62
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,200
in a little bit.

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,080
And then, later on, have you ever heard of a tainted kernel?

64
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,720
You might be one of those Linux users out there right now that

65
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,560
has a dirty, tainted kernel.

66
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,720
We'll tell you what the heck that is, what causes that,

67
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,400
and why the kernel team doesn't want nothing to do with it,

68
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,160
and what you can do afterwards.

69
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,160
And then, later on, in the show, we'll

70
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,440
talk about advocacy in a way that is actually effective.

71
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,400
How do you convert people to Linux in a way that sticks

72
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,200
and is going to succeed?

73
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,800
I think a lot of times in our community,

74
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,040
we get so excited about Linux that we are a little pushy.

75
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,820
And we try to convince certain people that

76
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:58,080
might not be ideal candidates.

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,880
So later on in the episode, I want

78
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:03,040
to outline maybe who isn't ideal to run Linux,

79
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,440
and the folks that are ideal, and how you can succeed

80
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,280
in switching them to Linux.

81
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,440
This is something that we've been talking about for weeks

82
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,320
internally.

83
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,440
It's not always easy, right?

84
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,000
That's the thing is, it's complicated,

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,520
and we're all blinded by our passions to some degree, right?

86
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,200
Yeah.

87
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,400
I do want people in my life to use Linux,

88
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
but like anything else, you've got

89
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,760
to think a little carefully about it.

90
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,240
Yeah.

91
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,520
I've got confessions to make later in the show.

92
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,400
But before we go any further, we've

93
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,160
got to bring in that Mumble Room Time appropriate greetings

94
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,160
virtual lug.

95
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:31,800
Hello.

96
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,480
Hello, everyone.

97
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,080
Hello.

98
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,760
Well organized.

99
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,240
Hello.

100
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:35,920
I liked that.

101
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,840
I liked that.

102
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,000
And also, coming in in high fidelity remote studio quality

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,480
cheese and Elle with us.

104
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,240
Hello, guys.

105
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,760
Hey.

106
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,240
Hello.

107
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,840
And Gal.

108
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,680
Hi, there.

109
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,320
So we have so much to start with.

110
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm very excited about the topics today

111
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,400
because a lot of times we start getting on a topic,

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,880
and I don't know, it just takes a while to go like,

113
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,400
why don't we talk about this on air?

114
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,960
Like, this is one of those weeks.

115
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,880
So I'm pretty excited to get started.

116
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,720
But I do want to start with some very, very, very good news.

117
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,200
It's kind of fun to start with something sort of nice.

118
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,800
I want to say a big happy birthday from the team here.

119
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,200
Happy birthday.

120
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Woo!

121
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,840
Yeah.

122
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,960
We got some birthdays this week.

123
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,760
First of all, big happy 21st birthday.

124
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,800
You are now legal to drink in the US of A to curl.

125
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,760
Oh, yeah.

126
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,680
A wonderful curl.

127
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,800
Everybody loves curl.

128
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,320
Who doesn't?

129
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,320
I mean, I literally use it, I think, every single day.

130
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,040
Actually, 4 billion internet users, at least at one point,

131
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,120
and 1.5 current installations per internet-connected human

132
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,640
on Earth.

133
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,960
I don't know how they know these numbers.

134
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,080
Yeah, that is a question, some of these, perhaps.

135
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,360
But they're all very impressive.

136
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,800
669 persons have authored patches that have been merged.

137
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,920
And that kind of just shows curl's hit the sweet spot.

138
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,600
It's just such a useful utility.

139
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,960
It's on the right layer of complexity and ease of use

140
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,360
that you can write complex automated scripts.

141
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,000
We're doing some of that with curl.

142
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,720
Or you can just use it on the command line

143
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,600
to download your favorite MP3 shows.

144
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,280
Yeah, well said.

145
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,120
It really is a tool.

146
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,080
It's a perfect example of a Unix slash Linux staple.

147
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,600
It's one of those staple utilities.

148
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,760
And it now consists of 160,000 lines of code

149
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,560
with over 24,000 commits.

150
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,080
So it's an active project still, which is great.

151
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,040
And 1,927 different persons have helped out so far

152
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,760
over the years.

153
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,480
See, I like that too, because they call it out separately.

154
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,440
And you can see that the community is not just people

155
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,600
getting patches merged, right?

156
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,360
Like people writing tutorials, talking about it, evangelizing,

157
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
or just filing bug reports.

158
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,560
That all helps.

159
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,440
You want to know a couple of nerdy stats?

160
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes, I do.

161
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,800
OK, so 50 different build environments for curl

162
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,800
are currently checked by their analyzer.

163
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,960
And they are spending upwards of 20 to 25 CPU hours

164
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,280
per commit checking it, per commit.

165
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,600
Well, yeah, see, they are taking a lot of time

166
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,440
to get that going.

167
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,520
And it's impressive that that's a lot of build configurations.

168
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,480
Yeah, and I guess they're going to have a party.

169
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,400
There's going to be a party out there.

170
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,520
I don't know.

171
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,280
I feel like it's something we could do a little more of

172
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,000
on the show is talk about these tools

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,320
that we use even when we don't know we're using them.

174
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,520
Like you might be using a package manager that's

175
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,560
using curl in the background to pull down a package.

176
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,360
Or maybe you're using YouTube DL and it's using curl.

177
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,680
Or there's all kinds of different use cases for curl.

178
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,760
So there's a lot of tools like that.

179
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,720
Also, I want to take a moment, and it's not

180
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,640
somebody that anybody listening to the show

181
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,760
is directly familiar with, but a member of our Jupiter

182
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
broadcasting community, Tyler, he's

183
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,200
been with the community for over 10 years.

184
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,160
It's his birthday today.

185
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,000
And I just want to say happy birthday to Tyler.

186
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,840
Happy birthday, Tyler.

187
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,360
He's a great guy.

188
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,920
Yeah, geez, you know Tyler.

189
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,760
He's just a great guy.

190
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,760
He's a wonderful guy.

191
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,240
He's all about the JB community and has been

192
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
and was really one of the first people

193
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,920
that I interacted with whenever I joined the community myself.

194
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,840
Yeah, and I guess I just want to take a little,

195
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,080
I want to try to make a little more effort this year

196
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,320
to thank the people that have been with us

197
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,480
for a really long time.

198
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,760
And I know there's a lot of you out there,

199
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,960
and Tyler's just one of many.

200
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,720
So thank you to all of you.

201
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
To Tyler, happy birthday to Tyler.

202
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,440
Also, by the way, Leonard Nimoy's birthday today.

203
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,680
Oh, wonderful.

204
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,440
The late-note Leonard Nimoy would have been,

205
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,480
I believe, 88 today.

206
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,400
Not that I'm a huge Star Trek fan or anything.

207
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,760
Now can we talk about the most important news of the week?

208
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,760
Are you good with this?

209
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,320
I knew you would want to get here,

210
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,760
and OK, let's get it over with.

211
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,440
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure

212
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,000
to announce that Nano 4.0 is released.

213
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,440
Yes, GNU Nano 4.0, the Rope of Sands edition, is out.

214
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,760
OK, that's a cool name.

215
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,000
Never mind, I changed my mind.

216
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,360
It is a super cool name.

217
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
I got nothing.

218
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,760
I got nothing.

219
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,840
I think the biggest thing for me,

220
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,320
and for what I've seen a lot of people talking about,

221
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,600
is that first thing on the list here, an overlong line

222
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,760
is no longer automatically hard wrapped.

223
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,520
And that's just like, you might have a preference about that,

224
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,760
but before, boom, just new lines injected into whatever

225
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,760
you were looking at.

226
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,800
And that's one of the reasons I never could use it.

227
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,120
I just think it's funny that that's what you've noticed.

228
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,000
What I noticed is smooth scrolling now one line at a time

229
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,880
has become the default. That's what I noticed.

230
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,280
See, OK, so there's some wheel rims.

231
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,840
There's some real rims for everyone.

232
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,400
So Wes now hosts the TechSnap program

233
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,840
with Jim Salter, who's an author over at Ars Technica.

234
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,080
And it's just really turned into a great production.

235
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
And it means that I don't get a chance now

236
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,820
to chat with you about some of these stories

237
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,160
that we traditionally would have talked about.

238
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,720
Yeah, that's true.

239
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,340
So I wanted to get your opinion on what

240
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,600
you think about this ASUS story this week, where hackers

241
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,040
hijacked the ASUS software updates

242
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,160
to install backdoors on thousands of Windows PCs.

243
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,560
I mean, the obvious pitch here is

244
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,060
this would never happen on Linux.

245
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,560
But I just think this is an insane story.

246
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,160
Researchers estimate that half a million Windows machines

247
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,080
received the malicious backdoor through the ASUS update server,

248
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,500
although the attackers appear to have been targeting maybe

249
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,080
only 600 of those systems.

250
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,840
Yeah, that's one of the weird aspects here.

251
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,900
And Kaspersky first found this and has started writing up.

252
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,940
And there will be.

253
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,520
They're going to publish at a conference coming up

254
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,580
a whole big breakdown.

255
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,040
That's not out yet.

256
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,480
But what researchers thought was weird, this is fairly clever.

257
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,640
Basically, they've gotten some keys from ASUS,

258
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,940
and then were able to have stuff that masqueraded

259
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,400
as legitimate updates that would pass all those verification

260
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,120
checks and just be installed on users' end machines.

261
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,840
Once that was there and they'd planted that,

262
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,200
then they specifically checked for MAC addresses

263
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,360
on network cards like they'd pre-identified them.

264
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,680
And only if they matched a set list did they then

265
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,720
go phone home to a command and control server

266
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,920
and install more software.

267
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,920
All right, so this is fascinating.

268
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,560
So Kaspersky Labs uncovered this attack back in January

269
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,240
after adding a new supply chain to technology,

270
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,080
like detection, that I guess is looking

271
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,440
at machines in production.

272
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,560
Yeah, I mean, supply chain attacks

273
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,160
are becoming more common and are a big deal.

274
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,480
So is this related to the buzzword I've heard

275
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,560
thrown around, Shadowhammer?

276
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,800
I've heard Shadowhammer a lot recently.

277
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,400
How is Shadowhammer related to this?

278
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,760
Yeah, that's what they're calling this.

279
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,800
And I think it actually might also refer partially

280
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,680
to some of the people behind it.

281
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,760
Like the group name might be Shadowhammer?

282
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,280
Interesting.

283
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,320
Because some of the people involved

284
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,080
or suspected threat actors here, there's

285
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
been similar looking attacks in the past.

286
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,880
So this is not entirely new.

287
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,340
It is just sort of wide scale.

288
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,800
And Kaspersky really wanted to publish it, obviously,

289
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,320
because they've improved some fixes in their software.

290
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,920
Yeah.

291
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,840
And I think it highlights a major issue that

292
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,440
is built into human beings, is we trust brands.

293
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,040
And you see a brand name.

294
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,080
It's a known vendor.

295
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,600
It's an update coming from ASUS.

296
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,740
And it's signed.

297
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,800
Why wouldn't you think that's safe?

298
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,600
And it kind of makes me want to eat a little bit of my hat.

299
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,040
Because System76 recently announced a firmware update

300
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,000
system that was based around the blockchain

301
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,120
to validate if it was valid.

302
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,880
And if the firmware update wasn't valid,

303
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,840
it has a rollback mechanism.

304
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,320
I kind of said, yeah, come on.

305
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,160
Just use LVFS.

306
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,600
So Emma is joining us.

307
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,360
She's in the Mumble Room right now.

308
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,280
And I think this is kind of interesting

309
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,560
that you guys were looking at an update mechanism that sort of

310
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,720
looks at if something is verifiably secure.

311
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,120
Now, Emma, have you had issues with firmware updates?

312
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,520
And has this been something that you guys have been considering

313
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,440
could happen?

314
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,920
I haven't had any issues or have customers report any issues.

315
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,720
But I think the firmware is the lowest-level software

316
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,400
that you can access.

317
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,960
So it's important for that to be the most secure.

318
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Right, because it's doing things you're not even aware of.

319
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,360
You have no idea what's going on there.

320
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,080
And so I do like the idea of removing

321
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,680
a little bit of the brand trust out of the picture.

322
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,080
I mean, that's what it shows here, right?

323
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,120
Even with cryptography, you can have

324
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,720
stuff that helps you ensure that it was signed with the right key.

325
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,520
But you're entirely reliant on that organization

326
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,120
and basically what comes down to people and procedures

327
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,840
to maintain the security of that key and really

328
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,400
all the infrastructure in between.

329
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,240
So at that side, if we don't use additional technology,

330
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,120
this could happen to LVFS or any of our package repos.

331
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,240
I was going to ask if you think LVFS could be susceptible

332
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,480
to something like this.

333
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,960
I'm sure Richard Hughes would argue that there

334
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,040
is some precautions in place.

335
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,120
And that's where it can be a mixed bag between,

336
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,960
do you rely on centralization so that you

337
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,760
can have more resources dedicated to distributing

338
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,440
firmware from many sources?

339
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,320
Or do you go another route where you want multiple options

340
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,080
so that if that is compromised, well,

341
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,800
system 76, for instance, wouldn't be affected?

342
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,840
My understanding, too, is that this isn't necessarily

343
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,160
completely solved because ASUS still hasn't invalidated two

344
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,160
of the compromised certificates, which means the attackers,

345
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,440
or I suppose anyone else really that figures this out,

346
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,360
could potentially still abuse this.

347
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,880
Yes, which is kind of unfortunate.

348
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,680
They stole two certificates, it looks like,

349
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,240
one that expired last year, and then there

350
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
was still one valid one.

351
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,320
And so far, that hasn't been invalidated.

352
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,600
So I don't know why ASUS is kind of dropping the ball there.

353
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,040
It must be because it's going to break something.

354
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,560
Yeah, probably there's a process they need to go to do,

355
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,680
update, get new keys that they can trust in their system

356
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,040
before they can invalidate that one.

357
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,560
I imagine they're relying on it.

358
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,480
Man, the Windows ecosystem is such a hot mess.

359
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,600
Wow.

360
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,480
It's so gross with all these different updaters.

361
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,520
When you get a Windows machine out of the box,

362
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,600
there's three or four different installation interfaces,

363
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,200
install wizards, and MSI installers,

364
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,640
and custom written installers.

365
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,360
And then there's the vendor's driver updates and firmware

366
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,440
updates, and then the Intel updates.

367
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,440
There's like Windows updates.

368
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,480
The culture makes you accept those things as normal.

369
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,840
You know, I think Elle often says that Linux

370
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,400
has too many repositories.

371
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,360
She'll often say, like, every time the solution

372
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,520
is add another repository.

373
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,800
But then I think about that situation on Windows,

374
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,160
and I think, I don't know if I'd like that any better.

375
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,680
No.

376
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,800
No.

377
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,640
Wow, ASUS.

378
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,800
So we're all getting Macs?

379
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,600
Is that what you're saying?

380
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,280
Yeah, and then we'll get no updates.

381
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,280
I mean, then we're really trusting the manufacturer

382
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,280
with their keys baked in.

383
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,160
Yeah, as long as you're good with a driver from four years

384
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,000
ago for your video card, then you're set.

385
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,680
All right, well, I guess we can move on.

386
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,160
But I just thought that was a fascinating story

387
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,480
that Windows users.

388
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,720
Also, just as like a slight PSA, if you have any reason

389
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,640
to think you're one of those 600 people that

390
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,960
may have been targeted, they do have a little website

391
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,360
that we'll have linked where you can go enter your Mac

392
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,400
and check.

393
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,360
I was chatting with somebody that works at Linux Academy who

394
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,080
runs Linux as their main desktop but has an ASUS system running

395
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,160
Windows for gaming.

396
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,040
And he's like, I'm not so sure.

397
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,000
I might be one of these.

398
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
So yeah, it could be you.

399
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,400
It could be, because you just never know.

400
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,240
Anyways, so there's a distribution.

401
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,560
I'm not going to go with the vernacular the media is using.

402
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,080
There's a distribution out there these days that

403
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,680
is causing a bit of controversy, and it's

404
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,760
called SIGINT OS, Signals Intelligent OS.

405
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,520
Signals intelligence would be sort of like a spy trade

406
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,760
craft term for intelligence about communications.

407
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,960
And SIGINT OS is an Ubuntu-based distribution

408
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,640
with a number of built-in intelligence applications

409
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,560
for software-defined radios, amongst a bunch

410
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,680
of other things.

411
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,440
Yeah, that's kind of what's interesting is,

412
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,960
by all accounts, it seems to be very well executed,

413
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,680
a built-in GUI that grants easy access to just

414
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,400
all the common tools that they've got ahead

415
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,880
and installed for you, things like an FM and GPS transmitter,

416
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,920
a jammer, a GSM base station search tool,

417
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,000
and an IMS eye catcher.

418
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,960
Now, that sounds interesting.

419
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,480
So it's a competitor to Kali, but it's focusing right there.

420
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,840
What you just talked about is cellular technology and GPS

421
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,040
technology.

422
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,040
Yeah, right, and then that's kind of interesting.

423
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,580
They've targeted this specific thing.

424
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:01,960
It also has teased an LTE search and LTE decoder tool,

425
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,240
which that could be very interesting.

426
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,600
We've seen more and more flaws in those cellular protocols

427
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,720
over the years.

428
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,040
Yeah, I'm not quite clear on if you can just

429
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,520
download this distro and start scanning for LTE devices

430
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,160
if you have LTE equipment.

431
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,560
It sounds like you need a license

432
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,400
from the distribution provider.

433
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,240
Oh, interesting.

434
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,020
Yeah, I mean, when you get into some of these things,

435
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,640
there are various legal requirements,

436
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,820
so I could see why they might be worried about that.

437
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,120
And we've got to say, like you said,

438
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,520
there was some controversy and such.

439
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,120
It's always going to bring up the debate around tools

440
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,000
can be used for good and for bad.

441
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,580
So if you're a legitimate researcher,

442
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,080
we should be probing for security in these products.

443
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,040
You could also abuse it.

444
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,840
The other way to put that, too, because you're right,

445
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,640
and the other way to think about that

446
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,080
is where is the line of enablement?

447
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,560
Where are you enabling casual people

448
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,120
to abuse systems versus empowering administrators

449
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,840
to check their own systems or people that

450
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,480
are doing penetration testing?

451
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,080
And this distribution, I think, kind of walks that line.

452
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,080
It's a two gigabit, two gigabit, like I feel like the oldest

453
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,320
person in the room when I do gigabytes versus megabytes.

454
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,440
It's a two gigabyte ISO file, which is, to me,

455
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,600
even still seems like a lot.

456
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,200
I appreciate that it's not now, but to me, it does.

457
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,660
I mean, it's still kind of a lot.

458
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,000
I just remember trying to fit them on CDs, you know?

459
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,480
And you don't want to download that on mobile.

460
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,120
Or dial-up.

461
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,920
The thing where I kind of feel like they maybe

462
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,400
crossed the line is this GUI that they

463
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,240
include to find LTE base stations and the IME

464
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,120
numbers of phones.

465
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,840
That isn't necessarily a bad thing,

466
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,960
but what's the practical use case for that?

467
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,200
When do you need to survey LTE stations

468
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,080
and try to collect the identification

469
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,840
numbers of phones?

470
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,360
That's fair, although the part that gets me about it

471
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,600
is, especially for wireless things,

472
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,320
those are just signals passing through you and your device.

473
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,960
It's another network signal.

474
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,320
And you can record it, and then you can just.

475
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,260
Now, where the line gets more gray, in my opinion,

476
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,440
is when you start actively communicating back

477
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,680
and interacting with the system.

478
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,280
Acting as a base station, injecting false information,

479
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,360
or even just recording private information.

480
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,200
Hm.

481
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,400
That's a, yeah, that's.

482
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,480
Right, like you can record an FM station for personal play

483
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,640
mate, because that's how you play the thing

484
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,800
in the first place.

485
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,560
Also, just a mention here that it's still

486
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,200
using Unity 7 for the desktop on this distro.

487
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,280
I just think that's great.

488
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,480
I mean, we're going to come back to this,

489
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,320
but it's a practical tool, I guess.

490
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,600
I like how it also, it's all wrapped up

491
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,520
in this beautiful little GUI.

492
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,320
But I'm pretty sure the FCC would have

493
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,440
some problems with Jammer.

494
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,480
That's what I'm thinking.

495
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,520
You know, some of these tools, I think

496
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,200
it's maybe a little too far.

497
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,640
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

498
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,140
It's probably pushing it, especially

499
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,060
when it comes to the cellular network stuff.

500
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,120
That's crossing a line.

501
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,640
But to Wes's point, I kind of feel

502
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,560
like this is becoming more and more the standard way

503
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,960
we network.

504
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,660
Cellular networking is becoming the way more and more people

505
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,280
are connected.

506
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,440
Yes, it's become almost an important public utility,

507
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,360
in a sense, even though it's not treated that way.

508
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,240
And we should, I think in particular,

509
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,680
there has been a dearth of testing.

510
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,880
These have been very proprietary and controlled

511
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,440
because there's only a couple main players that have access

512
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,120
and either make or use the tech.

513
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,560
So I would like to see more research done.

514
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,980
That doesn't mean I want people jamming my cell phone, which

515
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,600
is exactly what I do not want.

516
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,720
I know, because that's really going to be annoying.

517
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,680
If that becomes commonplace, well, what we're going to see

518
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,560
is an arms race, and the cellular carriers

519
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,560
will have to be able to innovate and update

520
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,580
their networks at a way faster pace than they do now.

521
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,280
But maybe this is the kind of thing

522
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,400
that will force that to happen.

523
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,040
6G, here we go.

524
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,600
Yeah, forget 5G.

525
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,080
Well, who wouldn't want to jam someone

526
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,600
that's on their phone and stuck in traffic or something

527
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,120
like that, right?

528
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,960
That's just burning up your time.

529
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,240
And so let me just jam the entire freeway.

530
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,760
I suppose there's also an opportunity for encryption

531
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,040
to succeed here, Brent.

532
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,280
Yeah, it feels to me like when you open up

533
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,800
some of these networks to some testing

534
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,440
from some white hat hackers, then it

535
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,360
may push the envelope a little bit,

536
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,200
because some of these networks have been in sync for a long time.

537
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,360
And so I would love to see encryption a little bit

538
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,960
everywhere for everybody's benefit.

539
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,800
And you're seeing that a little bit more

540
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,040
with encrypted messengers and stuff on our cell phones.

541
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,480
So why can't the cell networks be better than they are?

542
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,840
The technology seems to be there.

543
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,340
Yeah.

544
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,360
I could see if screwing around with the cell networks

545
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,200
becomes more accessible, it could force their hand.

546
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,000
But the short-term result would be

547
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,960
it is people that are pranking you,

548
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,240
like you go to a group event and all the cells get jammed

549
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,520
and nobody has any data.

550
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,800
Ha, ha, millennials can't use Instagram.

551
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,120
That's how it'll be justified.

552
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,480
But the reality is that's actually

553
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,900
a very important communications tool.

554
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,000
So there will be short-term losses.

555
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,740
But long-term, you're going to force the cellular networks

556
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,640
to react.

557
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,760
I think the other thing that I can't actually speak to,

558
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,400
but we should think about is how does it affect the landscape?

559
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,800
What other tools exist that have similar capabilities?

560
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,880
So if you are even a little bit motivated in the prankster

561
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,280
mindset, is this unique in making it easy for you

562
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:24,760
to do this?

563
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,360
Or is it just better executed for professionals

564
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,200
that want to use it?

565
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,960
And I don't know.

566
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,040
I don't use these tools personally, so I can't say.

567
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,420
This is an area that I haven't messed around with.

568
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,040
Kali Linux and going after network systems.

569
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,460
In fact, I spent some time about a solid year and a half,

570
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,360
really, because for six months, it

571
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,600
was sort of like trying it out.

572
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,400
But for a solid year, I did contracting

573
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,960
as a penetration tester.

574
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,120
And one of the absolute most enjoyable things I did really

575
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,400
was so much fun to drop a text file on a Windows server

576
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,320
desktop saying, I've owned you, or get access to.

577
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,640
Man, I remember the time that I found the FTP server

578
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,560
that the clinics, like they have one

579
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,760
of these big multi-function printer

580
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,800
fact scanner huge units from Xerox that you get

581
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,920
a monthly price.

582
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,880
And Xerox is just kind of hangs out

583
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,040
because it's always broken.

584
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,560
And it was FTPing the images of client records

585
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,400
to a server with no password.

586
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,200
Plain text FTP, no password.

587
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,920
This is great.

588
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,440
And by hiring me, I was able to sort of outline

589
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,440
these issues to them.

590
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,200
And they were able to get them fixed up before anybody

591
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,220
actually exploited that.

592
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,640
And I was using things like Kali Linux.

593
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,960
I don't remember Kali Linux's.

594
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,640
It wasn't always called Kali back then.

595
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,800
It was called something else.

596
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,560
Do you remember what it was called?

597
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,760
There was another name for Kali.

598
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,300
And in the project, there was a change.

599
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,680
But I used it for ages.

600
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,680
And that's a very valuable tool.

601
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,280
And we will see where this goes.

602
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,160
Siginsos is kind of a fun name, too.

603
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:56,680
All right.

604
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,960
There is some really important stuff we need to cover.

605
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,920
A lot in housekeeping this week.

606
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,120
I want to start by saying, if you're looking for work

607
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,640
and you are a Ruby on Rails developer,

608
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,560
or maybe you love yourself some Angular,

609
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,560
or you're willing to learn some Angular,

610
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,440
Linux Academy is hiring right now for several positions.

611
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,060
Remote, full time, full benefits.

612
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,320
It's a great company to work for, linuxacademy.com

613
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,560
slash careers.

614
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,960
If you are a Ruby on Rails developer,

615
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,360
or an Angular guy or gal that wants

616
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,440
to be involved in developing future additions to Linux

617
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
Academy platform.

618
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:32,640
Yeah.

619
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,240
I mean, that's it, right?

620
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,920
Like, come aboard, help make the platform better,

621
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,000
and everything gets better.

622
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,440
You get to directly help train more Linux users, which

623
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,360
is one of my favorite things about the job.

624
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,800
linuxacademy.com slash careers.

625
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:48,680
I would really encourage you, if you're thinking about a change,

626
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,300
do it.

627
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:49,800
Do it.

628
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,480
Because first of all, there are so many great things

629
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,400
about remote work.

630
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,440
Not to make housekeeping super long,

631
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,840
but cheese just recently transitioned

632
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,160
to working from home.

633
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,840
And I'm curious, cheese, does it feel like freedom?

634
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,720
What is it?

635
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,000
If you could sum it up just really briefly.

636
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,320
Yeah, really briefly.

637
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,560
I mean, it's different.

638
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,760
I quickly learned that my dogs do not

639
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,280
observe daylight savings time, that one of my dogs

640
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,920
get aggravated if I change it from Judge Judy.

641
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,960
One of my dogs gets really upset about that.

642
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,280
That's a complicated dog, man.

643
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,560
Yeah, they don't have a concept of work time versus play time.

644
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,320
How's the commute now?

645
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,520
The commute is wonderful.

646
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,880
It's about 10 feet.

647
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,440
But I do go through a regular get dressed,

648
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,200
put on regular clothes, as if I'm going

649
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,760
to go into an office somewhere.

650
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,160
It is a little different whenever you're time off,

651
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,680
because your house is still where you work.

652
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,560
But it's cool.

653
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,240
I have an opportunity to go to the beach.

654
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,920
And I did that this past weekend just

655
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,640
to disconnect from everything.

656
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,440
And it was great.

657
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,720
You know what I find that I've only started doing,

658
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,880
even just recently, and I know you do this,

659
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,440
is going somewhere to work.

660
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh, yeah.

661
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,680
Like a restaurant or a coffee shop or something like this.

662
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,640
I always thought that was such a MacBook using, coffee drinking.

663
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,280
But it actually is.

664
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,560
There's an energy you get by the people working around you.

665
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,320
I know that sounds weird, but you're around other people.

666
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,640
It's a change in pace.

667
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,680
And then at some point, you probably

668
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,880
want to go home, which can be a nice stimulus to just be

669
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,800
productive and wrap up.

670
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,360
You're like, OK, well, I came here to get this work done.

671
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,800
You kind of get your work done.

672
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,520
And then you can have a nice walk home, decompress.

673
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,440
Yes, and I'll go do XYZ at the coffee shop.

674
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,280
And then when I get back to the studio,

675
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,240
I'm going to work on this.

676
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,440
I separate it up that way, too.

677
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,080
So I think it's gotten me more active in my local community,

678
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,960
because it's not coming home from work

679
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,480
and then dreading going back out.

680
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,680
I actually get excited about going and seeing other people.

681
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,640
So I've become a lot more active in the meetups near me.

682
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,560
Interesting.

683
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,120
I can kind of see that, too.

684
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,840
That is one of the other things you have to be wary of, right?

685
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,160
You don't have an office anymore.

686
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,480
It's just you at your home.

687
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,600
You know, what I have found, too,

688
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,760
is I will get a different kind of work done

689
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,680
when I'm in office, like down at Linux Academy

690
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,320
versus back here at the studio.

691
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,160
Both good, just different.

692
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,960
That's interesting.

693
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,720
Just different kinds of work.

694
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,000
Anyways, let's keep going, because I was

695
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,680
going to try to make this brief.

696
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,920
If you are thinking about going to Linux Fest Northwest,

697
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,640
and you should be.

698
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,720
You have until the 31st, I think it is, of this month?

699
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,840
Yes, the end of this month.

700
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,320
OK.

701
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:33,920
May.

702
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,280
March.

703
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,160
March.

704
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,880
We're a mess.

705
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm going to confuse it, yeah.

706
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,800
The end of this month.

707
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,640
It's March 31st.

708
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,480
If you want to do a fancy sponsored Linux Fest Northwest

709
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,560
shirt, like you want to help out the fest

710
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,640
and get a fancy shirt out of it, they've got an $80 shirt.

711
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,080
I know it seems like a lot, but it's

712
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,520
because you're kind of contributing to Linux Fest,

713
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,360
which is a completely 100% lug run event.

714
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,200
The Bellingham Linux Users Group is

715
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,800
what puts Linux Fest together, right?

716
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,560
It's not a foundation.

717
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,040
It's not a corporation.

718
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,240
It's not a group of companies in the Pacific Northwest.

719
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,640
It is the guys at the Bellingham Linux.

720
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,320
And you're not making anyone a red chair.

721
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,120
You're just helping make the conference a little bit better.

722
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,000
Yeah.

723
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,600
So we'll have a link in the show notes,

724
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
because it's kind of like first come, first serve.

725
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,840
And it looks like they're going to have

726
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,000
a cool design for it, too.

727
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,400
So I just want to give them a mention,

728
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,160
because I think it'd be kind of cool if you're thinking

729
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,360
about going, or you just love the idea of something

730
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,480
like that.

731
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,120
And then obviously, I need to remind everybody

732
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,600
that Ansible is a thing, and that we will have a study group

733
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,800
on Ansible next week.

734
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,400
Meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

735
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,800
for details on that.

736
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,360
And I'm happy to say it's going to be hosted

737
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,040
by our very own L and Wes Payne.

738
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,840
Hey, that's us.

739
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,240
That is you guys.

740
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,280
And I think that's going to be great, because first of all,

741
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,640
I know you're a great presenter.

742
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,600
And second of all, I know you have a lot of hands

743
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,040
on with this kind of stuff.

744
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,120
And so if you want to learn a little more about Ansible,

745
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,240
we'll have the time and date.

746
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,080
It's 1 o'clock our time, which is before Linux Unplugged.

747
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,160
Before Linux Unplugged.

748
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,000
We're trying it at a different time, before the show.

749
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,560
And we'll learn some stuff about Ansible.

750
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,760
And then we can unwind with an excellent little Linux

751
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,280
Unplugged.

752
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,080
Absolutely.

753
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,600
And I want to put an invite out there

754
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,520
to anybody who is experienced with Ansible or a bit

755
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,600
of an Ansible pro.

756
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,320
Please consider joining our Mumble Room

757
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,520
and help answering questions.

758
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,760
Because we'd like to answer a lot of questions.

759
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,720
There is our early indicators that this

760
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,920
is a topic that people are pretty interested in.

761
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,640
And we've got 50 people already signed up for the meetup.

762
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,600
And I think it's something that people are trying

763
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,560
to wrap their heads around.

764
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,840
And we really want to help the community learn and figure

765
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,440
this stuff out.

766
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,120
It's like we've expanded from being a virtual Lug

767
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,400
to now we have like a virtual Birds of a Feather session.

768
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,320
So it's just going to be a place to talk about and learn

769
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:55,800
Ansible.

770
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,560
That's exactly it.

771
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,840
That is exactly it.

772
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,680
The virtual, and a lot of times Lugs

773
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,520
will have people come in and present stuff.

774
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,400
And it's just, it's expanding that.

775
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,480
And it's expanding that.

776
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,960
And calling it a virtual Birds of a Feather session

777
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,240
is actually, that's a pretty good way to describe it.

778
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,440
And down the road, as we kind of figure this out,

779
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,120
I could absolutely see us opening this kind of thing

780
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,160
up to community contributors that

781
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,160
would like to cover a topic that they're an expert on.

782
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,160
It's not just limited to Linux Academy, Training Architects,

783
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,360
or Westpane.

784
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,080
We're going to open up to the community.

785
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,800
We're just kind of getting familiar with how to do this.

786
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,040
And I think this study group is going to be a good one.

787
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,960
The Ansible Fundamental Study Group, next Tuesday,

788
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,480
one hour before our regular Linux Unplugged Lifetime.

789
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,000
That's 1 PM Pacific.

790
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,840
Of course, we have all the details at meetup.com

791
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,760
slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

792
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,060
That's going to be pretty cool.

793
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,560
I think that's going to be a good one.

794
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,720
I'm looking forward to it.

795
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,640
Now, I also want to mention that DebConf 19 is

796
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,300
making a call for proposals.

797
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:58,000
If you'd like to present a DebConf this year,

798
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,520
well, now is the time.

799
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,680
It's from July 14th and 19th.

800
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,220
So go get that submitted.

801
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,320
We will have a link in the show notes for DebConf stuff.

802
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,840
Oh, wouldn't that be neat?

803
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,200
You've got a cool event coming up, it sounds like, too.

804
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,880
Oh, yeah.

805
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,960
In May, I think it is.

806
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,880
It is in May, yeah.

807
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,400
What is it?

808
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,480
I guess we should probably tell people.

809
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,080
I mean, why not?

810
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,280
If they're going to be there, they

811
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,480
can come say hi to you and L. L.

812
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,520
Do you remember the details on is it Kubicon and when it is?

813
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,040
May 20th through 24th in Barcelona, Spain.

814
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,200
Boom.

815
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,320
How about that, an event in Barcelona, Spain.

816
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,120
Come say hi to Wes and L. What a lovely place to have an event.

817
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,720
I'll be here holding down.

818
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,400
This is weird to sit one out.

819
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,040
Yeah, that is weird.

820
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,240
Never really done that before.

821
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,520
Hey, if anyone finds us, I want to go on another ghost tour.

822
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,680
So I will organize that.

823
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,200
Just ping me, and I will get that happening.

824
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,120
Awesome, a ghost tour in Spain.

825
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,160
Wow, that would really be next level, actually.

826
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:49,960
I love that.

827
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,760
So there you go.

828
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,360
Details in the show notes, if you

829
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,120
want to know more, which is in your podcast player of choice

830
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,840
or over at linuxunplugged.com slash 294.

831
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:04,080
Now, I wanted to cover a couple of things in the show

832
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,320
that I feel like maybe people have run into that we've never

833
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,320
talked about.

834
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,040
Because to be honest, we have a bit of a bias on this show.

835
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,400
And there's just no way around it.

836
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:22,000
We've all been using desktop Linux for years now.

837
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,240
And I didn't think it stopped me from recognizing

838
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,240
deficiencies or where desktop Linux wasn't super strong.

839
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,560
But I got to say, with Jason Evangelo from Choose Linux

840
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,320
doing this challenge, this distro challenge,

841
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,280
and working closely with Elle as she tries out

842
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,680
the different distributions.

843
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:49,120
And both of them are completely technical.

844
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,560
Both of them are very familiar with operating systems.

845
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,840
Competent debuggers.

846
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,400
Yeah, and just to watch the different kind of issues

847
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,640
they've run into.

848
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,600
It's kind of been like little, oh, yeah, mm, right.

849
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,840
It's been a lot of that.

850
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,280
It's been a lot of like, oh, yeah, that's right.

851
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,200
That's just something I've learned to avoid.

852
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,080
Mm, oh, yeah, that problem.

853
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,200
Yeah, I just put an Intel card in.

854
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,640
Now that's what I do, oh, yeah.

855
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,440
Oh, for that, yeah, if I'm going to have more than three

856
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,000
monitors, I just do it on a desktop.

857
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,320
Yeah, these are all the things I've

858
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,880
internalized that I just sort of forgive Linux for now.

859
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,800
And I'm watching it from fresh perspectives

860
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,240
and from fresh eyes.

861
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,720
And one of the more interesting ones,

862
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,960
one of the more interesting issues that cropped up

863
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,120
was Elle's tainted kernel.

864
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,440
And I honestly hadn't heard of this.

865
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,600
And I'm imagining, I'm just picturing it, Elle.

866
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,440
You're sitting there looking at your logs,

867
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,080
trying to debug what was going on.

868
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,440
I mean, there must have been some issue

869
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,840
you were trying to solve.

870
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,360
And then you see tainted kernel.

871
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,600
Take me through what happened.

872
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,920
Why were you debugging?

873
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,200
And what was the experience going through the logs

874
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,960
and seeing that?

875
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,160
So I'd love to tell you that I was actually

876
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,480
debugging at the time.

877
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,240
But all I did was open the lid to my computer.

878
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,080
I log in, and suddenly I've got this pop-up telling me

879
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,840
that my kernel is tainted.

880
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,680
No additional information, no click here for more.

881
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,920
Like a GNOME notification came down

882
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,160
saying you have a tainted kernel, like a desktop

883
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,880
notification?

884
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,920
A system alert.

885
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,560
Wow.

886
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,480
Yeah, so I'm like, OK.

887
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,760
So I start looking in logs, and I'm

888
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,840
trying to grep the word tainted out of system logs,

889
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,160
and I can't find anything.

890
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,760
So I'm thinking maybe I'm just not

891
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,960
looking in the right place.

892
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,280
I'm looking at journal CTL.

893
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,800
I keep missing my old VAR log messages so badly

894
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,720
in that moment.

895
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,440
Oh, I know.

896
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:35,940
I know.

897
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,920
That is the one thing.

898
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,080
I miss VAR log messages so much.

899
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,680
For clarification, it's Fedora, right?

900
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
And in what version?

901
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,920
Fedora 29.

902
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,480
And I was following Jason's challenge,

903
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,840
so we were running GNOME for GNOME.

904
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,520
Right, of course.

905
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,320
I believe it was a 4.20 kernel.

906
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,200
Yeah, OK.

907
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,680
So yeah, I get in there, and I'm looking at logs.

908
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
And since I can't find anything, I

909
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,960
do what I hopefully every other admin does, and I go to Google.

910
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,160
I'm about three pages in, and I can't

911
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,760
find any official documentation.

912
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,960
So then I start looking at just forums,

913
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,480
and I narrow it down to either I've

914
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,640
installed proprietary drivers, which I haven't made a change,

915
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,720
or my system is completely hosed, and I've been owned.

916
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,360
There was no in-between ground.

917
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,080
Wow.

918
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,960
And just to clarify, had this just been a stock Fedora

919
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,160
install, like you hadn't gone through the process in GNOME

920
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,360
software where you install proprietary stuff?

921
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,200
And you just have Intel graphics, right?

922
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,320
Yep, I've just been following everything as traditional

923
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,880
as I could get it.

924
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,040
So I, till this moment, cannot tell you

925
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,200
what changed that suddenly has this alert going off.

926
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,840
So I close it out, and I'm thinking, OK, I do an update.

927
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,440
I turn off the computer.

928
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,440
I reboot it.

929
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,960
I want to say I did it three times,

930
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,440
because I think I actually did, just to be safe.

931
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,640
And I come back, and suddenly I have another kernel error

932
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,840
with no additional information, just kernel error.

933
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,120
So I close it out.

934
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,860
I turn it off.

935
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,480
I turn it back on again, and we're back

936
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,280
to the tainted system message.

937
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,080
So at that point, I'm thinking, OK,

938
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,160
this must be really bad, because they keep notifying me

939
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,560
every time I turn it on.

940
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,320
And it's when I start asking you guys,

941
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,520
is there a tool that I can use to test my kernel's integrity?

942
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,840
And is this even something I should be doing?

943
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,000
I hadn't heard the term tainted kernel,

944
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,320
but then doing searching, I realized

945
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,920
it's been around for a little bit.

946
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,280
And it really kind of comes from the, I mean,

947
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,760
from what I could kind of grok searching on it,

948
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,160
from the perspective of the kernel developers,

949
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,000
considering the kernel to be tainted.

950
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,240
Would you say that's accurate?

951
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:38,520
Yeah.

952
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
And I think one thing we should think about here

953
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,080
is when you load a module, you're

954
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,520
loading like a part of the kernel, right?

955
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,680
You get access to kernel memory, the kernel space.

956
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,340
You can do some pretty dangerous things.

957
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,080
And so if you do have some weird condition,

958
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,600
and you're trying to debug the kernel,

959
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
that might not be useful, right?

960
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
If you've loaded some weird proprietary driver

961
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,520
that the kernel developers can't see or touch or really access,

962
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,940
who knows what it did to memory?

963
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,800
And that might have been causing the fault.

964
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,240
So they want to know that's one access, but it could also be.

965
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,280
And I think this is what happened in L's case.

966
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,440
It was just a warning, right?

967
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,840
So something went wrong.

968
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,480
The atheros driver didn't like some change

969
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,840
when it came back up from sleep in this particular kernel

970
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,960
version, emitted a warning, and then that

971
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,920
is enough to say, look, something unusual

972
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,040
happened with the kernel.

973
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,400
So even though the atheros driver is open source, and it's

974
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,800
Yeah, it's not just related to license or proprietary.

975
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,920
It's really just to understand in the debugging

976
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,160
context, did something weird happen

977
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,480
to this kernel that won't actually help us?

978
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,880
Or another way to put that would be,

979
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,440
where's the line of responsibility?

980
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,600
Is it the kernel developer's responsibility?

981
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,480
Is it the distro maintainer's responsibility?

982
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,920
Or is it the driver developer's?

983
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,920
I mean, there's even stuff where the BIOS can send a signal

984
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,220
that there's been some weird machine check exception.

985
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,640
And that can be considered the kernel tainted,

986
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,180
because again, who knows what happened?

987
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:54,000
But I kind of feel like it does highlight and really underscore

988
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,020
how this system isn't really built for end users,

989
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,840
necessarily.

990
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,320
So if I honestly, even myself, if I saw a tainted kernel,

991
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,280
I would think I've been compromised in some way.

992
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,040
I would immediately start Google searching

993
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,800
and probably figure it out eventually.

994
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,120
But I would look at that and think, something is bad.

995
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:17,320
Either my system is busted, or I have been hacked

996
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,880
or compromised.

997
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,680
Maybe that repository I just added.

998
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,640
You start going and looking for problems.

999
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,320
Which could be useful, but also might just be a rabbit hole.

1000
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:29,120
Like, Elle, were you experiencing Wi-Fi problems before this?

1001
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,760
Or was your Wi-Fi generally working?

1002
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,000
No, and I didn't have any problems even after it started.

1003
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,520
All I had to go on was that one error message.

1004
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,760
So it wasn't even a problem.

1005
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,880
So is this maybe a case of Fedora

1006
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,200
just being a little over-aggressive

1007
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,400
in displaying information?

1008
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,520
Maybe other distros are having the same warning.

1009
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,360
They're just not telling you about it?

1010
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:52,360
It's like a computer that's a hypochondriac.

1011
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,400
You start searching for a problem when there is none that exists.

1012
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,360
I looked at this, and of course, my response was,

1013
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,480
well, I would have put an Intel chip in there.

1014
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
That's what I would have.

1015
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,240
And that's such a typical Linux user response.

1016
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,880
And I hate to be that guy.

1017
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,880
Oh, I just would have.

1018
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,760
Just pop open the back of your XPS

1019
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,280
and put an Intel chip in there.

1020
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,960
Yeah, right.

1021
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
We can't tell people to do that.

1022
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,360
Some of us are fine, but other people.

1023
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,000
Sometimes people don't need their system.

1024
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,800
They don't own it.

1025
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,960
It's a work system.

1026
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,440
They can't.

1027
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,240
And that's where I think we're going to move on to this

1028
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,120
as we keep discussing.

1029
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,320
But it's OK to present how you can do that to get better

1030
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,720
and more compatible hardware.

1031
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,240
But you can't expect that everyone's

1032
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,360
going to have the means or access or control to do that.

1033
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,520
Yeah.

1034
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,080
So I guess that would probably be a good segue

1035
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,360
to talk about the thing that we've been discussing

1036
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,360
internally recently.

1037
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,600
About every three months or so, somebody

1038
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,880
discovers that Jim Zimlin, the head of the Linux Foundation,

1039
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,200
has a MacBook.

1040
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,360
And they try to get a few clicks from it.

1041
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,960
And they try to get a bunch of outrage going.

1042
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,240
And it creates this really nasty dialogue

1043
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,240
in the different places where the community has its dialogues.

1044
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,240
And we all know where those places are.

1045
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,720
And a lot of the times, it comes down to,

1046
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,960
like, here's a couple of headlines.

1047
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,320
We're not going to link to these articles in the show notes

1048
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,480
because, again, it's clickbait.

1049
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,840
But there's headlines.

1050
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,120
And I guess if you really want it, you could go read it.

1051
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,480
But here's a headline.

1052
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,080
Jim Zimlin, head of Linux Foundation, friend or foe,

1053
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,200
uses Mac OS.

1054
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,360
And it's got some really solid logic in the article

1055
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,680
as you read through it, like things like fun fact

1056
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,000
and other things like that.

1057
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,320
Here's another article headline.

1058
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,520
Jim Zimlin's Linux Foundation still does not

1059
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,360
care about Linux desktops.

1060
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,760
Boom.

1061
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,080
Just dropping it right there.

1062
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:58,880
And I've kind of been that guy.

1063
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,320
You could probably put a highlight reel together

1064
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:04,240
of me being like, why are there so many MacBooks at Linux

1065
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,120
events and giving people hard times?

1066
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,600
Like, probably a good, solid few minutes

1067
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,320
of years of me saying that.

1068
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
So I've been there.

1069
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,000
I understand.

1070
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,520
But there is sort of a line, I think.

1071
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:24,600
And as Linux becomes more and more dominant on the server,

1072
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,800
there will be more and more users

1073
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,680
that come to Linux for very practical reasons

1074
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,800
for their job, to create software

1075
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,320
to run on those servers in the cloud.

1076
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,600
And they don't really care about your free software

1077
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,880
or your open source.

1078
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,920
And it doesn't mean that there isn't an opportunity

1079
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,240
to educate them, but it means you could scare them away.

1080
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,200
And I'm going to tell you, I have an example

1081
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,600
that we're going to talk about here in a moment.

1082
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,280
But before we get there, I want to talk about something that

1083
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,760
was published on March 23rd.

1084
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,360
Funny enough, Wes, did you notice it actually says

1085
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,440
published March 23rd slash 24th?

1086
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,040
Maybe it was published at midnight.

1087
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,320
By Richard Stallman.

1088
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,280
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

1089
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,440
And I think this is the root cause here.

1090
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,360
It goes back to the beginning of the free software movement.

1091
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,760
It is in our DNA.

1092
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,720
It is fundamentally at the root of our culture.

1093
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,760
So perhaps it is unfixable.

1094
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,240
But I want to read something.

1095
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,240
And I would like you, listener, to draw your own conclusions.

1096
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,640
You can read the entire piece.

1097
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,920
We'll have it linked in the show notes.

1098
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,480
I'll read a highlight.

1099
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,320
I'll try not to do a Richard Stallman voice.

1100
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,000
And I guess I should say the context of this

1101
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,640
is Richard Stallman is talking about install fests.

1102
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,960
And he writes, if users have to wrestle

1103
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,120
with this choice between installing

1104
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,680
proprietary software and free software only,

1105
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,400
then they should draw at least a moral lesson from it

1106
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,760
and maybe get a better computer later.

1107
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,880
But when the install fest makes compromises

1108
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,520
on the user's behalf, say it shelters the user

1109
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,660
from a moral decision, the user never

1110
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,920
sees something other than convenience is at stake.

1111
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,680
In effect, the install fest makes the deal with the devil

1112
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,840
on the user's behalf.

1113
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,180
There's a couple of things in here

1114
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:15,000
that I already find fascinating.

1115
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,600
We start with the assumed that for everyone,

1116
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,080
this is a moral decision and a moral lesson.

1117
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,760
So that's an assumed in this conversation, which I actually

1118
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,240
think could be debated.

1119
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,320
You could also debate if it should or shouldn't

1120
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,520
be a moral decision, but I think it's not

1121
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,480
a moral decision for everybody.

1122
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,000
And the compromises that the install fest

1123
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,460
is making on the user's behalf would

1124
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,560
be the compromises that make Linux work on the machine

1125
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:42,920
that they're installing it.

1126
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,480
The difference between Wi-Fi or no Wi-Fi.

1127
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,520
You come to an install fest because you

1128
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,440
want to leave with a working Linux system.

1129
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,400
Otherwise, you just do it at home.

1130
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,800
So he goes on to write.

1131
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,800
Oh, and then obviously, I should point out

1132
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,320
the deal with the devil.

1133
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,120
We're invoking religious language here, the devil.

1134
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,280
Also, just as a point here, it makes

1135
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,400
it sound like this is a deal that's signed forever,

1136
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,800
but you can install truly free software later.

1137
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,760
That's the whole problem here is you can start with Ubuntu,

1138
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,880
and we all distro hop.

1139
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,480
Sometimes that includes distributions

1140
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,320
from the Free Software Foundation.

1141
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,200
Yeah, that's true.

1142
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,920
You could learn, get inspired, and move on.

1143
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,840
Absolutely.

1144
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,080
In fact, I think that's the way it generally happens.

1145
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,800
So Richard Stallman has a proposal.

1146
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,680
He says, I propose the install fest show users exactly what

1147
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,120
deal they're making.

1148
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:38,680
Let them talk to the devil individually.

1149
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,920
My new idea is that the install fest

1150
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,560
could allow the devil to hang around off

1151
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:47,360
at a corner of the hall or the next room.

1152
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,160
Then he writes in brackets, actually,

1153
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,000
a human being wearing a sign saying, the devil, maybe

1154
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,120
some horns.

1155
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,080
Like, have some fun with it, he's suggesting.

1156
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,680
Have some fun with this one.

1157
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,720
The devil would offer to install non-free drivers

1158
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,680
in the user's machine to make more parts of the computer

1159
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,960
function.

1160
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,600
Take that in for a second.

1161
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:12,640
The devil would install non-free drivers in the user's machine

1162
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:16,680
to make more parts of the computer function.

1163
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,840
It's almost an admission right there in itself,

1164
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,320
but it's the devil doing it.

1165
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,120
That's the devil.

1166
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,800
The devil would explain to the user

1167
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:29,040
the cost of this using non-free unjust programs.

1168
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,080
The install fest would tolerate the devil's presence,

1169
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:38,120
but not officially sponsor the devil

1170
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:42,400
or publicize the devil's availability.

1171
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,000
He goes on to say, I should note,

1172
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,840
that Richard Stallman says he does not

1173
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,680
approve of the devil's work here.

1174
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,360
And he wraps it up with, what is to stop the devil

1175
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,000
from offering to install something

1176
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,800
like GNU slash Linux distros, such as Ubuntu,

1177
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,160
which offers the user other attractive non-free programs,

1178
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,960
not solely ones needed for the machine's hardware

1179
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,520
to function at all.

1180
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:10,600
That's a concern he has.

1181
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,800
I mean, does that make Ubuntu worse than the devil?

1182
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:15,040
The devil might install Ubuntu.

1183
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,360
And then here's the reason why that's not good.

1184
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:21,520
Because it installs programs that are not solely

1185
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,160
just necessary for the machine to function, barely function

1186
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,200
at all.

1187
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,240
If you are installing software beyond that

1188
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:33,120
to get the bare necessary functions,

1189
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:37,200
then you're making a deal with the devil.

1190
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,800
That is our problem.

1191
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,640
This is not a religious thing.

1192
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:48,520
These are tools.

1193
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,800
These are tools made by human beings.

1194
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,720
These are not religious objects.

1195
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,880
There are moral questions about their usage and software.

1196
00:45:58,880 --> 00:45:59,840
Absolutely.

1197
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,040
But this, I see over and over again.

1198
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,760
And I'm redacting the names to protect the innocent.

1199
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:11,480
Because to be honest with you, I mean,

1200
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,640
maybe we see this on a twice-monthly basis,

1201
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,640
really, where somebody comes in and they say,

1202
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,200
Chris, I'm so frustrated, or Wes, I'm so frustrated.

1203
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,320
I've been trying to get so-and-so to switch to Linux,

1204
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,620
and they're just not listening.

1205
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:26,120
They won't even try it.

1206
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:26,720
We've seen that.

1207
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,680
Yeah, absolutely.

1208
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,680
And sometimes you listen and you go, yeah, OK,

1209
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,080
boy, that does sound like a good use case.

1210
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,560
Yeah, they just leave my office.

1211
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,560
You put Ubuntu or put Fedora on there, and they're good to go.

1212
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:40,800
And then sometimes it doesn't make any sense.

1213
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:47,840
And I realize now that I was that person.

1214
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,600
I did this.

1215
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,320
So what I'm about to talk about, I want to make clear,

1216
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,360
I was this person.

1217
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,080
I think probably many of us have been.

1218
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,120
Yeah, I got excited, man.

1219
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:56,160
Because Linux is exciting.

1220
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,840
It's a great operating system.

1221
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,720
You can go back into the history of these shows.

1222
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:05,120
And my advocacy and mandating Linux

1223
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,120
be used for every task is laid out

1224
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,280
to bear in front of everybody.

1225
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,640
But I've had to think about it.

1226
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,200
I've got to be honest with you.

1227
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,160
In part, because of issues we've had in the studio,

1228
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,040
if I'm going to be effective in my job,

1229
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,360
I need to self-analyze and realize

1230
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:26,860
where I failed to properly consider the situation.

1231
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,400
And we don't need to go into details

1232
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,680
about the problems we've had.

1233
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,360
If you guys are interested, you can email into the show

1234
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:31,880
and ask us.

1235
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,760
But we've had a range of issues that we're kind of starting

1236
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,040
to get a handle on now.

1237
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,480
But just operational things, right?

1238
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,060
Nothing core to the content of the shows,

1239
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,760
just stuff that are little details

1240
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,600
that we have to do every day to make the stuff happen.

1241
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,520
Yeah, like you discover, oh, this was a design decision

1242
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,280
and also that's now creating this problem.

1243
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,920
Or Pulse isn't talking to this when this application is

1244
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,440
talking directly to the internet.

1245
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:54,680
You discover all these little weird problems

1246
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:58,520
that make it kind of obvious that there's not a lot of people

1247
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,520
doing what we're doing.

1248
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,120
You can make it work, but there's

1249
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:06,220
not a business and ecosystem around this.

1250
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,840
And I want to make it clear.

1251
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,440
I think Linux is maybe one of the most important software

1252
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,080
projects in the world, in the history of humanity,

1253
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:17,820
and probably the most important free software project.

1254
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,040
And as somebody who's run many Linux servers

1255
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,920
and still has them running and is very happy,

1256
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,080
I think it is the best operating system for servers.

1257
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,440
Why do you suppose that is?

1258
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,000
Why is Linux so goddamn good on the server,

1259
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,600
and yet it's sometimes a little hit and miss on the desktop?

1260
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:36,120
Sometimes you get tainted kernels.

1261
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,840
Sometimes you get these issues that crop up.

1262
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,680
Why is it hit and miss where Pulse audio sometimes

1263
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,160
creates a Barry White effect, and to the live stream,

1264
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,520
we sound like three octaves lower than we actually

1265
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,560
are because it's failed to communicate properly

1266
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,280
with the audio hardware, but yet the server side

1267
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,920
can generate billions of dollars in revenue

1268
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,920
and get 99.9999% uptime.

1269
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,600
Why is that, Wes?

1270
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,440
Part of it, I think, has to do a little bit with complexity

1271
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,840
and the assumption of how skilled or knowledgeable you

1272
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:07,160
need to be to operate the system,

1273
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:09,000
now that we've made leaps and bounds there in the server.

1274
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,740
But when you think about how it started taking off,

1275
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:14,560
it was a free, useful tool that you could just install.

1276
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,160
And if you had the know-how to get it installed and up

1277
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,240
and running, you could be very effective at it.

1278
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:22,440
You could replace really expensive other rigs

1279
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,880
that you had to buy with just cheap Intel equipment.

1280
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,920
Right.

1281
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,000
And I would say, too, one of the things that

1282
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,720
makes Android successful, the Linux underpinnings there,

1283
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:38,480
and Linux successful on the server, is a massive ecosystem

1284
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,120
of contributors from companies like Amazon, and Microsoft,

1285
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,560
and Intel, and Qualcomm, and Samsung.

1286
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,360
And the list goes on and on.

1287
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,440
Everybody knows the big list of contributors that are.

1288
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,920
Big list of diverse contributors

1289
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,080
from different fields that are all interested in this core

1290
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:53,920
underpinning.

1291
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:54,420
Right.

1292
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,560
And that translates to them spending money on developer

1293
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:01,880
time to write code to contribute to these areas of the free

1294
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,160
software stack.

1295
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,200
And it's the whole range from things

1296
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,240
that are application server-side things

1297
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,940
all the way down to the kernel that makes

1298
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,280
it work better on ARM devices.

1299
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,880
It's a whole range where there is

1300
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,760
a network of interdependent and competing businesses

1301
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,640
that have economic incentives to contribute code

1302
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:23,280
to this free software code base.

1303
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,760
Those economic incentives do not exist in the audio and video

1304
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,480
production side, where you're trying

1305
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,920
to do real-time audio or video in a fairly complicated setup,

1306
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,080
maybe with multiple interfaces, six, seven, 10 tracks at once.

1307
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:39,760
And you're audio in on one interface,

1308
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,160
audio out on another interface, but they have the same name.

1309
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:47,980
That is not an area where there is an economy of companies,

1310
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,520
some of the largest companies in the world, contributing code.

1311
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,660
Pulse Audio does not have that benefit.

1312
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,540
Neither does Video for Linux.

1313
00:50:56,540 --> 00:50:59,720
They are great projects that have had developers that

1314
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,440
have been committed to them for a very long time.

1315
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,600
Man, am I grateful.

1316
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,800
And they've come a long way.

1317
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,360
I mean, it's a lot better than it used to be.

1318
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,320
And we have things come in, like PipeWire,

1319
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,920
that just look fantastic.

1320
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,520
But again, there is maybe a company or two.

1321
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,520
And they're less mission critical, too.

1322
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,200
So you can put up with that if your employee's desktop,

1323
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:22,120
occasionally the sound doesn't quite work right,

1324
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,100
but it's a bigger deal when your kernel crashes on your server.

1325
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,080
And I don't think any of this is unusual.

1326
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,760
I think it's perfectly fine to expect maybe

1327
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:36,560
that the audio system on Linux isn't quite as solid as it

1328
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,360
is on a top 500 computer running a compute project,

1329
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,480
or the web server and database application stacks that

1330
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,960
are completely rock solid don't quite match up

1331
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,680
to how video capture works on Linux.

1332
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,960
It seems incredibly reasonable when you look at it

1333
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:51,640
in that context.

1334
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,880
I think it's natural, right?

1335
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,800
Because it is a successful free open source project,

1336
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,200
it can be taken in all the directions that people want to.

1337
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,160
You just have to have contributors.

1338
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,240
So the more contributors you have in each direction,

1339
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,440
then it can grow there.

1340
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,040
But I didn't see it.

1341
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,560
See, I didn't see it.

1342
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:12,320
Because I let what was a faith in my advocacy for Linux

1343
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:16,560
blind me to what is a simple economic market reality.

1344
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,560
I think it's confusing, too, because we're

1345
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:21,400
talking about general computers here, right?

1346
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,640
But we're also talking about specific tools or workflow.

1347
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,640
Some of the stuff that we use for a computer, like in audio,

1348
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,040
that could be a piece of equipment on the rack.

1349
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,720
And we don't have the same conversation

1350
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,440
to the same degree about that.

1351
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,060
And I want to try to use Linux for all the things

1352
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,560
because I think it's a great platform

1353
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:37,280
and it's easy for me to be like, I could do audio editing

1354
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,080
on Windows, but I would prefer to figure out

1355
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,280
how to do it on Linux.

1356
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,840
That doesn't mean that Linux is the best at it.

1357
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,320
And if my whole job and only focus was audio production,

1358
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,840
then I probably wouldn't choose Linux

1359
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,480
just because there aren't some of the tools I might need.

1360
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,840
Right, and I didn't give that consideration

1361
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,760
even though this is my business.

1362
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,080
And to be clear, we're not ripping Linux out.

1363
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,440
We're going to try to make this work.

1364
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,200
We think we can get this.

1365
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,560
I just now look back at it, and I

1366
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:09,300
realize that this was a blind spot that I had.

1367
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,200
My advocacy for Linux blinded me to what

1368
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,980
was obvious limitations just given the market

1369
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:17,320
realities of the situation.

1370
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,520
And so I got a note in on Telegram

1371
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,440
in our Jupyter broadcasting group about, Chris,

1372
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,800
I'm super frustrated because I can't get Adam Curry to switch

1373
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,120
to Linux.

1374
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,360
And I looked at the situation, I said, you know, man,

1375
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:30,840
I think what really is going on here

1376
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,560
is there's really zero incentive for someone

1377
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,720
to make a switch for that workflow when you're recording,

1378
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,240
you're live streaming, you're editing.

1379
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,040
Linux is great, but it's not necessarily better

1380
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,760
than Windows at that job.

1381
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,720
And there is a cost to switching because he

1382
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,680
would have to change recording applications and editing

1383
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,680
applications.

1384
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,880
He would have to learn a new desktop

1385
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,040
and a new operating system.

1386
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,880
Like, there's a cost.

1387
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,200
And he just wants to get the show done.

1388
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,480
He just wants to make money.

1389
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,440
That's where it is, right?

1390
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,400
There's always a cost, and there's

1391
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,040
going to be some cost-benefit curve,

1392
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:08,440
and you have to decide, like, where does it make sense

1393
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:09,560
and where is it good enough?

1394
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:13,960
So I get notes from other podcasters

1395
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,440
that have the same thing, and the kind of general response

1396
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,440
is like, man, the Linux community is really nagging me.

1397
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:20,360
Like, they're just really nagging me constantly.

1398
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,320
They say, you guys do it on Linux,

1399
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,000
but it doesn't seem worth it to me.

1400
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,400
And I don't recommend that they switch when they write to me

1401
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,080
because I don't feel like it would be necessarily

1402
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:32,000
a successful transition.

1403
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,520
I think for advocacy to be successful,

1404
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:39,080
we need to advocate in a new way, in a different way,

1405
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,960
something that is less like just blind advocacy where we're

1406
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,960
saying, yeah, Linux can do every job in every situation.

1407
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,120
That's true in most cases.

1408
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,720
You can probably make it work, right?

1409
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,160
And that's right.

1410
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,920
That's the difference between saying, like,

1411
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:54,840
you can do it on Linux, and you should do it on Linux.

1412
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,560
Bingo.

1413
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,320
And if you're trying to recommend something

1414
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,760
to somebody, you're trying to get them to switch,

1415
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,800
you've got to think about the workflow.

1416
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,600
And you've got to think about what your approach is.

1417
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,680
First of all, you can't just go all in crazy,

1418
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,080
like switch everything at once.

1419
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:13,360
But you also have to consider, is Linux

1420
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,920
the right tool for that job?

1421
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,560
Because for them, it's not a moral decision.

1422
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:20,640
It's not something that speaks to who they are

1423
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,000
and how they feel about the future of software

1424
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,880
and computers.

1425
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,680
It's simply a tool like their blender is a tool.

1426
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,200
Yeah, right.

1427
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,440
And I imagine that most people who

1428
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,440
find the philosophy of free software interesting

1429
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,960
did not come to it, did not come to these tools because

1430
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,760
of the philosophy, right?

1431
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,480
They probably learned about the philosophy

1432
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,400
after they started using some of these tools.

1433
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,320
You're only going to do that if you stick around,

1434
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,280
because the tool is effective.

1435
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,040
And I think we should, I kind of feel like we

1436
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,520
should be as a community, we should be OK with the fact

1437
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,880
that it's not great at video games.

1438
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,380
It gets better, but X11 has issues,

1439
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,160
and video card drivers have issues,

1440
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,240
and software availability has issues.

1441
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,680
It's not the best at video production and podcast

1442
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,200
production.

1443
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,800
It's usable, it's doable, but it has issues.

1444
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,280
Like we should acknowledge that, so that way when

1445
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:12,420
you do recommend Linux to somebody,

1446
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,640
it's a successful transition.

1447
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,200
Yeah, be honest about expectations, right?

1448
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:18,200
So that people aren't sad and depressed,

1449
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,440
or think bad about Linux, and just be like,

1450
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,520
here's the things that's great at,

1451
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,200
and here are some things that you might struggle at,

1452
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,960
or if that's what you really need to do,

1453
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,160
maybe this isn't a good fit.

1454
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,640
And I feel like, too, on top of that,

1455
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,160
it's clear there are workloads that Linux is great at.

1456
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:31,760
Absolutely.

1457
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,760
And clear winners.

1458
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,600
And that's where you double down,

1459
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,120
and you just have to be careful in your advocacy.

1460
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,840
You have to take a slow approach,

1461
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:42,280
and demonstrate success, and show your workflow working.

1462
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,200
A slow approach is it, right?

1463
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,000
Because this isn't a one and done deal.

1464
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,280
You can make inroads, right?

1465
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,760
Maybe first you set up a code box,

1466
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,200
and tell people that it's Linux.

1467
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,520
They get a little trust there.

1468
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,480
Then you set up a new machine that is Linux,

1469
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,360
and you say, here you go.

1470
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:57,440
It's great for browsing the web on the couch, have at it.

1471
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,440
You can do this gradually in a way

1472
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,240
where people can learn to trust it, enjoy it.

1473
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,240
And then is the time, once you see

1474
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,000
that this is a great tool with a great ecosystem of tools,

1475
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,920
you can start explaining how a lot of that's

1476
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,240
possible because of free and open source philosophy.

1477
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:11,960
Yeah, exactly.

1478
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,920
All right, let's start going around the horn here

1479
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,440
and see what other people think.

1480
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,440
So let's start with Mr. Bacon, because you've been

1481
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,840
in the community for a long time.

1482
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:21,960
You've seen the different types of pushy advocacy

1483
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,960
versus subtle advocacy.

1484
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:25,920
And I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.

1485
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,640
One thing, and I think this can kind of go across the board,

1486
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:33,840
is that the IRC room, or Telegram, or forums,

1487
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,680
or whatever community that you're a part of,

1488
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,360
if somebody is asking for help, be that guy that actually

1489
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:41,360
reaches out and tries to give some help.

1490
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:44,640
Don't be the guy that RTFMs them,

1491
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,880
or is elitist and says they should

1492
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,520
use this instead of that.

1493
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,840
Try to help guide them to the path.

1494
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,680
But one thing I would say, as far as the advocacy goes,

1495
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,960
is that I think that there's, like you said,

1496
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,120
there's different approaches.

1497
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,080
There's always the tool for the job.

1498
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,920
Linux is rock solid on the server side of things.

1499
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,520
It's getting there on the desktop.

1500
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:11,800
And some of these companies actually put their money

1501
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,480
where their mouth is.

1502
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,560
So you have System76, I'm sure Emma could speak to that.

1503
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:23,560
They're actually integrating Core Boot now.

1504
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:26,360
You have people like Purism as well.

1505
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,240
And they're slowly advocating these things

1506
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:33,920
for us to be able to utilize and give us the tools that we need.

1507
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,360
But they're not pushy about it.

1508
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,760
And I think being overly preachy,

1509
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,560
and I know that I was whenever I first

1510
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,560
started using Linux as well, but being overly preachy

1511
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,080
is really going to do nothing but drive people away

1512
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:48,880
from it.

1513
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:53,880
I'm curious, too, we'll get to the folks in the Mumbroom

1514
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,040
here in a second, but, Elle, one of the things

1515
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,280
I've noticed as you've been documenting your issues

1516
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,320
and talking about them on your Twitter account

1517
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,040
is there are sometimes the typical, like,

1518
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,000
why didn't you just do this, noob?

1519
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,520
And then there's sometimes, like, people take it

1520
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,640
as a mentoring moment.

1521
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,120
And that seems to be the big difference.

1522
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,360
So strangely enough, this is actually the topic

1523
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,960
that I'm discussing in my talk at Linux Fest.

1524
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,440
And the name of my talk is, you know,

1525
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,320
strengthening your community by poisoning the well.

1526
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,120
And that's kind of been the way that I

1527
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,600
feel my entire journey in Linux has been,

1528
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:29,560
is I go out and I do something that I'm so proud of.

1529
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,760
Like, hey, I'm trying out this new OS.

1530
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,960
And I run into one little bug, and I go out

1531
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,720
and I ask for help, and all I get is, well, it's obvious.

1532
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,400
You ran into it because, you know,

1533
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,640
why aren't you using Arch?

1534
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:40,960
Why are you using KDE?

1535
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,200
It's always, why did you do this,

1536
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,600
instead of turning it around and going, OK, you know what?

1537
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,520
I haven't run into this issue.

1538
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,400
I feel that people are almost afraid to admit

1539
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:52,200
what they haven't experienced and what they don't know.

1540
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,080
So when I find those people, you know,

1541
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,720
I call them my Twitter family that turn around and go,

1542
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:58,720
I don't know, but I'll help you troubleshoot.

1543
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,560
Or I do know, I ran into this, you're not alone.

1544
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:03,640
I always jump on those experiences

1545
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,240
because those are the people that I feel

1546
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,600
are going to change the way this community is run.

1547
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:12,240
Yeah, and it is really like one opportunity at a time

1548
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,440
to begin to change that.

1549
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,440
Brent, I'd like to hear your experiences, too,

1550
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,640
because I know you've been ramping up your Linux usage

1551
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,520
for years now.

1552
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,600
Yeah, and before I get into that,

1553
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,000
I have a question for Emma.

1554
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,320
Emma, is this kind of a new experience for you?

1555
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:29,480
I'm assuming you were using Windows previously.

1556
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,120
Did you run into problems there?

1557
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,640
And when you did, how was that process for you?

1558
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:37,280
Switching was actually really easy.

1559
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,640
Like you guys were saying, people

1560
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:43,080
can approach it as a mentor or a bully, really.

1561
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:46,760
And I had all my people at System76

1562
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,480
showing me how to do things constantly,

1563
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,160
never being negative about anything

1564
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,960
or making me feel dumb.

1565
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,520
I always felt empowered after I switched.

1566
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:00,520
And I never missed Windows.

1567
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,520
Not once.

1568
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,760
Amen.

1569
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,400
And Elle, what about your experience?

1570
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,120
So mine is a little bit different.

1571
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,840
I spent a majority of my time off the grid.

1572
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:14,240
So Linux was actually my first OS.

1573
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,320
I did not use Windows before I moved on to Linux.

1574
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,040
Wow.

1575
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,160
That is so awesome.

1576
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,520
It is really cool, yeah.

1577
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,200
And she went hardcore into the whole Red Hat route, too.

1578
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,320
And she could teach us a few things about RHEL.

1579
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:25,960
Let me tell you.

1580
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,760
Oh, I bet.

1581
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,000
So I'm curious now to hear your story, Brent.

1582
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,040
Yeah, well, I, as many of us, kind of

1583
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:35,320
went through lots of different operating systems,

1584
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,200
from Windows doing photo stuff there,

1585
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,240
and then moved to Mac OS doing photo stuff there

1586
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,360
for many years, and then to Linux

1587
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,880
just because I thought it could serve me a little bit better.

1588
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:49,560
But I've been also, for many years,

1589
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,760
helping other users move to Linux as well.

1590
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,240
And I find that the best approach

1591
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,680
is to take a humble one, right?

1592
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,720
Just because I'm convinced that it's the best tool for me,

1593
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,720
I know is not true, because I have these unique properties

1594
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,360
about myself compared to, let's say,

1595
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,160
my family or friends around me.

1596
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,360
I'm super curious.

1597
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:13,280
I've been dabbling with computers my entire life.

1598
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,960
And so I can't assume that the everyday computer

1599
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,320
user is going to have any of those same properties.

1600
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,560
And so what I've noticed is really helpful

1601
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,520
is trying to use empathy to approach it

1602
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,400
from their direction.

1603
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,520
So OK, my mom, for instance, uses her computer for email

1604
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:34,880
and browsing Pinterest and things like that.

1605
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,840
These are not things I do, but OK, in this environment,

1606
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,760
is this going to do what she needs

1607
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:41,760
and just get out of her way, right?

1608
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:45,560
So seeing the computer more as a tool and less like a hobby

1609
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,000
really helped me to move people successfully

1610
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,680
and on a path, a gentle path, that I can really enjoy as well.

1611
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:53,640
That makes sense.

1612
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:56,520
I'd be curious how you see photography

1613
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:59,000
and audio seem like there's some parallels there.

1614
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,760
So I'd be curious, like, Linux certainly,

1615
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,200
I mean, you use Linux for some of your professional things,

1616
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,440
but how do you feel about recommending it

1617
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,640
as the platform for photography?

1618
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,640
Yeah, I think that's a really important question.

1619
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,600
I see the chat room's asking that too.

1620
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:15,520
When I first started on Linux, I found

1621
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:18,200
it was a little bit more in its infancy,

1622
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,960
and that was started full time on Linux

1623
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,600
doing all of my professional stuff,

1624
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,560
so exclusively on Linux, I think, around 2012.

1625
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,240
So it's wild.

1626
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:30,720
But I was watching Linux before then and the tools

1627
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,240
and trying to see, so that's the moment where I decided, OK,

1628
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:36,360
this has everything a user like me who's

1629
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,960
fine with tinkering needs.

1630
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,080
And just last year, I gave a little bit of a talk

1631
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,040
here at a MakersFest.

1632
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,400
And when I gave that talk, the whole intention

1633
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,840
was to show the photo tools on Linux

1634
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:56,040
to try to encourage anyone to get access to them.

1635
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:59,320
And what the tools can do now, because they've

1636
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,360
come a long way, is they break down the barrier of entry

1637
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,160
to photography, so anyone with almost any computer

1638
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,200
can get access to some really professional tools.

1639
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,440
And the really neat thing was that the class

1640
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,880
was filled with people who showed up at the MakersFest,

1641
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,280
so there were retired dads who were just dabbling

1642
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,240
in photography as a pastime.

1643
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:22,040
There were kids who were just trying to check everything out

1644
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:22,720
just to play.

1645
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,480
And so I ended up giving a talk to the most widespread user

1646
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:30,800
base possible, and everybody caught on to it.

1647
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,880
So that, to me, really proved, OK, I'm showing dark table

1648
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:37,760
and I'm showing five super simple aspects of it,

1649
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,320
but it can really reach out to all of these users

1650
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:43,360
if you present it in a way that's gentle

1651
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:46,280
and has the right progression.

1652
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,080
And the kids caught on the fastest, which was great.

1653
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:53,080
So OK, someone who, I think they were like 10 or 11,

1654
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:55,960
so I was like, OK, they can start at almost any age,

1655
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,800
and that's a perfect age to start dabbling in creative arts.

1656
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,160
So photography is great, right?

1657
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:07,800
And but then the people who had way less computer experience

1658
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:11,000
also, after a little while and some pointers and stuff,

1659
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:11,840
started picking up.

1660
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:14,800
So that, to me, was really the proof that, OK, photography

1661
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,680
on Linux is there.

1662
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,180
And this every day, and I never have

1663
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:20,880
to tinker with the photography software anymore.

1664
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:23,360
The things I'm tinkering with are more advanced.

1665
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:25,800
And the photography, when I need to get to it,

1666
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,520
I can just get to it, and it's a production machine for that.

1667
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,920
So I would say anybody in photography, at least,

1668
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,040
it's a great time to move or at least try it.

1669
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,200
Yeah, and it's more and more categories over time.

1670
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,200
Linux is a better and better tool for that.

1671
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,160
And I think, Brent, that was an amazing breakdown

1672
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,760
of the things you need to do to evaluate, right?

1673
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,120
You can't just assume it's going to work.

1674
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,640
You need to be practical about it.

1675
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,400
And the other thing is it demonstrates

1676
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,480
what I think is maybe I would love

1677
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:53,640
to be a key takeaway from this conversation

1678
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:56,760
is show a successful workflow.

1679
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,880
Demonstrate being successful at a task.

1680
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:03,880
And that can be the biggest sales pitch in itself,

1681
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,720
right there.

1682
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,960
I think you really got to get this right.

1683
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,360
It's our responsibility, as experienced Linux users,

1684
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,280
to sell this tool in a way where it can succeed.

1685
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,680
I think, Wes, you were talking about it earlier in our chat.

1686
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,000
I just copied your quote here.

1687
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,820
This is great.

1688
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:20,840
You said, it's about being honest about tooling.

1689
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,760
And if you want the Linux experience to be good,

1690
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,960
you need to recommend it in situations where it can succeed.

1691
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:28,880
Yeah, I mean, it's not fair to people

1692
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,080
we recommend this to, to have to experiment and fight.

1693
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:32,320
And if they want that, OK.

1694
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,640
Or you can support them while they do that.

1695
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,600
That's great.

1696
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,280
But that's not for everyone.

1697
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,720
So try to find situations where it's going to be a great fit.

1698
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,120
There are many, because Linux is great at many things.

1699
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,120
Then you can earn some trust, and people open up after that.

1700
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:46,760
Yeah.

1701
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,480
Do you know what?

1702
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,920
I think we got another soapbox in here.

1703
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,800
Get that out of here.

1704
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,160
Let's just get that out of here.

1705
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,560
All right, I know the mumble room has more to say.

1706
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,260
Maybe we'll carry it over to the post-show.

1707
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:57,200
But I want to make that to be right there.

1708
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:59,200
I think that's the key message to drive home right there.

1709
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:01,360
We can continue the conversation in the post-show.

1710
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:03,840
But I think that's the takeaways, is as experienced

1711
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:05,960
Linux users, we need to be good stewards.

1712
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,440
We need to get this right.

1713
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,640
I think Elle says it perfectly.

1714
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,800
Sometimes you just have to be willing to admit to everyone

1715
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:16,360
that Linux sucks sometimes, and it's OK.

1716
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,720
Perfect.

1717
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,800
There you go.

1718
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,280
I love it.

1719
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,920
Most important free software project in the world, I say.

1720
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:24,440
At least in my opinion.

1721
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,360
But make sure that when you recommend it,

1722
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,480
it's going to succeed.

1723
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:28,680
That's what you've got to do.

1724
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,160
For the sake of everyone.

1725
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,080
That's right.

1726
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,080
All right, go get more Wes Payne over at TechSnap.

1727
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,600
We talked about that earlier, TechSnap.Systems.

1728
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,760
He's also at Wes Payne.

1729
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:40,600
I'm at Chris Elias, the network at Jupiter Signal.

1730
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:43,080
Man, we've got so much, really so many things to say now.

1731
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,680
I guess we need a longer outro.

1732
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:45,160
Yeah, we do.

1733
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,560
But I'll just leave you with this.

1734
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,640
Join us a little early next week for that Ansible study group.

1735
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:51,360
I think that's going to be really valuable.

1736
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:53,360
So I think we'll just make that the final word.

1737
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,480
Oh, and of course, also, see you right back here next Tuesday.

1738
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:56,980
Ah!

1739
01:07:56,980 --> 01:08:25,800
Oh!

1740
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:35,720
Hey, Unplugged Program, alright, Mr. Payne, we gotta get everybody to go over JB Titles.

1741
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:36,720
Go vote!

1742
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:40,200
Now, exercise those voting rights we've given you.

1743
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,560
So while everybody's voting on the titles, I know, I always plug at JBtitles.com, but

1744
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,360
we gotta get a good title.

1745
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:51,840
I wanna see what you guys think about NextDoc2, which promises to turn your smartphone into

1746
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:52,840
a laptop.

1747
01:08:52,840 --> 01:08:56,960
It's a nice aluminum laptop filled with battery, so it charges your phone too.

1748
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,800
Big trackpad, nice keyboard, HD screen, and it works with a few of those Android devices

1749
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:05,800
where you can plug it in and it extends to the device or like a Raspberry Pi.

1750
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,360
NextDoc doesn't only work with smartphones.

1751
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:14,160
With the full size HDMI in port, the new NextDoc still supports many PCs and Raspberry Pis,

1752
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:17,800
creating fully functional computers at a revolutionarily low cost.

1753
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:22,840
Thanks to the new USB Type-C port, we can also develop better integrated PC sticks so

1754
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:27,560
that you can use NextDoc with the processor and operating system of your choice.

1755
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:32,640
Imagine an enduring, sustainable computer that you can simply upgrade and customize

1756
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,540
as the years go by.

1757
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:39,100
By separating processor and operating system from the physical interface, we hope to start

1758
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:43,400
a paradigm shift in consumer electronics, where computers can be adapted rather than

1759
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,920
becoming obsolete, generating less electronic waste for the environment.

1760
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:51,640
So you can upgrade your smartphone and you still get the same screen, same battery, same

1761
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:52,640
keyboard.

1762
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,840
I think the 90s are calling us back.

1763
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,040
It does feel like history is repeating itself a little bit.

1764
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:02,120
Well, it's got 754 backers with 24 days left to go.

1765
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:07,280
You know what also interests me about that is that back in the early days of the Raspberry

1766
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:14,280
Pi Gen 1, a lot of people were using Motorola's old Laptop to do the same exact thing.

1767
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,640
It is actually kind of nice with a Raspberry Pi.

1768
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,600
It is actually kind of nice.

1769
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:20,840
I actually would like one of these for a Raspberry Pi.

1770
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:21,840
I don't know what the final price would be.

1771
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,520
What's the difference than attaching a nice keyboard and thing to your iPad?

1772
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,400
I guess the flexibility here, because you can pick what you interface with.

1773
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,400
Yeah, yeah.

1774
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:33,960
And I guess the whole, like, it has USB-C and it works with the smartphones and supports

1775
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,960
that too.

1776
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:35,960
That is kind of nice.

1777
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:37,280
I wish convergence ever becomes a thing.
