WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.400
Wes, you never have to worry about again.

00:02.400 --> 00:05.540
They have thrown machine learning at recipes.

00:05.540 --> 00:06.460
At least I think.

00:06.460 --> 00:07.460
What did you find here?

00:07.460 --> 00:09.260
Well, you already trust machine learning

00:09.260 --> 00:10.780
to drive you around, right, Chris?

00:10.780 --> 00:12.940
So why not let it cook for you

00:12.940 --> 00:16.020
with some generated recipes using TensorFlow

00:16.020 --> 00:18.820
and a recurrent neural network?

00:18.820 --> 00:21.180
How does cream soda with onion sound?

00:21.180 --> 00:23.700
Mm, about as good as the orange club tea sandwich

00:23.700 --> 00:24.900
with cookies.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.020
Yeah, these are pretty wild.

00:26.020 --> 00:29.500
It's a TensorFlow model applied to a whole bunch of recipes

00:29.500 --> 00:32.060
and then why not see what it comes up with?

00:32.060 --> 00:34.380
Now they do warn here in the README,

00:34.380 --> 00:35.940
it's all open source of course,

00:35.940 --> 00:38.540
that these recipes are for research purposes

00:38.540 --> 00:41.260
and not for actual cooking.

00:41.260 --> 00:43.220
Maybe you'd make this one, I don't know, Wes.

00:43.220 --> 00:44.580
Let's cook this up before the show

00:44.580 --> 00:46.780
and see if we like it mushrooms with lentil,

00:46.780 --> 00:49.940
stewed with shallots and tomatoes.

00:49.940 --> 00:51.020
It sounds really good.

00:51.020 --> 00:53.940
It has a lot of garlic, so what could go wrong?

00:53.940 --> 01:08.420
Hello friends and welcome to your weekly Linux talk show

01:08.420 --> 01:10.620
that has yet to be replaced by machine learning.

01:10.620 --> 01:11.620
My name is Chris.

01:11.620 --> 01:14.940
My name is Wes and I have high hopes for the machines.

01:14.940 --> 01:17.020
They have a lot of sample data to review

01:17.020 --> 01:21.580
because this is episode 359

01:21.580 --> 01:24.140
and this week we have so much to get into,

01:24.140 --> 01:27.420
including the death of Mac OS 10

01:27.420 --> 01:30.700
and how this will affect the Linux desktop.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.140
But before we get there,

01:32.140 --> 01:34.140
I wanna say time appropriate greetings

01:34.140 --> 01:37.660
to our powerful assembly of Mumble Room.

01:37.660 --> 01:40.700
Lug members of power?

01:40.700 --> 01:42.180
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

01:42.180 --> 01:43.020
Hello.

01:43.020 --> 01:44.580
Hello, good evening.

01:44.580 --> 01:45.940
I need to work on that, you know?

01:45.940 --> 01:47.620
I need to work on that name.

01:47.620 --> 01:50.180
It's just, it was like a beta, you know, it's just a beta,

01:50.180 --> 01:52.700
but we have a good crew in there.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.700
Lots of people in the quiet listening as well.

01:54.700 --> 01:56.380
We have 23 members there today,

01:56.380 --> 01:59.260
some familiar faces and some new ones as well.

01:59.260 --> 02:01.220
So thank you everybody for joining us.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.140
Well, let's get into the unplugged program

02:03.140 --> 02:06.220
because yeah, we have a lot to discuss.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.060
First of all, some big community news,

02:08.060 --> 02:12.580
some like things are changing kind of community news

02:12.580 --> 02:15.100
for the Linux hardware future landscape.

02:15.100 --> 02:18.780
And then we'll talk about how Apple switching to ARM

02:18.780 --> 02:20.500
will impact Linux.

02:20.500 --> 02:21.700
We don't do this too often,

02:21.700 --> 02:23.620
but I think in today's world,

02:23.620 --> 02:25.860
you have to acknowledge the entire marketplace

02:25.860 --> 02:29.980
and ecosystem and how that will also affect us Linux users.

02:29.980 --> 02:31.860
And we'll also talk a little bit more

02:31.860 --> 02:34.340
about the longer term picture there.

02:34.340 --> 02:37.300
Plus we have some pics, maybe some feedback and all that.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.740
More so Wes, what do you say?

02:38.740 --> 02:40.700
You wanna just start right in with the community news?

02:40.700 --> 02:42.180
Yes, please.

02:42.180 --> 02:43.100
See, I wanted you to argue.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.820
I thought for sure you'd argue with me a little bit.

02:44.820 --> 02:47.660
Now, you know, I love community news.

02:47.660 --> 02:49.020
It's true, you do.

02:49.020 --> 02:52.020
It's all kind of on topic this week

02:52.020 --> 02:55.260
because it just seems to be the way the industry is trending.

02:55.260 --> 02:59.020
There is an ARM-based Japanese supercomputer

02:59.020 --> 03:01.500
that is now the world's,

03:01.500 --> 03:03.260
is it the fastest or one of the fastest?

03:03.260 --> 03:04.660
The part that I cared about, of course,

03:04.660 --> 03:06.220
is that it runs Linux,

03:06.220 --> 03:08.260
but it is a Japanese supercomputer that's taken,

03:08.260 --> 03:09.340
it has taken the top spot

03:09.340 --> 03:12.580
in the biannual top 500 supercomputer speed ranking.

03:12.580 --> 03:15.660
Yeah, and it's the first time a computer based on ARM

03:15.660 --> 03:17.020
has done so.

03:17.020 --> 03:21.180
It's Fujitsu's 48-core A64FX system on a chip

03:21.180 --> 03:23.020
that's powering the whole thing

03:23.020 --> 03:26.380
and it's co-developed by Ryken and Fujitsu.

03:26.380 --> 03:30.700
The computer placed in the top 500 high-performance results

03:30.700 --> 03:35.340
with performance numbers like 415.5 petaflops.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.380
That's 2.8 times as fast as IBM's Summit,

03:38.380 --> 03:40.020
which is number two.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.900
That 48-core chip, huh?

03:41.900 --> 03:42.980
Wow.

03:42.980 --> 03:45.580
So right now it's number crunching for COVID-19,

03:45.580 --> 03:46.700
which is pretty cool.

03:46.700 --> 03:49.780
Also, Fujitsu's 48-core ARM chip here,

03:49.780 --> 03:51.900
this is one of those things we don't talk a lot about,

03:51.900 --> 03:54.100
but Fujitsu is kind of a wild duck out there.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.100
They're doing their own thing,

03:55.100 --> 03:57.020
they're making these super cool systems,

03:57.020 --> 03:59.580
but because they don't really fit

03:59.580 --> 04:01.120
into the realm of everyday life,

04:01.120 --> 04:02.540
they don't get talked a lot about.

04:02.540 --> 04:03.540
But this is a nice reminder

04:03.540 --> 04:05.120
that there's some killer Linux systems out there

04:05.120 --> 04:06.240
from Fujitsu.

04:06.240 --> 04:08.400
Yeah, super powerful.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.540
Back in the day, I had access

04:09.540 --> 04:11.620
to this neat flatbed printer they make,

04:11.620 --> 04:13.820
so clearly they're in the hardware game

04:13.820 --> 04:17.180
at serious levels in all kinds of spaces.

04:17.180 --> 04:18.220
It's also kind of interesting here

04:18.220 --> 04:20.580
where normally it's just been the Americans

04:20.580 --> 04:21.780
and the Chinese sort of competing

04:21.780 --> 04:24.260
for fastest supercomputer out there.

04:24.260 --> 04:26.140
This is the first time that Japan's made the list

04:26.140 --> 04:27.580
in the past nine years,

04:27.580 --> 04:30.940
but obviously they came to play and with an ARM system.

04:30.940 --> 04:33.340
I think we'll continue to talk about today

04:33.340 --> 04:35.820
how that's a big sign of things to come.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.040
Yeah, it does seem very fitting.

04:37.040 --> 04:40.660
Debian also has some big news in the ARM department.

04:40.660 --> 04:42.340
Ampere has partnered with Debian

04:42.340 --> 04:44.860
to support their hardware infrastructure

04:44.860 --> 04:47.940
and has donated three of their high performance

04:47.940 --> 04:50.580
ARM64 boxes.

04:50.580 --> 04:54.380
These Lenovo ThinkSystem HR330A servers

04:54.380 --> 04:56.860
contain Ampere's eMag CPU

04:56.860 --> 04:59.380
with an ARM V8 64-bit processor

04:59.380 --> 05:02.580
specifically designed for cloud servers.

05:02.580 --> 05:05.980
They've got a sweet 256 gigs of RAM,

05:05.980 --> 05:08.500
dual 960 gig SSDs,

05:08.500 --> 05:11.660
and a 25 gig dual port NIC on there.

05:11.660 --> 05:14.580
So these are no slouch.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.300
The donated servers have been deployed

05:16.300 --> 05:18.300
over at the University of British Columbia,

05:18.300 --> 05:20.660
just up north from the studio here.

05:20.660 --> 05:22.580
And the Debian system administrators group

05:22.580 --> 05:25.420
has already configured them to run ARM64,

05:25.420 --> 05:28.620
ARM hard float, and ARM EL build daemons.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.140
And all of that stuff is good news

05:30.140 --> 05:32.600
because they're replacing previous build servers

05:32.600 --> 05:35.720
that were running on basically development grade boards.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.140
And Ampere's goal here really

05:37.140 --> 05:39.580
is just to get better software developed

05:39.580 --> 05:42.380
for their cloud built, they say,

05:42.380 --> 05:45.100
the future of cloud and edge computing

05:45.100 --> 05:47.100
for these very specific systems they have

05:47.100 --> 05:48.340
where they're trying to build features

05:48.340 --> 05:50.900
in at the processor level for this type of work.

05:50.900 --> 05:52.100
They need the software support there.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.940
They need the open source software support there.

05:53.940 --> 05:56.720
And they seem to be big fans of the Debian project

05:56.720 --> 05:58.340
reading through their release announcement.

05:58.340 --> 05:59.540
So it's kind of a win-win.

05:59.540 --> 06:02.740
I mean, come on, who's not a big fan of Debian?

06:02.740 --> 06:03.820
The Dev1 folks?

06:04.980 --> 06:07.380
Yeah, I suppose so, but you're right.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.560
I mean, you know, the more these are out there,

06:09.560 --> 06:11.140
the easier it is to build on these platforms.

06:11.140 --> 06:12.620
And that is maybe one of the things

06:12.620 --> 06:14.180
that can be difficult about the ARM world

06:14.180 --> 06:15.700
is you gotta build for the platform

06:15.700 --> 06:18.220
you're actually gonna try to run on.

06:18.220 --> 06:19.380
Well, that's better for everyone,

06:19.380 --> 06:22.340
especially considering the huge number of packages

06:22.340 --> 06:23.500
in the Debian repos.

06:24.540 --> 06:26.460
Yeah, I've been really enjoying the Pinebook Pro

06:26.460 --> 06:28.580
over the two weeks now that I've been using it.

06:28.580 --> 06:31.240
I do feel like there's been a handful of packages

06:31.240 --> 06:32.380
I wish I could have gotten installed

06:32.380 --> 06:36.260
that are just not yet built for the ARM chipset.

06:36.260 --> 06:38.140
And I think it's not really,

06:38.140 --> 06:40.040
you know, I'm trying to think it's mostly

06:40.040 --> 06:41.920
like commercial applications

06:41.920 --> 06:44.460
that maybe even if the desktop client is open source,

06:44.460 --> 06:46.660
it's connecting to their proprietary service.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.180
I think that's probably the ones

06:49.180 --> 06:50.300
that haven't worked the most.

06:50.300 --> 06:53.180
And it's been frustrating, so I'd love to see this grow.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.540
But watching all this ARM news

06:55.540 --> 06:57.580
and reading it from an ARM laptop

06:57.580 --> 06:59.340
has been a bit of a mind job for me

06:59.340 --> 07:01.900
because the Pinebook Pro is already there, right?

07:01.900 --> 07:06.900
The ROK Pro 64, it's already a competitive mobile ARM

07:06.900 --> 07:10.660
platform and we have the PinePhone in studio

07:10.660 --> 07:13.100
and it was much better built than we expected

07:13.100 --> 07:14.140
right out of the box.

07:14.140 --> 07:15.160
That's for sure.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.740
So in a big way for open source and free software,

07:17.740 --> 07:22.740
it feels like ARM is now just an implementation detail

07:23.140 --> 07:26.060
that hasn't just really gotten wide enough adoption yet

07:26.060 --> 07:28.180
for all of the software edge cases to be worked out.

07:28.180 --> 07:30.020
But it just seems inevitable at this point.

07:30.020 --> 07:32.860
Yeah, I mean, these are cloud enabled servers,

07:32.860 --> 07:34.820
AWS, Amazon, they've been working hard

07:34.820 --> 07:36.180
on their Graviton chips too.

07:36.180 --> 07:38.860
So there's gonna be some really nice,

07:38.860 --> 07:40.900
in terms of performance and cost,

07:40.900 --> 07:44.060
instances available over there before long.

07:44.060 --> 07:47.060
And unless you've got x86 workloads

07:47.060 --> 07:49.500
that you really need because of some optimization

07:49.500 --> 07:52.140
or some vendor library that you don't have control over,

07:52.140 --> 07:53.420
if it's all just open source stuff

07:53.420 --> 07:55.140
that you can rebuild, recompile,

07:55.140 --> 07:58.220
or already just runs on top of Python or the JVM,

07:59.100 --> 08:00.620
why not run on ARM?

08:00.620 --> 08:03.020
And I think too about the Raspberry Pi.

08:03.020 --> 08:06.820
So the Raspberry Pi 4, eight gigs of RAM,

08:06.820 --> 08:08.380
pretty good processor now.

08:09.220 --> 08:10.980
Imagine what that thing's gonna be like

08:10.980 --> 08:14.940
when it's the Raspberry Pi 7, Raspberry Pi 8,

08:14.940 --> 08:16.580
maybe even the Raspberry Pi 10.

08:17.520 --> 08:20.420
It's gonna be a very capable little board.

08:20.420 --> 08:23.740
It's gonna probably put what we would consider

08:23.740 --> 08:27.020
a standard desktop system to shame today.

08:27.020 --> 08:30.780
And that's just a trend that just seems to continue.

08:30.780 --> 08:34.180
So it's coming, Wes, and the Pine Book

08:34.180 --> 08:35.500
has really made me kind of appreciate it

08:35.500 --> 08:37.520
because the battery life is fantastic.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.860
And I've been on this trip, I'm still on my trip.

08:39.860 --> 08:41.860
I'm actually in Texas.

08:41.860 --> 08:46.020
In fact, not only am I in Austin, Texas right now,

08:46.020 --> 08:48.560
but I am christening my cousin's studio

08:48.560 --> 08:52.040
that he had built down here at his office in Austin

08:52.040 --> 08:53.940
with the very first broadcast right here

08:53.940 --> 08:55.980
on Linux Unplugged in his new studio space.

08:55.980 --> 08:56.980
We're still dialing it all in,

08:56.980 --> 08:58.860
doesn't have all the furniture in here yet,

08:58.860 --> 09:00.740
doesn't even have all the final sound treatment

09:00.740 --> 09:03.620
installed yet, but it is pretty, pretty cool.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.540
Here, I'm gonna lean back so you can enjoy the space.

09:05.540 --> 09:06.380
Are you ready, Wes?

09:06.380 --> 09:07.200
I'm gonna-

09:07.200 --> 09:08.040
Oh, please.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.300
It's pretty, pretty great.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.740
You see, it drops off.

09:11.740 --> 09:13.920
You hear, I mean, it drops off pretty good, doesn't it?

09:13.920 --> 09:14.760
I mean, really-

09:14.760 --> 09:17.460
It's got some good bones in that studio.

09:17.460 --> 09:21.020
So pretty cool to do the first broadcast right here.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.900
So we're battle testing it for him.

09:22.900 --> 09:26.640
And I might give him a few pointers afterwards.

09:26.640 --> 09:29.140
My first tip was put a rug down.

09:29.140 --> 09:30.260
You gotta put a rug down.

09:30.260 --> 09:32.300
So he went this morning to Lowe's and got a rug.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.820
I mean, you just want as much stuff

09:34.820 --> 09:37.180
to absorb that sound as you can, right?

09:37.180 --> 09:38.440
Yep, so pretty great.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.680
So I'll probably be down here for the rest of the week.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.100
And I'll probably start the long trek

09:43.100 --> 09:46.780
back to the Pacific Northwest, maybe via Montana first.

09:46.780 --> 09:48.060
I just like how wherever you go,

09:48.060 --> 09:50.220
you just end up setting up studios, you know?

09:50.220 --> 09:51.420
So wherever you stop, you're like,

09:51.420 --> 09:53.260
hey, can I just, I'll just rent an extra room

09:53.260 --> 09:54.720
and I've got all this foam paneling.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.860
If you guys could put that up for me.

09:56.860 --> 09:57.700
I mean, that's, you know,

09:57.700 --> 09:59.280
I fill all the RV up with foam, right?

09:59.280 --> 10:01.100
Just for these very purposes right here.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.660
It's like a ball pit, but you're just floating on foam.

10:03.660 --> 10:05.500
So I'm looking at my route back, you know?

10:05.500 --> 10:06.820
I'm looking at that and I'm thinking,

10:06.820 --> 10:09.740
I'm gonna avoid New Mexico as much as possible

10:09.740 --> 10:13.140
because I think I lost five years of life on my RV.

10:13.140 --> 10:15.140
And in fact, I even have a slight oil leak

10:15.140 --> 10:17.020
from my fill pan from my drain.

10:17.020 --> 10:18.060
Just my drain plugs leaking.

10:18.060 --> 10:21.180
But I think it's because the New Mexico roads were so bad

10:21.180 --> 10:23.740
that it just shook Lady Joups down to her core.

10:23.740 --> 10:25.340
So I gotta do like a little bit of maintenance

10:25.340 --> 10:26.980
on her before we head home.

10:26.980 --> 10:29.740
And I think I'll probably go up through Colorado

10:29.740 --> 10:32.840
and Wyoming, through Montana,

10:32.840 --> 10:35.260
and then through Idaho, back to Washington.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.960
So take a nice long trek, you know?

10:38.960 --> 10:40.680
Just work from the road.

10:40.680 --> 10:43.360
I got the kids with me, got the wife, got the dog.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.780
Got the Mi-Fi, so yeah,

10:44.780 --> 10:47.820
why not enjoy the experience of the West?

10:47.820 --> 10:51.500
Got multiple Mi-Fis, Wes, multiple.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.780
Yeah, that's true, you're a pro here.

10:53.780 --> 10:56.260
And so not only have I been rocking the Pine Book Pro

10:56.260 --> 10:58.620
as sort of my, I just want one thing

10:58.620 --> 11:00.100
that I just plug in and keep charged

11:00.100 --> 11:02.780
and don't have to worry about it while I'm on the go.

11:02.780 --> 11:04.220
Pine Book Pro has been great for that.

11:04.220 --> 11:09.220
But I gotta say, so much respect for the Raspberry Pi 4.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.660
People talk about, oh, it runs a little hot.

11:13.660 --> 11:15.840
You know, that was a big discussion for the Raspberry Pi 4.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.060
You better get a heat sink for it.

11:17.060 --> 11:20.020
And people are getting heat sinks with active fans

11:20.020 --> 11:22.740
and just going all out to try to keep the temperature down.

11:22.740 --> 11:27.300
Last night, the booth that I run the Raspberry Pis in

11:27.300 --> 11:28.820
along with my Wi-Fi and my Switch,

11:28.820 --> 11:31.340
and I don't do this, don't do what Chris does.

11:31.340 --> 11:33.100
And where I have my hard drives

11:33.100 --> 11:35.540
that are all formatted in ButterFS,

11:35.540 --> 11:38.780
that space got to 99 degrees last night.

11:38.780 --> 11:40.820
Oh! Yeah.

11:40.820 --> 11:42.300
Now that's Fahrenheit, right?

11:42.300 --> 11:43.660
Yeah, otherwise they'd be melting.

11:43.660 --> 11:45.100
They just kept going, you know?

11:45.100 --> 11:48.500
Like I'm streaming Plex to the TV, the Wi-Fi's,

11:48.500 --> 11:49.580
everything's just working.

11:49.580 --> 11:51.380
If they just, they get hot

11:51.380 --> 11:52.740
and I don't have them under intense load,

11:52.740 --> 11:53.940
if I really had them crunchy,

11:53.940 --> 11:56.180
then they'd probably start having issues.

11:56.180 --> 11:58.420
And I vent them when I get home

11:58.420 --> 11:59.780
and I realize how hot it is.

11:59.780 --> 12:02.380
I like the idea of you, because it's in a seat in your RV,

12:02.380 --> 12:04.420
like the idea that you have to prioritize,

12:04.420 --> 12:06.340
well, am I gonna sit down and relax?

12:06.340 --> 12:08.780
Or am I gonna vent my computers?

12:08.780 --> 12:10.700
No, sorry, son, you can't sit there.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.260
The Pi's are venting.

12:12.260 --> 12:13.660
That actually happened, yep.

12:13.660 --> 12:17.180
I gotta, hey, I gotta vent the computers.

12:17.180 --> 12:20.660
Oh, but I wanna get to it before they all fry,

12:20.660 --> 12:22.140
because what I'm really worried about going

12:22.140 --> 12:24.380
isn't now the Raspberry Pi so much.

12:24.380 --> 12:26.900
I'm worried about the little power bricks

12:26.900 --> 12:29.580
for like the switch or the Wi-Fi access point.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.580
I'm worried about that melting or popping.

12:32.580 --> 12:34.500
So that's my concern at this point,

12:34.500 --> 12:36.220
because the Raspberry Pi will thermal throttle.

12:36.220 --> 12:38.660
It'll even, it'll shut itself down.

12:38.660 --> 12:40.180
So that isn't the big concern.

12:40.180 --> 12:42.380
That's the nice part about this solid state life.

12:42.380 --> 12:44.220
There's not a whole lot of moving parts.

12:44.220 --> 12:47.020
So it's gonna fail, it'll get there eventually.

12:47.020 --> 12:49.420
And actually, the way I realized it's kinda great,

12:49.420 --> 12:50.420
I mean, it's not a huge thing,

12:50.420 --> 12:52.140
but I Velcroed everything in there,

12:52.140 --> 12:56.020
and that, or I should say that loop and hook,

12:56.020 --> 12:57.580
it's not Velcro, it's loop and hook.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.900
No, come on, that's a brand name.

12:59.900 --> 13:03.700
But that creates an airspace under the hard drives

13:03.700 --> 13:04.780
and under the Raspberry Pi,

13:04.780 --> 13:06.920
so there's a little bit more room for air to move

13:06.920 --> 13:09.580
when I do ventilate, so that helps.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.560
But I'm, yeah, I'm pretty impressed

13:11.560 --> 13:13.100
with how well it's all worked.

13:13.100 --> 13:17.860
LadyJuice is so integrated now with the Linux systems

13:17.860 --> 13:20.140
and the automations that it's pretty critical.

13:20.140 --> 13:22.300
So that's, if anything happens,

13:22.300 --> 13:25.240
it makes things very, very, very inconvenient.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.780
But it's all awesome so far.

13:26.780 --> 13:30.120
You drop back like 50 years if that little booth goes down.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.340
Yes, yeah, really.

13:31.340 --> 13:33.220
The one thing I will note for folks,

13:33.220 --> 13:34.140
because I do hear from people

13:34.140 --> 13:36.100
that are building these into their campers

13:36.100 --> 13:37.940
for the summer and stuff like that.

13:37.940 --> 13:40.700
All of these systems expect your home

13:40.700 --> 13:42.580
to remain in one place.

13:42.580 --> 13:46.540
So anything that uses location for your automations

13:46.540 --> 13:51.100
or security stuff, or like for me, like my cameras.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.400
The way I have my home assistant system work

13:53.400 --> 13:56.780
is when I leave an area, the cameras come on.

13:56.780 --> 14:00.300
If no one's been home for a while, lights start to turn off.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.660
The heaters go to standby mode.

14:02.660 --> 14:06.380
Like things sort of shut down over time when no one's home.

14:06.380 --> 14:09.680
And then when people arrive, these things reverse themselves.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.780
Or when the sun sets or the sun rises,

14:11.780 --> 14:14.980
other things automatically trigger in the RV

14:14.980 --> 14:16.340
to maintain things.

14:16.340 --> 14:19.860
And the first couple of days, I didn't really notice

14:19.860 --> 14:22.380
because I was pretty close to home on the road.

14:22.380 --> 14:25.300
But by the time I got to Utah,

14:25.300 --> 14:27.320
I noticed that something wasn't quite right

14:27.320 --> 14:28.820
with the lights and everything.

14:28.820 --> 14:32.460
And then like things just didn't seem like

14:32.460 --> 14:33.820
they were working quite right

14:33.820 --> 14:36.700
or something wasn't in the state I expected it to be in.

14:36.700 --> 14:39.380
And it took me a solid maybe three or four days

14:39.380 --> 14:41.780
into the trip before I realized, oh yeah,

14:41.780 --> 14:43.660
every couple of days now, I got to go in there

14:43.660 --> 14:45.420
into home assistant into the other systems

14:45.420 --> 14:47.460
and update the location information

14:47.460 --> 14:49.420
because they just expect your house to never move.

14:49.420 --> 14:51.620
Oh yeah, I mean, I don't move around as much as you,

14:51.620 --> 14:53.420
but I move around more than I'd like.

14:53.420 --> 14:55.640
And I've noticed that too, just you change a little bit

14:55.640 --> 14:57.220
and all your systems have already learned like,

14:57.220 --> 14:58.660
oh, these are the nearby cell towers.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.100
Here's where you are approximately.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.140
You don't tell them any of that.

15:01.140 --> 15:03.500
And I don't know how to necessarily tell Google

15:03.500 --> 15:06.180
that I've moved and that my directions shouldn't go

15:06.180 --> 15:07.420
to the old place.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.580
Yeah, it's very tricky on Google home

15:09.580 --> 15:14.140
and it's not even worth it on the ecosystems.

15:14.140 --> 15:16.180
They just are such a pain in the butt.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.060
It's not even worth updating them.

15:18.060 --> 15:20.660
And so you just basically get weather and information

15:20.660 --> 15:21.980
from your home location.

15:21.980 --> 15:24.460
The plus side of that is no one knows where you are.

15:24.460 --> 15:27.180
Yeah, that is true.

15:27.180 --> 15:28.960
That is kind of great actually.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.180
But speaking of Google,

15:30.180 --> 15:32.820
there is more features coming to Chrome

15:32.820 --> 15:36.180
because we've been talking about how Chrome needs more stuff

15:36.180 --> 15:38.900
and more specifically, it's getting a feature

15:38.900 --> 15:43.900
that iPhone users and Mac users seem to enjoy, AirDrop.

15:44.120 --> 15:46.000
And they're calling it Nearby Share

15:46.000 --> 15:49.460
and it will expand Android devices, Windows, Linux, Mac OS

15:49.460 --> 15:53.100
and Chrome OS all thanks to its Chrome integration.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.260
Yeah, in other words,

15:54.260 --> 15:56.060
Nearby Share will be part

15:56.060 --> 15:58.940
of the Google Chrome browser feature lineup.

15:58.940 --> 16:01.820
One more feature for this browser that just keeps growing.

16:02.660 --> 16:05.260
Taking care of the whole sharing thing regardless

16:05.260 --> 16:07.680
of the platform and hey, that is kind of nice, right?

16:07.680 --> 16:10.940
Chrome runs basically everywhere these days.

16:10.940 --> 16:12.780
According to a recent discovery

16:12.780 --> 16:15.460
shared by Dinson Francis of Chrome Story,

16:15.460 --> 16:17.620
the feature has actually already been implemented

16:17.620 --> 16:19.320
in the Canary version of Google Chrome.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.260
So if you're running that,

16:20.260 --> 16:23.260
maybe you've seen it show up in a system near you.

16:23.260 --> 16:24.160
That means it's currently

16:24.160 --> 16:26.820
in a rather advanced testing phase

16:26.820 --> 16:30.620
and probably we'll all get to play with it before too long.

16:30.620 --> 16:32.500
I mean, this is so late.

16:32.500 --> 16:35.540
I don't understand like what a handy feature to have

16:35.540 --> 16:38.380
just observing folks in the iOS ecosystem.

16:38.380 --> 16:41.220
I mean, this is a pretty basic technology, right?

16:41.220 --> 16:45.460
I didn't realize how popular AirDrop was

16:45.460 --> 16:48.340
until I started visiting offices again

16:48.340 --> 16:51.520
and people would just use AirDrop for just,

16:51.520 --> 16:54.860
hey, I updated the presentation before you go live,

16:54.860 --> 16:58.020
here's the presentation for one group I'm thinking of

16:58.020 --> 16:59.660
or here we're at the meeting,

16:59.660 --> 17:01.380
would anybody else like a copy of this doc?

17:01.380 --> 17:02.860
And they just AirDrop it to everybody.

17:02.860 --> 17:04.640
And to me, that always seemed like,

17:04.640 --> 17:06.300
well, that's what file shares are for

17:06.300 --> 17:09.300
or God forbid, even an email attachment.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.020
But much like many other things in the corporate world

17:12.020 --> 17:13.700
changed since the last time I was in it,

17:13.700 --> 17:16.300
AirDrop seems to have been fairly adopted.

17:16.300 --> 17:21.300
And I note that Microsoft integrated a very similar feature

17:22.500 --> 17:26.140
with the same name, Nearby Share, that's awkward,

17:26.140 --> 17:28.620
into Windows 10 build 1803.

17:28.620 --> 17:31.340
Now, technically, Chris, that's Nearby Sharing

17:31.340 --> 17:34.060
on the Microsoft side, totally different.

17:34.060 --> 17:35.560
Right, my bad.

17:36.980 --> 17:41.260
And I wonder if Google's is gonna be like Chromecast

17:41.260 --> 17:43.540
where there's some cloud involved

17:43.540 --> 17:46.820
sometimes in the actual transmission of the data

17:46.820 --> 17:51.380
or sometimes it's just for session negotiation

17:51.380 --> 17:52.780
or will it be over the land?

17:52.780 --> 17:57.580
Because that seems to be the primary advantage of AirDrop

17:57.580 --> 18:00.780
and the equivalence that we've tested on the Linux desktop

18:00.780 --> 18:02.460
is it's land to land.

18:02.460 --> 18:03.540
Yeah, right, there's totally times

18:03.540 --> 18:05.340
where you just don't have access to the cloud

18:05.340 --> 18:08.140
for whatever reason, even if you wish that you did,

18:08.140 --> 18:10.780
then these features can just keep working without a hitch.

18:10.780 --> 18:12.060
That's a lot of value.

18:12.060 --> 18:14.220
When I'm driving and there's areas

18:14.220 --> 18:17.340
where maybe there's a tiny bit of cell signal

18:17.340 --> 18:22.340
or there's no signal, so, so much of modern technology

18:22.660 --> 18:26.260
is just worthless, just worthless.

18:26.260 --> 18:29.620
And I just don't want any more of that.

18:29.620 --> 18:32.860
There's no reason that a cloud server needs to be involved

18:32.860 --> 18:34.700
for me to discover something on my land

18:34.700 --> 18:37.300
and send something to an IP address on my land.

18:37.300 --> 18:40.380
Right, I was just thinking of, I had a time on a plane

18:40.380 --> 18:43.640
where I had an ebook downloaded on my laptop,

18:43.640 --> 18:45.700
but I needed it on my phone.

18:45.700 --> 18:50.260
But I hadn't paid for the internet, of course, on the plane.

18:50.260 --> 18:51.860
Because it's ridiculous.

18:51.860 --> 18:55.200
Yeah, and it just, despite all of the weird hacks

18:55.200 --> 18:56.700
that I tried, I just couldn't get it to go.

18:56.700 --> 18:59.000
And if I'd had this feature that worked offline,

18:59.000 --> 19:00.100
it would have taken me two seconds

19:00.100 --> 19:01.180
and I would have enjoyed my ebook.

19:01.180 --> 19:05.660
Was that before you tried HTTP over DNS?

19:05.660 --> 19:08.540
Yeah, I think so, in my more naive days.

19:11.580 --> 19:14.660
All right, well, let's do a little housekeeping here

19:14.660 --> 19:17.220
in the pod, because we have a few things to talk about.

19:17.220 --> 19:20.580
Number one, the Luplug takeover is happening.

19:20.580 --> 19:24.500
They now have an autonomous zone in our mumble every Sunday.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.460
They also have established an autonomous zone

19:26.460 --> 19:30.980
on the IRC server, irc.geekshed.net pound Luplug.

19:30.980 --> 19:33.620
Now, the LuG itself takes place every Sunday

19:33.620 --> 19:34.820
at noon Pacific.

19:34.820 --> 19:37.220
That's the same time we do this here podcast,

19:37.220 --> 19:38.560
but it's just on Sunday.

19:38.560 --> 19:42.060
It's also, somehow, they have leveraged

19:42.060 --> 19:44.900
their new negotiating position to campaign Angela

19:44.900 --> 19:46.060
and they have gotten it

19:46.060 --> 19:49.060
on the actual live production calendar.

19:49.060 --> 19:51.520
A true victory for the Luplug.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.620
So join us every Sunday where we hang out, talk Linux,

19:54.620 --> 19:55.820
come up with ideas for the show,

19:55.820 --> 19:57.920
and if I don't make it, they plot takeovers

19:57.920 --> 19:59.940
of the entire network, so that's fun too.

19:59.940 --> 20:01.660
All of that is in our mumble room,

20:01.660 --> 20:05.100
the same exact software and server we use for this show.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.660
So you get it set up once, you come hang out on a Sunday,

20:07.660 --> 20:09.260
and then if you ever have the opportunity

20:09.260 --> 20:11.620
to join us on a Tuesday, you can.

20:11.620 --> 20:13.700
That's when we record this show, Tuesday live,

20:13.700 --> 20:18.260
noon Pacific over at jblive.tv, also on the calendar.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.420
How about that?

20:19.420 --> 20:21.580
Huh, look at us.

20:21.580 --> 20:22.800
It's really all Angela.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.940
So thanks to Angela for doing that.

20:24.940 --> 20:26.820
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

20:26.820 --> 20:29.100
to get that converted to your local time.

20:29.100 --> 20:29.940
We'd love to see you.

20:29.940 --> 20:32.340
If you're hanging out, I just jump in from time to time

20:32.340 --> 20:33.900
and make it for maybe an hour,

20:33.900 --> 20:35.100
maybe make it for a couple hours,

20:35.100 --> 20:36.980
maybe I make it 45 minutes.

20:36.980 --> 20:38.580
It goes while the conversation's going.

20:38.580 --> 20:40.700
That's how long, and you can just sort of dip in.

20:40.700 --> 20:43.740
It's like a beautiful, crystal clear Linux stream

20:43.740 --> 20:45.300
of fresh conversation.

20:45.300 --> 20:46.260
That's what I love about it,

20:46.260 --> 20:48.760
is it's just a place that you know is gonna be there.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.700
Sometimes you can make it, sometimes you can't.

20:50.700 --> 20:52.460
So you never know quite who's going to be there,

20:52.460 --> 20:54.160
which is partially exciting.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.060
But regardless, you know there's gonna be a community

20:56.060 --> 20:58.960
of folks interested in talking about Linux and open source.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.780
Ready, if you are, on Sunday.

21:00.780 --> 21:02.820
Couple other bits of admin for this show.

21:02.820 --> 21:05.220
You hear us mention the show notes quite a bit.

21:05.220 --> 21:08.060
Linuxunplugged.com slash 359 will be links

21:08.060 --> 21:09.700
to stuff we talk about today.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.720
That's also where you'll find the contact page link.

21:11.720 --> 21:13.100
If you'd like to send us an email

21:13.100 --> 21:15.600
or recommend something we check out on the show,

21:15.600 --> 21:17.220
you can find that there as well.

21:17.220 --> 21:18.620
Linuxunplugged.com.

21:18.620 --> 21:19.460
And with that,

21:21.780 --> 21:24.980
we enter a zone that is truly going to be frustrating

21:24.980 --> 21:26.080
for some of you.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.120
I warn you, you may be triggered

21:28.120 --> 21:29.900
by what happens next on the show.

21:32.420 --> 21:36.360
This week was WWDC.

21:36.360 --> 21:39.380
And I don't think we've ever covered one of them ever

21:39.380 --> 21:41.580
on this show before, very intentionally.

21:41.580 --> 21:43.660
But this year is a little different

21:43.660 --> 21:47.500
because it is the death of Mac OS 10,

21:47.500 --> 21:50.380
and it is the transition of the Apple platform

21:50.380 --> 21:54.740
back to an extremely esoteric custom-built system

21:54.740 --> 21:58.100
that will undoubtedly be very, very locked down.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.380
This is a big moment

21:59.380 --> 22:02.320
because it's Apple's custom system on a chip.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.060
It's not an x86 processor

22:04.060 --> 22:08.560
that's capable of running x86 OSs out of the box right now.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.820
It's something brand new.

22:09.820 --> 22:12.280
Apple is officially moving to its own silicon chips

22:12.280 --> 22:13.420
for Mac hardware.

22:13.420 --> 22:15.640
Calling it a historic day for the Mac,

22:15.640 --> 22:18.260
Apple CEO Tim Cook detailed the transition

22:18.260 --> 22:20.440
from PowerPC to Mac OS,

22:20.440 --> 22:23.140
the move to Intel chips before unveiling their plans

22:23.140 --> 22:25.700
to use Apple's own ARM-powered silicon chips

22:25.700 --> 22:27.860
in the Macs in the near future.

22:27.860 --> 22:31.640
The Mac has had three major transitions in its history.

22:31.640 --> 22:35.900
The move to PowerPC, the transition to Mac OS 10,

22:35.900 --> 22:38.060
and the move to Intel.

22:38.060 --> 22:41.980
And now it's time for a huge leap forward for the Mac.

22:42.900 --> 22:45.260
Because today is the day we're announcing

22:45.260 --> 22:46.900
that the Mac is transitioning

22:51.740 --> 22:54.180
to our own Apple silicon.

22:54.180 --> 22:55.340
Wow.

22:55.340 --> 22:56.940
Oh boy.

22:56.940 --> 23:00.940
Now, we don't have all of the details yet,

23:00.940 --> 23:03.460
but what we have so far is a Mac mini

23:03.460 --> 23:06.680
with an iPad processor in it, 512 gigabytes of storage,

23:06.680 --> 23:08.900
some RAM in there, and it's a development kit.

23:08.900 --> 23:10.820
16 gigs of RAM.

23:10.820 --> 23:14.380
And I think this will truly be the end

23:14.380 --> 23:19.240
of any opportunity to ever run Linux on a Mac hardware.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.080
I really do.

23:20.080 --> 23:21.380
I think this is just the end of it natively.

23:21.380 --> 23:23.520
You'll be able to virtualize it, we'll get to that.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.860
But I think it truly is the end.

23:24.860 --> 23:27.100
Now, this is an awkward position for Apple

23:27.100 --> 23:30.100
because Linux can't be ignored anymore.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.940
In their previous transitions,

23:31.940 --> 23:33.060
they didn't have to address it.

23:33.060 --> 23:34.740
When they announced x86 Max,

23:34.740 --> 23:36.520
it wasn't the elephant in the room.

23:36.520 --> 23:39.980
But now it is legitimately part of the real world.

23:39.980 --> 23:42.300
It is part of people's development workflow.

23:42.300 --> 23:44.580
And it even got a mention in their keynote.

23:44.580 --> 23:45.740
Now, as Craig mentioned,

23:45.740 --> 23:48.300
many of our users rely on apps from other environments.

23:48.300 --> 23:51.700
So let me bring up a Linux VM and parallel its desktop.

23:51.700 --> 23:53.160
You can see the graphical user interface

23:53.160 --> 23:54.800
designed for Linux here.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.100
But of course, many developers like to use Linux

23:57.100 --> 23:58.420
for hosting servers.

23:58.420 --> 24:00.380
So let me dive down to the command line

24:00.380 --> 24:02.660
and launch an Apache web server.

24:02.660 --> 24:05.100
And now, I can simply bring up Safari

24:05.100 --> 24:06.580
and browse the website of the server

24:06.580 --> 24:08.380
I just launched in the Linux VM.

24:08.380 --> 24:10.980
Pretty weird to see Linux demoed on the stage.

24:10.980 --> 24:12.280
Well, it's not really a stage,

24:12.280 --> 24:14.140
but on screen at WWDC.

24:14.140 --> 24:16.300
Yeah, right, they're giant developer event

24:16.300 --> 24:19.020
that normally includes mostly just Xcode

24:19.020 --> 24:20.740
and some flashy Mac features.

24:20.740 --> 24:24.000
Yeah, it's remarkable if any other company gets a mention,

24:24.000 --> 24:27.900
let alone a GNOME Shell Debian 10 demo.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.500
That's pretty wild.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.160
So what is the open source story on the Mac?

24:31.160 --> 24:32.620
Because I think one of the first reactions

24:32.620 --> 24:33.460
that people have is,

24:33.460 --> 24:36.740
well, Linux already runs great on ARM processors.

24:36.740 --> 24:38.340
But something that people have to remember

24:38.340 --> 24:41.580
is these are not standard ARM CPUs.

24:41.580 --> 24:44.380
These are custom Apple silicon.

24:44.380 --> 24:46.300
ARM isn't a CPU.

24:46.300 --> 24:50.260
There's not like it's an Intel x86 processor,

24:50.260 --> 24:52.700
where you could buy something that's x86 compatible

24:52.700 --> 24:55.020
that could be from AMD or Intel.

24:55.020 --> 24:57.660
There isn't one ARM CPU.

24:57.660 --> 25:00.340
And so it's a series of technologies

25:00.340 --> 25:01.760
and there's so much more to it,

25:01.760 --> 25:06.220
including graphics, storage controllers, networking,

25:06.220 --> 25:07.580
all of that has to be supported

25:07.580 --> 25:09.060
by the host operating system.

25:09.060 --> 25:13.340
And I think it's pretty clear that Apple's vision for this

25:13.340 --> 25:17.460
is we'll port the open source applications themselves

25:17.460 --> 25:19.460
and the rest is up to virtualization.

25:19.460 --> 25:21.020
We're also passionate about making sure

25:21.020 --> 25:23.460
that open source projects thrive on the Mac,

25:23.460 --> 25:24.540
especially if they benefit

25:24.540 --> 25:26.380
the larger software developer community

25:26.380 --> 25:27.900
and can help accelerating the port

25:27.900 --> 25:29.940
of other software packages.

25:29.940 --> 25:31.660
So we've already done the initial work

25:31.660 --> 25:33.820
for some of the more widely used open source projects

25:33.820 --> 25:36.180
to help the community get started.

25:36.180 --> 25:38.980
And we'll be publishing patches to them in the next days.

25:38.980 --> 25:40.940
They've ported things like Qt,

25:40.940 --> 25:44.260
they've ported things like Mono, FFmpeg,

25:44.260 --> 25:48.540
and others to their ARM processors.

25:48.540 --> 25:50.300
Homebrew, that's a big one that stands out,

25:50.300 --> 25:51.780
and Blender even.

25:51.780 --> 25:55.860
Yeah, but for the actual Linux OS itself,

25:55.860 --> 26:00.660
for that they've updated their hypervisor in Mac OS

26:00.660 --> 26:04.700
and they expect that's how people will run Linux on Macs.

26:04.700 --> 26:07.020
One area that we have worked on removing kernel extension

26:07.020 --> 26:10.140
usage is for virtualization products.

26:10.140 --> 26:13.020
The Mac is the world's best developer platform.

26:13.020 --> 26:15.500
Many developer workflows require using tools

26:15.500 --> 26:19.100
from different platforms or performing server deployments.

26:19.100 --> 26:21.740
To meet these needs, many of you spin up virtual machines

26:21.740 --> 26:23.460
running different operating systems

26:23.460 --> 26:25.860
or lightweight containers like Docker.

26:25.860 --> 26:27.740
And we know that this is critical to your work

26:27.740 --> 26:30.220
and important we support these needs.

26:30.220 --> 26:32.460
That's why we've been working hard with our partners

26:32.460 --> 26:35.300
to support virtual machines on Macs with Apple Silicon.

26:35.300 --> 26:36.340
As you saw in the keynote,

26:36.340 --> 26:38.140
we started working with Parallels,

26:38.140 --> 26:40.140
and I want to walk you through an early port

26:40.140 --> 26:42.100
of Parallels Desktop for Mac,

26:42.100 --> 26:43.580
running on the Apple hypervisor

26:43.580 --> 26:45.580
that's been updated for Apple Silicon.

26:46.540 --> 26:49.140
This is running on a prototype Mac with Apple Silicon

26:49.140 --> 26:51.580
that supports virtualization.

26:51.580 --> 26:54.740
Here we have a fully featured ARM version of Debian Linux

26:54.740 --> 26:56.140
running on Parallels Desktop.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.100
Remember, this doesn't require any third party

26:59.100 --> 27:01.620
kernel extensions to be installed now.

27:01.620 --> 27:05.060
I've installed Swift for Linux and started a new version

27:05.060 --> 27:08.020
and started a new project with Vapor,

27:08.020 --> 27:10.540
a Swift web framework you may be familiar with.

27:10.540 --> 27:11.860
So we should be clear here, right?

27:11.860 --> 27:14.100
That this is Debian on ARM?

27:14.100 --> 27:14.940
Yes.

27:14.940 --> 27:17.180
You can run efficient ARM VMs

27:17.180 --> 27:20.140
on top of their ARM-based silicon.

27:20.140 --> 27:20.980
Exactly.

27:20.980 --> 27:24.820
This is Apple supporting Linux VMs that are ARM-based.

27:24.820 --> 27:29.580
They have, I believe, taken Beehive from FreeBSD

27:29.580 --> 27:32.300
and ported it to Mac OS and customized it

27:32.300 --> 27:34.460
to run enhanced on their silicon.

27:34.460 --> 27:36.980
It's now all in an SDK you can access.

27:36.980 --> 27:39.260
So instead of having to make your own custom

27:39.260 --> 27:40.820
kernel module basically,

27:40.820 --> 27:43.860
there's just now regular Apple calls to the OS

27:43.860 --> 27:46.460
that you can say like, hey, I want a new ARM VM.

27:46.460 --> 27:49.100
Here's the disk image I want you to use and go at it.

27:49.100 --> 27:52.300
Yeah, I mean, it's not unsimilar to how we do it on Linux.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.140
It isn't a complete solution.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.300
See where Microsoft, they closed the gap

27:56.300 --> 27:58.060
and made a solution around Linux.

27:58.060 --> 28:01.420
Apple is essentially offloading this work to Beehive

28:01.420 --> 28:04.620
and Parallels, a commercial company to build the front end.

28:04.620 --> 28:08.380
And then they're deprecating the ability

28:08.380 --> 28:12.620
to actually run native operating systems on their hardware

28:12.620 --> 28:13.460
and saying, well, look,

28:13.460 --> 28:15.740
we've ported a bunch of the open source software

28:15.740 --> 28:17.500
and we've got this fancy hypervisor

28:17.500 --> 28:19.340
that we've stolen from BSD.

28:19.340 --> 28:21.220
So what's your problem?

28:21.220 --> 28:23.300
I think when you zoom out and look at this,

28:23.300 --> 28:27.700
it means the world has one less Unix-like operating system

28:27.700 --> 28:28.900
for the desktop.

28:28.900 --> 28:33.900
And it makes Linux the most prominent Unix-like desktop

28:34.060 --> 28:36.340
that is now available for general computers.

28:36.340 --> 28:37.660
So if I take your point here,

28:37.660 --> 28:41.780
it's that Mac OS is, for a while we pretended,

28:41.780 --> 28:43.140
or I mean, and it was, right?

28:43.140 --> 28:46.340
The Hackintosh world maybe demonstrates this best.

28:46.340 --> 28:48.220
It was a sort of general purpose operating system.

28:48.220 --> 28:52.060
Sure, 95% of it ran on Apple hardware,

28:52.060 --> 28:54.100
but it was an operating system that could

28:54.100 --> 28:56.380
and would support other things.

28:56.380 --> 29:01.380
But in theory, the more iOS-like future Mac OS 11, I guess,

29:02.140 --> 29:03.980
that's gonna be even more targeted

29:03.980 --> 29:08.100
at custom Apple hardware and isn't intended anymore

29:08.100 --> 29:11.660
if it ever really was for more general purpose things.

29:11.660 --> 29:12.620
I don't think it's possible.

29:12.620 --> 29:15.140
I think the controller,

29:15.140 --> 29:16.980
which you've already seen at the T1 and the T2

29:16.980 --> 29:19.620
that are in the MacBooks with touch bars and later,

29:19.620 --> 29:21.740
it's never been supported by Linux.

29:21.740 --> 29:23.900
And now they're going to integrate the secure enclave

29:23.900 --> 29:25.780
and encryption and all of that into the system.

29:25.780 --> 29:27.740
That'll never be supported by Linux.

29:27.740 --> 29:28.940
They'll never do that.

29:28.940 --> 29:30.660
I think that's an interesting aspect here.

29:30.660 --> 29:31.980
You touched a little bit on, well, yeah,

29:31.980 --> 29:36.460
I mean, Linux already supports ARM architectures and stuff,

29:36.460 --> 29:38.140
but I think the biggest thing here

29:38.140 --> 29:40.860
is they no longer have that Intel chip at the core

29:40.860 --> 29:43.700
that limits sort of how they're gonna customize their board

29:43.700 --> 29:47.100
and configure all the other chips running on the system.

29:47.100 --> 29:50.620
Now that entire domain is basically in their hands.

29:50.620 --> 29:52.100
And so, yeah, it's not new.

29:52.100 --> 29:53.820
We already had the whole, the T2 chip,

29:53.820 --> 29:56.300
lots of custom hardware and controllers

29:56.300 --> 29:57.820
that just Linux didn't support

29:57.820 --> 29:59.460
because it was all custom done

29:59.460 --> 30:01.660
between the hardware and the software on Apple side.

30:01.660 --> 30:04.780
This is just one bigger step down that road.

30:04.780 --> 30:06.180
Yeah, very much.

30:06.180 --> 30:08.780
And Drew, I know that you worked,

30:08.780 --> 30:11.260
I think as an Apple genius or a certified Apple tech

30:11.260 --> 30:13.860
for a while, ages ago,

30:13.860 --> 30:15.820
back when you could put Linux on MacBooks.

30:15.820 --> 30:17.700
I'm curious to know your perspective on this.

30:17.700 --> 30:22.300
Yeah, I was ACSP and ACT certified for a while

30:22.300 --> 30:24.140
working in the MSP world.

30:24.140 --> 30:27.780
And one thing that I do want to be flat out about

30:27.780 --> 30:30.540
is even though they make the promise

30:30.540 --> 30:31.740
that they're going to be porting

30:31.740 --> 30:34.820
some open source projects over,

30:34.820 --> 30:39.420
I would be hesitant to really put any faith or trust in that

30:39.420 --> 30:43.380
because they are so wary of the GPL v3

30:43.380 --> 30:45.420
that they went so far as to roll

30:45.420 --> 30:47.340
their own Samba implementation

30:47.340 --> 30:49.580
rather than go up to Samba 3.

30:49.580 --> 30:54.580
I would not expect for them to really bring out a ton here.

30:55.380 --> 30:59.820
It's only going to be things using GPL v2, LGPL,

30:59.820 --> 31:03.660
things that they consider to be friendly licenses to them.

31:03.660 --> 31:07.260
And while that will cover a large portion

31:07.260 --> 31:09.060
of open source products,

31:09.060 --> 31:12.020
we're not looking at a case of Apple

31:12.020 --> 31:16.300
is suddenly going to be a huge boon to open source on ARM.

31:16.300 --> 31:19.700
I just don't think that's going to be the future for us.

31:19.700 --> 31:23.700
Yeah, I could see it causing an industry reaction

31:23.700 --> 31:26.260
where more players move towards ARM

31:26.260 --> 31:29.100
and that has the net effect of improving

31:29.100 --> 31:30.460
open source free software

31:30.460 --> 31:32.940
and Linux's support for that platform.

31:32.940 --> 31:35.460
I could see it having that sort of knock on domino effect

31:35.460 --> 31:36.780
at the bigger picture level.

31:36.780 --> 31:38.580
I don't think any direct hardware drivers

31:38.580 --> 31:40.220
are going to be contributed by Apple.

31:40.220 --> 31:41.540
For a brief moment,

31:41.540 --> 31:43.420
when they started talking about Linux up on stage,

31:43.420 --> 31:45.340
I thought, what if they did it?

31:45.340 --> 31:48.460
What if they just took a sucker punch to Microsoft

31:48.460 --> 31:51.860
and they went all in on a bootcamp style Linux support?

31:51.860 --> 31:53.740
That'd be pretty great.

31:53.740 --> 31:56.580
But Apple users aren't going to care.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.180
I think it was a very common use case

31:58.180 --> 31:59.500
that if they were going to be using Linux,

31:59.500 --> 32:02.140
they'd be using it in a VM or in a terminal,

32:02.140 --> 32:03.660
SSHed into a server.

32:03.660 --> 32:06.140
They weren't putting Linux on their MacBooks.

32:06.140 --> 32:07.660
This is just something that I've always thought

32:07.660 --> 32:09.780
would be great to see Apple support.

32:09.780 --> 32:12.700
And now it's just, that hope is gone.

32:12.700 --> 32:13.820
For the most end users,

32:13.820 --> 32:16.180
I think running it in a well-supported VM

32:16.180 --> 32:19.420
is actually going to be a pretty good solution for them.

32:19.420 --> 32:22.060
Unfortunately, I think when you look at the state

32:22.060 --> 32:24.060
of software distribution and development

32:24.060 --> 32:25.460
in the open source world,

32:25.460 --> 32:26.580
this is going to fit right in

32:26.580 --> 32:28.140
with where most people are at.

32:28.140 --> 32:31.620
And then something to keep in mind,

32:31.620 --> 32:33.260
there's the Docker angle here.

32:33.260 --> 32:36.260
And that also got a mention in Apple's keynote

32:36.260 --> 32:37.980
and in the State of the Union,

32:37.980 --> 32:40.300
where some of these clips are coming from.

32:40.300 --> 32:42.820
And it seems they're planning to work with Docker

32:42.820 --> 32:46.340
to bring some kind of support natively to macOS.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.740
These environments can interact

32:47.740 --> 32:50.500
due to features built into macOS Big Sur.

32:50.500 --> 32:52.380
And thanks to the hypervisor framework

32:52.380 --> 32:55.260
with complete support for networking, storage,

32:55.260 --> 32:56.900
input devices, and much more.

32:57.940 --> 33:00.540
Virtualization technology is used by container solutions

33:00.540 --> 33:01.700
such as Docker.

33:01.700 --> 33:04.380
And we know it's incredibly important for many of you

33:04.380 --> 33:06.860
as it's a very common for server-side development

33:06.860 --> 33:08.340
and testing.

33:08.340 --> 33:10.380
So we'll be working with Docker to enable this

33:10.380 --> 33:11.780
in the coming months.

33:11.780 --> 33:15.420
To Docker somehow via some probably virtualization tool

33:15.420 --> 33:16.660
like it's done on Windows.

33:16.660 --> 33:18.740
Right, well, I mean, that's how it works now, right?

33:18.740 --> 33:21.620
Docker just spins up a Linux VM in the background

33:21.620 --> 33:24.340
and then the user space sort of connects everything through

33:24.340 --> 33:25.780
with proxies and forwarding.

33:25.780 --> 33:26.780
On macOS already?

33:26.780 --> 33:28.340
Yeah, yeah, that's how they do it now

33:28.340 --> 33:30.180
because they didn't go the Windows route

33:30.180 --> 33:33.580
of having this before fancy API compatibility

33:33.580 --> 33:35.740
and now just even more built-in things.

33:35.740 --> 33:39.780
So instead of OS X or OS 11 now doing,

33:39.780 --> 33:41.420
Windows does that at the OS layer for you

33:41.420 --> 33:43.100
with WSL and on the Mac side,

33:43.100 --> 33:45.500
that's what the fancy Docker desktop app is for.

33:45.500 --> 33:49.660
Yeah, and we're not gonna see something like WSL on Macs.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.820
That's just, it's not gonna happen.

33:51.820 --> 33:55.940
They are too scared of dipping their toes in the water

33:55.940 --> 33:58.500
of something that is a license that requires you

33:58.500 --> 33:59.540
to contribute back.

33:59.540 --> 34:01.900
That's never been their thing.

34:01.900 --> 34:03.900
For lack of a better word, they're takers,

34:03.900 --> 34:06.220
they're not contributors to open source.

34:06.220 --> 34:09.180
And we're not going to see something like them

34:09.180 --> 34:11.420
bringing the Linux kernel into Mac

34:11.420 --> 34:13.060
and having it run things natively.

34:13.060 --> 34:14.860
It's just never going to happen

34:14.860 --> 34:17.940
unless there's a huge cultural shift at Cupertino.

34:17.940 --> 34:19.020
You know, that's really interesting.

34:19.020 --> 34:20.740
You were talking about the taker side

34:20.740 --> 34:23.580
and I think they kind of hit on it there.

34:23.580 --> 34:25.300
They were talking about how they've already made

34:25.300 --> 34:26.620
some patches that are gonna be contributing

34:26.620 --> 34:28.700
to a wide range of open source software.

34:28.700 --> 34:31.020
But right at the end, they mentioned,

34:31.020 --> 34:33.660
the whole goal of that is it's just like a recognition

34:33.660 --> 34:35.660
that these software libraries are at the base

34:35.660 --> 34:38.500
of so much proprietary software and open source

34:38.500 --> 34:40.860
or mixed licensed software,

34:40.860 --> 34:43.340
that their goal was to get end user software going.

34:43.340 --> 34:45.900
And so they just had to touch these base systems.

34:45.900 --> 34:48.340
And it's an interesting model of take when you want,

34:48.340 --> 34:50.300
contribute when you need to.

34:50.300 --> 34:51.660
It's very Apple.

34:51.660 --> 34:53.300
And you think about their focus.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.380
Their focus really at the end of the day

34:54.380 --> 34:57.860
is all about iOS services,

34:57.860 --> 35:00.180
building that iOS ecosystem platform.

35:00.180 --> 35:02.100
That's really what drives them.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.980
And so you can kind of look at the lens

35:03.980 --> 35:05.820
of these decisions through that.

35:05.820 --> 35:08.980
This is bringing the Mac platform closer together.

35:08.980 --> 35:10.580
It means that the Mac is once again,

35:10.580 --> 35:12.620
kind of its own unique branch of technology

35:12.620 --> 35:14.540
like it was back when it was power PC

35:14.540 --> 35:17.140
or even Motorola based.

35:17.140 --> 35:18.660
I think, now I could be wrong,

35:19.660 --> 35:21.980
but I think this is tremendously wonderful for Linux

35:21.980 --> 35:23.140
on the desktop.

35:23.140 --> 35:26.220
And it's also to FreeBSD's loss.

35:26.220 --> 35:27.500
If you think about it,

35:27.500 --> 35:32.500
imagine just for like a crazy branch of reality moment,

35:32.500 --> 35:36.620
let's picture that, right, FreeBSD was GPO.

35:36.620 --> 35:40.460
And then let's picture that Apple decided to adopt

35:40.460 --> 35:42.740
some of the BSD user lens stuff

35:42.740 --> 35:45.140
and bring it in with their mock kernel into Mac OS.

35:45.140 --> 35:47.540
And that every single improvement they made

35:47.540 --> 35:50.940
to any of those tools or any of that user space stuff

35:50.940 --> 35:55.820
over time had to be contributed 100% back up to FreeBSD.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.020
Where would FreeBSD be today?

35:58.020 --> 35:59.580
And I know Apple hates the GPO

35:59.580 --> 36:01.220
and they don't wanna use that blah, blah, blah.

36:01.220 --> 36:03.180
Even though they do have some GPO projects actually.

36:03.180 --> 36:05.180
But I know that for their desktop

36:05.180 --> 36:06.260
and for their consumer systems,

36:06.260 --> 36:07.820
that's not what they're into.

36:07.820 --> 36:09.060
But imagine that moment.

36:09.060 --> 36:11.060
This could be FreeBSD's moment

36:11.060 --> 36:14.140
for those who want to remain on the x86 platform.

36:14.140 --> 36:15.820
This could be FreeBSD's moment,

36:15.820 --> 36:18.020
but instead it will be Linux and Windows.

36:18.020 --> 36:21.540
And I think for those who want a Unix like system,

36:21.540 --> 36:26.540
now you have Lenovo, Dell and System76,

36:26.780 --> 36:28.700
Intraware and others that are at the top

36:28.700 --> 36:30.540
of their games right now.

36:30.540 --> 36:33.100
Making Linux hardware, top Linux hardware,

36:33.100 --> 36:34.900
the best Linux hardware we've ever seen.

36:34.900 --> 36:38.180
And it's a perfectly functional developer system

36:38.180 --> 36:40.860
that you can install and just continue to upgrade.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.620
And you don't have all these shenanigans

36:42.620 --> 36:44.460
where once a year they're gonna pull the rug out

36:44.460 --> 36:46.780
from underneath you with either a new UI

36:46.780 --> 36:49.700
or a new platform or a new way of distributing apps

36:49.700 --> 36:50.980
or a new app store system

36:50.980 --> 36:52.860
or a new in-app payment restriction.

36:52.860 --> 36:54.460
That kind of stuff just doesn't happen.

36:54.460 --> 36:57.380
And it's just goofy nonsense

36:57.380 --> 36:59.460
that people that are creating server-side and web software

36:59.460 --> 37:01.140
just don't even need to deal with.

37:01.140 --> 37:03.580
Now, people who are writing iOS apps and Mac apps,

37:03.580 --> 37:04.540
they'll have to deal with it,

37:04.540 --> 37:07.820
but I think Apple will limit the total developer appeal

37:07.820 --> 37:09.540
by moving away from x86.

37:09.540 --> 37:12.380
Right, I mean, they have done a lot to show how games

37:12.380 --> 37:14.660
and other sort of graphical utilities will run,

37:14.660 --> 37:16.700
but you've just got to wonder how many times

37:16.700 --> 37:18.220
is there some weird C library

37:18.220 --> 37:21.180
that you have to get all the right build dependencies

37:21.180 --> 37:22.500
installed for to get it to compile

37:22.500 --> 37:25.860
just because your Python app needs to link against it

37:25.860 --> 37:28.060
so it can use those advanced features.

37:28.060 --> 37:29.700
Now, it does seem like they've already,

37:29.700 --> 37:31.860
they've been paying particular attention to that.

37:31.860 --> 37:33.060
If you look at some of the libraries,

37:33.060 --> 37:35.180
they've already chosen to port,

37:35.180 --> 37:36.700
but sometimes you get into the weeds

37:36.700 --> 37:38.660
and there just isn't an arm build for it

37:38.660 --> 37:41.980
and you're not comfortable porting that C dependency,

37:41.980 --> 37:43.420
you might be stuck.

37:43.420 --> 37:45.940
Yeah, I think also the lack of virtualization options

37:45.940 --> 37:46.940
will hurt.

37:46.940 --> 37:51.940
When you spend $3,000, $4,000 on a computer,

37:52.340 --> 37:54.500
you want to be able to do all of the things

37:54.500 --> 37:55.420
you needed to be able to do.

37:55.420 --> 37:58.780
And that often for a lot of professional workloads

37:58.780 --> 38:02.300
or even hobbyist workloads includes virtualization

38:02.300 --> 38:07.300
and emulating full stack, emulating x86 on arm.

38:08.220 --> 38:10.980
I don't care how fast your arm processors are,

38:10.980 --> 38:13.260
that's going to be painful.

38:13.260 --> 38:16.580
And it seems like Apple sort of has built a mechanism

38:16.580 --> 38:19.180
for certain types of Mac software

38:19.180 --> 38:21.060
and they're calling it Rosetta 2.

38:21.060 --> 38:22.620
Now, while we expect most developers

38:22.620 --> 38:24.300
will go native immediately,

38:24.300 --> 38:26.940
we want to make sure that users can run all of their apps

38:26.940 --> 38:31.060
on day one, even if some apps haven't yet been updated.

38:31.060 --> 38:33.300
Now, we've been down this road before.

38:33.300 --> 38:36.420
When we transitioned from PowerPC to Intel processors,

38:36.420 --> 38:39.700
a cornerstone of that transition was Rosetta,

38:39.700 --> 38:42.820
a technology that makes it possible to run PowerPC apps

38:42.820 --> 38:45.060
on Intel-based Macs.

38:45.060 --> 38:48.220
Mac OS Big Sur will include a new version of Rosetta,

38:48.220 --> 38:49.620
Rosetta 2.

38:49.620 --> 38:52.780
Rosetta 2 automatically translates your existing Mac apps

38:52.780 --> 38:55.820
so they work on new Macs with Apple Silicon.

38:55.820 --> 38:58.500
And this time, Rosetta is even faster,

38:58.500 --> 39:01.140
more powerful, and more compatible.

39:01.140 --> 39:02.420
We will see.

39:02.420 --> 39:05.260
They say it translates the apps at launch time.

39:05.260 --> 39:08.260
And if you download the app from the Mac App Store,

39:08.260 --> 39:11.020
in the background, it will translate the calls

39:11.940 --> 39:14.900
almost wine proton style, where it says,

39:14.900 --> 39:16.380
okay, this is an x86 call,

39:16.380 --> 39:18.940
I'm going to translate it to an Apple Silicon call.

39:18.940 --> 39:23.180
And it will pre-catch that for certain types of apps.

39:23.180 --> 39:25.860
And then for apps that you download from the web,

39:25.860 --> 39:28.860
they will figure it out on first launch.

39:28.860 --> 39:30.760
And so that first launch will have a delay.

39:30.760 --> 39:31.860
That's where it's really interesting

39:31.860 --> 39:33.460
because they have the ability both to like

39:33.460 --> 39:34.980
just sort of convert it ahead of time

39:34.980 --> 39:36.500
for a compiled application,

39:36.500 --> 39:37.860
or for something like a web browser

39:37.860 --> 39:40.460
that's running just-in-time compiled JavaScript,

39:40.460 --> 39:43.020
then they can do it just at runtime too,

39:43.020 --> 39:44.700
which I mean, clearly,

39:44.700 --> 39:46.980
that's where a lot of engineering effort,

39:46.980 --> 39:49.220
besides building the Silicon,

39:49.220 --> 39:52.060
they spent a lot of time monitoring it too, I'm sure.

39:52.060 --> 39:53.860
It's an interesting bit of technology.

39:53.860 --> 39:57.060
I think part of me covers this with a bit of sadness.

39:57.060 --> 40:01.180
It would have been great to see something like Mac OS

40:01.180 --> 40:02.660
just become generally available.

40:02.660 --> 40:04.900
I would love to see Apple just say,

40:04.900 --> 40:06.060
yeah, you know what we're going to do

40:06.060 --> 40:07.900
is we're going to make it the most powerful

40:07.900 --> 40:10.060
developer workstation for every developer in the world

40:10.060 --> 40:11.740
like they claim it is by making it available

40:11.740 --> 40:12.860
to everyone in the world.

40:12.860 --> 40:15.020
Right, compete on the same terms of like,

40:15.020 --> 40:17.740
I can buy some sort of decoupled hardware,

40:17.740 --> 40:21.220
whatever I want happens to suit me best, Mac or otherwise,

40:21.220 --> 40:22.740
and then run your operating system

40:22.740 --> 40:25.140
because it's a good operating system with a good ecosystem,

40:25.140 --> 40:26.500
which that all might be true,

40:26.500 --> 40:29.620
but I just, I can't run on a ThinkPad or an XPS.

40:29.620 --> 40:34.620
Yeah, and with this transition, Mac OS 10 is done.

40:35.900 --> 40:38.180
They're done, they ran it for about 17 years.

40:38.180 --> 40:40.460
They got about 18, 17 years of life out of it.

40:40.460 --> 40:42.820
Really, they're launching Mac OS 11,

40:42.820 --> 40:46.340
and that will be a new version,

40:46.340 --> 40:49.100
a new branch with a new UI with these new features

40:49.100 --> 40:52.800
and aim for ARM compatibility towards the future.

40:52.800 --> 40:55.120
And I think when we look at this,

40:56.060 --> 40:59.020
we as a desktop are not yet ready

40:59.020 --> 41:02.260
to fully replace either Windows or Mac OS still.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.940
And we covered this a little bit last week.

41:03.940 --> 41:06.600
I would love to have seen our desktop environments

41:06.600 --> 41:08.500
be even a little more robust,

41:08.500 --> 41:10.020
get even a little more polished.

41:10.020 --> 41:13.900
I'd love to see a more powerful file system used by default

41:13.900 --> 41:15.220
in more distributions.

41:15.220 --> 41:17.540
I would like to see more engineering

41:17.540 --> 41:19.180
put into some of the finer touches

41:19.180 --> 41:21.500
to get developers up and running with sets of tools.

41:21.500 --> 41:23.620
Like you've seen certain distributions invest in,

41:23.620 --> 41:25.820
but it's just unique to them.

41:25.820 --> 41:27.660
Those are areas where I think like Linux

41:27.660 --> 41:29.260
could have shored up a little bit

41:29.260 --> 41:32.760
before this opportunity came around, but here's the thing.

41:32.760 --> 41:36.380
This is to Apple's own admittance, a two-year transition.

41:36.380 --> 41:39.220
Now, Tim Cook says they're gonna start shipping ARM Macs

41:39.220 --> 41:40.620
by the end of this year,

41:40.620 --> 41:42.380
but they say it'll take them multiple years

41:42.380 --> 41:43.780
to actually pull this off.

41:43.780 --> 41:46.140
We still have time and we still have an opportunity

41:46.140 --> 41:48.300
to see where the rest of the industry goes here.

41:48.300 --> 41:51.060
And I think Linux is in a really,

41:51.060 --> 41:53.220
really good position right now

41:53.220 --> 41:55.660
because of our early work on ARM

41:55.660 --> 41:57.260
and because of the continued acceleration

41:57.260 --> 41:58.660
of adoption of ARM in the cloud,

41:58.660 --> 42:00.340
which will benefit Linux as well.

42:00.340 --> 42:01.780
I think we're in a good position.

42:01.780 --> 42:02.620
Yeah, you're right.

42:02.620 --> 42:04.780
I mean, really everything's been going well from Linux.

42:04.780 --> 42:06.140
Microsoft recognizes it.

42:06.140 --> 42:07.900
I mean, Apple clearly recognizes it,

42:07.900 --> 42:10.620
mentioning Linux at WWDC,

42:10.620 --> 42:14.340
a powerful ecosystem of easily recompilable software.

42:14.340 --> 42:15.980
That's about the best thing you could hope for, right?

42:15.980 --> 42:17.920
They had to go set up special relationships

42:17.920 --> 42:19.340
with folks like Microsoft and Adobe

42:19.340 --> 42:22.140
to make sure that their flagship products would run

42:22.140 --> 42:23.900
versus the open source approach where they just said,

42:23.900 --> 42:25.060
oh yeah, we already fixed it.

42:25.060 --> 42:26.420
We'll send you the patches.

42:26.420 --> 42:28.240
Yeah, and it's just gonna be in the OS and good.

42:28.240 --> 42:29.080
Yeah, exactly.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.660
I mean, it gives them more control

42:30.660 --> 42:33.780
and to some extent, if they contribute some other things,

42:33.780 --> 42:35.180
it might benefit the ecosystem.

42:35.180 --> 42:37.760
I mean, just running on their platform is good.

42:37.760 --> 42:39.740
Ideally, you'd hope that they would continue to do

42:39.740 --> 42:42.020
and contribute some improvements and such,

42:42.020 --> 42:43.980
but they at least acknowledge

42:43.980 --> 42:46.020
they have to play a little bit of ball.

42:46.020 --> 42:48.980
So what do you think Intel's reaction will be, Byte?

42:48.980 --> 42:51.560
Well, if I look at how Intel reacted

42:51.560 --> 42:54.820
when Microsoft went with Snapdragon,

42:54.820 --> 42:57.580
it will be a lot of lawsuits coming up.

42:57.580 --> 43:00.980
Yeah, especially it seems like Microsoft got in that area

43:00.980 --> 43:03.580
when it came to the emulation of x86

43:03.580 --> 43:06.080
and Intel released some statement already saying,

43:06.080 --> 43:08.580
we're gonna keep working with Apple on other stuff.

43:08.580 --> 43:10.380
You know, we don't just sell them CPUs,

43:10.380 --> 43:12.180
but also our CPUs are still better.

43:12.180 --> 43:15.100
They essentially released that statement.

43:15.100 --> 43:16.840
Well, I'll just say this before we wrap up,

43:16.840 --> 43:18.220
if anybody out there in the audience

43:18.220 --> 43:22.060
ends up with one of these Mac mini iPad monsters,

43:22.060 --> 43:24.100
try putting Linux on there and let us know how it goes.

43:24.100 --> 43:25.280
I'd be curious.

43:27.120 --> 43:29.340
Okay, Westpane, before we get out of here,

43:29.340 --> 43:33.020
we do have a pick this week that is rad.

43:33.020 --> 43:34.380
It just, first of all,

43:34.380 --> 43:36.260
is a great example of how awesome

43:36.260 --> 43:38.260
a command line application can look.

43:38.260 --> 43:40.140
And second of all, very handy.

43:40.140 --> 43:41.440
Yeah, this is so cool.

43:41.440 --> 43:43.860
It's called Unsilence,

43:43.860 --> 43:46.560
and it's a console interface in library

43:46.560 --> 43:50.180
to remove just the silent parts of a media file.

43:50.180 --> 43:51.700
Yeah, even videos or whatnot.

43:51.700 --> 43:53.540
So say you download a lecture

43:53.540 --> 43:58.460
and the professor pauses, walks back and forth

43:58.460 --> 43:59.460
and just sort of, you know,

43:59.460 --> 44:01.720
maybe there's two, three, four, five, 10 seconds

44:01.720 --> 44:04.100
of silence there, just snip all that out for you.

44:04.100 --> 44:06.380
Or sometimes Chris is burping on the live stream

44:06.380 --> 44:07.500
and you just don't want to hear it.

44:07.500 --> 44:09.480
Yeah, you do need something tuned for burps though.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.660
That is not impossible though.

44:11.660 --> 44:13.160
Right, customized.

44:14.500 --> 44:15.460
That's what Drew's for.

44:15.460 --> 44:16.740
Drew's tuned for burps.

44:18.540 --> 44:19.380
We appreciate you.

44:19.380 --> 44:21.380
Yeah, can we develop a machine learning module

44:21.380 --> 44:24.300
for detecting burps and farts?

44:24.300 --> 44:26.100
That would make my life much easier.

44:27.100 --> 44:28.580
Well, we've got plenty of sample data,

44:28.580 --> 44:29.960
so we should be able to.

44:29.960 --> 44:34.280
Yeah, there you go, I have a link to that

44:34.280 --> 44:36.440
and everything else in the show notes.

44:36.440 --> 44:37.360
That's such a nice app.

44:37.360 --> 44:39.500
It gives you tons of feedback as it goes through

44:39.500 --> 44:41.440
and like figures out where all the silent bits are

44:41.440 --> 44:42.440
and removes them.

44:42.440 --> 44:43.680
And you know, there's all kinds of stuff

44:43.680 --> 44:46.280
because it's just some Python and FFmpeg.

44:46.280 --> 44:47.700
And so if you want to customize this,

44:47.700 --> 44:48.540
you want to make a video

44:48.540 --> 44:50.780
where it's a whole bunch of jump cuts really quick,

44:50.780 --> 44:51.620
or you want to make a video

44:51.620 --> 44:53.720
that just contains the silent parts,

44:53.720 --> 44:55.880
all of that's possible with this library.

44:55.880 --> 44:59.500
Everything is possible with FFmpeg, let's be honest.

44:59.500 --> 45:00.800
It's the best tool ever.

45:00.800 --> 45:03.560
And it's already ported to run on Apple Silicon.

45:03.560 --> 45:06.320
Oh, good.

45:06.320 --> 45:10.080
All right, well, I think that's about all the Apple talk

45:10.080 --> 45:12.840
we have in us for like the next 360 episodes,

45:12.840 --> 45:14.160
so that should be good.

45:14.160 --> 45:15.160
Unless somebody gets their hands

45:15.160 --> 45:16.320
on one of them development kits,

45:16.320 --> 45:17.760
then we might bring it up again.

45:17.760 --> 45:19.560
LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact,

45:19.560 --> 45:21.640
one more plug for how you get ahold of us.

45:21.640 --> 45:23.040
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

45:23.040 --> 45:25.280
The show is at Linux Unplugged on the Twitters,

45:25.280 --> 45:26.200
if you use it.

45:26.200 --> 45:29.040
And if you don't, I understand.

45:29.040 --> 45:30.520
Just go tell a friend about the show.

45:30.520 --> 45:32.880
Spread the word about the big talk show, we appreciate it.

45:32.880 --> 45:35.400
Let the world know there's an Unplugged out there for them.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.040
See you next Tuesday!

45:37.040 --> 46:03.440
士 put your phones in your pocket

46:03.440 --> 46:21.220
So I think, you know, the reality is, is that Macs haven't been for a long time or were

46:21.220 --> 46:24.880
never going to be computers that you could just use for whatever you want.

46:24.880 --> 46:31.160
They are a product that has that product's operating system, like a Nintendo Switch does,

46:31.160 --> 46:33.160
like a PlayStation or an Xbox does.

46:33.160 --> 46:37.800
And you've got to think about it in that context, not in a, hey, this is a piece of consumer

46:37.800 --> 46:41.320
technology that is mine and I can do what I want with.

46:41.320 --> 46:46.460
You have to think of it as this is a piece of technology that is built for very purpose

46:46.460 --> 46:47.520
specific things.

46:47.520 --> 46:53.160
And if I am doing those things, perhaps it's good for me, but I can't make it do what I

46:53.160 --> 46:54.160
want.

46:54.160 --> 46:58.040
And even though it's very expensive and if I spend $4,000 on a laptop, I should be able

46:58.040 --> 46:59.880
to do everything with it.

46:59.880 --> 47:04.600
That's just not the reality is there is a use case spectrum now, and it just if it doesn't

47:04.600 --> 47:30.720
fit within that use case spectrum, this is not a computer for you.
