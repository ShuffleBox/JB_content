00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged episode 46 for June 24th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,920
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's reporting in from Charlotte,

3
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:49,040
North Carolina. My name is Chris. Hello, Matt. Hello, Matt. Hello. Hello. Hi there. So, we've

4
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,680
got a big show today because we've got more stuff from Southeast Linux Fest 2014. Matt's

5
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:59,080
joining us on Mumble this week. We're going mumble mumble for all of the audio, which

6
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:04,120
we'll see how that works. It's an experience. So far, it's been a little troublesome. But

7
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:08,440
I think we worked out the kinks enough to do a show. And we also have Q5Sis. He's joined

8
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,640
us today. He was down at Southeast Linux Fest. Noah couldn't make it because I guess he's

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,040
going to Australia, I guess. I don't know. That guy's crazy. Wow. Yeah. I know. And he

10
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,920
just sent me an awesome little goody bag of stuff. He's got these Blackberry chargers

11
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,200
he loves, so he sent me a couple of those and a microphone. And then the coolest thing

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,760
ever, it lets you run HDMI over Ethernet. So, we could have like machines up in the

13
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,220
editing office that we could run down to the studio over our Ethernet and capture their

14
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,880
full screens, 1080p capture, over the network. It's kind of cool. That's awesome. No, it's

15
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,320
so cool. So, he just sent all that kind of stuff in and got a bunch of great interviews

16
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,920
we'll be playing today. But I thought, Matt, we would start with a little bit of follow-up

17
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,320
and feedback. Mr. Rotten Corpse, are you in here today? Paging Mr. Rotten Corpse. Did

18
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:04,160
you have anything to mention about the XBMC app art that you've been working on? Paging

19
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,480
Mr. Corpse. Oh, yeah, sure. Is my audio fine? Because it's kind of... It's all right. It's

20
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:17,000
enough to tell us about the XBMC app. Yeah. Yeah. Me and Rob Lowe are working on an update

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,280
to the XBMC app. There's been a lot of improvements to the artwork and language. So, there should

22
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:31,000
be a new update to it in about a day or two. Very cool. Very cool. So, it's a better time

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,640
than ever to have the Jupyter Broadcasting XBMC app. And I saw that you guys were working

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,920
on that last night, and that's really cool. So, I wanted to give a mention for that. So,

25
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,760
let's jump into our feedback. Corky98 submitted an article to the Linux Action Show subreddit

26
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,680
kind of following up on our conversation regarding Mantle on the Linux Action Show this Sunday.

27
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,800
He says, hello, Chris. On this week's Linux Action Show, you showed a clip of an AMD representative

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,080
announcing the possibility of Mantle support for Linux in the future. While this is all

29
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,120
very good, Mantle is another proprietary solution to the problem of graphic APIs and is bound

30
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,840
to eventually fail. I respect that the first few years Mantle will probably outperform

31
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,520
OpenGL and maybe even DirectX, but proprietary solutions will always run out of steam due

32
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,560
to the amount of effort needed to maintain them. Money runs proprietary solutions and

33
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,400
AMD will not assign a large budget year after year to maintain the code. I did my research

34
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,560
and before I was old enough to remember OpenGL and DirectX eye to eye, here's John Carmack

35
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,600
complaining about DirectX and a 2002 article summing up DirectX. In early 2000s, DirectX

36
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,360
was considered shambles and OpenGL was clearly an outperformer by then, by far. Then Microsoft

37
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,600
stepped up their game and caught up. DirectX is still ahead because of that boost in support

38
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,500
in the early 2000s. So, what does this mean? It means that maybe Matt's assumption that

39
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,500
OpenGL couldn't be fixed could be considered incorrect. OpenGL is heavily restructured

40
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,600
because the industry support for multiple versions of OpenGL and the newest version

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,240
is not pushed, unlike DirectX. Yes, OpenGL is very differently structured to DirectX,

42
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,760
but it doesn't mean it cannot be saved. And there's also, something he doesn't go into,

43
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,160
but there's also an extension system to OpenGL that is also a good thing and a bad thing.

44
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:11,040
But he thinks the important part is that the same AMD representative said that before Mantle

45
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,400
support that a high-quality OpenGL driver was going to be provided for Linux. This is

46
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,720
the news, Corky thinks, not Mantle support for Linux. Of course, they're lying and they'll

47
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,760
put a bit more work, release an entirely new version number and it will still be pretty.

48
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:31,100
But he said, also with things like Wayland coming down, this completely coincides with

49
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,000
Wayland becoming usable. So, if they leave it for a year or two, wait for Wayland to

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,400
get sort of figured out, wait to see where Valve pushes things, and then maybe AMD will

51
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,520
come along with either their new OpenGL or Mantle release.

52
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,760
That's an interesting idea, Corky. And Corky wanted to kind of write in, essentially, and

53
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,960
chime in support for OpenGL because both Matt and I were kind of like, well, OpenGL seems

54
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,400
to be fine, but developers seem to have written the book on it and decided they're not happy

55
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,040
with it anymore. And I think that was sort of the key piece that Matt and I were talking

56
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,560
about. And I think that's still the case. I think part of the problem is that developers

57
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,000
have just kind of checked out. I mean, Matt, am I missing anything? Is that kind of...

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,360
Well, no, I think that's it. I also think it's important to remember that my point was

59
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,040
that the very first thing out of my mouth is I know squat about OpenGL. That was the

60
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,520
very first thing out of my mouth, so I can't speculate on something I don't understand.

61
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,520
Yeah, totally.

62
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
Let's get that out of the way.

63
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Let's just make that a disclaimer.

64
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,360
Yeah, let's be clear on this. But that being said, I do think that at the end of the day,

65
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,040
whether it's tinfoil or OpenGL or pies out of the sky, if the developers aren't into

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,240
it, that's a thing. So we can try and tree hug our way through this, like we usually

67
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
do.

68
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,120
Okay, Matt, so let's take Heaven's Revenge as a take here. Heaven's Revenge, you think

69
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,000
it's something to do with the kids?

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,120
I think so, because didn't all this graphics API hoopla happen in the late 80s, early 90s,

71
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,160
where there was a whole bunch of different APIs, and then they all converged into one,

72
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,800
well, two standards, DirectX and OpenGL, so they're just going back and making a whole

73
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,400
bunch of problems all over again.

74
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,880
Oh, I see what you're saying. The new developers didn't learn the lessons of the past generation.

75
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,000
Yeah, they don't know what our older elders went through to get us to this point.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,080
Yeah, some of those gray hairs were well-earned fighting those battles that they're sort of

77
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:30,120
retredging up. I will see. I think, just to kind of cap off the whole mantle thing, it'll

78
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,600
happen if gaming on Linux really becomes enough of a market force that people want to make

79
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,040
money on it, and then that's when AMD will pull their head out of their ass, but by then

80
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,160
it will be too late to become fully relevant and lock it in.

81
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,240
So Sebastian writes in, we got really up in a huff a couple of weeks ago about Alienware

82
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,160
switching over to Windows for their quote-unquote Steam machine. Sebastian says, hey guys, there's

83
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,320
a video from E3 with the Alienware console that you talked about. In the video, they

84
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:05,120
talk about being flexible and giving you the opportunity to upgrade to SteamOS or install

85
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,200
the beta of SteamOS without voiding your warranty. So I thought this was extremely interesting

86
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,440
because this was a huge, they're basically torpedoing their future SteamOS effort. So

87
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,840
here is the clip of the Alienware rep.

88
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,960
Now if someone is interested in SteamOS, if they pick this up now, it's going to come

89
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,600
with Windows and they'll be able to upgrade this later, correct?

90
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,720
Absolutely. So once SteamOS is finally out, or if you want to load the beta, you absolutely

91
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,320
can load it on this system. We'll not void your warranty by any means. We'll support

92
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,980
it. We'll even help you do it if you need instructions on how to do it. SteamOS also

93
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,840
works with the Xbox 360 gamepad. It also works with the Logitech gamepad and a few others.

94
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,640
So this is SteamOS ready.

95
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,120
Exactly. I know a lot of guys out there were a little bit hesitant when they first started

96
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,200
hearing about these pre-built SteamOS boxes coming out, or in this case a WindowsOS box

97
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,280
because they're like, oh, why don't I build my own? This has a compelling value due to

98
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,520
stuff like form factor and price, which is actually very impressive.

99
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,040
There you go. And that was on the Linus Tech Tips YouTube page and they talk about the

100
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:10,840
fact that, you know what, they're going to actually support users that want to install

101
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,720
SteamOS. Does this make you feel better, Matt?

102
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,040
It makes me feel a little better because I feel like rather than living with their head

103
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,240
in their clouds or off their butts, depending on how you want to feel like they're actually

104
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,500
trying to embrace it, but basically placing responsibility onto the end user. I'm fine

105
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,060
with that, as long as they're not being debased about it.

106
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,560
So Riley, you think it's a terrible idea. Terrible idea.

107
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,960
Yes, because they still have to support their software, which is Windows essentially, they

108
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:45,600
still have to do their license fees for it, and you have to support it after SteamOS does

109
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,600
come out. They should have just waited for a stable build on SteamOS, but they did, and

110
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,360
they were just lazy, and I don't know what they did with it. But they should have waited.

111
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,960
I think that's still it. I think the fact that they had a Windows UI ready to roll right

112
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,160
out of the gate shows that they were kind of planning for things not to work out, they

113
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,920
weren't fully into it, and I think that's the real nail in the coffin.

114
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,240
All right, Rod and Corpse, if you want to play devil's advocate, go ahead, I'll let

115
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
you.

116
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:22,800
Okay, so I was thinking maybe it's helpful in a way. It's negative to the SteamOS, sure,

117
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,000
but it could potentially be good, because if they're calling the SteamBox or Steam Machine

118
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,440
and people start seeing that more often than just regular Valve Steam users, and they see

119
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,880
that the machine is able to be bought as a SteamBox, and then the next version is Linux,

120
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,960
they will still see it as a SteamBox, and maybe have more likelihood to buy it.

121
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:50,880
Hmm. All right, okay. I guess I could see that, particularly if the user is just totally

122
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,160
unaware, but it seems at least for the first year...

123
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,960
I don't believe that, I'm just thinking it's a possibility.

124
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,000
Okay, okay, I was going to say, because it seems like for the first year or two of this

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,080
console's life, the consumer is going to be pretty aware of what it is, because it's going

126
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,240
to be the savvier of the groups buying initially. I don't think the most average consumer has

127
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,200
any idea that the Xbox 360 runs a version of the anti-kernel. I think it's totally irrelevant

128
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,760
to them. They don't need to know it runs Windows, they don't give a crap that it runs Windows,

129
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,600
and I think SteamOS machines would eventually be like that, but I think for the first couple

130
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,400
years it's probably... probably people who know what an operating system is probably

131
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,360
know what the advantages of Windows over Linux are, maybe, I think? I don't know.

132
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,360
I think initially...

133
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
Oh, go ahead, Matt.

134
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,720
Well, I just wanted to draw one thing on here, is that at the end of the day, even if you

135
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,520
know what the OS is, if they're trying to target gamers, there's a little thing called

136
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,520
titles.

137
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,240
Yeah, very true.

138
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,560
And they're trying to launch with as many titles as possible. Now, while I think Alienware

139
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,640
is definitely kind of selling us all down the road, and certainly that's true to the

140
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,700
day, it's a money grab. I'm not expecting them to be all touchy-feely about it, just

141
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,880
they're looking at making money, period. They don't care.

142
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,320
Yeah. And, Poby, what's your point of view on this topic?

143
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:08,480
They're a hardware manufacturer, they need to sell hardware, and I think, given SteamOS

144
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,920
isn't out, I think it's perfectly reasonable for them to make a machine that runs whatever

145
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,880
operating system is out at the time. Like, right now, I would really love to have a box

146
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,160
underneath my TV. I cannot be bothered to build something. I would rather buy off the

147
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,120
shelf, and maybe I'm paying a premium for that, maybe I'm not getting the same components.

148
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:33,000
But I'm pretty sure there's plenty of people out there who, like me, would buy something

149
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,200
like over the internet or from a store, and if it happens to have Windows on it, so be

150
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,820
it, in the same way that anyone else would buy a laptop that happens to have Windows

151
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,880
on it. I'll stick it under my TV, maybe I'll install Linux on it later when the Windows

152
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,320
install becomes cruft-laden and horrible, because that's what Windows installs do. So

153
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,840
what do you do? You wipe it and you put Linux on it, and that's what people will do.

154
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,360
And so they'll see it as a performance upgrade, a boost.

155
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,520
Right. And I don't think it's a lazy thing. I think someone suggested that it was lazy

156
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,040
of Alienware. I don't think it's lazy. They need to sell hardware. They've already put

157
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,100
the R&D into making this thing. So it makes sense for them to ship the thing rather than

158
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,200
leave it on shelves or mothball the thing. It makes sense.

159
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,600
Do you think maybe it underscores the fact that they believe in a home theater PC-type

160
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,880
setup for console gaming, and they think that's the real revolution, is getting a PC that

161
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,760
powerful in that form factor in the living room with a controller-capable UI. That's

162
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,440
the thing that they believe in, not necessarily what operating system powers it.

163
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,040
Exactly. And the fact that they're willing to support people trying to get SteamOS on

164
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,600
it, the beta of SteamOS, all power to them. If anyone else had come out with a piece of

165
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,120
hardware and said, look, we're running a proprietary OS, but we will actively help you install

166
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,520
an alternative OS, surely that should be applauded.

167
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,040
Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You said commercial software.

168
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,400
Yeah, thanks, Richard.

169
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
He wanted to clear that up.

170
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,280
Yeah, right. All right, well, we're going to get into Southeast Linux Fest. We'll have

171
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:09,560
more links, including some additional info that didn't quite fit in the show notes if

172
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
you guys want to check that.

173
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,000
Before we go on, I want to thank DigitalOcean, one of the sponsors of the Linux Unplugged

174
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,120
podcast. Now, you know about DigitalOcean, right? Because it's kind of like one of the

175
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,320
coolest companies to come around in a while. It's simple cloud hosting, and DigitalOcean

176
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,280
is dedicated to offering really the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

177
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,480
And you know, I mean, sure, you can make a cloud server in under a minute, no bigs, right?

178
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,100
Wrong! It's a huge deal! Users can create a cloud server in under 55 seconds, and pricing

179
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:43,960
plans start at only $5 a month for 512MB of RAM, a 20GB SSD, a blazing fast CPU, and 1TB

180
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,160
of tier 1 bandwidth. Plus, DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco,

181
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,400
Singapore, and Amsterdam. But man, that interface? That interface is simple! Man, that interface

182
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,320
is intuitive with a control panel that won't stop, and power users can replicate it on

183
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:05,240
a large scale with DigitalOcean's straightforward API. And that stands for Application Programming

184
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,240
Interface. Think about the possibilities! In fact, people have! Because DigitalOcean

185
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,520
has a badass community with a ton of people growing all around it every single day, and

186
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,280
they're making applet controllers for Ubuntu, and that Mac operating system, and all those

187
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:21,720
other operating systems where you can control your DigitalOcean Droplet right from your

188
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,440
desktop. And of course, because you can get a Droplet imaged, deployed, spun up super

189
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,980
fast, it saves you time, makes it really easy to back up, makes it crazy simple to revert

190
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:36,700
if you make a mistake. In fact, that makes it ideal for training, too. So many possibilities.

191
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:42,640
Run your backend infrastructure, train yourself, replace a cloud service for $5 a month. Why

192
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,120
not? Well, I'll tell you why. Maybe you're going to be cheap. I understand. I mean, $5

193
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,480
is not very much money, but you want a better deal. You want something even better? Well,

194
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,760
guess what? Chris is going to hook you up. Going to hook you up. You want to know what

195
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,920
you can do? Use the promo code UNPLUGJUNE. Use the promo code UNPLUGJUNE. When you check

196
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,640

197
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,160
been using for a while, you're going to get a ton of machine. And let's be honest, we're

198
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,280
talking about Linux here. We're talking about something that excels as a server operating

199
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:14,520
system in really, really different, varying different environments. I mean, that's what's

200
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,440
so great about it. And it's amazing what you can get for $5 a month. And if you use our

201
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,760
promo code UNPLUGJUNE, UNPLUGJUNE will get you a $10 credit. Bob's your uncle. You're

202
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,680
going to get to try that droplet for two months. They also have hourly pricing. So if you want

203
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:33,120
to just try something out for testing, you can. There's lots of reasons to try out DigitalOcean's

204
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,760
super fast provisioning, SSD hard drives, tier one bandwidth, amazing hardware sitting

205
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,440
on top of KVM virtualization, private networking, an active developer community, just a rockin'

206
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,720
community in general. Go check them out. DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code UNPLUGJUNE. Don't be

207
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,320
a fool. Go get yourself your own cloud server with root access up in the cloud connected

208
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,040
to tier one bandwidth for only $5 a month. UNPLUGJUNE when you check out. That lets them

209
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,840
know you heard about it right here on the Linux Unplugged show. And by the way, keeps

210
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,080
us going. And that's also a really good thing. Big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

211
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Linux Unplugged.

212
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:18,440
Okay guys. So Mr. Q5, is there anything you want to set us up with Southeast Linux Fest

213
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,880
before we move on and get into some interviews? I've got six clips I want to play here on

214
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,400
the show. All really good stuff. Our first one is Zach Underwood. Now I don't know, Mr.

215
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,600
Q5, is there anything you want to set us up with before we jump right in or should we

216
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
just start?

217
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,200
Well I do want to end up with something. But before we jump in with Zach's video, I do

218
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:45,200
have to say that for those of us that were there at Linux Fest Northwest, we realize

219
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,800
and we remember that the wireless network situation was kind of bad. The wireless network

220
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:58,560
itself was phenomenal. Absolutely fantastic connection. The way they had it set up, the

221
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,000
way they did everything was the way it should have been done. This guy, Zach, he knows what

222
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,240
he is doing.

223
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,520
Now how many people in attendance do you know? Do you have a rough number versus Northwest

224
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,800
versus Southeast?

225
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,600
I don't have an exact number.

226
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,040
Was it more or less people? Because that might explain the Wi-Fi.

227
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:25,680
It was a little bit less. But just the way that the conference was set up, I would say

228
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:33,280
about the same in the area at the same time. Linux Fest Northwest had a higher volume,

229
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,960
but I would say it was Southeast. I think more people stayed around for the whole day.

230
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,360
Interesting. Interesting. So hey, that's always a big plus when the wireless works. All right.

231
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,800
Well we'll kick it off with Zach's interview and then you can chime in with anything you

232
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,320
want to add and we'll run through some of these. So we'll send it over to Zach Underwood.

233
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,760
Good afternoon. We are still at Southeast Linux Fest going around table to table meeting

234
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,320
a bunch of exciting people. Zach here from Global Vision drove two hours to not only

235
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,360
be at Southeast Linux Fest, but he is giving me internet tokens. Isn't that right, Zach?

236
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,360
Yes, I am.

237
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:13,400
So this is possibly your presentation, which is coming up in an hour or so. Yeah. It's

238
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,920
going to be the presentation. I am looking forward to the most out of any of them here

239
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:24,280
at Self. Primarily because I have a particular problem that we were kind of discussing off-camera

240
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,120
that I've been trying to find a solution. And your expertise in this area is going to

241
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,460
be, at least I hope, is going to be instrumental in fixing this problem. So if you could tell

242
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:39,760
me a little bit about what exactly your presentation and specifically your company does and what

243
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,920
it is, the service that you provided here at Self.

244
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,640
All right. First I'll start off with the company. My company is Global Vision. We're a wireless

245
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,800
ISP. So we provide wireless internet to clients that typically maybe have only DSL and they

246
00:18:53,800 --> 00:19:00,840
want something better than the 1.5 meg DSL. So we set up a tower with access points and

247
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:08,000
then we point client radios on the client's house to the tower to show them internet.

248
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,880
So what we're doing, my presentation here at Self is basically how to optimize indoor

249
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,160
wireless, particularly in a multi-access point environment. So you would have in a hotel

250
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,840
or a conference room. A lot of the stuff I'm going to be talking about is not really applicable

251
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,680
to a single radio. Those are pretty easy. That's pretty simple. And so I'm going to

252
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:33,360
talk about optimizing it as for performance, for speed, the difference between 2.4 gigahertz

253
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:40,040
and 5 gigahertz radios and basically just how to make Wi-Fi not suck.

254
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:46,520
So give me an idea for somebody who is maybe looking at setting up a very simplistic wireless

255
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,660
network. Maybe they want something just a little bit better than the integrated radio

256
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:56,640
that's in their router. What do you recommend for just a single autonomous access point?

257
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:02,560
I'm very bullish on a vendor called Ubiquity. They are very price conscious. They make a

258
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:09,560
wireless access point called the UAP. It retails for about 69 bucks and it competes with Cisco

259
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:15,180
access points that go for six or seven hundred dollars. So there is a little bit of a learning

260
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,920
curve with these systems. First off, none of the Ubiquity radios you can actually log

261
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,080
into and see a web interface. You have to use a separate management software which they

262
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,480
give away for free. They don't charge a license. Thank you Cisco. So the UAP is a great choice

263
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,840
for an AP and we actually deploy them quite often to our clients.

264
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:41,720
So we have set up a number of the Unifi access points. How do those work with Linux?

265
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,560
They actually work really well. They actually run Linux and you can SSH into the radios.

266
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,800
They're running BusyBox which is a very stripped down embedded version of Linux.

267
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,240
How about for the management service? If I wanted to stay away strictly from a Mac or

268
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,920
Windows environment, can I do that?

269
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:04,280
Yes. They actually prefer to run the management server on a Linux platform. In this case Debian

270
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,200
and Ubuntu. It is a Java based app that uses MongoDB for the backend.

271
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,920
Outstanding. And if people wanted to find more about Global Vision and the concepts

272
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,960
that you're talking about, where can we direct them to?

273
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,880
GlobalVision.net and anyone feel free to email me. I am zunderwood at GlobalVision.net and

274
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,200
I'll be happy to send you a copy of the presentation.

275
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,760
Outstanding. Thank you so much Zach for taking some time to talk with us.

276
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
All right. Thank you.

277
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,600
Wait a minute Wimpy. You're connected to us right now by shortwave radio? That's some

278
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,320
kind of special. Yeah, we can hear you. Where do you live that you have to connect by shortwave

279
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,320
radio?

280
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:46,040
Well, as I learned today, about 15 miles from Popeye, but apparently in the back of beyond,

281
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,280
in the farming belt of North Hampshire.

282
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:53,160
I love that those APs run Linux. I'm all about that. Like, oh yeah, you can just switch in

283
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,800
and run BusyBox and then you can pretty much do everything you need. And it sounds like

284
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:03,040
those guys really knew their Wi-Fi stuff based on what Q5 was saying. Okay. Well, so there's

285
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,880
a group called Wicked and they're working on a two-factor authentication system. And

286
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,800
I haven't watched the whole clip yet, but I'm hoping it's essentially an open solution

287
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
to two-factor authentication. Let's take a listen.

288
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,400
I'm here with Nick from Wicked and I don't know anything about Wicked right off the bat,

289
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,720
but I got to tell you from looking around your table and looking at some of the promotional

290
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:27,760
material you have, I have to tell you, I'm intrigued. Can you tell me a little bit about

291
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,160
what Wicked is and what it is you guys do?

292
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:36,880
Sure. So we provide a two-factor authentication solution. It is a software-based solution.

293
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,560
So the two factors are possession of a private key embedded in a software token and knowledge

294
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:49,080
of a PIN. And we have a server that sits behind your corporate firewall. It's Linux-based.

295
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:55,120
And there's a key pair exchange basically between the software token and your server.

296
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,160
And a PIN is created by the user and there's a registration process. And after that, when

297
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,420
the user wants to log in, they type their PIN into the software token. It's encrypted,

298
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,040
sent to your server. If the PIN is correct and the encryption is valid and the account

299
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,600
is active, a one-time passcode is generated on the server, encrypted, and returned to

300
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
the user.

301
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,680
Now, this is a solution that can be, you said that it's based on Linux. Can your system

302
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,960
be used with Linux?

303
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,320
Oh, yes. So in your infrastructure, what you want to do is establish an authentication

304
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:34,200
protocol. Typically, what we see is companies use RADIUS. So your VPN, SSH, Apache, FreeNX,

305
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,680
all these systems will talk RADIUS. And the ideal thing is to have them all talk RADIUS

306
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:45,960
to your free RADIUS server or in the Windows world, the NPS, have it do authorization in

307
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,400
your directory and then proxy the credentials to an authentication server like Wicked.

308
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:59,160
Sure. Okay. Does this, to get this product rolling, does it take a lot of knowledge in

309
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,960
the development field? Or is it something that an administrator could do?

310
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:08,080
No. And it's primarily targeted to administrators. And we've got a very easy setup process. We're

311
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,920
trying to make it as easy to set up as software as a service, but be reliable and be in your

312
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,280
location.

313
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,720
So this isn't a subscription-based model. It's something you buy one outright.

314
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:22,200
Actually, our licensing is different. We have a subscription licensing. So instead of having

315
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,960
a permanent license and charging you 20% per year for support, we actually charge an annual

316
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,880
subscription, but you still control the software. We have a three-year prepayment option, so

317
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,360
you can get a discount if you prepay. But we kind of looked at it as being like, well,

318
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,480
do you really want to pay upfront for all of our software? And then maybe what if we

319
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,600
got a business? So it's less risk for our buyers. We're

320
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,360
incented to keep the software up and running and solid and secure. So it kind of aligns

321
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,960
our incentives.

322
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,720
And the thing is that funding model is probably a little bit more beneficial to your business

323
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:01,240
to have that steady income rather than somebody, they come in and then they buy it and then

324
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
they take off, right?

325
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,400
Yeah. So it makes it harder to grow fast because if you get that big chunk of money, you can

326
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,400
actually grow fast, but it makes it more disciplined. And we're not going to grow faster than we

327
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,200
can grow our marketplace.

328
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,520
Now how does your product compare to something like say Google Authenticator?

329
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,440
So Google Authenticator is primarily their software token. They have like a PAM module

330
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,960
that you can run for SSH. There's two key differences. One is that it is an addition

331
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,800
to passwords. So we prefer to get rid of passwords because they suck.

332
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,520
And it's also really just a PAM module. So what happens when you want to use it for your

333
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,880
VPN? Where's the integration for that? Where's the Apache module? So if you're doing a one-off

334
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,080
thing and you just want to lock down the couple of servers that you manage or have at home,

335
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,760
that's great. If you're really looking at deploying something that can help your organization

336
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,520
grow and manage users and have logging and have support, that's where you'd look to Wicked.

337
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,320
Outstanding. Where can people go to find out more about Wicked and what you guys do and

338
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,760
how to get involved or to, I guess in your case, how to purchase the product or service?

339
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:13,300
So wickedsystems.com, W-I-K-I-D, systems.com. We have a source for sites. We've got an open

340
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:19,120
source version. We do welcome contributions to that. And we are on Twitter at wickedsystems

341
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
as well.

342
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,920
Perfect. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us. We really appreciate

343
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
it.

344
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,360
I like, it says, Doggo Red in their, Dago Red in the chat room says that they were also

345
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:35,960
giving out mix drink, mix shake, like drink shakers as swag at the fest. That's awesome.

346
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,600
That's a great swag item. I kind of want to check that out. And again, that's wicked and

347
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,600
it's a W-I-K-D. Q5, did you get a chance to look at that stuff? What did you think?

348
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,040
Yeah, their stuff is actually really impressive. And just to let you know, I did happen to

349
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,520
get one of those drink shakers for him.

350
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Oh, for me?

351
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
So I will drop that in the mail.

352
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
No way!

353
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
Yes, I did.

354
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
Oh, awesome.

355
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,880
I saw it and I was like, this is something Chris would love.

356
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
I do.

357
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,200
I looked at the guy and said, I'm going to take two. And he's like, well, I really don't

358
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,000
have that many. And I said, well, we're doing an interview. He goes, yeah, okay, I can

359
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
afford two.

360
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,720
Good man. Good man. Well, I love that. And I'm so glad Noah got the Google Authenticator

361
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,080
question in there because that was totally what I was thinking too. So Q5, were you on

362
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,640
camera for these interviews?

363
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Was that you?

364
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,280
I was actually the man behind the camera for all of these.

365
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:27,360
Okay. Wow, very awesome. Okay, our next group is the Internet System Consortium. And Noah

366
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,280
stopped by and had a quick chat with them. I believe they just celebrated their 20th

367
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
birthday too.

368
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:38,560
So we have Chuck from ISC, the Internet Systems Consortium. How are you doing today, Chuck?

369
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,600
Real good. How are you?

370
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,800
I'm doing excellent. Now, to start out, if you can tell me a little bit about what ISC

371
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,760
is and what it is you guys do.

372
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:54,200
Well, ISC has been around in the internet for a long time. We just had our 20th birthday

373
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:02,640
this spring. ISC is the author and publisher of the BIND 9 DNS software that most of the

374
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:12,320
internet uses now. We also have ISC DHCP product, which again is the standard implementation

375
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:25,360
of DSC across most of the internet. In addition to the software services, we provide support

376
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:30,360
for free software. In fact, that's a good deal of what funds the company. And that's

377
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:40,480
my job. I'm a support engineer. And in addition, we do have a hosting service, which we have

378
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:49,280
a commercial side and a public benefit side. And we have, we do DNS hosting, SNS secondary

379
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:55,920
name service, which again is split into a public benefit and a commercial side. We also

380
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:07,760
maintain the F root name server, which is an Anycast server all across the world. I

381
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,800
don't know exactly how many nodes it has, but F root is everywhere. And we do a lot

382
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,360
of cool stuff to benefit the internet.

383
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,840
Well, awesome. Well, thank you so much for taking time to meet with us. We really appreciate

384
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,840
it.

385
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,720
Thank you. And I also, I didn't get a chance to finish because we put one in the last week's

386
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:30,400
episode, but another Slackware advocate too, right Q5? It seems like Slackware was big

387
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:33,840
down there. Is that just the impression I got from these clips?

388
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,680
Oh yeah. Slackware users came out in force and actually talking with Chuck, his whole

389
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:45,240
family uses Slackware. His wife uses it. His 17 year old son uses it. His 15 year old daughter

390
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,720
uses it. His entire family runs Linux.

391
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,000
That's awesome. And yeah, he made the comment like if Slackware is meant for you, it'll

392
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,000
eventually find you. You don't have to find Slackware. I love it. You know, that's so

393
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,440
cool. And it's good to see like you go to these kinds of events, you get everybody together

394
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,760
and one of the old dog distros is still getting a lot of love.

395
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,240
Before we go to our next group of clips, I want to thank our second sponsor this week

396
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,480
and that is the great folks over at Ting. Go to linux.ting.com. That'll take $25 off

397
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,160
your first device. Or if you've got a device that's compatible, well then let's give you

398
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,680
a $25 Ting credit. And if you're like me, that might pay for more than your first month

399
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:30,920
of service. In fact, go to linux.ting.com. Click that how much would you save button

400
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,600
right there and plug in how much you actually use.

401
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:39,420
So I decided I'm taking like a husband, wife, you know, a spousal or you know, whatever

402
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,360
your situation is, two people, plug in your actual minutes. And I kind of high balled

403
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,040
here. I went 800 minutes, 500 text messages and 2 gigabytes of data. Now this isn't what

404
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,980
you're paying for. It's what you actually use. And I was generous. I said you're going

405
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,520
to get that for $150 a month. That's probably, I mean you're probably going to pay more than

406
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,420
that. But we're going to low ball a little bit here.

407
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,400
When I calculate the savings, I could see that by switching to Ting over a two year

408
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:10,760
period, I would save $2,064. $2,064 by switching to Ting. Linux.ting.com. That's where you

409
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,560
want to go. And once you become a Ting customer, I'll tell you there's a few things about the

410
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:17,920
Ting service you're going to absolutely love. First of all, it's a flat $6 per month and

411
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:21,400
then it's just your usage on top of that. Plus whatever cut the man's going to take.

412
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,140
But really, it's a flat $6 and then your minutes, your messages and your megabytes, Ting adds

413
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,680
them all up at the end of the month. Whatever bucket you fall into, that's all you pay.

414
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,480
The great part is their dashboard makes it crazy easy to see where you're at. You can

415
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,400
track individual devices, set limits, set alerts. Go in there and set up call 40 when you miss

416
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:40,020
a call. All that kind of stuff that you're always wondering, hey, what's that code I'm

417
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,720
supposed to enter in my phone to activate this feature? Ting exposes all of that through

418
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,360
their dashboard and through their companion apps on Android and iOS. Lots of nice things

419
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,640
about Ting. And I also want to point out that when you're over at Ting, go to Linux.ting.com

420
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,720
to get started. Try out that savings calculator. And then after you've played around for a

421
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:05,880
little bit, head over to the blog. Ting really, really puts a lot of effort into this blog

422
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,860
and there's a ton of good content, even for non-Ting customers. But what I want to point

423
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,240
your attention to is if you're in a contract and you know you want to switch to Ting but

424
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,280
you're not ready to go whole hog and cancel your contract, I want to remind you that Ting

425
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,120
does have an early termination relief program, ting.com slash ETF. You can find out more

426
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,040
about that. There's also another system they've set up, Ting Reminders. Ting will just send

427
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,160
you a nice little gentle nudge when your contract expires and says, hey, bro, why don't you

428
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,980
move over to Ting now? We'll get you taken care of. They've also got a new swap program

429
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,640
to help you swap up to a Galaxy device and move over to Ting. Linux.ting.com. Check them

430
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:45,560
out. No hold customer service. Voicemail, caller ID, tethering, hotspot, three-way calling,

431
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,880
call forwarding, all other features you'd expect, all part of your service, no hidden

432
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:55,640
charges, no BS. It's really quite awesome. Linux.ting.com. And a really big thanks to

433
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:00,440
Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. I've been using them for well over a year now.

434
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:06,120
And it totes rocks. I got my recently-bricked Ubuntu Touch Nexus 5 on the Ting network.

435
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,820
And until I tried to do today's update, I was quite enjoying using it on the Ting network.

436
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:21,600
But now, I'll just use Android. Okay. Now, we're going to move over to the BSD folks.

437
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,600
If you haven't gone to one of these fests, you got to understand how these BSD guys work.

438
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:33,700
They are sneaky. They get in there, they talk nice to people, they play nice, they listen

439
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,360
to the Linux users and they politely nod their head. And they say, here, Linux user, take

440
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,800
these horns, put these horns on, and then walk around with these flashing. It is subversive,

441
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:49,680
it's devious, and it works every time. And Noah had a chance to stop by and chat with

442
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:55,360
Chris, Chris's brother, Chris Moore, who you probably know from BSD now. Well, he got a

443
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,360
chance to talk with Ken Moore about PCBSD.

444
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,280
We're here with Ken Moore from the PCBSD project. How are you doing today, Ken?

445
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,720
I'm doing very well, thank you.

446
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,200
Thanks a lot for taking the time to talk to us. Now, I know that every time I see Alan

447
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:17,200
June, he makes it a point to tell me. We gave Alan a ride back from LinuxFest Northwest

448
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,440
back to his hotel. And the entire way back, the conversation was dominated with the idea

449
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,640
that everyone in the world should switch to BSD.

450
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,520
Oh, of course.

451
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:33,600
So tell me a little bit about what your connection to the BSD project is and what it is that

452
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
you do.

453
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,000
I am one of the developers on the PCBSD project. I generally focus on designing the graphical

454
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,720
utilities to make system management, system administration, installing and running applications,

455
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,560
doing all of that to make it simple for the user to basically use any system, any free

456
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,080
BSD system.

457
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:58,040
Now, PCBSD is primarily geared towards people that want to install it and run it on like

458
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,760
a laptop or a desktop. Is that correct?

459
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,800
Yes, PCBSD is more desktop focused. So any of the different desktop environments, we

460
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,160
have them all available. And we just try to provide PCBSD utilities on the side for managing

461
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:15,400
the free BSD specific functions in the background like wireless and stuff because they are very

462
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,640
different from the way Linux is run.

463
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:24,720
So since the project is very different from the majority of Linux distributions, what

464
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,020
would be a reason that I would want to switch to PCBSD or maybe just give it a try and see

465
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,160
what I think of it?

466
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,320
Well, a couple of the things that come to me off the top of my head is the stability

467
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,760
of free BSD since the operating system is completely separate from all the third party

468
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,280
packages. You can add and remove things like desktop environments and utilities and really

469
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,320
configure your entire system however you want without having to worry about breaking your

470
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
system.

471
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:55,640
Another one is ZFS. We have ZFS natively on free BSD and it is fabulous. That is actually

472
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:02,200
the required file system for PCBSD. Whenever you install a PCBSD system, you are installing

473
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,120
onto ZFS.

474
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:09,140
And then with that, we have a number of ZFS functions that we use and tie in to create

475
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,120
boot environments. So whenever you are going to perform an upgrade of your system, it will

476
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,360
automatically create a boot environment in the background. And if you don't like the

477
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,400
upgrade, if something got changed like it went to a new version of an application that

478
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,800
doesn't work right, all you have to do is restart your system and say, oh, I want to

479
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,520
go back to this older boot environment and you are back to your system in less than a

480
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
minute.

481
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,680
Okay, well thanks. If somebody was interested in getting involved in the PCBSD project or

482
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,600
learning more about PCBSD, where could that person go?

483
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,840
You can go to PCBSD.org or we also have forums and a wiki and a blog, all of them just with

484
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:49,440
the prefix. So wiki.pcbsd.org, forums.pcbsd.org, blog.pcbsd.org. Any of those sites will get

485
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,200
you going and connect you to the project.

486
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,880
Outstanding. Well, thanks a lot for taking time to meet with us. We really appreciate

487
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
it.

488
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,560
Thank you very much. I thought that was a great chat. And unfortunately, maybe we'll

489
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,900
get a chance to talk to Ken about this more. Then you can get a chance to talk about that

490
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:08,640
new desktop environment that PCBSD is working on. But they make good case for running PCBSD.

491
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,440
I'm digging that update snapshot system, Matt, where it's just sort of like, hey, you updated?

492
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,640
Well, let me just create a little backup environment you could boot into. That's pretty nice. I

493
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,640
kind of want that.

494
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,040
I love that idea. I want that on everything I run.

495
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,600
I wonder if once ButterFS is a little more widely adopted, a little more mature, if you

496
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:35,400
might see distros integrating that. This is the nice thing that PCBSD has going for them

497
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,240
is they really just focus on BSD and can focus on just what BSD supports so they can unilaterally

498
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
do something like that.

499
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,440
Now, we've got one more BSD clip to get to. And I'm really glad that Noah got a chance

500
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,960
to chat with Drew. She's sort of world famous for her involvement with the FreeBSD Project

501
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,520
and other things. I believe she's also been a guest on the BSD Now podcast. So I was really

502
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,120
glad they got a chance to chat with her. So here, we'll play that clip now.

503
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,060
As if one interview with the people from the BSD Project wasn't enough, we actually have

504
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:10,840
two people here that we can talk to. And the second is Drew. Now, Drew, we were specifically

505
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,180
asked to go seek out and talk to her. We were told that she has phenomenally interesting

506
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:21,880
things to say by Alan. How's that for a set up? And so we're here with Drew today. How

507
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
are you doing today, Drew?

508
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,160
I'm doing fine. Thank you.

509
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:33,520
Tell me a little bit about what it is that you do with the BSD Project and how your role

510
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:39,120
differs a little bit from the guys at the PCBSD Project.

511
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:46,000
Yeah, so I'm involved in a lot of little pots. So my main focus is on documentation and my

512
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,280
background is in system administration. So I write the documentation for both the PCBSD

513
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:00,240
and the FreeNAS Projects. And what we do is we aim to have a comprehensive user guide

514
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,240
for every release of the operating system. So it sort of keeps me busy. I'm also involved

515
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,400
with the FreeBSD Project. So I'm one of the directors at the FreeBSD Foundation. And I

516
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:17,120
also, as I can, I try to assist in the FreeBSD Handbook. Because FreeBSD has always been

517
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:24,040
known for having very comprehensive documentation. So I try to assist with that as well. From

518
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:30,840
my system administration background, I also care about, in addition to documentation,

519
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:40,720
and ways to get future system administrators to have a good solid base and open source.

520
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:47,940
So one of the things that we founded ten years ago is the BSD Certification Group. So we

521
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:55,960
concentrate on making sure that system administrators know what skills employers are looking for

522
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:01,780
when it comes to system administration. And we focus on the BSD operating systems.

523
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:08,880
Now I asked the gentleman from the PCBSD Project what he thought the compelling argument was

524
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:16,440
to give PCBSD a try. Can you give me what comes to mind as a compelling argument to

525
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,200
give BSD a try on the backend, on the server?

526
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,000
Yeah, so if we look at it from the FreeBSD point of view, which is basically the base

527
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,920
for the projects, PCBSD for Freenas, for PF Sense, I would agree with Ken's assessment

528
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,800
that ZFS is definitely a big one. We've had ZFS for some time. It's very mature. It's

529
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,720
very stable. And both the PCBSD and the Freenas projects are building on top of that ZFS base

530
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,800
to make utilities, to make it easier to take advantage of the features built into ZFS.

531
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,840
Some of the up and coming stuff that's coming out of FreeBSD from a programming point of

532
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:08,760
view, Capsicum is a really big deal. So Capsicum is a set of APIs that make it possible to

533
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:19,120
take existing applications that were originally not designed to be secure, and you can hook,

534
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:25,480
redevelop those applications with a very small footprint to actually secure them. So Capsicum

535
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:32,440
actually came out of a project, FreeBSD was a reference based system, it's the University

536
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,700
of Cambridge and Google, and they took the Chromium web browser, and nobody could accuse

537
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:44,240
a web browser of being securely designed from the beginning, and they were able to prove

538
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:49,440
that they could secure that application in less than 100 lines of code.

539
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,680
Wow, that is impressive, especially in a web browser. If somebody was interested in finding

540
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,320
more about the server side of BSD, or getting in contact, maybe even contributing to the

541
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,720
project, how would somebody get in contact or do that?

542
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,920
So FreeBSD has been around a very long time, it's a very large project, there are several

543
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:15,160
hundred committers, dozens of people that work on documentation, hundreds of thousands

544
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:22,400
of end users, so huge project. Because of that, and because it is an operating system,

545
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,960
it really depends on which parts you're interested in. So for example, we have several dozen

546
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:34,880
mailing lists. So somebody, if they're coming in on the development side, and they're interested

547
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,240
say in writing network device drivers, there would be mailing lists that would hook you

548
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,880
into the right people to discuss that sort of thing. If you're interested in file systems,

549
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,920
or if you're a system administrator, you're interested in administration. So I would recommend

550
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,560
go to the FreeBSD website, check out the mailing lists, because one of the things you want

551
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,720
to do is you want to become familiar with who's who in the community, and you also want

552
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,840
the community to become familiar with you, what it is that you can bring to the table.

553
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:12,400
And FreeBSD has always been known as being a helpful community, but you know, you have

554
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:19,920
to really engage with the community. So we have the mailing lists, we have IRC channels,

555
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:25,640
so we really recommend don't be shy, come in, you know, and engage with the community.

556
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,600
Well, thank you so much for taking time to talk with us. We really appreciate it.

557
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:34,800
I notice she's not wearing horns. Now, okay, Q5, be honest, did their insidious niceness

558
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,600
get to you a little bit? Because now not only are they going to these Linux conventions,

559
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,680
but they're enlisting the help of Canadians who are famously nice. Are you feeling the

560
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,800
pressure to run a little BSD now?

561
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,160
Oh, yeah, they're definitely nice. And actually, let me pause you right here, because Alan

562
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,320
has been quietly listening to me talk in our community about my preferences with desktop

563
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,960
environments and how I like to manage my system and how I like to run it. So he casually one

564
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,600
day is like, Oh, you should ask Ken about the one he's designing. Okay, sure, no big

565
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,960
deal. I'll talk to him about it. So I talked to Ken about it. And I'm like, Okay, you know,

566
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,720
give me kind of rundown. He's like, Well, better yet, let me just show it to you. I'm

567
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:18,400
not going to say much. Let me say that Lumina is unbelievable. Now, now keep in mind, you

568
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,960
know, I'm puppy Linux dev. But after checking out Lumina and where it is in its current

569
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,240
alpha state, it's actually tempting me to install PCB SD on one of my laptop, but it

570
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,280
seems so crazy to have another desktop. It really was now was it sort of like, can you

571
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,680
give me his sounds like it maybe is a little bit like a tiling window manager a bit? No,

572
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:42,000
it's not. It's a you know, it's a regular. It's not a tiling window manager. But it's

573
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,280
all the little things that make workflow so much quicker. The seamless nature of how he's

574
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:54,880
worked in life preserver with ZFS is just unbelievable. Yeah, that is pretty sweet.

575
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,880
Yeah. Yeah, Ken's got some Ken's got some skills, huh? Yeah, I'll be I'll be curious

576
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,400
to follow the way that goes. So it's called Lumina. We've talked a little bit about it

577
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,640
before. There's not a lot of details yet. L-U-M-I-N-A. And he did say that it has there's

578
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,480
some distribution. It might be arch that has actually already ported it over and has it

579
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,760
as an option. But I don't know exactly what distro that is. Very nice. Somebody runs Linux

580
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:24,160
and they want to test it out. I mean, obviously, they won't get any of the ZFS features, but

581
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,560
they can at least poke around and see what it's what's how it works and what I can't

582
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:32,940
wait to try it. Hey, I could look PCB SD. Hey, hey. I mean, if it comes with a pair

583
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:38,100
of horns, well, very good. So worth a trip, you think? Is it is it something you'd recommend

584
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:44,840
folks go to next year? Absolutely. You know, thinking back, you know, kind of comparing

585
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:49,500
it to Linux Northwest, because we had a bunch of our community members there. I've never

586
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:53,280
been to either conference before. This was my first year at Northwest. This is my first

587
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,920
year at Southeast. And I know this may sound kind of cliche, but I really do mean this

588
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,640
self felt like more of an extended family. Even though I knew none of these people before

589
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,920
after that one day on Friday, I felt like I was one of them. That Southern charm is

590
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,160
what you're saying? Exactly. You know, I had a great time at Linux Northwest. And if you

591
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,520
take all the goodness that was in that conference and you add in, you know, that legendary Southern

592
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,580
hospitality, yeah, you just you have a recipe for an amazing event. What about being at

593
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:24,400
a hotel? Did that give it a weird feeling at all? Or was that work really well? Actually,

594
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,920
it worked really well. The layout and the way that they had the floor track and the

595
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,620
individual, you know, speaking rooms, everything was right there and easily accessible. So

596
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:36,320
you could easily go from, you know, when you're going around talking to different vendors,

597
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,720
seeing what they have to offer to, oh, there's a there's a talk in that room right there

598
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:43,640
that I want to go to. Yeah, it wasn't like I need to go walk off and go up a hall and

599
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:49,260
up a staircase and find what room everything was there. Everything was easy to get to.

600
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:54,300
It was just it was a great event. Very cool. Well, maybe maybe we'll have to do a live

601
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,800
stream from there next year. You never know what's possible. It's interesting to see these

602
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,500
events because, you know, they don't get a lot of coverage. There's not a lot of people

603
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:08,640
talking about them yet. They're a major event that happens in the community. And I think

604
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,160
they're you'd almost expect them to be, I don't know, dwindling, maybe becoming less

605
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:18,760
relevant with things like hangouts that are available and mumble and and everything else.

606
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,080
But in some ways, there seems to be more of them than ever. And they seem to be larger

607
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:28,680
than ever. I don't know. I think maybe people somehow have managed to realize that there

608
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,960
is actually some value in meeting in meet space somehow. I expected we would all just

609
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,040
like be staring into the monitors for the rest of for the rest of humanity. But we still

610
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,000
manage to get together from time to time. So if you go to a fest that we can't attend

611
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,440
to, we'd love to hear your report. And one of the ways you could share your experience

612
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,200
is by going to LinuxActionShow.reddit.com. Start a thread there. Why not start a thread

613
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,040
about doing a meet up? That's what Q5 did. And you can also send us an email. Go to Jupiter

614
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,320
Broadcasting dot com. Click the contact link and choose, well, send it to Linux Unplugged.

615
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,520
Choose Linux Unplugged from the dropdown. Or Linux Action Show, depending on the timing.

616
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,200
I'll leave that to your savviness. That's up to you. If you're an email ninja and think

617
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:11,120
you can time it just right, you could also choose Linux Action Show.

618
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,560
All right, guys. Well, anybody have anything to contribute before we run? I think that

619
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:19,440
was a pretty good coverage. I know Riley was thinking they were too nice. There's some

620
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,520
little off about that. Riley, are you OK? No, I'm not OK with it. There's something

621
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,040
off about it, too. I just see them in a dark room going it with their hands up.

622
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,080
Those lights flashing, those horns flashing in a dark room.

623
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,160
What you're saying is you don't trust people who are nice.

624
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:43,280
No, you know what? In some ways, they are there solving a same problem, and they just

625
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,760
think they have a better way to do it. And I think it's a bit of confidence, in a way.

626
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,240
I think it demonstrates the fact that they can show up. It's not a hostile thing. They

627
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:56,800
can share the room. It's something that's taken Microsoft a decade to figure out.

628
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:01,440
We just now saw Microsoft really start to get it at Linux Fest Northwest. But the BSD

629
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,800
guys, they're cut from the same cloth. Just maybe one that has more stitching. I don't

630
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,800
know.

631
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,760
All right. Well, we'll leave it at that. I also had a link that I wanted to chat about,

632
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,880
but I think we'll save it for the big show. But if you guys want to do a little additional

633
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:20,160
reading, I'll leave it to you. You can find it in the show notes. Go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com.

634
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,000
Look for Linux Unplugged, episode 46.

635
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,400
And also, we're putting a call out to have folks help fund our Patreon page that goes

636
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,080
in to contribute to investments in the network. Patreon.com slash today. We're trying to do

637
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,440
some crowdfunding to bring revenue up for the network, so that way we can do things

638
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:42,040
like hire contractors to resolve problems that we have, or buy some on-location equipment

639
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,200
to do some more on-location streaming like these types of events. And all of that is

640
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,800
dependent on increasing our financing. And really, there's two ways that a network like

641
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:54,280
ours can increase financing. We can add additional ads, and that's certainly something we could

642
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:59,200
consider doing. And we can also go to crowdfunding. And I believe the real answer lies somewhere

643
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,920
there in between. I think it's more about a balance and finding a mix and diversifying

644
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,360
income sources for the networks. That way, we're here for the long haul. And that's what

645
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,480
we're trying to do. So if you go over to Patreon.com slash today, you can find out more information.

646
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,520
You can pledge whatever you can afford. That money is distributed to all of the shows,

647
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:18,960
all of the profits generated there go into the network, and it's celebrated via our Tech

648
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,920
Talk Today podcast. As we reach different milestones, we have a little party in the

649
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,040
show. Like the barbecue challenge is kind of like a fun way to just celebrate in the

650
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:30,400
show. But it also means, oh, the network has achieved another level of funding, which means

651
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:37,020
we can accomplish XYZ. My big, big a-boo right now is, as the network has grown, we've greatly

652
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:40,140
increased the complexity of our technical infrastructure to the point now where there's

653
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:44,640
enough equipment that it really could take at least a part-time person coming in a couple

654
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,320
of times a week, keeping it all running. And that's why I'm constantly struggling these

655
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:52,960
days with hardware failures, because it's just, when you have this much equipment running

656
00:50:52,960 --> 00:51:00,340
24-7, things happen. And you need somebody who has really solid IT experience in networking

657
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:05,140
and storage and network-attached storage and really high-performance networking. But you

658
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:09,640
also need someone who has broadcast equipment experience, that understands about encoding,

659
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,560
about the specialized needs that a certain rig might have. And that's sort of a nexus

660
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:18,680
of talent that's extremely difficult to find and not free. But it's an example of something

661
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,480
that we have to be able to do in order to keep moving the network forward, because it

662
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,240
just is getting to that point. And the way we can do that is by knowing we have a good,

663
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,160
stable platform of funding by our audience. The folks who consume our shows can be the

664
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:37,240
folks who fund our shows. So go to patreon.com slash today. We greatly, greatly appreciate

665
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:41,980
your support. And check out Tech Talk today. In fact, join me live tomorrow. If you're

666
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:46,160
listening to this on Tuesday night, we'll be covering the Google I.O. keynote live in

667
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:52,040
Tech Talk today at 9 a.m. Pacific, noon Eastern. When that launches, you can join us in the

668
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,560
Mumble Room, our virtual lug, and comment away on the Google keynote as it happens,

669
00:51:56,560 --> 00:52:00,120
and we'll release that as a download so you guys can go catch all of the goodies that

670
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:06,520
came out of Google I.O. So that'll be tomorrow's Tech Talk today, episode 15, I believe, which

671
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:12,080
will be on June 25th as we are recording this episode. That right there, though, will wrap

672
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:17,840
us up. So go over to linuxactionshow.reddit.com, help contribute and comment, and give us your

673
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,960
thoughts, your feedback for this week's episode. We'd love to hear it. Don't forget to send

674
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,400
us an email and all those kinds of goodies. We really appreciate it. Okay, Matt, well,

675
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,420
guess what? We're all done. We can get out of here. We wrapped up our Southeast Linux

676
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:35,160
Fest coverage, and I think we're going to do some how-to stuff on Sunday. I'm going

677
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,200
to double check the calendar, but I think we're going to have a great episode on Sunday's

678
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:42,480
Linux Action Show, so I'll see you then, okay? All right, I'll see you then. Sounds good.

679
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,960
All right. Thank you, everybody, for tuning in to this week's episode of the Linux Unplugged

680
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,280
Show. We'll see you back on Sunday for Linux Action Show, and if you can't make it for

681
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,920
some reason, I won't judge, but I'd love to see you back here on Tuesday for the next episode

682
00:52:52,920 --> 00:53:21,480
of Linux Unplugged. All right, everyone, see you right back here next week.
