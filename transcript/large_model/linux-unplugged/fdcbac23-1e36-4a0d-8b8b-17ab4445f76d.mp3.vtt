WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
I have to apologize to the podcast audience.

00:03.040 --> 00:06.520
There's going to be some rain noise and maybe some thunder, although I think that's past

00:06.960 --> 00:09.280
about 15 minutes before we went on the air.

00:09.680 --> 00:14.000
I was watching a storm approach and it just got bigger and bigger.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.960
And then about 10 minutes before we went on the air,

00:15.960 --> 00:18.720
I realized it was really impacting my LTE performance.

00:18.720 --> 00:23.960
I sent Wes a message and I'm like, Wes, my LTE coverage is dropping rapidly.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.800
So Wes goes and looks up the weather map for me.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.800
He's like playing meteorologist over there.

00:29.800 --> 00:33.160
You know, when I look at it, I'm like, it's not clearing up anytime soon, is it?

00:34.160 --> 00:37.080
No. So I decide, all right, I got to get the cell booster up,

00:37.080 --> 00:40.320
see if I can't get the LTE signal back up to some sort of usable range.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.240
That way we can do the show because I'm remote.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.880
I'm in Wyoming. I have to have good connectivity.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.920
So there I am in probably one of the top 10,

00:47.920 --> 00:50.840
maybe even top five thunder and lightning storms of my life.

00:51.080 --> 00:54.440
Like an idiot, I'm climbing up the ladder on the back of my RV.

00:54.440 --> 00:58.600
Do do do with a coax cable hanging to the ground in my mouth.

00:58.600 --> 01:02.040
So that way my hands are free. Do do do climbing up the back of the RV.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.120
I wrap my arm around the ladder.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.840
So one arms around the ladder.

01:05.840 --> 01:09.040
The other arm is trying to tighten down a coax cable.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.360
The wind is nuts.

01:10.360 --> 01:13.640
My clothes are getting soaked by this crazy sideways rain.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.160
I'm up on the roof getting this thing all tight and I climb down.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.800
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.400
I'm just totally soaked head to toe.

01:19.400 --> 01:24.800
By now, I feed the wire, the coax cable into the RV in one of the slides.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.600
I just feed it in there.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.840
I go get it all hooked up, power up the cell booster,

01:27.840 --> 01:29.400
sit down, get ready to do the show.

01:29.400 --> 01:33.000
And I notice my cellular performance has not improved at all.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
I go look, random air light.

01:36.320 --> 01:40.240
I'm sitting there dripping water on the floor with a random booster air light.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.640
So I've got no LTE. I got a big storm.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.640
But you know what, Wes? The show goes on.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.320
It sure does. Can't stop it.

01:46.320 --> 02:02.800
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 254 for June 19th, 2018.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
that's live from a very stormy Casper, Wyoming.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
My name is Chris.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
My name is Wes.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.560
Hello, Mr. Payne.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.760
It is good to be connected with you over the past few days.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.280
Over the power of a somewhat shaky LTE connection,

02:19.280 --> 02:21.000
thanks to the thunder and lightning.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.400
But that doesn't prevent us from having a great show.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.040
We're going to get into some major stories

02:26.040 --> 02:29.400
that are really concerning several large open source projects.

02:29.400 --> 02:33.840
We'll talk about what's going on with Blender and their situation with YouTube.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.760
And then we'll get into a bunch of community news,

02:35.760 --> 02:40.600
including some important news for one of the important members.

02:40.600 --> 02:43.560
Important news for an important member of our community, Techstar.

02:43.560 --> 02:45.920
We have an update on his health situation.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.200
Deepen has a new release.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.440
We're doing an update to on the Librem 5,

02:49.440 --> 02:50.800
what they're working on, where they're at,

02:50.800 --> 02:55.040
some new portable hardware coming, a distro you might not have considered.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.480
And then I'll give you an update on my adventures

02:57.480 --> 03:01.720
at setting up Linux Academy with OBS running on Kubuntu 1804

03:01.840 --> 03:05.160
and migrating their live stream from a Mac to GNU slash Linux.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.480
Then we got a little segment on retro games.

03:07.920 --> 03:09.400
I've just sort of embraced it.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.360
I've decided it's time to be an old man.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.360
I'm going to love the old games.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.440
In a way that only the love games, the old games can love me.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.400
Give you an update on my Texas trip.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.720
Plus Linux desktop's usability seems to reach a peak

03:24.320 --> 03:26.800
and then they want to change everything, whoever they might be.

03:27.080 --> 03:29.440
And it all goes out the window for some new design.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.280
And often with that, a loss of usability.

03:32.480 --> 03:37.280
And a follower of the show has documented this process over and over again,

03:37.280 --> 03:42.280
going back to the original Xerox interface to the latest versions of Gnome 3.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.240
So we'll cover that as well in the show.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.760
Get a good conversation going.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.600
But Wes, before we go any further, you know, we got to bring in that mumble room.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.040
So time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

03:51.240 --> 03:53.120
Hello. Hello.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.480
Good evening. Hello, everybody.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.520
It's super good to be connected with you.

03:57.520 --> 04:01.920
As I was I was driving yesterday for 10 hours and I literally had the thought,

04:02.240 --> 04:05.240
you know, tomorrow I'm going to be sitting down, just hanging out with my buddies.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.240
Like today's kind of a grindy day.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.680
But tomorrow, tomorrow we get to hang out.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.760
So thank you, everybody, for being here. I really appreciate it.

04:11.760 --> 04:12.720
I've been looking forward to it.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.920
That's what got me through driving nonstop yesterday.

04:16.400 --> 04:17.880
But we'll talk more about that later.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.600
Let's get into some of the news that's going on.

04:19.600 --> 04:24.320
It's impacting the community and one that's got Blender Project upset.

04:24.320 --> 04:28.680
The MIT courseware that's open is been been screwed around with.

04:28.680 --> 04:32.720
And it all is kind of building towards my concerns around Article 13.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.080
So that's a lot of stuff I just laid on you.

04:35.080 --> 04:37.480
Let's start with the bigger picture stuff.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.280
YouTube. It's an ongoing issue.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.120
And the centralization of services.

04:42.120 --> 04:46.480
We've been constantly reminded of the limitations that open source

04:46.480 --> 04:49.280
and free software projects run into when they use centralized services

04:49.280 --> 04:52.480
like Slack, like GitHub and like YouTube.

04:53.400 --> 04:57.560
And several popular YouTuber accounts, including the MIT OpenCourseWare account

04:57.840 --> 05:01.480
and the Blender Foundation's accounts have had all of their videos blocked.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.600
Channels just been screwed with completely by YouTube.

05:05.120 --> 05:09.920
And in a little bit of irony, too, the MIT courseware stuff

05:09.920 --> 05:13.640
has been taken down because it contains content from MIT,

05:14.080 --> 05:16.120
according to the YouTube video. Have you seen this, Wes?

05:16.120 --> 05:18.800
Yeah, it seems. Oh, man, I don't know.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.200
It's very frustrating.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.080
I'm still trying to catch up on all that's happened because a lot has happened

05:23.080 --> 05:24.560
kind of quickly.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.880
But just the fact that there's so many blocked videos,

05:26.880 --> 05:30.360
that the centralization of this platform is once again so highlighted.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.240
I just want to watch local media.

05:32.240 --> 05:34.320
Yeah, I know, right? Yeah.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.360
So the MIT one isn't an isolated incident either.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.200
There's other organizations that have been blocked by their own content.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.160
I once got a copyright flag on my own voice.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.840
You know, when I do the introductions, I do them for Koda Radio.

05:46.840 --> 05:50.040
I go, this is Koda Radio, episode 283.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.120
Yes. Yes.

05:52.120 --> 05:56.120
They flagged my own voice once on YouTube claiming that it was owned by somebody else

05:56.320 --> 05:57.600
because it's just some scripts, right?

05:57.600 --> 05:59.960
They're listening to the audio waveforms, doing matching.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.320
It's kind of it's not as advanced as we like to think it is.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.840
And that's how Blender is getting screwed.

06:05.840 --> 06:07.520
No, right. Absolutely not.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.360
It has so much data to churn through.

06:09.360 --> 06:14.120
And it's really just a simple, somewhat simple fingerprinting procedure.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.680
So there's very much limits.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.640
And unfortunately, we hit them all the time.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.760
And you can thank Facebook for all of this.

06:20.080 --> 06:24.480
I think also, though, the YouTube like Python scripts to do content ID matching.

06:24.520 --> 06:28.080
Didn't it really start with the Viacom lawsuit against YouTube before Google bought them?

06:28.200 --> 06:34.960
Sure. But no other company has promoted more responsibility of the

06:34.960 --> 06:38.560
platform to monitor uploads than Facebook.

06:39.160 --> 06:45.160
And now there are even actual very concrete proposals waiting to be voted on, especially

06:45.160 --> 06:52.080
in the EU side on actually making it Google, for example, responsible for the content

06:52.400 --> 06:57.400
and to require automated tools to exist so that content can be removed within an hour.

06:57.400 --> 07:03.880
Right. So if they like any any corporation, like they already had content ID because it

07:03.880 --> 07:07.160
was for the music association to get out of their ass.

07:08.040 --> 07:13.200
Now they have another incentive to try to make sure the algorithms are acting as fast

07:13.200 --> 07:18.600
as possible. And as a consequence, we're seeing now open source projects to be mostly

07:18.600 --> 07:22.840
affected because those were the ones that usually had more loose policies.

07:23.560 --> 07:28.200
I think it's just a natural consequence of the political environment at the moment.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.480
Yes, I think you've nailed it there.

07:30.480 --> 07:33.280
And Blender is taking matters into their own hands.

07:33.280 --> 07:37.520
They've launched a video Blender dot org, which is peer to it's just a test at this

07:37.520 --> 07:41.080
point. But it's peer to which is a peer to peer video distribution platform.

07:41.320 --> 07:43.600
I tried it doesn't work as well for me.

07:43.800 --> 07:47.840
Blender thinks that this is something to do with the monetization strategies at YouTube

07:48.120 --> 07:52.000
because they've never since 2008 tried to monetize their YouTube channel.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.880
But it keeps getting turned on for them and they keep going and turning it off.

07:56.160 --> 08:00.720
Who knows? But I think what what you say, Dar, is the bigger point here is people are

08:00.720 --> 08:06.960
really upset about if we cauterize all this with with legal ease and we essentially take

08:06.960 --> 08:11.160
the YouTube problem, which I just mentioned, and we apply it to the entire Internet where

08:11.160 --> 08:16.080
you're supposed to for every GitHub documentation submission that has a screenshot.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.120
You need to have somebody review that there.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.880
It gets it just gets completely unscalable.

08:21.160 --> 08:25.880
And several different projects are raising a red flag about Article 13.

08:26.240 --> 08:28.200
And UbiPorts is one of them.

08:28.200 --> 08:31.720
They say, Dear UbiPorts supporters, the freedom to develop software collaboratively

08:31.720 --> 08:37.560
online is at serious risk by an article included on the current proposal for copyright

08:37.560 --> 08:39.400
reform in the European Union.

08:39.640 --> 08:46.080
The specific proposal known as Article 13, which just a side note, sounds like something

08:46.080 --> 08:51.640
out of 1984, imposes mandatory upload filters on online platforms that share, quote,

08:51.680 --> 08:54.440
large amounts of user generated content.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.480
Large amounts is not clearly defined. So that's red flag number one.

08:58.800 --> 09:04.280
And it could be as many as 500 pieces of arts, 500 songs, 500 programs, 500 units of any

09:04.280 --> 09:06.680
work that could be legally protected by copyright.

09:07.720 --> 09:12.240
This is extremely concerning, and it's not just UbiPorts is raising this red flag.

09:12.280 --> 09:18.280
The Free Software Foundation over on their website says free software is under attack

09:18.480 --> 09:19.880
within the European Union.

09:19.880 --> 09:25.840
The proposed European Copyright Directive poses a great risk for free software and its

09:25.840 --> 09:31.200
development. The Legal Affairs Committee of the European Parliament will be voting June

09:31.240 --> 09:38.880
20th and 21st on whether or not to continue to allow us, as in the free software

09:38.880 --> 09:41.880
community, to build software online together.

09:42.360 --> 09:47.840
So one of the situations I say is don't, like for, especially for open source projects

09:47.840 --> 09:54.280
listening, don't flunk out of the platforms just yet, because then they will say, see,

09:54.280 --> 09:55.520
you have an alternative.

09:56.200 --> 10:02.240
Use your voice to actually make your argument against the Article 13.

10:03.080 --> 10:08.880
There is a, the EU is actually doing a public consultation and you can, I will provide the

10:08.880 --> 10:10.320
link if you guys want.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.280
Yes, please. I'll drop in the show notes.

10:12.280 --> 10:18.920
That you can participate and basically just answer, say your piece and it's going to

10:18.920 --> 10:23.520
matter. Even if you're not the local business, even if you're not in the EU, it will

10:23.520 --> 10:24.040
matter.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.120
Yeah, I will definitely put that in the show notes.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.720
It's also more than just the 13th Article, the three in Lebanon are also terrible.

10:29.880 --> 10:33.600
Yeah, and I don't understand them as much, but it sounds like it could actually impact

10:33.600 --> 10:35.640
people that are just sharing news articles and whatnot.

10:35.640 --> 10:36.560
What's your understanding?

10:36.600 --> 10:38.720
It doesn't have any correlation to fair use.

10:38.720 --> 10:43.280
So there's, so even if you do something legally in the fair use concept, the European

10:43.280 --> 10:49.000
change, copyright reform would ignore all of that and still say that you're violating

10:49.000 --> 10:53.440
it. And there's other cases where if someone provides a service that you display that

10:53.440 --> 10:59.920
service or let's say, for example, you take a Twitter, like a tweet from Twitter and you

10:59.920 --> 11:04.760
use the embed thing where you display it directly from the Twitter embed code and then

11:04.760 --> 11:08.920
you load it on your website, you're violating the copyright reform of Article 11 at that

11:08.920 --> 11:09.120
point.

11:09.160 --> 11:14.440
Right. And they're trying to essentially protect the journalists and say, you have to

11:14.440 --> 11:16.120
go to the source to get the information.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.600
So therefore they'll stay alive.

11:17.600 --> 11:20.160
They'll stay in business because everybody forced to go to the source.

11:20.320 --> 11:21.160
What are your thoughts, Dar?

11:21.360 --> 11:24.520
No, no, they explicitly put a tax on it, too.

11:24.520 --> 11:28.880
Actually, it's not just forcing you to go to the source.

11:28.880 --> 11:33.240
They the ancillary link that that's what they call it, essentially.

11:33.240 --> 11:37.040
It says that if you include a snippet, it's not so much the link, but if the link brings

11:37.040 --> 11:43.480
a snippet over, that snippet requires a license before you can actually present it.

11:43.960 --> 11:48.240
So platforms that like Google News would essentially have to pay a tax.

11:48.360 --> 11:51.920
What about my show notes where I link to a story and I include like a preview of the

11:51.920 --> 11:53.960
article in there? Like maybe I even embed like a quote.

11:54.320 --> 11:59.760
If you embed that quote, then again, if this place that you're gathering this information

11:59.760 --> 12:04.440
from is a news outlet, because this is very specific to news outlets, it doesn't go and

12:04.440 --> 12:06.000
say, hey, your blog or something.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.600
It goes like into a news agency.

12:09.240 --> 12:13.320
So that is actually the bigger problem, because it's also making distinction between

12:14.520 --> 12:21.000
copyright of some individuals versus other individuals, which is actually probably illegal.

12:21.040 --> 12:27.040
But curiously enough, because you're then you're discriminating against citizens,

12:27.040 --> 12:32.640
different types of citizens. But essentially, the end result is still news organizations

12:32.640 --> 12:35.760
would be able to get these licensing benefits.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.040
At least that's what their their intent is.

12:38.040 --> 12:42.200
And when it comes to the other measure that they want to pass through, which is what we

12:42.200 --> 12:47.480
already talked to Article 13, like fair use right now is not standard across the EU, which

12:47.480 --> 12:51.800
is one of the reasons to bring these actually copyright reform overall.

12:51.800 --> 12:56.320
We're losing out in some countries and in some countries, people are actually gaining.

12:56.320 --> 13:06.040
So even though it feels very negative, when we look at from technical point of view, it

13:06.040 --> 13:10.680
is easy to see why there's actually still some support for these reform.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.880
Some countries don't even allow you to take a picture of a building.

13:14.280 --> 13:19.800
And also the parliament in the UK don't allow you to use any content that's not

13:19.800 --> 13:22.920
to use any content that's for satire.

13:23.240 --> 13:29.080
Like there's all kinds of different things that are violating fair use, the idea of fair

13:29.080 --> 13:37.400
fair use. But there's this that one individual thing is there's so many things wrong

13:37.400 --> 13:44.120
with this, this reform that not there's so many things that break the idea of any kind

13:44.120 --> 13:50.560
of fair use in trade that it makes it where most of these services are just trying to

13:50.560 --> 13:52.160
make as much money as possible.

13:52.400 --> 13:57.440
And so they like, for example, the not being able to have to pay a tax or a license to

13:57.960 --> 13:59.280
display content on your website.

13:59.280 --> 14:05.920
It's so these news organizations that can't somehow figure out how to stay relevant, they

14:05.920 --> 14:10.160
can force people to if they use their content that they have to go that they have to pay

14:10.160 --> 14:11.640
them to use it or don't use it.

14:11.640 --> 14:16.680
So that is really, I think, devastatingly awful to those of us in the states.

14:16.680 --> 14:20.680
But Dar brings up a good point that outside the states, there are some countries where

14:20.680 --> 14:22.120
aspects of this are an improvement.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.080
So I want to move forward in this conversation, keeping that in mind.

14:25.360 --> 14:30.400
But talking specifically about Article 13, this this seems to be the where it really

14:30.400 --> 14:34.720
goes off the rails because you reports other aspects, Article three and those aspects,

14:34.720 --> 14:37.280
maybe maybe there is some merit to that to that argument.

14:37.280 --> 14:43.480
But Article 13 of this whole copyright reform seems really to be where the damning bit that

14:43.480 --> 14:47.600
the Internet's freaking out about is you report says that it's going to totally screw over

14:47.600 --> 14:51.840
Launchpad and GitHub for them and that all user generated content on those platforms

14:51.840 --> 14:56.560
will have to be reviewed at the time of submission and will have to be if it isn't found in

14:56.560 --> 15:00.520
violation or potentially in violation removed instantly.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.040
Yes, that doesn't seem possible.

15:03.040 --> 15:07.400
Like the bigger companies could could maybe you could argue that big companies could sustain

15:07.400 --> 15:11.560
that. But smaller like open source project would be impossible to review any code like

15:11.560 --> 15:11.800
that.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.760
I completely agree.

15:14.240 --> 15:20.400
And not only that, if you actually zoom out a little bit and see what a lot of you

15:20.400 --> 15:26.320
countries are attempting to try to do, they like France and Spain, even a couple of a

15:26.320 --> 15:27.800
couple of countries basically did it.

15:27.800 --> 15:33.480
They've set up what they call A.I. incentive programs for companies to open their A.I.

15:33.480 --> 15:36.960
incentives. To be honest, this is no brainer.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.120
You open an A.I.

15:38.120 --> 15:42.560
center in tax incentive for companies to bring their development to your country.

15:43.040 --> 15:46.320
Then you make it so that it's actually required to use A.I.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.240
services like upload filters.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.880
And there you go.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.720
The economy booms there, not elsewhere.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.560
Yeah, this is no brainer what these countries are actually the countries that are pushing

15:57.560 --> 16:01.520
more for this vision are the countries that did investments to make tax benefits and tax

16:01.520 --> 16:03.200
cuts for setting A.I.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.400
research centers in their country.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.120
Now, from my very U.S.

16:06.120 --> 16:11.560
centric point of view, admittedly, it feels like the EU keeps screwing up my Internet.

16:11.560 --> 16:17.520
So first of all, can I just say I still am angry about all of those notices about cookies.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.720
I don't care if I care about cookies.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.280
I'm taking care of it via other means.

16:21.560 --> 16:25.080
I am so sick and tired of clearing those messages.

16:25.080 --> 16:28.440
This just this week, I finally started actually clearing them out instead of just leaving

16:28.440 --> 16:30.120
them up in protest, wrecking the website.

16:30.840 --> 16:35.320
And then we have GDPR, which is as a business owner has made my life a little bit more

16:35.320 --> 16:41.000
complicated. And now Article 13 is coming down, which gives me once again the heebie

16:41.000 --> 16:43.160
jeebies. Am I am I wrong here, Wes?

16:43.160 --> 16:47.840
But don't you feel like that we're starting to really run up against the edges of traditional

16:47.840 --> 16:50.640
laws and borders and having them applied to the Internet?

16:50.880 --> 16:54.320
It feels like the only reason why this stuff has any chance of being successful is because

16:54.320 --> 16:55.680
of the size of the EU.

16:55.880 --> 17:00.520
If this was some small, tiny little nation, if North Korea was doing all of this, nobody

17:00.520 --> 17:01.520
would give any craps.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.560
Hang on.

17:05.120 --> 17:06.680
Hang on just a minute.

17:06.680 --> 17:10.160
Because it feels like it feels like you guys are wrecking my Internet, to be honest with

17:10.160 --> 17:11.040
you. You're wrecking my net.

17:11.040 --> 17:18.040
So when the US go round hoovering up people for DMCA, DMCA violations outside their

17:18.040 --> 17:20.040
borders, that's fine and dandy.

17:20.120 --> 17:23.600
But when we try to implement laws that protect users, that's bad.

17:23.600 --> 17:26.680
Right. No, I mean, you know, yeah, right.

17:26.680 --> 17:31.680
Exactly. Like there is a place for the GDPR data protections and especially just giving

17:31.680 --> 17:33.960
users control over how their data is stored, that kind of things.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
If it's stored, I'm kind of actually for that.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.280
Not actually against it. But the cookie stuff really getting old.

17:39.320 --> 17:42.920
It's like, it's like what it feels like is old people that don't know how the Internet

17:42.920 --> 17:45.600
are working or making laws about the Internet that affects everyone.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.680
Right. And that's not to give them control.

17:48.680 --> 17:54.840
It's to show them what people are collecting about them.

17:55.280 --> 17:59.480
And to make this aware is a good step, in my opinion.

17:59.800 --> 18:04.560
Except it doesn't go too far in which way they proved by when they when they within the

18:04.560 --> 18:09.400
first week of the GDPR becoming in effect, there is like thirty five thousand requests

18:09.400 --> 18:13.680
for removal from Google and various search engines from government officials in the EU.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.840
Oh, my God. Thirty five thousand.

18:17.840 --> 18:24.360
Yeah. There was a variety of countries of all levels of their governments.

18:24.840 --> 18:30.520
Like it was it was the most blatant, obvious usage of it was coming down immediately.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.560
It does seem like it's a problem of scale in many ways there, right?

18:33.560 --> 18:35.560
Like where a lot of these laws, there are intent.

18:35.600 --> 18:39.440
And in the like what you were saying to the to the nature of the Internet, but the you

18:39.440 --> 18:44.000
know, the economic and political impacts of the Internet have grown a lot and maybe the

18:44.000 --> 18:45.880
ways we interact with it haven't.

18:45.880 --> 18:49.720
And so a lot of the intent here maybe makes sense because there are these very large

18:49.720 --> 18:55.320
corporations that do have nation level impact, but it just they are not well crafted enough

18:55.320 --> 18:58.600
to scale down to the individual contributors that make up the parts of the Internet.

18:58.600 --> 18:59.600
We value a lot.

18:59.760 --> 19:01.560
That's true. Nation scale impact.

19:01.560 --> 19:05.920
That's a good way to put it. I do have an extremely positive side note on all of these

19:05.920 --> 19:11.320
debate. So one of the situations that has been complained about is ability to link and

19:11.320 --> 19:15.440
basically to deal with content online.

19:15.440 --> 19:23.000
These changes made it so that it is actually harder to have people like Snowden whistle

19:23.000 --> 19:29.080
blowers. And because of these high criticism generated in parliament about the inability

19:29.080 --> 19:34.640
to have whistle blowers, actually, there is now a whistle blowers protection legislation

19:34.640 --> 19:38.080
coming through because of these debates.

19:38.080 --> 19:43.360
So there has been reticence all over because different countries have different policies

19:43.360 --> 19:49.200
of what it should entitle you to be a whistle blower and making an EU makes it applicable

19:49.200 --> 19:52.960
to the 27 remaining member states.

19:53.760 --> 20:02.520
And when you look at that, you actually see a greater point that they are aware of the

20:02.520 --> 20:04.200
limitations being placed.

20:04.200 --> 20:09.720
So now we just have to say that they will not be elected and we'll try our best to put

20:09.720 --> 20:15.440
it down so that they don't pass it because they are aware if they weren't aware, they

20:15.440 --> 20:20.320
wouldn't debate the need of having now better whistleblower protections because it would

20:20.320 --> 20:21.920
be harder to expose things.

20:22.400 --> 20:27.360
Right. Because when you release a piece of information that is private to an organization,

20:27.920 --> 20:30.440
it will be filtered out by an upload filter.

20:30.440 --> 20:35.000
Right. So ultimately, making yourself becoming a whistleblower is kind of impossible then.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.800
Oh, that is really, really creepy.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.880
Popey, did you want to jump in?

20:37.880 --> 20:40.360
Because I know we kind of just went off on a couple of rabbit holes here.

20:40.360 --> 20:45.040
Did you want to follow up on my whole you guys are recommending it or I've calmed down.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.040
It's fine.

20:47.560 --> 20:51.840
And just to be clear, I don't think anybody here would be happy to defend the DMCA.

20:51.840 --> 20:55.080
No, no. And I wasn't defending GDPR either.

20:55.360 --> 20:56.760
I'm not. I'm not defending it.

20:56.760 --> 21:01.240
I agree with Chris that it was a law implemented by old people who don't understand the Internet.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.000
Right. I get I get that.

21:03.480 --> 21:11.640
But you can't use it as an excuse for why we're all terrible people when other people

21:11.640 --> 21:14.280
around the world do exactly the same kind of thing and they get off scot-free.

21:14.560 --> 21:18.000
Yeah, fair enough. And I got to remember, too, to be nice to old people, because not

21:18.000 --> 21:22.800
only am I quickly becoming one, but I met a ninety three year old listener, I believe

21:22.800 --> 21:24.280
it was at Texas Linux Fest.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.280
That's incredible. Yeah.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.480
Yeah. So I got to remember to be nice.

21:27.480 --> 21:31.440
But now you can get paid for your data because that's a positive thing with GDPR.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.760
You know, I'll take it.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.520
You know, maybe I could just start selling my you know, that could be a good way to make

21:37.520 --> 21:38.520
revenue.

21:38.520 --> 21:41.600
And there's actually definitely a couple of new advantages.

21:41.600 --> 21:46.240
So, for example, right now, if you let's say a speed ticket, you can't actually use the

21:46.240 --> 21:49.960
camera footage to prove that you had, for example, an alibi.

21:49.960 --> 21:53.960
But because the data is yours, you actually have a right to that data.

21:53.960 --> 21:57.920
To request it and to have it, and therefore you can use it, for example, to prove that

21:57.920 --> 22:00.640
you are in a different place in case of a false accusation.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.520
This is just an example of what actually GDPR does for you.

22:05.000 --> 22:10.080
It goes even further. Like you're talking about, for example, how your credit score

22:10.080 --> 22:14.640
gets evaluated because GDPR doesn't cover just your data, but data related about you.

22:14.880 --> 22:19.200
Ultimately, you have to make the question of, all right, if you go to your bank and

22:19.200 --> 22:22.960
say, hey, give me all the data that you have on me, they will have to give you all the

22:22.960 --> 22:27.200
data that you have on me. They will have to basically show you how they are using your

22:27.200 --> 22:29.600
data to evaluate your actual credit score.

22:29.800 --> 22:34.040
And as a consequence, it disambiguates lots of services that are around data.

22:34.600 --> 22:38.680
I think that's a positive thing, because oftentimes algorithms nowadays make decisions

22:39.480 --> 22:40.480
that affect your life.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.960
You kind of want to know how that happens.

22:43.280 --> 22:48.800
In a way, you could also think about this is this could be like a good thing to as far

22:48.800 --> 22:54.960
as it is stops people from forcing like asking for data they don't need because they're

22:54.960 --> 22:57.520
too afraid to like to just store it.

22:57.520 --> 23:02.000
They don't they don't have it. So they'll disable things like the New York Times or

23:02.000 --> 23:06.480
some other news organizations would disable JavaScript entirely so they didn't have to

23:06.480 --> 23:07.480
deal with it anymore.

23:07.480 --> 23:12.280
I've really enjoyed the reduction in spam email that's come my way over the last few

23:12.280 --> 23:13.440
weeks. That's been quite nice.

23:13.880 --> 23:18.240
But also, don't forget that the US have just as many ways to screw up the Internet as the

23:18.240 --> 23:19.840
EU do. You've got SOPA.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.280
You've got net neutrality.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.880
You've got SOPA didn't pass.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.880
PIPA didn't pass.

23:23.960 --> 23:25.720
No, but they could have done.

23:25.720 --> 23:26.720
That's the point.

23:26.720 --> 23:28.880
Net neutrality was good and it's been removed.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.800
And that's true. That is that is that is going to be a problem.

23:31.960 --> 23:32.960
Yeah, that's a fair point.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.600
Yeah, it's you're right.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.440
The US has their everybody really that has any major influence.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.400
It's what you do when you have the influence.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.400
Right. Yeah. Yeah.

23:41.960 --> 23:44.720
So another influence in our community has been Techstar.

23:44.720 --> 23:48.240
He is the guy that made PC Linux OS.

23:48.240 --> 23:52.560
I've been following PC Linux OS since I was a Mandrake user way back in the day.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.560
It's been a long, long journey.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.320
And I have some bad news.

23:56.320 --> 24:02.720
I just wanted to make you guys aware of it and maybe you can send well wishes or do

24:02.720 --> 24:03.720
whatever you do.

24:04.160 --> 24:08.080
It looks like Techstar is facing the end of a battle with cancer.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.920
And he posted on their forum that he doesn't think he's going to be around much longer.

24:11.920 --> 24:18.440
And that is super sad to see because Techstar was one of these individuals who was an early

24:18.440 --> 24:23.200
pioneer in creating a really user friendly Linux desktop operating system.

24:23.680 --> 24:26.560
And he's had he's held strong opinions.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.560
He's been a really unique individual in the community.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.040
And he's somebody Texas, somebody I've followed for a long time.

24:31.040 --> 24:34.400
And when I saw this announcement, I wasn't I know I just wasn't prepared for it.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.640
I was in Texas at the time, too.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.280
So I know. Yes.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.920
Serious is, by the way, she says she says she doesn't understand.

24:39.920 --> 24:42.240
I just want you guys to know that Siri just let me know that she doesn't understand why

24:42.240 --> 24:45.600
Techstar is is losing his battle with cancer.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.480
And I don't like to cover down or stories like this, but it is.

24:48.480 --> 24:51.760
And it's something I think people need to be made aware of.

24:52.800 --> 24:58.080
And we can get into a bus factor and small distribution debates in the future.

24:58.400 --> 25:05.360
But for now, the show's best wishes to Techstar, his family and the PC Linux OS community.

25:05.360 --> 25:06.640
I'll have a link in the show notes.

25:06.640 --> 25:09.440
If you guys want to see that, or if maybe you want to go in and jump in if you've been

25:09.440 --> 25:11.120
a member of the community and leave your comments.

25:11.120 --> 25:14.640
I think there's probably not much to add, but our thoughts are with them.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.840
And it's super sad.

25:15.840 --> 25:18.720
And, man, cancer sucks.

25:18.720 --> 25:23.280
Cancer just like talk about something that has taken some great people.

25:23.280 --> 25:23.760
Absolutely.

25:25.760 --> 25:28.800
Yeah, so that'll be links in the show notes.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.800
If you guys want to read his words and maybe leave a message in the form.

25:32.800 --> 25:36.560
Let's talk about Deepin for a moment, something that we don't get a chance to talk about very

25:36.560 --> 25:37.120
much on the show.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.880
Deepin 15.6 was released.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.400
It's got a new app launcher.

25:40.400 --> 25:44.400
And if you don't remember, one of the things that is sort of unique about Deepin is their

25:44.400 --> 25:48.880
own custom desktop and well, quote unquote, custom, their own unique desktop environment

25:48.880 --> 25:51.360
with a new efficient launcher that's all based on Qt.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.560
It's a little more modeled off of Windows 7, I would say, the launcher.

25:54.560 --> 25:58.560
If I were to give it a description, if it's like a start menu, you click it, you get your

25:58.560 --> 26:00.160
most favorite apps on there.

26:00.160 --> 26:04.560
Left side, then you get computer, document, videos, music, pictures, downloads and the

26:04.560 --> 26:06.080
clock on the right side.

26:06.080 --> 26:10.320
It's a more traditional style launcher and it's a nice update.

26:10.320 --> 26:13.760
There's a new welcome app as well, sort of reminiscent of Monte welcome.

26:14.400 --> 26:18.400
Does anybody in the in the Mumble room that knows better than I remember what distribution

26:18.400 --> 26:22.080
deepens based off of or or what the desktop environment is based off?

26:22.080 --> 26:24.560
Yes, Debbie and they used to be a bunch of them.

26:24.560 --> 26:27.440
They're Debbie and and they're their devs environment is their own.

26:27.440 --> 26:30.240
The deep and desktop environment. What are our thoughts on this?

26:30.240 --> 26:33.120
Um, doesn't seem like it gets much attention because I think it's the largest audience

26:33.120 --> 26:38.800
is outside the US, but they say their claim is sort of expect the simplicity of Gnome

26:38.800 --> 26:47.280
Shell and maybe Budgie and but Qt, you know, like Qt underneath that does sound appealing

26:47.280 --> 26:50.720
to, but I think a lot of what you've talked about previously on the show.

26:50.720 --> 26:55.440
I am downloading it now because it seems like they have caught on to the concept of

26:55.440 --> 26:58.000
it seems like they have caught on to the zeitgeist.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.280
I can't speak to it because I haven't really tried this release, but I will.

27:01.280 --> 27:04.960
They're very friendly every time you talk with the devs and they generally fix the stuff

27:04.960 --> 27:05.760
you complain about.

27:06.720 --> 27:13.040
I had that experience, but also weirdly enough, every time I go to IRC to talk with them,

27:13.040 --> 27:18.000
I get a huge influx, an increase of influx of spam from China.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.920
That may be just a coincidence.

27:19.920 --> 27:26.000
Um, the also the other thing is I guess maybe why people are reluctant to actually use it

27:26.000 --> 27:30.880
as a daily driver, even though there's, you know, technically it's being open source

27:30.880 --> 27:36.400
and we can check it is that the power that Chinese government has on Chinese companies

27:36.400 --> 27:39.200
or whatever organization runs on China.

27:39.760 --> 27:43.600
That generally I think would be their biggest bottleneck, right?

27:43.600 --> 27:45.280
The elephant in the room always.

27:45.280 --> 27:50.080
They did announce that they did have contracts with in some ways with the government.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.200
That makes it even worse.

27:51.200 --> 27:56.240
Like I guess it will work well for their market because all right, people already are using

27:56.240 --> 27:57.520
the system, right?

27:57.520 --> 28:00.720
And are already bound to the same legislation.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.080
So I guess it makes sense.

28:02.080 --> 28:06.960
Like if you're using it's like we understand, you know, Google is going to be a friend of

28:06.960 --> 28:12.880
NSA and so Microsoft, we understand that and we're generally okay because we have that

28:12.880 --> 28:17.840
same regulatory environment in every other company that operates in our territory.

28:17.840 --> 28:23.040
So for them might be okay, but for us it feels like, okay, this is a party we don't really

28:23.040 --> 28:24.080
go with.

28:24.080 --> 28:24.800
Good points.

28:24.800 --> 28:25.280
Good points.

28:25.280 --> 28:26.240
Dar, you're on fire today.

28:26.800 --> 28:30.560
I wasn't going to say it for some reason, but I agree that is that was the elephant

28:30.560 --> 28:31.040
in the room.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.000
I don't know why I just felt like it was inappropriate to bring it up.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.080
So I'm glad that you said something.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.040
What do you think, Michael?

28:37.040 --> 28:40.960
It is interesting and it definitely has to be said because it's just it just is what

28:40.960 --> 28:44.480
it is, but there's no there's no evidence that there's they're doing anything wrong

28:44.480 --> 28:46.320
as far as tracking information or anything.

28:46.320 --> 28:50.800
There's been multiple attempts to show like to test to see if there's any like spyware

28:50.800 --> 28:51.520
or anything.

28:51.520 --> 28:56.320
And while there are some things that are somewhat sketchy, none of it's technically any kind

28:56.320 --> 28:57.040
of spyware.

28:57.040 --> 29:01.200
So as far as me, the reason why I don't use it is because it doesn't have plasma.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.320
And that was an easy choice.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.080
Boom, right there.

29:04.080 --> 29:10.000
And funny enough, we probably have higher scrutiny for Deepin because just sort of where

29:10.000 --> 29:13.840
they are based and we actually check more than stuff done in our own region.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.720
But, you know, people are biased and isn't that funny?

29:16.720 --> 29:17.360
You're so right.

29:17.360 --> 29:18.000
You're so right.

29:18.640 --> 29:22.160
We should be we should be much more critical of stuff coming out of the US really than

29:22.160 --> 29:23.040
we are.

29:23.040 --> 29:24.640
So all fair points around.

29:24.640 --> 29:28.560
I want to talk to Wimpy in a moment about his his new NUC.

29:28.560 --> 29:33.600
But before we go there, how about just a super brief update on the progress of the Librem

29:33.600 --> 29:34.080
five?

29:34.080 --> 29:39.760
It's something we've been tracking fairly steadily on Linux Action News, but we've kind

29:39.760 --> 29:44.480
of had a few smaller developments that don't quite rank moving up to Linux Action News.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.400
So I thought I'd just bust them out here for you.

29:46.400 --> 29:52.320
First of all, in case you didn't know or forgot, it is a Wayland stack on the Librem five and

29:52.320 --> 29:53.840
they're continuing to work on that.

29:53.840 --> 29:59.120
They've been testing the vibrators in that thing, chargers and the usability improvements

29:59.120 --> 30:00.400
to their posh phone shell.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.760
Posh is the name and they say it's running on top of Wayland now.

30:03.760 --> 30:07.840
They've had some lock screen improvements, arrow widgets were added to the library for

30:07.840 --> 30:10.560
swiping, et cetera, so you can get a little overlay.

30:10.560 --> 30:14.800
They're continuing to work on their back end GTK three calling application that their

30:14.800 --> 30:16.720
dialer application that they call calls.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.080
Clever.

30:18.080 --> 30:22.240
And on the hardware front, they continue evaluating components like the Wi-Fi module.

30:22.240 --> 30:23.680
Still an evaluation right now.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.520
Vibration motors and battery charges.

30:26.320 --> 30:29.200
You got to test some of that stuff, make sure it's the right stuff, especially battery

30:29.200 --> 30:30.320
chargers, I would imagine.

30:30.320 --> 30:33.920
And they're also exploring camera options still for the Librem five.

30:33.920 --> 30:39.840
And I think like all of the previous outreaches, it's really top notch.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.040
Purism has a great blog where they're really keeping everybody up to date and all this

30:43.040 --> 30:43.440
kind of stuff.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.000
They're working hard, I would imagine.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.160
Having been inside companies, they're trying to expose the great work that's happening

30:50.160 --> 30:50.960
to the blog.

30:50.960 --> 30:56.320
It can be a long process and I really commend them for doing that because I love watching

30:56.320 --> 30:57.600
how they're building this thing.

30:57.600 --> 31:01.120
Looking at the prototype stuff that they're doing and the fact that you can get a prototype

31:01.120 --> 31:06.000
sent to you and stuff like that, it's just so cool that there's people now doing videos

31:06.000 --> 31:11.760
of them testing stuff, showing the plasma mobile working on the prototype builds and

31:11.760 --> 31:12.320
stuff like that.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.760
It's very cool to see.

31:13.760 --> 31:17.280
I was under the impression that the plasma mobile folks hadn't got Librem five test

31:17.280 --> 31:17.840
hardware yet.

31:17.840 --> 31:18.720
Although they don't have it.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.880
The Librem Purism is doing it.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.400
The plasma mobile people are getting prototypes.

31:24.400 --> 31:28.160
But the fact that they're showing that plasma mobile is working on their current prototypes

31:28.160 --> 31:32.720
that Purism themselves are doing it to show that it is functional.

31:32.720 --> 31:33.760
That's very cool.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.320
Yeah.

31:34.320 --> 31:38.320
So I think a couple other folks are still waiting to get their test hardware yet.

31:38.320 --> 31:40.880
But maybe they're not there yet.

31:41.600 --> 31:47.760
And it also sounds like Michael Larabell over at Ferronix has noted that they're using

31:47.760 --> 31:49.600
a secondary processor.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.440
So one processor is not good enough, Wes.

31:51.440 --> 31:55.680
They're going to have two processors and it really comes down to the binary blobs.

31:55.680 --> 31:56.640
Did you catch this?

31:56.640 --> 31:56.880
Yeah.

31:56.880 --> 31:57.360
It's interesting.

31:57.360 --> 31:59.440
Well, Chris, your freedom is important, right?

31:59.440 --> 32:03.840
And if that's kind of the whole point of what you're trying to do, it's interesting to see

32:03.840 --> 32:08.800
them taking this rather maybe serious approach and just not have to deal with that.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.400
Not have to embed them on that first processor.

32:10.400 --> 32:14.320
Have a secondary unit that they can talk to you and try to get that information with.

32:14.320 --> 32:17.520
And still, quote unquote, respecting your freedom.

32:18.720 --> 32:19.440
Yeah.

32:19.440 --> 32:20.720
That's a neat trick.

32:20.720 --> 32:25.280
So you get the Free Software Foundation's AOK because it's a secondary processor.

32:25.280 --> 32:30.640
So they need a binary blob for this phone to do the DDR4 memory training.

32:30.640 --> 32:31.520
Of course you do.

32:31.520 --> 32:32.640
That's just we're still there.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.000
We're still in that world.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.120
Oh, wow, though.

32:35.120 --> 32:42.000
Like that's what we're up against is binary blobs that train the DDR4 RAM how to behave

32:42.000 --> 32:44.560
timing wise on boot every single boot.

32:45.280 --> 32:48.320
Like that's the level that we are trying to get down to here.

32:48.320 --> 32:51.920
OK, talk me out of this because right now I'm feeling like this is like an impossible

32:51.920 --> 32:56.480
never ending war that we are going to be constantly behind, never able to catch up on.

32:56.480 --> 32:57.600
So talk me out of this, Dar.

32:57.600 --> 32:58.640
No, I'm not going to talk you out of it.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.080
I'm going to make it worse.

33:00.080 --> 33:00.960
I'm going to make it worse.

33:01.680 --> 33:06.560
There is just in U.S., for example, there is a law Communications Assistance for Law

33:06.560 --> 33:09.200
Enforcement Act or CALEA for short.

33:10.240 --> 33:15.520
This legislation actually has been used and there's money that government even gives

33:15.520 --> 33:20.320
to companies to make sure that their hardware and software is updated to allow actually

33:20.320 --> 33:22.000
into lawful interception.

33:22.880 --> 33:28.720
So I am curious to see how they're going to do because one of the reasons modems in

33:28.720 --> 33:35.120
phones have direct access is not only for performance when it comes down to, you know,

33:35.680 --> 33:38.080
reaching out to your microphone and your speaker.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.240
And they also have a real time capability.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.680
They connect to the tower.

33:41.680 --> 33:45.920
They have generally overriding capabilities on top of their actual phone OS.

33:45.920 --> 33:50.080
That's also because it helps with complying with CALEA law when you want to sell in the

33:50.080 --> 33:51.120
United States market.

33:52.240 --> 33:55.440
I actually am curious to see how they're going to do this.

33:55.440 --> 34:00.720
Also, on top of this, if you have a VoIP service or even if you just make, let's say, an IP

34:00.720 --> 34:01.840
based only phone, right?

34:01.840 --> 34:03.440
You just you use data.

34:03.440 --> 34:08.080
Well, CALEA law also says that if you are doing VoIP services, you're then classified

34:08.080 --> 34:12.480
as a carrier, the VoIP provider, and therefore you have to support CALEA as well.

34:12.480 --> 34:15.200
There's that part that is interesting too.

34:15.200 --> 34:20.080
So what about this idea of breaking it out into a secondary co-processor or second processor

34:20.080 --> 34:24.000
that you could almost change out per region or situation?

34:24.000 --> 34:25.120
Like, is that a good idea?

34:25.120 --> 34:28.960
That could, I could see that actually working, but it seems like it would add complexity.

34:28.960 --> 34:30.080
It's an excellent idea.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.120
It adds complexity.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.280
Of course, it will drain your battery slightly more.

34:33.280 --> 34:37.920
Hopefully Linux, you know, in Plasma will just be more battery efficient.

34:37.920 --> 34:38.880
We hope for that.

34:38.880 --> 34:44.000
And, you know, at least we're trying, which has been usually the biggest bottleneck is

34:44.000 --> 34:50.240
nobody actually tries because the know-how is, the requirement is just too big, right?

34:50.240 --> 34:51.520
To do it as a single man.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.560
And now there's a team working on it.

34:54.560 --> 34:58.880
Maybe we'll start to find, but I am skeptical.

34:58.880 --> 35:03.680
And I think that in the end of the day, the fight will still end up in the same place.

35:03.680 --> 35:06.640
It's going to be a fight to live in the same place.

35:06.640 --> 35:12.800
It's going to be a fight to legislative reform and not necessarily on the technical means

35:12.800 --> 35:17.200
because the law is there and you have to comply with it, especially because you're selling

35:17.200 --> 35:18.000
a product.

35:18.000 --> 35:25.920
So now my last bit is a bit of a miss for the Purism folks is it looks like potentially

35:26.720 --> 35:32.400
they may have an issue with their iMX8 ARM processor that's going to be in the Librem5.

35:32.400 --> 35:39.520
It just missed the 4.18 kernel window and that's a bit of an issue for them because

35:39.520 --> 35:43.760
the next window for 4.19 will be the last release of 2018.

35:43.760 --> 35:48.880
And so if this iMX8 ARM processor bits, especially the bits around the system on the chip, because

35:48.880 --> 35:55.200
part of it is already actually in the kernel, like the SATA support and some DRM bits are

35:55.200 --> 35:57.440
already upstream in the Linux kernel.

35:57.440 --> 35:58.400
So close.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.280
Yeah, I know.

35:59.280 --> 36:02.640
It's just the rest of the bits of the system on the chip, like the drivers and all that

36:02.640 --> 36:04.960
kind of stuff that haven't made it in the kernel yet.

36:05.520 --> 36:11.520
And if they don't get squared away by 4.19, then there's really not going to be a kernel

36:11.520 --> 36:15.440
for the Librem5 that has upstreamed all of the driver support.

36:15.440 --> 36:15.760
Right.

36:15.760 --> 36:20.480
They can build it in the meanwhile, deal with the situation of the SATA back and be then

36:21.040 --> 36:25.520
the ones providing a kernel that supports the things that they need until they sync

36:25.520 --> 36:27.840
back up and then you're just getting normal releases.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.680
I don't see that as a huge issue.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.120
It's manageable, probably.

36:31.120 --> 36:35.520
I feel like that phrase is said a lot and, you know, it's manageable, probably.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.200
Sometimes that works out, sometimes not.

36:37.200 --> 36:38.000
We will see that.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.200
But yes, it probably is right.

36:39.200 --> 36:44.960
Like if they can just build it with those almost upstream sources and manage their transition,

36:44.960 --> 36:48.960
if they already have a resilient sort of, you know, updating system in place where they

36:48.960 --> 36:51.200
can fall back if it fails, then there's less risk.

36:51.200 --> 36:54.080
If they don't, aren't smart about that, then maybe it's riskier.

36:54.080 --> 36:56.000
It's a phone, it better update well.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.840
It better update well, right?

36:57.840 --> 36:58.160
Yeah, exactly.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.400
It's a phone, it better update well, right?

37:00.400 --> 37:02.800
So it's a good thing, actually.

37:02.800 --> 37:05.200
Let them try it before you buy it.

37:06.080 --> 37:09.600
It's certainly interesting work that Purism are doing with the Librem 5.

37:09.600 --> 37:13.600
You know, there's a lot of technical challenges here and there's a lot of innovation that

37:13.600 --> 37:16.080
needs to happen in order to create a device like this.

37:16.560 --> 37:20.400
But I think the people that are following this project and particularly those people

37:20.400 --> 37:24.960
that are backing the project probably need to reset their expectations as to when they

37:24.960 --> 37:29.360
need to reset their expectations as to when this phone is going to ship as an actual device.

37:30.080 --> 37:38.560
Because I've backed a number of mobile phone type crowdfunding devices in the last 18 months

37:38.560 --> 37:39.060
or so.

37:39.680 --> 37:45.200
And at the moment, they're posting lots of interesting information about the hardware

37:45.200 --> 37:50.320
enablement that they're doing, and the applications that they're writing and their display stack

37:50.320 --> 37:51.280
and all the rest of it.

37:51.280 --> 37:54.960
Their goal is to launch in January, February next year.

37:55.760 --> 38:02.160
On the crowdfunders for similar mobile devices, six months from delivery dates, they were

38:02.720 --> 38:10.240
making prototype devices and manufacturing runs to test the manufacturing processes to

38:10.240 --> 38:15.840
square away quality assurance, you know, niggles and what have you so that they could start

38:15.840 --> 38:18.160
to plan for production runs.

38:18.160 --> 38:22.240
And on both these crowdfunders I'm referring to, one was the Jelly Pro phone and the other

38:22.240 --> 38:29.680
was the Gemini PDA, even though they were doing this four and six months before their

38:29.680 --> 38:36.480
release deadlines for the devices, both missed their release targets by four and seven months,

38:36.480 --> 38:41.680
even though they were, you know, that far along in their, you know, production planning,

38:41.680 --> 38:43.680
actually making the devices.

38:43.680 --> 38:47.680
So for all of the interesting things that are going in in the software, whilst the wireless

38:47.680 --> 38:52.480
chipset is not agreed and whilst the camera module is not agreed, that means that the

38:52.480 --> 38:56.080
casing dimensions and what have you is also not agreed yet.

38:56.080 --> 39:00.800
So they can't be in a place where they're producing casing samples and starting production

39:00.800 --> 39:01.600
runs.

39:01.600 --> 39:07.440
So I think, you know, these devices are going to ship into the back end of 2019.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.440
Hmm, not January?

39:09.440 --> 39:16.000
It will be a Herculean effort if Purism pull it off and they deserve, you know, a round

39:16.000 --> 39:20.400
of applause and all the champagne corks popping in celebration if they do it.

39:20.400 --> 39:27.440
But I can't see how they're going to be able to do that because from what I understand,

39:27.440 --> 39:35.200
they don't have engineering samples of the devices and they don't even have dev boards,

39:35.200 --> 39:38.640
you know, available to all of the people that are working on this stuff yet.

39:38.640 --> 39:44.240
So, you know, hardware enablement needs to happen in various projects and those developers

39:44.240 --> 39:46.720
will need devices in order to do that.

39:46.720 --> 39:52.480
So it's a very interesting project and it's great to see all of the updates.

39:52.480 --> 39:56.880
But, you know, in terms of actually producing a device, a phone that you can hold and use,

39:56.880 --> 39:59.680
I think there's some considerable way out yet.

39:59.680 --> 40:02.000
Yeah, I can't really argue with you on that.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.840
That all kind of adds up.

40:03.840 --> 40:08.960
So let's talk about your NUC for a moment because I have been thinking about making

40:08.960 --> 40:12.080
this RV studio setup permanent.

40:12.080 --> 40:17.120
The part that is not permanent right now is I'm just using my XPS laptop, which is not

40:17.120 --> 40:18.720
quite the right machine for the job.

40:18.720 --> 40:22.320
And I also would like to have that machine available while I'm doing the show for like

40:22.320 --> 40:23.600
browsing the web and whatnot.

40:23.600 --> 40:26.080
And I've been thinking about installing a NUC in a cupboard.

40:26.080 --> 40:32.480
So above where I'm sitting, I have a cabinet and in that cabinet, I have a DBX 286.

40:32.480 --> 40:39.520
I have a PreSonos sound interface and then I have a USB-C hub where I have all of that

40:39.520 --> 40:43.760
stuff connected in and then one USB-C cord down to my XPS.

40:43.760 --> 40:47.840
And I can get all of that with one cord and it's fantastic.

40:47.840 --> 40:48.400
I love it.

40:48.400 --> 40:49.520
Beautiful.

40:49.520 --> 40:50.240
It's great.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.240
I could make it a little bit better, though, if the machine was permanent.

40:54.240 --> 40:58.400
If it wasn't my personal laptop that I just play around with and I use to play video games,

40:58.400 --> 40:59.760
even though it's not got a great video card.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.320
A podcasting station right there in the RV.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.720
Wes, you might call it a podcasting workstation.

41:04.720 --> 41:07.040
Oh, I like it.

41:07.040 --> 41:11.600
So the NUC was really what came to mind because I could just slot it right on top of all this

41:11.600 --> 41:14.960
equipment in the cupboard and it has USB-C on it.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.800
But the last time I talked to Wimpy about it, he said,

41:17.600 --> 41:20.160
there's some stuff missing from the kernel so it doesn't work so good.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.920
He didn't quite say it in that high pitched voice.

41:22.480 --> 41:27.360
But I don't know, a little birdie tells me that perhaps Wimpy has reached some level of success

41:27.360 --> 41:29.840
and now I can't help myself.

41:29.840 --> 41:31.200
I'm beginning to dream, Wimpy.

41:32.160 --> 41:36.400
How are things going with your Linux experiment on the new, what is it, the Hades Canyon NUC?

41:36.400 --> 41:37.600
Yeah, it's the Hades Canyon.

41:37.600 --> 41:40.880
I have a fully hardware accelerated Hades Canyon NUC now.

41:41.920 --> 41:48.240
So I thought the big problem was that the video drivers weren't in the kernel yet from Intel,

41:48.240 --> 41:50.320
like they hadn't actually submitted them upstream or they hadn't.

41:50.320 --> 41:56.400
No, so well, it's actually from AMD because this is a Vega M GPU.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.840
So it's actually the work of AMD.

41:59.840 --> 42:02.960
So what's happened in the last week is this.

42:02.960 --> 42:11.600
Linux kernel 4.18 release candidate one has been released and the necessary kernel drivers

42:11.600 --> 42:13.520
exist in the 4.18 kernel.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.640
So you need the 4.18 kernel.

42:17.920 --> 42:27.040
You need the microcode for the RX Vega M GPU, which is not in the upstream Linux firmware

42:27.040 --> 42:33.200
Git repository yet, but it is available from AMD's staging Git repository.

42:33.200 --> 42:40.560
And the other thing you need is Mesa 18.1.1 or newer.

42:40.560 --> 42:41.600
Are you writing this down, Chris?

42:43.360 --> 42:45.840
The weekend, an interesting thing happened.

42:45.840 --> 42:49.680
So you can install Ubuntu 18.04, any of the flavors will do.

42:49.680 --> 42:56.320
And the Ubuntu mainline kernel PPA now has 4.18 RC1 in it.

42:56.320 --> 43:02.960
So you can go and grab that kernel and Timo Altonen, who's the maintainer for the graphics

43:02.960 --> 43:10.960
stack in Ubuntu, he's been updating Mesa in 18.04, but has also started to prep what will

43:10.960 --> 43:17.920
be the new enablement stack and Mesa 18.1.1 is in the X updates PPA.

43:17.920 --> 43:23.440
So just by turning on a couple of PPAs and installing a different kernel and updating,

43:23.440 --> 43:28.080
you know, just doing an update to pull in those Mesa updates and then adding the microcode

43:28.080 --> 43:36.480
into lib firmware, lib firmware AMD GPU, I now have the whole thing going, which is great.

43:36.480 --> 43:37.920
And it's performing quite well.

43:39.360 --> 43:45.600
Now, the thing is, is that for this to really fly, it needs Mesa 18.2, which is currently

43:45.600 --> 43:51.600
in development. So if you and what I haven't done yet is test this configuration with Mesa

43:51.600 --> 43:58.080
18.2. So that's a project for this weekend. And I expect some modest performance games

43:58.080 --> 44:02.800
by doing that. But right now, as a workstation, all the bits and bobs are now working.

44:02.800 --> 44:07.200
And work casting pod station is what FreqLab calls it in the IRC. And I think that's not

44:07.200 --> 44:07.680
bad.

44:07.680 --> 44:08.720
Just a pod station.

44:09.280 --> 44:13.840
It's a pod station. It sounds like it's a bit of work, but not insurmountable.

44:13.840 --> 44:18.080
It's really, really quite straightforward. Yeah. Once you know, once you know what needs

44:18.080 --> 44:20.480
doing, doing it is really quite straightforward.

44:20.480 --> 44:25.200
Yeah. So how likely would any of this be to land and say like a hardware enablement of

44:25.200 --> 44:26.240
1804?

44:26.240 --> 44:36.400
So by Ubuntu 1804.2, all of the necessary bits and pieces should be landed in order

44:36.400 --> 44:37.440
for this to function.

44:37.440 --> 44:40.080
Oh, I mean, you know, I mean, that sounds really nice.

44:40.080 --> 44:49.440
Yeah. But what I'm talking to some people about at work is also so 18.2 will be out

44:49.440 --> 44:54.240
just after 18.10. So the other thing we're talking about is trying to make sure that

44:54.240 --> 45:01.760
everything we need is landed in 18.10. Because it turns out resellers of these NUCs have

45:01.760 --> 45:06.640
approached Ubuntu and asked about, you know, getting the enablement going for these devices

45:06.640 --> 45:10.880
because it turns out lots of Linux users have been buying them.

45:10.880 --> 45:15.040
Yeah. Good. Good. Voting with the wallet does actually work, it sounds like.

45:15.040 --> 45:20.080
Yeah. And the other thing to add, I think I may have mentioned this before, but the

45:20.080 --> 45:25.600
LVFS project with all of the firmware updating and what have you, this device, all of its

45:25.600 --> 45:30.080
bits and bobs are supported in LVFS. So I was able to do the firmware and BIOS upgrades

45:30.080 --> 45:33.680
all through FWUPD.

45:33.680 --> 45:34.880
Oh, that's fantastic.

45:34.880 --> 45:36.720
Just pretty, pretty nice. Yeah.

45:36.720 --> 45:39.680
That's like a, that is a sleek system now.

45:39.680 --> 45:45.600
That is. Oh, okay. So I think that will be the pod station, but I may be just lazy enough

45:45.600 --> 45:53.680
to wait till 18.02 just simply because, 18.04.2, because after this road trip, and I'm not

45:53.680 --> 45:56.800
going to get the NUC on this road trip, I'm back in studio for a while. So I won't really

45:56.800 --> 46:00.800
need it. So I don't think, I don't know. I don't think, although I say that and then

46:00.800 --> 46:03.440
something comes up and I'm back on the road.

46:03.440 --> 46:04.440
It's just going to happen.

46:04.440 --> 46:08.240
Are you making me want to do it? And the eGPU stuff's all working too Wimpy? The device

46:08.240 --> 46:09.760
is your main driver at this point?

46:09.760 --> 46:15.680
So literally this, this has been, I've got this working within the last 36 hours. So

46:15.680 --> 46:21.560
it's on the desk behind me and I need to like move over all of my data and configurations

46:21.560 --> 46:24.960
and what have you know, I haven't done any of that yet. I've been running benchmarks

46:24.960 --> 46:29.640
and things on it and playing games on it and what have you, but I've not set it up for

46:29.640 --> 46:35.000
real work yet, but it will be over the course of this weekend, it will be transitioning

46:35.000 --> 46:41.120
to my dedicated workstation. And whilst it does work with external GPUs because it has

46:41.120 --> 46:49.120
two Thunderbolt 3 enabled USB-C sockets on it. So you can really go to town with your

46:49.120 --> 46:56.800
Thunderbolt on this device. I want to run it with just the integrated GPU, which in

46:56.800 --> 47:06.240
terms of performance right now with Mesa 18.1.1 is operating around the performance of like

47:06.240 --> 47:16.800
a GTX 1050, something like that. So it's good enough that for 1080p gaming with, you know,

47:16.800 --> 47:22.480
medium to high settings, it's absolutely fine. As soon as you start cranking things

47:22.480 --> 47:29.880
up to, you know, 1440p and you really sort of turn on all of the features, then it starts

47:29.880 --> 47:35.760
to run about, you know, 30 frames a second for the games. But if you go at 1080p, it's

47:35.760 --> 47:36.760
more than capable.

47:36.760 --> 47:41.640
Yeah, fair enough. Yeah. And I, you know, for what I'd be using it for, that would be

47:41.640 --> 47:46.200
totally great. Well, that's a good update. I'm glad to hear all that.

47:46.200 --> 47:49.760
If you've got any GPU, then you just plug in another device. And on that front, I've

47:49.760 --> 47:52.600
also got a Razer Core X now as well.

47:52.600 --> 47:57.400
Oh, what? And how do you like this? And no, so the Razer Core X, isn't that, that's like

47:57.400 --> 48:01.240
the, it was released what, three months ago or something? It's like a fairly new external

48:01.240 --> 48:02.240
GPU unit.

48:02.240 --> 48:07.160
No, the Razer Core X was released a couple of weeks ago. So some time ago. Oh, yeah,

48:07.160 --> 48:11.360
this is brand new. So some time ago I got the Razer Core and then I got the revised

48:11.360 --> 48:17.560
model which was the Razer Core V2. And now I have the Razer Core X. So this is, these

48:17.560 --> 48:24.480
are eGPU enclosures. The difference between the Razer Core X and the earlier models is

48:24.480 --> 48:29.800
it's a much bigger device. So it can take triple width cards. So if you've got a graphics

48:29.800 --> 48:34.880
card with one of these super spanky cooling solutions on it, you know, that makes it super

48:34.880 --> 48:41.760
fat, then it can accommodate those. It's got a higher rated power supply. So it can take

48:41.760 --> 48:49.440
the RX Vega 64, for example, which the other models can't quite cope with. And this one's

48:49.440 --> 48:55.880
cheaper. This is half the price of the other. So this is $250 instead of $500. And those

48:55.880 --> 49:02.040
cost savings come from the fact that it doesn't have any RGB and it doesn't expose any additional

49:02.040 --> 49:09.320
USB ports or ethernet ports on the, on the back of the device, like the, the Razer Core

49:09.320 --> 49:10.320
V1 and V2.

49:10.320 --> 49:12.560
Ah, it's not quite like a hub.

49:12.560 --> 49:17.640
No, it's not like a hub. It is just an enclosure for a PCI card basically.

49:17.640 --> 49:20.680
Yeah, but I do like that additional power.

49:20.680 --> 49:26.360
Yeah, yeah, exactly. So I've put my RX Vega 56 in that now and I'll be selling the Razer

49:26.360 --> 49:35.000
Core V1 so I should keep the V2 and keep the X. I'm all about the eGPUs. I'm an eGPU hipster.

49:35.000 --> 49:41.480
Yeah, you are. Well, I want to talk a little bit about games here in a moment. In fact,

49:41.480 --> 49:44.560
one that you were playing on your live stream in a bit. So actually, let's pick that thread

49:44.560 --> 49:49.500
back up. But let's, let's take a moment and mention a quick app pick and then we'll do

49:49.500 --> 49:54.040
our sponsor block. I first want to mention, though, this is one that came in from James

49:54.040 --> 50:01.600
via the contact form at linuxunplug.com slash contact. And it is a early days, self-hosted

50:01.600 --> 50:08.520
Google Photos clone. Frickin' finally. That's all I have to say about that. It's self-hosted.

50:08.520 --> 50:13.480
It is a front and a back end. Django back end and a React front end. It's in heavy development

50:13.480 --> 50:18.040
right now. Some features are currently implemented. You can label faces, you know, so that way

50:18.040 --> 50:20.200
you can find all your Westpain pictures.

50:20.200 --> 50:21.260
That's right. You want those.

50:21.260 --> 50:26.420
You do, of course. I've got a Westpain search. Westpain all the time. All the time. It's

50:26.420 --> 50:29.760
Docker ready too, Wes. So this is, I think, actually you might have found this. I don't

50:29.760 --> 50:33.240
think I found this. I think you... No, no, it was sent in by James. I just said that.

50:33.240 --> 50:36.200
I don't know if you had a chance to look at it, Wes, but it looks like it could be the

50:36.200 --> 50:37.200
beginning.

50:37.200 --> 50:42.160
Actually, yes, I'm playing with the demo right now. It's not bad. I mean, for the basic browsing

50:42.160 --> 50:46.160
around, looking around, it seemed just fine. There's several galleries on the demo site

50:46.160 --> 50:51.120
of seemingly random faces grouped together, so I don't know what that says about the actual

50:51.120 --> 50:57.120
application performance. But otherwise, it was a fine UI. It seemed to work well.

50:57.120 --> 51:01.920
Yes, you can check it out. If you go to the link we'll have in the show notes, linuxownplug.com

51:01.920 --> 51:08.640
slash 254, and the login is demo. Demo and then demo1234. And the guy says right here

51:08.640 --> 51:14.880
in the Jithub, as Noah calls it, that it's early days. But it's called OwnPhotos. No

51:14.880 --> 51:22.280
relation to OwnCloud or like OwnNotes or anything. It's just a name. It's a semi-name

51:22.280 --> 51:27.600
collision. That happens all the time. And it's got back end. It's got like a back end

51:27.600 --> 51:32.600
and a front end. So the theory could be that if this were to take off, one day you could

51:32.600 --> 51:37.480
have like, say, Shotwell that is using the back end of this thing and Shotwell is a front

51:37.480 --> 51:43.240
end or something. So it could have some potential. Could have some potential. And probably with

51:43.240 --> 51:46.560
a little bit of help from the open source community, it might get there. So we'll have

51:46.560 --> 51:50.680
a link to that in the show notes. Otherwise, like Noah says, it's up on the Jithub.

51:50.680 --> 51:55.840
Now let's talk about our sponsors this week. We're doing this new in the show and I'm actually

51:55.840 --> 52:01.280
sort of actively soliciting feedback on it. We're trying to block all the sponsors together.

52:01.280 --> 52:05.020
It's what's sort of become the new standard in the podcast industry. If you subscribe

52:05.020 --> 52:09.960
to more newer podcasts, you'll notice that about this percentage into the show, it's

52:09.960 --> 52:14.120
kind of like percentage based on the content. They have a real formula for it. It's pretty

52:14.120 --> 52:19.320
adorable. And they put the ads here. They put them right here and they say, we'll put

52:19.320 --> 52:23.880
them all back to back and you listen to this bit and then it doesn't interrupt the flow

52:23.880 --> 52:27.860
of the content earlier or later in the show. I like the idea and I want to see what you

52:27.860 --> 52:32.800
guys think because it also gives me an opportunity to sort of collect all of the cool things

52:32.800 --> 52:36.940
that our sponsors are doing and link them all up in one spot and collate all of that

52:36.940 --> 52:40.520
and kind of get the word out there about the things that our different sponsors are actively

52:40.520 --> 52:45.020
doing because you may have heard of them before. You may know that Linux Academy sponsors us

52:45.020 --> 52:49.000
or that Digital Ocean or Ting sponsored the show. You may know that by now. But you might

52:49.000 --> 52:51.560
not know the new stuff that they're doing. So that's the other thing I kind of like about

52:51.560 --> 52:55.780
this opportunity. So I am actively looking for your feedback. Tweet me at Chris Ellis

52:55.780 --> 52:59.960
or send it into the contact page at Linux Unplugged dot com slash content. So let's

52:59.960 --> 53:02.980
start with Linux Academy because that's why I am on the road. I'm on my way back from

53:02.980 --> 53:06.280
Linux Academy. I'll tell you about that here in just a couple of minutes. Wrapped up their

53:06.280 --> 53:11.400
OBS system, got it all built for them. And while I was there, I started to get the inside

53:11.400 --> 53:18.180
scoop. People are working just like heads down like maniacs on this new content launch

53:18.180 --> 53:23.440
they're doing in July. Now in April, I told you about 70 plus new challenges and courseware

53:23.440 --> 53:26.840
and updates and all the stuff that they'd rolled out. And I was like, that's their biggest

53:26.840 --> 53:32.120
content push ever. Well, in July, they're basically bringing Christmas to July with

53:32.120 --> 53:38.080
150 new courses, challenges and learning activities. They're going to be launching in July. And

53:38.080 --> 53:43.320
this reason I was down there was for their ability to live stream and sort of try to

53:43.320 --> 53:49.800
message what is in all of this update. Because when you get to 150, it starts to get lost

53:49.800 --> 53:53.020
a little bit in the details. And so that's one of the reasons they want to start doing

53:53.020 --> 53:57.240
more live streams. So they can kind of break it down, do giveaways, tell people about what's

53:57.240 --> 54:02.720
in there, that kind of stuff. But this isn't official yet. But I got the scuttlebutt. Like

54:02.720 --> 54:08.900
I was talking to some of the course authors. I got an idea of what's coming down the pipe.

54:08.900 --> 54:11.940
So if you're a Linux Academy subscriber already, if you went to Linux Academy dot com slash

54:11.940 --> 54:14.680
unplugged, you're going to get all of this stuff. Or if you want to go subscribe, you

54:14.680 --> 54:19.760
can get it soon. And this is just one or two of many things. But it looks like they're

54:19.760 --> 54:26.800
going to be slipping in in this 150 plus bundle. Saltstack certification training, Red Hat's

54:26.800 --> 54:33.340
certification for expertise and virtualization, also Red Hat's expertise cert and ansible,

54:33.340 --> 54:37.200
and a Red Hat certified architect full support, which is a big one, I guess, in the industry.

54:37.200 --> 54:41.080
The Red Hat certified architect full support. Also a couple other ones that sounded kind

54:41.080 --> 54:44.520
of interesting. A Lambda deep dive. They're going to have a course where they're going

54:44.520 --> 54:50.960
to be slipping in that 150 bundle. And an AWS security specialty certification. In fact,

54:50.960 --> 54:53.960
I didn't really get the details on this, but it looked like they're going to be doing a

54:53.960 --> 54:57.640
lot of stuff with security. Like that's going to be a big area Linux Academy is going to

54:57.640 --> 54:58.640
go into.

54:58.640 --> 54:59.640
Please.

54:59.640 --> 55:01.920
And it looks like, yeah. And I think they're even doing hiring around that, too, to try

55:01.920 --> 55:06.160
to staff up. That's going to be awesome. So if you're not familiar with Linux Academy,

55:06.160 --> 55:09.800
you can subscribe for seven days for free when you go to Linux Academy dot com slash

55:09.800 --> 55:14.880
unplugged and try out their hands-on labs, their courseware, their schedule planner,

55:14.880 --> 55:18.040
hang out in the community that's stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members. They've got

55:18.040 --> 55:24.360
courseware on AWS, Azure, and anything around Linux. Or if it runs Linux or Linux runs on

55:24.360 --> 55:28.760
top of that. And if you're ready to sort of like upgrade your skills on OpenStack or if

55:28.760 --> 55:32.600
you ever need help, they have instructors that are there to help you. It's a great service.

55:32.600 --> 55:37.400
And they're launching Christmas in July with 150 new ways to train and learn, as well as

55:37.400 --> 55:40.280
some Azure courseware that's going to be in there, although I didn't get the details on

55:40.280 --> 55:43.360
what, because the Azure courseware is like, it's hard for my brain to remember, because

55:43.360 --> 55:49.640
it's like, it's like Azure 70-535. And I'm like, what does that even mean? Whereas with

55:49.640 --> 55:54.940
like Red Hat, it's Red Hat certification of expertise and virtualization. I kind of get

55:54.940 --> 55:59.800
what that means. So that I grok. But they're just doing it's a whole bunch of stuff. And

55:59.800 --> 56:02.760
they have some blog posts that are teasing some of it out. So you can check that out.

56:02.760 --> 56:07.680
So thanks to Linux Academy. And thanks to everybody who goes to linuxacademy.com slash

56:07.680 --> 56:12.440
unplugged to sign up, support the show, and get a free seven day trial. And speaking of

56:12.440 --> 56:16.920
good deals, a big thank you to Ting for supporting the Unplugged program for a long, long time

56:16.920 --> 56:21.180
now. The storm has cleared. I don't know if you can hear it, but the storm has cleared

56:21.180 --> 56:26.700
in the background. And my Ting connection is strong. Ting is smarter than unlimited.

56:26.700 --> 56:33.360
If you use less, you pay less. The average Ting bill is just $23 per month. It's $6 for

56:33.360 --> 56:37.360
your phone, $6 for the line. And then it's just your minutes, your messages, and your

56:37.360 --> 56:41.900
megabytes on top of that. Nationwide coverage, you can rest assured that Ting's got your

56:41.900 --> 56:46.040
coverage from coast to coast. They got coverage. And they got CDMA and GSM. So you can pick

56:46.040 --> 56:49.960
whatever works better in your area. Today, I'm on CDMA. I think last time we did the

56:49.960 --> 56:54.680
show, I might have been on GSM. I can't remember, because I just have both now. It's $6 a month

56:54.680 --> 56:59.000
for the line. That's a pretty easy expense to cover. And I use it like a couple of times

56:59.000 --> 57:02.440
a year. I love that, because Ting has a control panel where I can go in and I could actually

57:02.440 --> 57:07.820
turn the service off if I wanted to. I could transfer it. When Rekai decided to go do Twitch

57:07.820 --> 57:12.360
full-time, we transferred his line out of my Ting account to him. So he could just keep

57:12.360 --> 57:18.700
that phone number, keep that phone, all that stuff. It's really nice. And in that particular

57:18.700 --> 57:24.060
case too, their customer service was fantastic, because they need my permission to do a thing.

57:24.060 --> 57:27.200
And then he's got to call up and activate a thing and give payment info. And they were

57:27.200 --> 57:31.300
totally cool about just sort of coordinating all of that. And it's just a super nice aspect

57:31.300 --> 57:35.360
of Ting that doesn't get enough attention. But on top of paying for what you use and

57:35.360 --> 57:39.640
that control panel, they have a great set of devices that you can go grab. Or because

57:39.640 --> 57:44.680
they support CDMA or GSM, you can bring your own. Just check their BYOD page. And for a

57:44.680 --> 57:48.200
little bit, I want to tell you about their giveaway. They're doing something new here.

57:48.200 --> 57:55.480
It's the hashtag Ting Summer. Hashtag pound sign. Pound sign. Ting Summer. And if you

57:55.480 --> 57:59.600
do that, when you like to submit a photo to Twitter or Instagram, and it's a good, you

57:59.600 --> 58:01.800
know, it probably doesn't have to be that good. Let's be honest. They're going to be

58:01.800 --> 58:06.360
nice. They're Ting after all. But try to take a good one. And then do a hashtag on their

58:06.360 --> 58:11.640
Ting Summer on the Facebook, on the Twitter, on the Instagram. And you will get entered

58:11.640 --> 58:18.160
for a bi-weekly giveaway of the Moto Z2 Play. They're also going to give away the True Zoom

58:18.160 --> 58:26.520
Moto Mod snap-on that gives it like an actual DSLR lens on the Moto. If you ever see a picture

58:26.520 --> 58:32.280
of this thing, Wes, it's like a full-fledged lens on the back of a camera, or on the back

58:32.280 --> 58:38.720
of a phone. It's ridiculous. It's awesome though. And they're giving it away for like,

58:38.720 --> 58:44.040
you know, using a hashtag. So I just encourage you to... Ting is awesome, dude. They're just

58:44.040 --> 58:48.140
insane. There's a few rules and the whatnot, so just go over to their blog. But do me a

58:48.140 --> 58:53.480
favor. Start by going to linux.ting.com. That'll take $25 off a device, or if you bring one,

58:53.480 --> 58:57.000
it'll give you $25 in service credit. But on top of that, it lets them know you heard

58:57.000 --> 59:02.080
it here, linux.ting.com, and then click over to that blog post and read about the giveaway.

59:02.080 --> 59:05.360
Because I think you can get on that. I think you could probably get in on that. You know,

59:05.360 --> 59:08.960
sometimes Wes is snapping a few pictures there in that Seattle area. You had that hashtag,

59:08.960 --> 59:12.880
Wes, you might get yourself... I'm on there liking that stuff. I see it. I'm like, oh

59:12.880 --> 59:16.400
yeah, that's good. I'm liking that. You know that? I want you to know I'm liking your stuff

59:16.400 --> 59:21.880
sometimes. It's important you know that. Hashtag Ting Summer. All right. Now, before we go

59:21.880 --> 59:26.320
any further, I got one more thing to give out here, because we all love and know Digital

59:26.320 --> 59:32.800
Ocean, and you can get in on the goodness, do.co.plugged. Get a $100 credit. Yeah, 100s.

59:32.800 --> 59:36.960
100s applied to your account for 60 days when you sign up with a new account. 100s in Digital

59:36.960 --> 59:43.400
Ocean credit is... It's way more than you need. It's an excessive amount of credit.

59:43.400 --> 59:46.840
I think you should go sign up, because I don't know why they haven't turned this off yet,

59:46.840 --> 59:51.480
to be honest with you. If I was Digital Ocean, I would cut this crap off right now. Because

59:51.480 --> 59:55.840
I don't know what you're doing with that 100 bucks. Because here's the thing. Our previous

59:55.840 --> 01:00:01.240
promo was 10 bucks. That was enough. 10 bucks was enough, Wes. Just like 640k of RAM was

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:06.480
enough. Yeah, right. It's crazy. It was. It was plenty. And now $100. You know, back in

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.600
my day, back in my day, we got $10 in credit. And then even further back in my day, we had

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:15.680
to rack our own gear. Okay? So now you're gonna... I can't even with you guys. But if

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:22.160
you go over there to do.co.plugged until Crazy Digital Ocean quits it, you can sign up. And

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:27.000
with a new account, you'll get that 100 credit. And you can try to deploy a system in seconds.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.960
I mean, it just only takes you seconds to get a system up and going. You want to go

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.320
try out GitLab and say, screw you to Microsoft, which I don't necessarily agree with. But

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:40.680
I don't judge you either. Well, you can do it with that 100 credit and then just see

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:45.760
how perfectly useful it is and then just keep paying. That's probably what I would do. But

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:49.800
you know what? I can't really say what you're gonna do. You may just want to seed your favorite

01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:54.200
distribution for a bit. But they do have some really cool options. Like you can mix and

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:58.960
match droplet resources now, which is kind of a new feature for Digital Ocean. So say

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.320
you want like a lot of CPU for all that Monero. Well, then you can just throw like a ton of

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:08.000
CPU, which I also do not recommend. But you could. And let's just say you want a lot of

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.360
disk because you're like Crazy Chris and you're backing up all the photos from your road trip

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:16.680
using Nextcloud to your cloud, which is your own cloud up on the Digital Ocean. I want

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:20.700
all the disk, Wes. That's what I do. So I attach 250 gigs of block storage. That's how

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:26.200
I do. And let's just say that I had this really long video message I wanted to send Wes. You

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.400
know how I would do that? Digital Ocean spaces generate an URL. You know what somebody ought

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:33.440
to do is they ought to take and this is a serious thing. They ought to take that Digital

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:38.320
Ocean API, which is really well documented, easy to understand, and I think their crazy

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.400
great dashboard might be a client of because it's feature complete. I tell you what. Just

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:47.840
make me one app for iOS and you can make it for those Androids if you want to put it in

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:51.920
the share sheet. So I hit a share button. It comes up and then I hit a button on my

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:58.800
share sheet and it creates a Digital Ocean space using the API with my account and then

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:03.320
it generates a link and then I could send that file to Wes because you see that would

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:08.680
be awesome because the Digital Ocean API is so slick that there's already tons of great

01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:13.040
open source software that's been created for it. So this is just one more thing that Chris

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.880
is asking for. Somebody out there go take advantage of it. Also, because Digital Ocean

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:23.640
is not satisfied with just giving you $100 in credit, they're also going to enable you

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:31.040
to donate your time for writing tutorials to open source projects and charities. You

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:34.320
can write for donations. I'll have a link in the show notes. And if you want to write

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:39.480
up some, say you're an expert on WireGuard, which is probably not super common yet, or

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.920
maybe something else that is more common that people are interested in, you could go write

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:47.200
that up, submit it to Digital Ocean, and if they like it, what they were going to pay

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.260
you because they do sometimes pay their course authors or whoever is writing up like the

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:54.480
tutorials and stuff. Instead of giving it to you, they'll give it to the charity of

01:02:54.480 --> 01:03:01.360
your choice. Isn't that pretty cool? Up to $400 too. I have information in the show notes

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:06.960
if you want to check that out. dio.co slash unplugged and a big thank you to Digital Ocean

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.720
for sponsoring the unplugged program. So I got some retro gaming nostalgia on during

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:19.080
Linux Fest Texas and it feels sort of good. Like at first I was like I shouldn't do this.

01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:23.920
I shouldn't succumb to nostalgia. I shouldn't allow myself to revert. And you know, I don't

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:27.580
want to be like my folks who like are still listening to the stuff from high school when

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:31.300
they were in high school. They listen to that music. I don't. I try to keep my music taste

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:35.800
current even though all new music is horrible. I want to stay fresh. I want to stay current.

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:42.040
I don't want to let myself become an old man. However, the classics are the classics, man.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:46.680
And and you can't ever beat Mario. Mario's solid. And there's some other things like

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.880
in that category. Like I will. I still love to sit down and play a great game of Doom.

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:56.000
Can't help it. I love it. And another game in that category for me where it may not look

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.720
the best. It may not be peak first person shooter. But damn, I love original quake and

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:09.640
and if if this didn't land at just the right time for my soul, there is now a snap to install

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:15.720
quake shareware snap install quick dash shareware and you can play the classic quake first person

01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:21.320
shooter back when it games is making quake. And you get the shareware one boom right there

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:25.360
and it's done. It's good to go. Isn't that awesome? This couldn't possibly be easier.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:29.480
I don't think Melissa came reinstalled. But that's really just that's not that's crazy

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:33.880
sauce. So yes, I know what I'm doing after the show. I also because I'm kind of snap

01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:40.600
stupid. So maybe somebody could educate me on this. But I have a snap installed that

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:45.180
I cannot link you to and I don't understand how this works. Because it's in the snap store.

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:49.880
So I thought I could go to snap craft.io and link you to it. But I installed something

01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:55.120
I think I can't remember the exact syntax, but something like snap install, go g dash

01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:01.960
galaxy dash wine space dash dash edge, I think. And then I get the go g galaxy client for

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:09.800
Windows in a snap container. And I just use that to log into my go g account and started

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:15.400
installing software. And it was great. And I wanted to link you all to it. So you could

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:19.640
try it out. But I don't understand maybe because it's an edge release. I can't link you to

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:25.720
it. Is that what it is? So by default, the web version of the store only shows you stable

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.640
channel snaps. And it hides everything in the other channels. But we're looking to change

01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:35.120
that. So you will be able to see and link to snaps that are in other channels. But it's

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:39.360
just the default at the moment is stable only. Okay, so that is out there if you want to

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:43.080
install it, I don't really know what the utility of it is other than it just made it really

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:48.360
easy to get the galaxy client going. And then I installed a couple of games. I also I recently

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:53.680
installed the battle net manager so I could get Diablo two and Starcraft three installed.

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:57.440
Yeah, this is it's been happening over here was it's been happening. The guy who made

01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:03.360
that go g galaxy snap is actually in the IRC is still down. And he's going to give you

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:09.200
the what you need to do to to to run it. Oh, thank you, sir. Very nice.

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:14.080
So the other thing that I noticed was created as a snap. It's not exactly a retro game,

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:19.720
although it did come out in 2008. So I guess that was like a decade ago, is Trackmania

01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:26.780
nations forever, which I got to watch you and wimpy play on wimpy's live stream the

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:31.560
other night. This is now a snap that you can just install somehow. I don't understand how

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:36.200
this works. Maybe somebody can explain explain this to me. You can snap install the Trackmania

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:42.280
snap and it comes down. It pulls down like a Windows installer, which then launches and

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.840
loads additional software. Am I getting this right?

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:52.360
Yeah, yeah. So Trackmania nations forever is a free to play Windows game, but it's proprietary

01:06:52.360 --> 01:07:00.080
and you can't redistribute it. So the snap is called TM nations forever. And the snap

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:10.100
contains a wine runtime and some scripts to bootstrap that environment. So when you install

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:18.560
the TM nations forever snap and run it for the first time, it interrogates the isolated

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:25.880
wine prefix, sees that the game isn't there, reaches out to the internet, downloads the

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:33.640
installer from the internet, and then installs the game into the contained wine environment

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:41.040
that that snap created. And then you have you that you now have this Windows game running

01:07:41.040 --> 01:07:46.760
in wine inside the snap. And now it's just a game that you can use. And also, you're

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:52.840
saying it's retro. But for me, I've been using Linux on a full time basis for 13 years by

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.960
the time this game came out. So when I actually discovered it for the first time, this was

01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:03.000
a new game, as far as I was concerned, irrespective of what the release date was. And I think

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.400
it stands up. I mean, it's it's quite, it's pretty, it runs very fast. It works really

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:15.240
well on integrated graphics and discrete graphics. And it's it's at and the most important thing

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:22.960
is, it's really, really good fun. It's easy to play, but very, very difficult to put down.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:27.000
Yes. Yeah, I really just enjoyed watching you to play it the other night on your live

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.520
stream. And I thought to myself, like, when I when I saw the year was 2008, I thought

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:35.560
to myself, how did I miss that? When I was watching them play that the other night, I

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:40.080
would have thought it was a game for maybe just two years ago. It did look really sharp.

01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:44.480
So the 2008 thing isn't a put down. The other thing is when we were doing that live stream,

01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:48.600
we were both live streaming. So the papi was live streaming to his channel, and I was streaming

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:54.960
to mine. But we were obviously using the snap of the game. We were using a snap of Firefox

01:08:54.960 --> 01:09:01.800
to drive twitch. We were using a snap of discord to communicate with each other. We were using

01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:08.920
a snap of OBS to do the live streaming, and then a snap of telegram to orchestrate our

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.880
listeners. And we were joined by several of the Ubuntu podcast listeners who installed

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.480
the snap and came in and joined us in game.

01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:17.480
Incredible.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:22.460
That's the part I like. Yeah, it just makes it super easy for people watching to also

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:27.080
play snap install and you're good to go. Which is, that's a really great feature.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:32.560
Yeah, and this was extensive QA because we just published that snap into the stable channel.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:39.920
So being the dedicated people that we are, papi and I were doing QA on Twitch from half

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:44.600
past nine until half past one in the morning just to make absolutely sure it all worked

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:45.600
fine.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.600
Bless you.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.600
I love my job.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.240
That is the kind of dedication that you just can't pay for. You know, that is true dedication,

01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:52.240
gentlemen.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.440
Yeah. Write a letter to Canonical and stall them.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.440
Right.

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.440
Mark at Ubuntu.com.

01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:05.160
Yeah, yeah. Well, it does seem to work quite well. And so we'll have links to that in the

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:09.640
show notes as well. Mr. West, you and I were debating on the pre-show, like how to cover

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:14.800
this next story. It's from a listener of the show, Pro Bono, and he's also involved with

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:20.160
AppImage. And it does influence his write up a bit over on Medium, but he makes some

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.680
solid points about Linux desktop usability. And he writes, why do desktop environments

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.560
increasingly degrade the desktop UX that once used to be straightforward and common sense?

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.160
Now stick with us here. This isn't like the common rebaked argument we hear all the time.

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:39.260
And don't mistake Pro Bono for anti Linux. He's a fan of the Linux desktop and the projects

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:42.960
we're going to talk about here. But he says there seems to be a tendency specifically

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:47.080
for desktop environments and applications to mess around with the proven concept of

01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:53.400
menus. Menus specifically seem to be what have him upset. And Bill Atkinson, the inventor

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:58.240
of menus, well describes them. He says in a quote, I'm proud of the pull down menus.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:02.580
I thought that pull down menu was a very good solution to providing visibility, spatial

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:07.080
memory of where the commands were as well. And that's a you can find that quote in the

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:13.080
Computer History Museum as well. He says, Pro Bono, he says, he goes on, why is there

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:19.560
an unsettling tendency to kill the beloved file, edit, etc. menus that also date back

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:26.980
to the Lisa interface that has been engraved in our brain muscles for 40 years? This goes

01:11:26.980 --> 01:11:32.300
way back. But yet, we seem to keep wanting to reinvent it. Going back to Bill Atkinson,

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:36.360
another quote, he says, the nice thing about this menu was because the titles of the menus

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:41.100
were always much narrower than the items. It basically tripled your effective screen.

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:45.700
You could scan along the top and see all available commands without doing any of them. You could

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:52.080
harmlessly see what is available. And discoverability seems to be a big point of Pro Bono's case

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.800
here. He mentions like the new GTK three pop over menus, which they were super, super proud

01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:02.000
of have taken out all of the keyboard shortcut commands in order to make the menu shorter.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:08.460
So there's like no control C for copy, no control P for paste, no control S by the save.

01:12:08.460 --> 01:12:12.900
Discoverability is gone. But to make matters worse is then the browsers really started

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:18.100
this offense is it's all compounded by the hamburger menu. Like we gave Microsoft a hard

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:23.440
time for the ribbon. But the hamburger menu is the biggest offender of all of them because

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:30.400
it's just this lazy cram everything in this three dot menu. Just put it all in there,

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:36.900
cram it all in there. And that's really like a huge step back. In fact, and I love this,

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:43.120
Pro Bono goes to point out in his post that when you go way, way, way back to 1981, the

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:50.560
Xerox Star, the original thing that Apple ripped off the idea from and iterated on,

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:58.200
the Xerox Star had a hamburger menu in 1981, had a fricking hamburger menu in 1981. And

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:06.280
then Pro Bono shows the design notes for the Lisa interface where they try out a global

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:11.360
menu, application menus, and they also try out a hamburger menu. Like they try out all

01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:17.600
the different stuff in the 1980s, early 1980s, and they have solid notes on why those designs

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:22.780
did or did not work. And so when we go back to the hamburger menu, when we drop global

01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:28.360
menus, his point, Pro Bono's point is we're actually going back to design mistakes of

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:35.580
the early 1980s that designers worked and iterated to get us out of for years. And now

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:41.280
some of the most popular open source desktops like GNOME 3 are making the mistake that we

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:46.880
made 40 years ago. And Wes, this is a pretty strong argument that he makes with lots of

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:55.040
pull quotes, screenshots, early UI concept design. And it leaves me just going like damn,

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.960
dude really has a point here. What did you think?

01:13:56.960 --> 01:14:02.520
Well, we are lucky to live in a pretty rich ecosystem of different paradigms that you

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:06.560
would like to use. And he makes reference to a really large number of them, especially

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:12.120
in projects like Monte where there's even more customization of different layout styles.

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:16.640
I think some of his points are spot on about there are some simple features that could

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:22.800
help discoverability that like, maybe if they're not enabled, is an option of the installer.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:26.600
Maybe there's some degrees between not having them at all or options to have them there.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:30.240
I'm wondering what do you think in now that you've spent some time with Plasma? Do you

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:32.000
think any of this is less relevant?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.920
I tell you one of the things that I like about having in Plasma is I've gone in, I've turned

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:39.400
on all of the menus for like in Dolphin. By default, they're off. But now when I launched

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:43.200
Dolphin, I have like my alt, you know, if you hold down alt to get those menus, I have

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:49.160
them now. And the reason why is what he points out where he makes a strong case here is discoverability.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:52.860
When I'm learning a new UI, I like to have that style, I like to get the little hint

01:14:52.860 --> 01:14:57.400
of what the Ctrl C would do for copy or what the Ctrl S would do for save. Like, if I didn't

01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:02.680
know that, how do I learn that unless it's put in some menu somewhere? And he makes a

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:09.980
strong case for global menus, which I am not so sold on. Because the basic idea for global

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:16.360
menus comes down to, well, look, you can jam your mouse up to the top of the screen faster

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:22.000
than you can finesse it to the top of an application. That I'm not so sold on. I don't know, does

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:26.080
anybody in the Mumba room have thoughts as has the desktop made steps?

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:32.960
So I actually did a good portion of a master's thesis on the Linux desktop usability. And

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:41.280
I tested Cinnamon, Mate, KDE. It was all the stuff that was on Antegros back in the day

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:47.160
that was all the defaults that were there. I didn't install anything special. And the

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:51.840
most quote unquote usable desktop was Cinnamon. And if you look in the Hacker News comments

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:56.240
for this article, there's actually quite a few people who say, oh, have you tried Cinnamon

01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:02.860
in some kind of magical way? And I think there's a lot of stuff that different desktop environments

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:03.860
do well.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:08.860
And one of the things that's mentioned in the article is on the Mac, for example, they

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:13.400
have the search in menus for help. I can't tell you how many times that's actually saved

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:18.800
my bacon when I've been looking for something quickly. And I think there's a lot of small

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:25.480
things that Linux could learn from Mac and Mac could learn from Windows. And it's a cycle.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:29.600
But the other thing that's happened in the last 10 years is that obviously mobile interfaces

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:35.360
have come along, and they've kind of shaken up how most people interact with devices.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:39.560
And you look at things like the hamburger menu, and they are as a direct consequence,

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.640
I believe, because of mobile stuff.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.640
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:49.000
I don't necessarily need to have the about stuff available, taking up valuable screen

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:55.120
real estate all the time. But I do probably want my history to be available, for example,

01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:56.120
easily in a web browser.

01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:00.120
Yeah, I definitely see there's a compromise too, when you're trying to save like development

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.000
resources and you want to create mobile applications, you want to create desktop applications, you

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.720
want to create web applications, there's going to be compromises that are made. I think it's

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.240
a tight line between compromises and repeating old mistakes.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:15.100
And there's also I mean, who are you targeting? You have to think like some of those desktops

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:18.160
you can be very productive in once you've learned everything and discoverability is

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:24.560
perhaps less of a priority for you. Obviously, that's not the best for reaching a wide audience

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:28.360
or a number of things. But for power users, sometimes that's all you care about.

01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:31.520
Yeah, and I definitely agree once you kind of know a system. That's a good point. Alex,

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:37.320
you had to drop a link in the IRC to that write up you did. Now, I want to kind of get

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:40.840
out of here with just kind of an update on how things went at Linux Academy and with

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:44.440
the work I did there and just spend the last couple of minutes on that. But just a quick

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:49.520
mention, I think it's FreeBSD's birthday today. I think they just turned 25. So congratulations

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:53.880
to the FreeBSD project. Just want to mention that too in the show. So today, we're doing

01:17:53.880 --> 01:17:57.280
the show from Casper, Wyoming. We were just in the middle of a storm, but now actually

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:02.320
blue skies are starting to clear. Since we did the last Linux Unplugged, I've driven

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.320
1070 miles.

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:04.320
Whoa!

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:06.280
19 hours and 25 minutes.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.280
Mm-hmm.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.280
Yeah.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.280
Impressive, sir.

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:15.840
Thank you. I left Linux Academy last Friday. And for some crazy reason, Hadia flew back

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:21.180
to Seattle Friday a.m. really early, picked up all three of our kids and brought them

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:27.200
back to Dallas. And now they've been with us for the drive home. So that's been fun.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:29.680
And it was a good way to spend Father's Day for sure.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.680
That sounds great.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:33.140
Yeah, it's been, yeah, it has been great. It has been great. It's been challenging like

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.880
to do work, but it's also been really nice to have this opportunity. And we split our

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:41.040
time up between playing hard, getting sunburns, which we've now gotten out of our system,

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:46.700
and driving like crazy and doing a bit of work here and there. We had 95 plus days though,

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:50.040
you know, for like weeks. We were just ready to get out of there. So we pushed hard yesterday,

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.920
drove a lot. Kids are off at the movies right now as I do the show. They're actually on

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:57.360
their way back right now. And then we're going to continue. We're going to keep on pushing

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.640
home, probably do like a couple of more stops, like some swimming holes and things like that.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:06.800
And then make it home probably this weekend if all things go well. Yeah, so the next Unplugged

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:09.000
I should be back in the studio, I think.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.540
That's wild.

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:19.920
And so I got, I got Dell, I got Dell, I got a Dell XPS desktop set up at Linux Academy

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:26.800
with Kubuntu 18.04 minimal install and the latest version of OBS. Now they got a couple

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:31.840
of PCI expansion. I can't remember. Oh, Sonnet, I think. I can't remember. Somebody makes,

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:37.080
but they're just standard PCI USB cards. But each port has its own dedicated controller

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:41.480
and they got like six ports or something like that on the back of each PCI card. So each

01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:47.200
one has a controller with full USB bandwidth going into the PCI bus. Yeah, it's nice. And

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:52.440
then they got Elgato capture cards that hang off of those. And they have different sources

01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:58.600
coming in like a Chromebook or like a guest machine or like a desktop. And we also got

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:03.200
them set up with a bit of a mixer setup so they could do a little mix minus action and

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:07.360
a 4K Canon camera coming into that thing, which is the first time I'd ever worked with

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:12.320
4K and OBS, which was fun. And yeah, it's a pretty straightforward setup. They're going

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:17.040
to be using in July when they do their new big content launch. And I got them set up

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:21.080
with the same switcher, the same shuttle pro switcher that I have in the JV one studio.

01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:25.240
They had, so now they have one of those, which is sort of fun. Oh, nice. Took a little funky

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:29.480
work to get that going under Linux these days because it's not really well supported anymore,

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:35.240
but it's still my favorite switcher. Yeah, yeah, but it went pretty well. I kind of want

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:40.520
to go back down there in July, which is crazy because I've just gotten home. But that's

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:44.720
when they're doing their live stream stuff for this big content release. And I kind of

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:48.520
want to be there for the first stream because I don't really want to make sure it goes well.

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:52.760
I don't want the first stream on Linux to go badly. Your reputation's on the line. Linux

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:58.320
is reputation too, right? So because otherwise it's right back to Wirecast and the Mac. And

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:04.240
I got to give credit. I met Jacob, their production guy they just hired recently, and he's never

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:08.680
used OBS. He's never used Linux, but he's totally on board with learning because he's

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:15.120
working at Linux Academy now. That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. And so he was there. I was showing

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:19.000
him how it works. Meanwhile, he was dealing with some exciting family stuff at home. And

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.760
so that was like, we were balancing all of that and everybody was super dedicated and

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:28.160
really invested in making it all work. So I just want to be there if I can when it happens.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:31.720
I don't know. I'll probably fly down if it's possible. Just to make sure that first live

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.080
stream on Linux where everybody's watching goes smooth. And then after that, I'll feel

01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:39.720
much better. We did a test stream on Friday. So I know it works, but it's a little bit

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:46.240
different when it's actually like the time where it's go time, you know, we'll see. We'll

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:50.360
see how that goes. But yeah, it was a good trip. Now I'm on the way home. And by the

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:56.720
next time we see and hear you here and see me, I'll be in the studio. I'm a little sad,

01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.920
but I'm also kind of looking forward to getting back to Seattle. I'm looking forward to it.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:05.780
It'll be nice. I miss the studio. So let's wrap it up with just a little bit of deets.

01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:09.360
If you want to support what we're doing here at the network, you go to patreon.com slash

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:13.520
Jupiter signal. If you'd like to go get more of producer Michael, check him out tux digital

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:18.880
or destination Linux. Also, you can check out our friends wimpy and poppy on the Ubuntu

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:23.880
podcast. Go check out Ubuntu podcast. It's always a great show and their adventures continue

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:27.240
here. A lot of things we talked about get picked up or continued on their show. So go

01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:32.100
get that at Ubuntu podcast. And if you want more Wes and myself, then tech snaps your

01:22:32.100 --> 01:22:36.880
show tech snap dot system will boom. How about that for all the plugs? He's like I got through

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:42.800
them all the little block of plugs ease. Also, why not join us live on a Tuesday? I'm gonna

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:46.820
just throw this out there. Come get yourself a nice healthy Linux sandwich. It's way more

01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:52.380
fun, way more fun. You see, we start out around 130 on our live stream Pacific time, we get

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:56.760
going with the unplugged show, we chat, we say things we shouldn't say, then we do the

01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:00.160
show. That's the part you just heard. And then we kind of hang out a little bit more

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:04.200
say a few more things we shouldn't say. And then that crazy cat Noah takes over and he

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:09.400
starts answering your questions live, all right here and you just sit back and absorb

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:14.200
via the process similar to osmosis, but nothing like osmosis. Thanks so much for tuning this

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:18.760
week's episode of the unplugged program. We'll be back here next week, back in the Seattle

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:22.880
studio. I'm looking forward to it actually. See you next Tuesday.

01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:59.240
All right, now we got to pick a title. Those kids are out from the movie. They're in the

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:05.220
Uber. They're on their way back to the RV. So the countdown has started. It's go time.

01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:10.840
So the EU broke the internet is currently on top one. It was a play on words. It was

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:15.840
supposed to be you broke the internet. But anyway, nevermind. Oh, I love it. Who's gonna

01:24:15.840 --> 01:24:22.720
read it like that? Who's gonna read it like that? Well me, but then I'm weird. Yeah, yeah.

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:29.920
Article 13. Unlucky for some nation scale. That hasn't been passed really yet. Okay,

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:38.220
let's not get ourselves. Fair enough. Copyright is broken and stop killing the internet. Wow.

01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:43.400
Super positive show guys, but they would actually reintroduce 20 years in a way because if you

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:49.680
really think about it, currently it's eight years plus after the author's death and these

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:55.200
new provisions would make it 20 years only. I can't though. All these are super depressing.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:25:01.720
We can't name the show that. We can't name the show EU broke the internet or stop killing

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:09.800
the internet. Ionic. Come on now. Ironic. Okay. How about this one? How about everything

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:13.600
is great? How about just everything is great? Let's just do that. Let's just do everything

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:18.200
is great. We love you. Everything is great. Everything should feel fine. Nothing's wrong

01:25:18.200 --> 01:25:24.280
here. Nothing to be concerned about. Linux unplugged 254. The longest title ever. Bury

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:42.120
your head in the sand. Yeah. Nothing to see here. How are you?
