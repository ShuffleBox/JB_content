1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
I know you were looking into how to migrate off

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,740
of Silverlight, Wes, and I've got great news for you

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,760
because a team of experts came together

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,000
and created OpenSilver.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,700
Finally, a modern, plugin-free, open-source

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,180
re-implementation of Silverlight just in time.

7
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,020
That's great.

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,040
I finally don't have to move on

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,760
and learn any sort of new HTML5-based technology.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:32,600
Hello friends, welcome in to Linux Unplugged episode 344.

11
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,440
My name is Chris.

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,400
My name is Wes.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,560
Wes, this week, your weekly Linux talk show

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,720
ended up running Windows 10.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,720
What?

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,000
It's been quite the week.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,400
We figured to round out last week's episode,

18
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,080
it'll only be fair to take a look at Windows 10

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,820
and load it up with the latest and greatest

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,480
that Microsoft has to offer

21
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,960
and how perfect it happened to coincide

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,620
with us both attending the very first WSLConf,

23
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,980
the Windows Subsystem for Linux conference.

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,180
It's really showcasing how people can get work done

25
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,500
on Windows in Linux,

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,480
or another way to put that is showcasing

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,380
some of the work they'll be able to do soon.

28
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,000
We'll tell you a little bit about that

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and what our experience has been like

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,360
at a Linux event that has put together

31
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,960
like a canonical Microsoft joint effort.

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,780
It's been something.

33
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,620
Oh yeah.

34
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,460
We've been attending this morning

35
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,720
and we'll tell you all about that.

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,240
Of course, we've got community news and some app pics,

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,480
but first I've got to say a hearty afternoon to Mr. Bacon.

38
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,320
Hello Cheesy.

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,360
Hello there.

40
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,320
How are you?

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,280
Oh, you know, pretty good.

42
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,100
Been up early.

43
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,480
We got in at 6 a.m. to do the WSLConf

44
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,520
because even though it was a Pacific Coast event

45
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,560
at Microsoft, once it went virtual,

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,520
they opened it up to the world

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,160
and so they made it East Coast time.

48
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,900
And so it started really early for us.

49
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,080
At 6 a.m. this morning?

50
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,520
Yeah, your boys have been podcasting since 6 a.m.

51
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,840
Is it still going on?

52
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,040
Yeah, it's still going on right now,

53
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,040
but we hit the old pause button to do this

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,440
and then it continues tomorrow

55
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,280
and we'll be attending again.

56
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,680
So definitely still time to catch it,

57
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,560
sign up, go check it out live if you want.

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,400
Yeah.

59
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,520
And also a huge time appropriate greetings

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,460
to our virtual lug.

61
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,300
Hello Mumble Room.

62
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,140
Hello.

63
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,960
Hey.

64
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
Hey.

65
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,640
Hello.

66
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,460
Hello.

67
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,300
Howdy.

68
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,560
Well, howdy to Ace Nomad, Brent, Bight, Carl,

69
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,120
Computer Kid, Frank, Colonel, Neon Popey,

70
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Stefan, Stewin, Tech Mav, Tyler, and Mr. Wimpy.

71
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,160
Hello you all.

72
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,000
It's so good to see you.

73
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,820
Wow, what a crowd.

74
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,340
We've been, have you been WSLing Popey or Wimpy?

75
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,380
I've had it on in the background

76
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,120
while I've been doing my other work, yes.

77
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,200
Yes, yes.

78
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,320
I've actually been sitting here

79
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,980
and paying quite a bit of attention to it

80
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,920
and cutting some clips and whatnot,

81
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,600
which is one of the nice things of it being virtual

82
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,760
is it's actually pretty easy for us to get audio.

83
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,600
A lot less work.

84
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,960
Yeah, probably the easiest conference I have ever attended.

85
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,280
Yeah, but we'll get to that in a moment.

86
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,840
First, I wanna cover something that Jim Salter posted about

87
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,040
over at Ars Technica,

88
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,940
and that is the ZFS Snapshot support

89
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,060
that is landing in Ubuntu 2004.

90
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,160
This is something you and I have been speculating a lot

91
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,520
about where is this gonna go?

92
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,600
And we've gotten some indications over the last few months

93
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,160
about Snapshots getting built

94
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,160
into the package management system of Ubuntu,

95
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,780
so that way when you install a package,

96
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,480
before that package is actually installed

97
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,640
or the change is executed, a Snapshot is taken.

98
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,720
Right, I mean, this is functionality

99
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,000
we've been experimenting with,

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,040
totally different world over with ButterFS and Snapper.

101
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,020
It'd be nice to have it just built right in though.

102
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,560
And the user doesn't have to worry about it.

103
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,880
It's invoked by the package manager.

104
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,800
Exactly.

105
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,080
So Jim dug into how this works exactly.

106
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,480
He says when you first get Ubuntu installed,

107
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,300
there aren't any fresh Snapshots on the system yet,

108
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,060
but if you do say apt-get install gimp,

109
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,640
you'll see that ZSys has taken a Snapshot

110
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,960
of every data set present in the R pool,

111
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,120
and there's a lot of data sets.

112
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,280
Oh, yeah.

113
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,920
Thankfully though, having a Snapshot taken

114
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,000
prior to installing any new packages

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,760
means that something should go haywire,

116
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
which I mean, it doesn't happen that often

117
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,880
on Ubuntu these days, but it certainly can.

118
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,880
You can easily revert the system back to its prior state

119
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,520
before you had that package installed.

120
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,800
Yeah, that's nice.

121
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,840
Carving up the system into so many different data sets

122
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,080
means in turn that we can roll back

123
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,420
only those parts of the system

124
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,120
affected by the package manager.

125
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,520
You don't have to Snapshot your entire root partition

126
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,340
because you've got these data sets parceled out,

127
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,480
and that means you've got a lot more granularity and control.

128
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,960
So it's a little more complicated

129
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,720
by having more data sets,

130
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,800
but it's less complicated from a restoration standpoint.

131
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,460
And the idea in theory is that ZSys

132
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,920
is going to be managing that for you,

133
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,400
so unless something goes really wrong,

134
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,520
you don't have to worry yourself

135
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,880
about how many data sets there are.

136
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,280
Yeah, that's kind of the whole thing that's nice about it

137
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,800
is it's essentially transparent to the user

138
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,480
until they need it,

139
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,340
and Dydrox tweeted back to Jim and said,

140
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,000
by the way, you can actually revert the system state

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,400
from grub, too, which is a way for a user

142
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,600
to actually just from a GUI revert back.

143
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,680
Jim had some questions around,

144
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,240
okay, I can see how you can take a Snapshot

145
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,160
and trigger that all to happen,

146
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,660
but how do I actually go back and restore that state

147
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,000
without having to go to the low level

148
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,400
and roll back each data set individually?

149
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,840
Dydrox is sort of explaining,

150
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,420
actually, we're planning to use grub for that.

151
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,120
Pobay, I know you've been playing around with 2004.

152
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,440
Have you played around with any of this stuff?

153
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,860
Did you do the experimental ZFS support,

154
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,580
or did you go extended four?

155
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,920
So I did go ZFS on my main ThinkPad,

156
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,200
so the machine I'm on right now,

157
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,920
and every so often, I apt install something.

158
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,880
Because it's clean, I've got to go through

159
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,880
and install a few things,

160
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,360
and I do that on demand as I need them.

161
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,880
Every time I do that,

162
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,320
I see the little line that says saved system state,

163
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,480
and I'm thinking, ooh, that's nice.

164
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
I haven't actually had to revert anything yet,

165
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,360
and I think Dydrox is right to point that out.

166
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,320
The whole grub thing is supposed to be the user-facing part

167
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,000
so that that whole, oh, my system is broken.

168
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,320
What on earth do I do?

169
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,160
Well, you just reboot and choose a different snapshot,

170
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,380
and then you're back in the game.

171
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,220
It's brilliant.

172
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,060
I love it.

173
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,880
Kind of makes sense,

174
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,720
instead of having to troubleshoot

175
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,560
from a possibly broken system.

176
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,280
Yeah, I think Jim's coming across it,

177
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:58,320
coming to it as someone who is deeply technical

178
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,840
and very much a ZFS expert,

179
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,680
whereas we're trying to pitch it towards people

180
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,840
who don't care about what technology is under the covers.

181
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,120
They just know that if they need to go back in time,

182
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,960
they can do.

183
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,440
Right, they might not even know it's,

184
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,280
or likely don't even know it's ZFS.

185
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,120
Right.

186
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,160
It's just happening.

187
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,960
That's fascinating and totally makes sense

188
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,400
for a broader audience.

189
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,040
Wimpy, I'm kind of curious if you have thoughts

190
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,200
on where the future of this stuff could go?

191
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,200
Well, for 2010, it's going to be all about encrypted ZFS.

192
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,960
Ooh.

193
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,120
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

194
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,480
That's great, and of course it would make sense

195
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,960
to do that in the 10 release.

196
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,120
Yeah, that's awesome.

197
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,700
Hmm, I think I'm gonna do it.

198
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,880
So we put Windows 10, I was actually,

199
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,600
so I was gonna go to 2004.

200
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,320
I had already even made the USB drive for you.

201
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,520
Yeah, yeah, like I was gonna do it after the show,

202
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,760
but then we were like, we should really round out

203
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,960
our experiences learned from Mac OS

204
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,240
with our experiences learned from Windows

205
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,580
and give it a real fair shake.

206
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,880
Try to remove as much bias as possible,

207
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,920
try to take our time setting it up right,

208
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,600
use the new Windows subsystem.

209
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,160
Actually try to get work done with it.

210
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,420
Try the new terminal, all that stuff.

211
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,960
And I didn't end up on Ubuntu as a result of that,

212
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,920
but once I take Windows off, and hint, yes,

213
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,400
I will be taking Windows off,

214
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,280
I'm gonna go with 2004, and I think I'm gonna do it.

215
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,400
I'm gonna do the ZFS.

216
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,960
It's neat to see some of this happening too.

217
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,300
I think we all speculated, all right,

218
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,180
is this gonna be an area that Ubuntu explores down the road

219
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,280
when ZFS wasn't announced,

220
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,760
as built right in way back when?

221
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,680
It's finally here, I mean, it's nice to see.

222
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,740
I agree, I agree, and gonna be fun to play around with.

223
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,040
Something to look forward to.

224
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,320
I'm trying to think of ways in which I can break my system

225
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,280
so that I can test this,

226
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,880
because it's pretty boring at the moment.

227
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,800
Nothing's broken, so it's a bit of a challenge

228
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,760
to see if I can exercise this thing.

229
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,000
You just need to write a quick script

230
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,160
that deletes random files,

231
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,740
and you know, share that with everyone.

232
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,580
Yeah, there you go.

233
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,480
I think it's a pretty great idea for a workstation.

234
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,680
I mean, obviously it's good for,

235
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,820
I mean, I think when we talk about this,

236
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,040
we're often talking about servers,

237
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,100
and updates, and stuff like that,

238
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,000
but I think it's really nice

239
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,860
for a peace of mind from a workstation.

240
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,660
Just to be able to roll back, and know like,

241
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,160
okay, maybe I'll go deal with why that upgrade failed later.

242
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,200
Right now I have work to get done.

243
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,280
Yes.

244
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,420
Oh, yeah, you know, like last night.

245
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,920
I should never do this.

246
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,520
Don't do like Chris does.

247
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,360
Oh boy.

248
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,080
But I'm having a problem with my Home Assistant app

249
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,440
on my phone, can't connect to my Home Assistant server.

250
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,800
The webpage works fine,

251
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,640
and the system has needed rebooted recently

252
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,720
a couple of times, so I thought, you know,

253
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,960
I'm just gonna do a full update.

254
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,840
It's been a little while since I've updated

255
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,000
the Raspbian install on this box,

256
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,920
and I'll get the latest Docker image,

257
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,600
and reboot, and see if everything just works.

258
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,300
Maybe I don't need to try much further than that.

259
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,720
You know, just basic troubleshooting stuff.

260
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,880
Right, update and see if it fix it.

261
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,580
Until it's like bedtime, and I'm getting up super early

262
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,940
to get in here to do WSL Conf,

263
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,160
so I'm trying to go to bed early,

264
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,520
and it's still taking forever to write the packages

265
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,840
because of the slow SD card,

266
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,800
and I think to myself, if this breaks,

267
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,280
I'm gonna be up all night fixing this.

268
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,680
Like, it's a very important system.

269
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,160
It's those things where like, I know I shouldn't do it,

270
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,120
but normally it works, so I'm just gonna take the risk

271
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,840
and do it, and then it...

272
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,920
It did work, it did work.

273
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,040
No, everything was fine.

274
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,300
It rebooted, everything was fine,

275
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,740
but the thought I had was,

276
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:11,040
oh man, I wish I had a snapshot right now.

277
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,660
I wish I would've done, because like last week,

278
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,640
I was talking, or the week before,

279
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,240
I was talking about making an image backup of it,

280
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,600
which I still haven't done.

281
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:21,360
And I was really regretting it, but everything went fine.

282
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,400
But those snapshots will just give me

283
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,680
a little bit more peace of mind.

284
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,960
All right, you're not allowed to watch anything new on Plex

285
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,040
until you've got those backups.

286
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
What about existing shows?

287
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,160
Picard's on, Picard's on.

288
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,640
I gotta watch Picard.

289
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,920
I know, it's ridiculous.

290
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,460
And to make matters worse, I'm heading off to go to Denver,

291
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,640
so it's not like I'm gonna have time to do it anytime soon.

292
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,840
Wait, you're going to Denver?

293
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,660
I'm going to Denver, Wes.

294
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,760
So it's been kind of like one of those,

295
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,280
should I go, should I not go?

296
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,360
But when I saw how successful

297
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,080
the App Center for Everyone campaign was

298
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,920
for the elementary OS guys, 190% funded.

299
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,000
They raised $19,000. Wow.

300
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,120
They're going for 10,000.

301
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,360
And I started thinking about what it is here

302
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,200
that's so appealing.

303
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,000
And I mean, there's the factor of, you know,

304
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,560
elementary OS is a proven project

305
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,400
that has delivered results for years

306
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,920
with a steady progression in improvements,

307
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,560
but they've also delivered on these sprints in the past.

308
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,780
So there's that aspect of it

309
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:19,120
that makes it pretty much a sure bet.

310
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,680
But my time on the Mac that just wrapped up

311
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,960
was so freaking like perfect

312
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,280
because it showed me how necessary

313
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,680
a healthy third-party app ecosystem really is

314
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,480
and how important developers actually paying to eat

315
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,080
and feed their families actually plays a role

316
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,120
in them staying committed and creating great software.

317
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,060
And I think I was starting to buy into,

318
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,760
well, we can have just everything that's a free ecosystem.

319
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,600
It's a utopia and it's going to be fine.

320
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
It'll just take a while.

321
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,840
And then, and then I tried a few apps

322
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,920
that are so far and above better

323
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,160
than anything that I have used in years.

324
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,480
I really had to have a think about it.

325
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,280
And then this thing lands

326
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,560
and it's so outrageously well-funded.

327
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,720
I realized this could be the spark

328
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,160
that sets off a very important fire

329
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,180
because this is a cross distribution payment backend system

330
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,820
done by a proven project.

331
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,960
And if they're successful,

332
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,680
they'll likely be others that crop up to compete with it.

333
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,080
And we'll have multiples in the market,

334
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,120
but somebody has to prove it out that it's worth it.

335
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,680
And somebody has to make something

336
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,840
that is easy for developers to digest.

337
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,240
And these guys also have a track record of doing that.

338
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,640
And I think I want to be there for whatever happens.

339
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,240
If it's a huge success

340
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,420
and it kicks off a new revolution of desktop Linux software,

341
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,160
I want to be there for that moment.

342
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,780
If it's nothing more than just watching

343
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,720
a well-organized project execute

344
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,520
on something that their community finds important,

345
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,480
I want to document that.

346
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,080
And if it's an utter failure,

347
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,280
I'd like to have insights as to why.

348
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,360
So I am packing up lady jupes.

349
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,640
I'm getting out of the COVID-19 hot zone

350
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,360
and I'm heading to Denver to document this thing.

351
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,160
I'm doing it on my own dime.

352
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,800
And I go into the rationale and all of that

353
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,560
in the Chris Last cast, chrislast.com slash nine.

354
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm going to go there, I'm going to document it,

355
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,040
I'm going to talk to the guys.

356
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,760
I'm going to wrap my head around what they're doing

357
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,080
because I think, especially after my recent time

358
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,200
visiting the Mac, this is so important.

359
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,680
And this is the first step.

360
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,620
If they're successful, others will follow.

361
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,640
And then we will have ourselves a real functioning system

362
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,520
that it gives developers a path to monetization

363
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,440
to create high quality software

364
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,280
that can run on top of our free operating system.

365
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,480
And I think there's something amazing about that,

366
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,180
that this free operating system

367
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,220
could become a viable economic platform

368
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,720
for people to feed themselves.

369
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,740
I want to see it.

370
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,220
So I'm paying for it myself.

371
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,080
It's not a work function.

372
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,600
It's not really something that I think work

373
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,720
probably is very interested in.

374
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,400
It's not really in the core area of their interest,

375
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,740
but I think it's important.

376
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,920
Hey, I'm glad I'm going to live vicariously through you

377
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,760
because you're right.

378
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,280
I mean, the elementary project and Dan and Cassidy

379
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,400
as developers and creators who, you know,

380
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,840
obviously love the Linux platform

381
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,760
and are trying to build things for it,

382
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,640
they get those problems of, well, how do I get money?

383
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,000
What framework do I target?

384
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,640
How do I even build an app that's going to work

385
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,840
with all the things that I need?

386
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,120
I think they're a great team

387
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,120
to try to take on this challenge.

388
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,680
A hundred percent funded on day four,

389
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,980
619 backers when I checked.

390
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,720
That's pretty big.

391
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,240
And this is the only way we're ever going to beat the Mac.

392
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,520
If you want to be, if you want to become a popular platform

393
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,520
for the average user, you got to get there.

394
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,400
It's, you know, I think it's,

395
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,400
I think it's a cliche to blame marketing.

396
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
To say that it's a lack of organized marketing

397
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,440
that has prevented Linux

398
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,320
from getting adopted to the marketplace

399
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,080
is a fundamental misunderstanding

400
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,180
of what makes the market move.

401
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,480
It's wishful thinking that that's all that has to be solved.

402
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,120
The reality is, is this has to be solved first.

403
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,120
Well, and I think that there's a ton of great apps already

404
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,700
available in the App Center that are, in my opinion,

405
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,720
on a different level than a lot of the free apps

406
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,240
that you would get from any other distribution.

407
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,960
Namely like Quilter.

408
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,560
I love, I don't know if you've tried that one or not.

409
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,200
I think the developer is asking like nine bucks for it.

410
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,980
I gave them 10, but it's a Markdown editor.

411
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,280
Super clean, super efficient Markdown editor

412
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,660
with a preview toggle and a Markdown toggle.

413
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,800
I actually picked it up from the JB Telegram.

414
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,560
I was asking for an awesome Markdown editor.

415
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,240
And I think it was Shicken who had suggested it to me.

416
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,360
So I've been using that one.

417
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,960
Cassidy's got some pretty cool apps out there.

418
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,680
Palette is a pretty cool one that he's made.

419
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,400
But there's tons of apps that are already out there

420
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,560
that are excellent.

421
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,400
Really nice.

422
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,520
And I think that going forward,

423
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,960
what they're starting to create is an environment

424
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,080
where I can purchase these apps

425
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,540
and then I can reload my whatever laptop

426
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,440
and download all the apps that I've already purchased.

427
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,920
Previously, I don't mind giving to that developer again,

428
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,380
but if that app ends development,

429
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,300
at least I've already got that purchase locked down.

430
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,520
I try to make some examples of what I think are apps

431
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,840
that just could not be replicated on the Linux side

432
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,880
in that Chris Lastcast.

433
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,200
So if you think I'm wrong,

434
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,980
I first encourage you to check out episode nine,

435
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,040
because I think I make the case of applications

436
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,660
that are the prime example of things that you could only have

437
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,600
if there was a monetization path.

438
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,920
Well, that is the stability too.

439
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,040
It's monetization and knowing that this platform

440
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,880
is going to be around.

441
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,920
I can enter here and I'll get some stuff back.

442
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,520
And it's not all going to change out from under me.

443
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,600
I can build a long-term customer base.

444
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,640
That's really important.

445
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,100
There's a culture shift that has to happen along with that.

446
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,920
And that is that Linux users are willing to pay for software,

447
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,680
but it's a chicken and the egg problem right now.

448
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,600
And the advantage that the elementary OS guys have

449
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,560
that I see over previous projects,

450
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,960
and I'd like to get Popey's take on this here in a second,

451
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,200
is they are well-liked throughout the community.

452
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,920
They have good standing and they're creating something

453
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,000
that is going to be generally available.

454
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,240
It's not just distribution-specific here.

455
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,160
And I think maybe that might be some

456
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,560
of the fundamental difference here.

457
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,760
Popey, what do you think?

458
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,080
Yeah, they also have a solid developer story,

459
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,280
which we've got some experience of making a paid app store

460
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,960
in that we did it back in the 1204 days.

461
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,200
And we didn't have a solid developer story.

462
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,920
It was build a dev of anything and submit it

463
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,320
to the store and we'll review it

464
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,360
and maybe it'll go in, maybe it won't.

465
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,920
And while there were paid apps in there,

466
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,200
it was a mishmash of basically awful applications.

467
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,120
There wasn't anything really compelling.

468
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,520
And I think because the elementary guys

469
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,120
have set their bar quite high for their expectations

470
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,960
and they've set that their documentation is solid

471
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,760
and they've made opinionated choices

472
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,740
about what you need to do in order

473
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,640
to be accepted in the store.

474
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,520
I think they're going to end up with a bunch

475
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,720
of beautiful functional applications

476
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,560
that developers will get paid for.

477
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,160
Whether they get paid enough

478
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,440
and whether they get enough apps

479
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,600
is the thing we can only tell by doing this for years

480
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
and looking back on it.

481
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,440
I agree.

482
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,840
I think that's the yet to be seen.

483
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,480
And if it will be enough to stop the natural momentum

484
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,480
towards just publishing things

485
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,840
as an electron application,

486
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,800
which seems to be where we're building momentum to

487
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,720
and is functional and will be generally accepted

488
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,240
by those that just need to get work done,

489
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,520
especially those in an enterprise environment,

490
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,440
but it's not ideal in all cases.

491
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,280
I think it's fine for some applications,

492
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,520
but I don't think it's ideal for all applications.

493
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,920
And that's why I really would like to see

494
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,880
a healthy native application ecosystem.

495
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,340
Even if we could only point to a dozen to 30

496
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,480
semi-healthy applications that have been monetized.

497
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,140
Like right now, when I think about applications

498
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,680
that take direct money

499
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,580
in the traditional sales transactional sense,

500
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,140
I know I'm wrong on this,

501
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,880
but the only commercial application I can think of

502
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,680
off the top of my head is Crossover,

503
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,880
where you download it on Linux,

504
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,800
you get a 30-day trial,

505
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,280
and then you pay your 50 bucks or whatever it is.

506
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,700
Well, there are certainly paid apps

507
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,240
in other Linux app stores.

508
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,560
Sure, sure.

509
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:01,080
The monetization system is something that already existed

510
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,240
that the software vendor has implemented.

511
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,640
It's not implemented in the store.

512
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,240
So you pay a monthly fee for Spotify,

513
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,200
or you pay a fee for Slack or Skype,

514
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,720
but they all have their own ways

515
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
of taking their funds out of you,

516
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,440
which doesn't benefit the distro.

517
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,960
Whereas what elementary are doing

518
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,000
ensures that it's sustaining the distro

519
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,520
as well as the developer.

520
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,560
Great point.

521
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,040
Yeah, services have really kind of brought

522
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,880
a whole new wave of applications to Linux

523
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,120
because when you're monetizing as a service,

524
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,040
you want to bring on as many users as you can.

525
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,480
So that that shift in monetization strategy

526
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,480
has actually benefited Linux users to some degree,

527
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,960
but I'm sick and tired of it.

528
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,480
I'm so sick of subscriptions.

529
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,720
I've been thinking like Hediana,

530
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,660
when we get back from Denver,

531
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,360
we're gonna have a calling where we just sit down

532
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,800
and look at all those subscriptions right now

533
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,640
and cancel stuff.

534
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,460
It's like you need some subscription service

535
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,920
to manage all your subscription services.

536
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,800
There is one.

537
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,240
I saw it advertised on Twitter.

538
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,060
There is one.

539
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,520
We'll give that a try.

540
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,800
Yeah, just needs access to everything real quick

541
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,640
to do that.

542
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,680
So no bigs, right?

543
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,880
No bigs.

544
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,760
Anyways, I'm very excited about it.

545
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,680
One of the things that we haven't really talked about

546
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,440
and it's kind of a concern to me

547
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,920
is how the community itself is gonna react.

548
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,480
Obviously, I hope that this is kind of a change

549
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,280
in which the community doesn't always have to

550
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
have something that's free,

551
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,040
that they can actually donate to something,

552
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:27,880
donate to a project and help push these developers forward

553
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,640
and instead of, I guess, expecting it to always be free.

554
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,840
I think there will be a negative reaction though

555
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,600
from a portion of the community.

556
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,460
And I think that's one of the reasons I want to go.

557
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,600
So that way, when I'm having a conversation about it,

558
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,440
I have that on the ground insight into this.

559
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,600
Plus, I think it's just really good to just reestablish

560
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,560
in-person connections with this team

561
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,000
and with all of the events getting canceled.

562
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,480
There won't be an opportunity likely this year

563
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,080
to actually go see Dan and Cassidy.

564
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,200
Get it while you can.

565
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,380
Are you really just going down there

566
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,000
so that you can get your hoodie early?

567
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,960
Yeah, they better have them.

568
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,120
Swag pickup.

569
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,960
Right.

570
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,720
Yeah, I suppose, full disclaimer, I was a backer,

571
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,040
but I think I said that earlier.

572
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,840
So we'll see where it goes.

573
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,480
I think it's still going to be good for me to do it

574
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,280
and I'll talk about it here on the show

575
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,600
and let you guys know how it went.

576
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,080
I'm excited for them though.

577
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,880
I think it's pretty tremendous that they got $19,000

578
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,600
and it didn't quite make their next stretch goal,

579
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,140
but I think they'll still be able to put that money

580
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,000
to really good use.

581
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,800
And one of the things that I think also was a takeaway.

582
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, I want to mention this too.

583
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,160
I know I'm going on about this,

584
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,600
but I think there's a lot to learn here.

585
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,460
I think there's things for other distributions

586
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,200
to pay attention here that are working for them.

587
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,040
Think about this.

588
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,680
How many distributions do we know

589
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,600
that have a couple of full-time staff

590
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,440
and have these successfully community-funded sprints

591
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,760
where they get together as a team

592
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,400
and then produce something?

593
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,480
That sounds like Ubuntu.

594
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,320
It sounds like it's Ubuntu.

595
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,160
Sure does.

596
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,920
Fedora has Flock and there's some,

597
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,120
but they really have figured out a recipe here

598
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,160
that I think other distributions could look at

599
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,040
as a pathway to success.

600
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,160
And part of it is because of their special sauce,

601
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,040
but I think there's things to learn here.

602
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,240
And that's another reason I want to go

603
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,800
is I think there's things for other distributions

604
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,640
to learn here.

605
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,600
And I want to learn what it is.

606
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,840
And you just like Denver.

607
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,780
That's true.

608
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,620
That's true.

609
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,040
Although when I'm going through Wyoming,

610
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,240
it's supposed to get really cold.

611
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,840
We're going to be up at like 8,000 feet

612
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,460
and it's snowing right now.

613
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,040
So I'm really going to be watching the weather

614
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,880
very closely for that.

615
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,960
It's not a great time of the year.

616
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,240
You wanted an adventure, right?

617
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,240
Yeah.

618
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,640
All right, well let's do a little housekeeping.

619
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,680
You know what I just realized?

620
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,440
This is the best turnout we have ever had

621
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
after daylight savings.

622
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,480
Fantastic.

623
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,140
You all did a tremendous job.

624
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,800
Usually there's like four of you in here

625
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,640
after daylight savings.

626
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,000
No one's shown up grumpy and confused late in the show.

627
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,060
Yeah, I was going to make a special reminder

628
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,320
about daylight savings has happened now in the US.

629
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,300
And so it'll take a little while

630
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,520
before it changes everywhere else.

631
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,200
And typically it messes up everybody's live schedule,

632
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,400
but look at this rocking,

633
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,080
like it's such a great showing

634
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,040
that I didn't even cross my mind

635
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:07,920
until we got to the housekeeping.

636
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,080
So thank you everybody.

637
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,500
We do this Tuesdays, jblive.tv.

638
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,600
If all goes as planned,

639
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,620
I'll be live streaming from Denver next week.

640
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,300
I'll be remote at Denver in Lady Joops.

641
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,980
There is an RV park called the Flying Saucer.

642
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,820
I love it.

643
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,920
It's right by where they're having a sprint.

644
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,960
So just park up right there,

645
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,320
do my shows, get my work done,

646
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,040
head over to their place, do interviews.

647
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,880
It's going to be great.

648
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,260
It's just, so it's jblive.tv on a Tuesday.

649
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,320
If you want to watch that train wreck in real time,

650
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,680
because that one's going to be tricky,

651
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,800
show up next week.

652
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,040
Yeah, definitely a live one.

653
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,320
Yeah, jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar

654
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,600
for your local time zone.

655
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,680
So far, still chugging right along.

656
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,820
FOSTOC live June 20th at the Harrison,

657
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,140
which is near King's Cross in London.

658
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,900
Some of your favorite Linuxy podcasters get together

659
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,960
and have themselves a night.

660
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,020
As far as I know, it's a go.

661
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,720
Popeye and Wimpy, I believe you're going to be there.

662
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,880
I don't know otherwise.

663
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,720
Yeah.

664
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,560
It's going to be there.

665
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,380
Yeah.

666
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,220
It may change.

667
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,060
Who knows?

668
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,760
Just need to figure out what the show is going to be.

669
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Small matter of that, but other than that, yeah.

670
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,140
Pandemic pending.

671
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,720
Pandemic pending.

672
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,640
It should be going June 20th.

673
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,600
Tickets are on sale now.

674
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,440
Pay what you want for that.

675
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,800
And I hear that the Ubuntu podcast

676
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,720
is always one to catch live.

677
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,080
Set expectations there.

678
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:27,920
Thanks.

679
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,760
Yeah.

680
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,600
We've been bumped up the billing list this year.

681
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,320
I hear, Adam, if you can only catch one show in the year,

682
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,140
that's the show.

683
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,980
This is the one.

684
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,800
Oh, no.

685
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,640
And we need everyone to go.

686
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,180
I mean, we can't make it, unfortunately.

687
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,100
So go in our stead.

688
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,940
Go and tell us.

689
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:44,100
Come back on the Mumble Room, on the podcast,

690
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,880
and give us your full review.

691
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,360
Also, a plug for Linux Headlines, linuxheadlines.show.

692
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,320
Every single weekday, in three minutes or less,

693
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,120
you get the news, and it's great.

694
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,240
It's a great way to stay up to date.

695
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,460
And then last but not least, join us on our Telegram

696
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,920
at telegram.com slash.

697
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
No.

698
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,720
No.

699
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,840
It's probably something like that.

700
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,320
But it's Jupiterbroadcasting.com.

701
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:05,920
Have you heard of that?

702
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,840
Slash Telegram.

703
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,400
Have you heard of that, Wes?

704
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,040
Oh, yeah.

705
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,640
You're familiar with that?

706
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,140
Yeah.

707
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,640
You know, Headlines is no joke.

708
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,200
I try to stay up on the news, but already twice this week,

709
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,320
I've learned things from Headlines.

710
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,040
I know.

711
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,080
It's quite the system.

712
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,120
Things I needed to know.

713
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,920
All right.

714
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,040
So our ThinkPads have Windows 10 installed on them.

715
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,840
Now, you have a dual boot, right?

716
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,320
Oh, yeah.

717
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,160
Of course I do.

718
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,680
I went all in.

719
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I did it 100%.

720
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,680
And then what I was thinking I might do later

721
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,120
is when I go 2004, just resize the main partition

722
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
and maybe keep them on there.

723
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:36,800
It's a nice way to handle, too.

724
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,920
See how Montu's installer does with that.

725
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,120
Yeah, exactly.

726
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,040
And what do I care?

727
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,400
I mean, it'll handle it great, of course.

728
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,520
Well, and if it doesn't, could not care less.

729
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,920
Hey, I installed that.

730
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,480
So I think we should start with WSLconf,

731
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,920
because that's going on right now as we record.

732
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,600
And then we should loop back and, I think,

733
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,840
talk about our Windows 10 experiences,

734
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,640
because a lot of it's centered around WSL, which is, of course,

735
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,400
as you guys probably know, the Windows subsystem for Linux.

736
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,960
And starting with version 2, which

737
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,880
is rolling out on the Insider builds right now.

738
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,920
So if you want to go get all up to date,

739
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,560
you can grab an Insider ISO that is already

740
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,200
at a build number high enough now

741
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,560
that you can just install WSL2.

742
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,600
The key thing, and there's a lot to it,

743
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,640
but the key thing about WSL2 to take away is it's much faster

744
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,560
and it's a proper tiny Hyper-V VM.

745
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,880
And to that end, the different distributions and projects

746
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,720
that ship on WSL have been working

747
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,060
to take advantage of some of these improvements.

748
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,480
And it's in a really good position right now.

749
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,680
And so Wes and I were extremely curious what

750
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,240
it's like to go attend a Linux event at the Redmond campus.

751
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:47,480
However, because of the current corona concerns,

752
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,840
it transitioned to a virtual event.

753
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,640
And very quickly, which, I mean, that's

754
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,240
difficult for any conference.

755
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,040
Side note, when all of this is over,

756
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,280
I would love to invite Hayden on the show

757
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,440
and get the scoop from him on how the hell he pulled it off.

758
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,360
Because the amount he must be working

759
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,160
and the whole team behind this event because.

760
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,800
Unbelievable to convert a in-person conference

761
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,960
at the Redmond campus into a virtual event

762
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,280
with presentations and hundreds of attendees.

763
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,320
Way more viewers now.

764
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,800
I got to get the story on that.

765
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,960
But I figured I wasn't even going to ask him right now.

766
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,880
Because he's just trying to get through the event.

767
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,480
It's still going on right now.

768
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,440
And I was very impressed because they pulled it off.

769
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,640
And they ended up using Red Hat's blue jeans for it,

770
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,680
which is the first time I'd ever used blue jeans.

771
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,280
And so I get into the studio this morning.

772
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,000
I bring it up here.

773
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,440
And I started recording some clips.

774
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,000
So that way we could share a bit of it with you.

775
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,240
And we start with an introduction and a bit of history

776
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,640
of the subsystem.

777
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,920
OK, we are live.

778
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,600
Welcome, everyone, to the first WSL Conf, now virtual.

779
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,640
Welcome, attendees.

780
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,480
Welcome, speakers who are joining us.

781
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,280
And welcome, our friends from Microsoft.

782
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Thank you for your participation and your support

783
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,200
for this event.

784
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,320
And of course, this is Hayden Barnes from Canonical.

785
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,560
Thank you, attendees, for coming out.

786
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,760
Some of you from very far-flung time zones, we appreciate it.

787
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,000
Speakers who have been flexible with us at this time,

788
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,160
adjusting from in-person to virtual to shifting time zones,

789
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,200
we know it's been a hassle, and we appreciate

790
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,320
what you've done for us to bring us everything

791
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,120
you're going to show us.

792
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,280
Thank you to Canonical for sponsoring this live stream

793
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,440
and to Microsoft for creating the WSL platform

794
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,440
that we build on.

795
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,600
We have come quite a ways on WSL, Windows Subsystem

796
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,960
for Linux.

797
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,160
Those of you may recall, Microsoft first

798
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:46,760
announced Bash on Ubuntu on Windows in 2016.

799
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,280
And then in 2017, it became Windows Subsystem for Linux,

800
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,680
WSL as we know it today, with a growing ecosystem of distros

801
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,960
on the Microsoft Store.

802
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,680
Two years later, Microsoft announced WSL 2,

803
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:08,000
and that was the version of WSL with a live Linux kernel.

804
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,880
And we are looking forward to that shipping

805
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,760
in April of 2020.

806
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,560
Just coming up here soon.

807
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:20,480
Might coincide if we make it with Ubuntu 2004.

808
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,240
Now, of course, when you go from a physical event

809
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,320
to a virtual event, you are still

810
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,240
subject to the very things that many virtual events are

811
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,320
subject to, like microphone issues.

812
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,280
Craig, we're having issues with your audio, I think.

813
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,160
And like so many presentation applications,

814
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,480
they can be buggy, plugins can crash.

815
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,880
Hello, there we go.

816
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,680
Let's try this again.

817
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,800
There we go.

818
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,680
I had a plugin crash.

819
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,040
OK.

820
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,600
So thank you so much, Hayden.

821
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,520
So one of the things, and then he crashed again.

822
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,400
But one of the things, once Craig got going,

823
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,960
he's a program manager for WSL.

824
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,480
And Wes and I had this conversation

825
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,480
about another program manager who also presented,

826
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,800
these individuals at Microsoft really know these products.

827
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,880
I thought when I heard the term program manager,

828
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,760
I thought, oh, that's a fancy PMO.

829
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,880
They probably don't know all the technical details.

830
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,720
No, these individuals, they know the nitty-gritty details.

831
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,360
That's just it.

832
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,080
You can tell that they've worked on computers for a long time.

833
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,720
They understand what the technology is.

834
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,880
It's not just someone who's part of the business

835
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,160
mechanics behind the scenes.

836
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,120
Yeah, and I'm not just trying to blow smoke here.

837
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,280
I have had this impression when I work with Microsoft

838
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,320
individuals a couple of times that these people,

839
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,940
they know their job in a way that is not

840
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,400
typical in corporate America, if I could make that statement.

841
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,640
So somebody that's maybe not actually hands on the code

842
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,600
generally has a pretty high level

843
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
abstracted understanding of the product,

844
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,680
whereas these individuals truly understand the product.

845
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,360
And so Craig begins to explain a bit of what he does in WSL.

846
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,960
My name is Craig Lowen.

847
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,720
I am a program manager here at Microsoft

848
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,760
working on the Windows subsystem for Linux.

849
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,120
And I wanted to say welcome on the behalf of the Linux

850
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,880
community here at Microsoft.

851
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,100
We're going to be here.

852
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,200
Did you catch that part?

853
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,760
He says welcome on behalf of the Linux community at Microsoft.

854
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,520
During this presentation, something else

855
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,840
that struck both of us was that some

856
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,840
of the individuals at Microsoft are of an age

857
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,400
where they maybe have not worked there

858
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,480
before Microsoft was all in on both embracing and, I would

859
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,480
say, monetizing open source.

860
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:33,300
They've only been there since Microsoft existed in the state.

861
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,960
They were not there in the bad old days.

862
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,960
This is the only Microsoft they know.

863
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,800
And there's something just that really strikes me

864
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,240
about that, because it sort of shows

865
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,680
like a new era of people that have entered the company

866
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,720
in the last five years.

867
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,960
Because this has been a, I don't know if we're almost

868
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,600
into an eight, nine year transition now.

869
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,200
And people that have joined in the last five day years

870
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,800
have existed in this giant organization

871
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,320
in its current state.

872
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,000
And Force, and in the chat, as well as listening to you,

873
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,960
if you have any feedback, we are also at linuxatmicrosoft.com.

874
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,640
So you can send us an email there and talk to us.

875
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,400
And thank you so much for coming out.

876
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,360
We're really excited for this event,

877
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,440
barring the technical instructions that we just had.

878
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,120
And we're here to talk about the Windows subsystem

879
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,000
for Linux, WSL.

880
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,480
This is something that I work on directly.

881
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:31,000
I hand a lot of the feedback and talk about WSL all the time.

882
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,960
So for me personally, it's awesome to be here

883
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:37,600
and to hear exactly why you're using WSL 4,

884
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,640
what your feedback is, and how we can improve it.

885
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,480
And we're excited to be talking about all the new stuff

886
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:48,400
coming out with WSL, with WSL 2 coming out soon,

887
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,440
and all of the details with that,

888
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:54,000
as well as all the exciting new features coming up with WSL.

889
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,520
In fact, as different contributors added,

890
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,080
what they are changing, like Docker, for example,

891
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,720
maybe some of the most significant changes

892
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,000
are coming to Docker.

893
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,480
Docker on Windows is transitioning to using

894
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,280
the kernel that's built in WSL 2,

895
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,360
instead of shipping their own kernel now.

896
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,480
That's massive.

897
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,320
It's a huge reduction.

898
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,000
It's a big architecture change, yeah.

899
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,520
It's a big reduction in complications,

900
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,120
is what I was going to say, but it's also,

901
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,800
it means Docker is no longer responsible

902
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,640
for shipping their own kernel.

903
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,680
They'll use the built-in subsystem stuff,

904
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,080
which will have obvious performance advantages.

905
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,560
As Craig wraps up, he added.

906
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,440
And I kind of wanted to give a Microsoft showcase

907
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,720
or highlight reel of the Linux activity going along

908
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,720
inside of Microsoft besides just WSL.

909
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,480
And he goes off a litany of projects

910
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,200
that they're working on that are open source

911
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,800
and individuals that are using Linux inside Microsoft.

912
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,840
And then he wraps up with a bit of a shout out

913
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,120
to the Linux community.

914
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:50,640
So that's kind of the Microsoft core ecosystem

915
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,640
of people that are building directly on WSL.

916
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,200
There's also tons of other stuff going on

917
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,600
with the WSL community, beyond just what's going on here

918
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,280
at Microsoft specifically.

919
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,560
There's all the distros that are running on it.

920
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,360
Thank you to all of our distros, like definitely Canonical

921
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,880
as well as OpenSUSE Alpine, Penguin, Debian, and more

922
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,360
who allow all of your Linux binaries to run

923
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,840
on the WSL platform as well, and Kali for sure,

924
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,880
as well as WSL utilities, Docker desktop,

925
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,200
which is building an experimental engine

926
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,200
that uses WSL2 into their Docker desktop for Windows client.

927
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,680
These are all people who are directly innovating on WSL.

928
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,360
Yeah, a lot of software that makes it so simple

929
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,800
to develop software for Linux that you never,

930
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,600
but you never have to leave the Windows environment.

931
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,080
Yeah, it's a little scary, spooky almost.

932
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,040
I mean, we were watching a presentation about C++

933
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,680
where they've just turned Visual Studio

934
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,800
into an integrated GDB enabled debugger.

935
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,600
And it's like the best visual interface

936
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
to GDB you could ever want.

937
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,240
Oh, you want to use GCC and CMake?

938
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,760
That's fine, that's no problem.

939
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,840
You're empowered to target Linux

940
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,680
from these very powerful Windows tools.

941
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,320
And you see some of Microsoft's competencies, I think,

942
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,680
that we on the Linux side have kind of,

943
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,080
maybe not ignored, but didn't interface with directly

944
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,600
because that was for building Windows things

945
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,880
that we weren't interested.

946
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,360
And suddenly those are all just unleashed

947
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,600
to target our platform.

948
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,160
What triggered me and really struck me

949
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,040
is when I realized that the example they were given

950
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,760
where they were building an application,

951
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,240
they were building a Linux only application

952
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,320
in Visual Studio.

953
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,640
And then the presenter, she was like,

954
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,640
and then we could also, if we wanted to,

955
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,120
if you wanted to target Windows, you can.

956
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,560
And it's like, wait a minute, wow.

957
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,160
And I thought, well, this just makes it possible

958
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,840
to do all your Linux development

959
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,680
and you never have to run a Linux desktop, ho hum.

960
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,280
But I actually don't think these were ever people

961
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,040
that were likely to switch to the Linux desktop

962
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,440
to begin with.

963
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,000
There is, and we all know this to be true,

964
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
an entire world of free software, open source and Linux

965
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,280
that exists that people make lots of money off of

966
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,440
that doesn't involve the desktop world.

967
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,040
You could be employed to write free software

968
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,840
and never run desktop Linux.

969
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,200
In fact, presenters who are contributors

970
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,200
to multiple distributions like Gentoo and Kali Linux

971
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,560
were running Mac OS and they were just running everything

972
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,640
under VMs and Docker containers.

973
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,960
Yeah, I think it's a sort of pragmatism

974
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,440
we need to be more comfortable with.

975
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,040
You know, there's things we kind of want to reactionarily.

976
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,400
There's things we want and there's the way

977
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,440
things actually are.

978
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,000
Right, yeah, exactly.

979
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,840
Here's reality.

980
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,160
And I can also imagine it's useful too,

981
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,680
I mean, just for people that, you know,

982
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,280
you might have Linux at home or you have a Chromebook

983
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,320
that you use on your couch, but your work machine's Windows

984
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,160
because that's what IT provides.

985
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
And you just have more abilities now,

986
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,120
regardless of the philosophical implications.

987
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,440
Yeah, you do have.

988
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,960
And for people that were never gonna be able

989
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,280
to switch to Linux, they can now write software for Linux.

990
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,680
And I guess that means we worry

991
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,440
that we lose a little bit of leverage, right?

992
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,400
We have less of a way to say like,

993
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,720
well, you gotta switch to Linux

994
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,880
because we've got all these tools

995
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,480
and now more and more of those are available on Windows.

996
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,320
But you're right.

997
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,520
I don't think that was really that big of a lever

998
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,560
to begin with.

999
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,120
And it's kind of a gross way to do things.

1000
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,800
You also saw different projects

1001
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,800
trying to tailor their particular project to the subsystem.

1002
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,960
So like example, the Penguin folks

1003
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,080
seem to be pivoting very hard to graphical environment,

1004
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,360
getting X applications and X FCE and Qt applications.

1005
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,840
With some impressive results.

1006
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,680
Yeah, that seemed to be a big focus for them.

1007
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,920
So that's, and then Kali Linux was trying to,

1008
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,880
Kali Linux did a presentation about essentially doing

1009
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,360
your penetration testing from the subsystem,

1010
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,880
from your Windows machine,

1011
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,840
which how many corporate guys that are forced to,

1012
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,560
and gals that are forced to run Windows.

1013
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,520
Right, or you might even wanna run Windows

1014
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,000
to run some Windows specific tooling

1015
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,760
to target a Windows network.

1016
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,120
It might be easier to run the subsystem

1017
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,400
than a whole Windows VM.

1018
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,520
Obviously this event is about the subsystem,

1019
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,600
but there is another star that is shining very bright

1020
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,800
in all these conversations.

1021
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,400
And it's something Wes and I used the hell out of

1022
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,240
in this last week.

1023
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,320
And that's the new Windows Terminal.

1024
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,160
You've probably heard about

1025
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,560
their new open source Windows Terminal.

1026
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,760
It's got retro term effects, all of that.

1027
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,840
Well, the program manager, Kyla Cinnamon,

1028
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,880
joined us to talk a little bit about that.

1029
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,280
So just a quick introduction.

1030
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,440
My name is Kyla Cinnamon

1031
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,320
and I am the program manager on Windows Terminal.

1032
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
So I work with Terminal every day,

1033
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,200
working with the community, working with developers.

1034
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,880
And we just wanna make the Terminal

1035
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,440
the best command line experience on Windows.

1036
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,920
And boy, is it just in every single demo.

1037
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,600
And I've been using the crap out of it.

1038
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,360
So I wanna talk about your experience

1039
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,640
with the Windows Terminal a little bit more.

1040
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,420
But it's so obvious how this plays

1041
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,840
into their overall strategy for developers now.

1042
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,440
It's what they're doing almost wouldn't be possible

1043
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,680
without this new Windows Terminal.

1044
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,760
It's such a key strategic piece of software

1045
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,440
because one of the essential things it does

1046
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,360
is this tab system allows you to jump right into a system.

1047
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,100
So for example, on my machine,

1048
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,640
when I start the Windows Terminal right now,

1049
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,200
it starts in an Ubuntu Abash environment,

1050
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,580
which is just fantastic.

1051
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,920
This is another area where is it suddenly easier

1052
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,160
to develop for multiple Linux environments

1053
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,040
from Windows than it is on Linux?

1054
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,320
I mean, you can set up charutes and all those things,

1055
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,060
but this is a tab.

1056
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,100
It quite frankly is.

1057
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:10,920
I have three different Linux distributions installed

1058
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,200
and I have each one of them in a tab.

1059
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
I mean, isn't that something?

1060
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,660
So Hayden comes back on in a bit

1061
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,360
and talks a little more about Ubuntu

1062
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,480
on the subsystem in 2020.

1063
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,240
On Ubuntu on WSL, we are moving towards Ubuntu 2004,

1064
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,320
Focal Fossa, that is the next major Ubuntu LTS,

1065
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,340
long-term support release.

1066
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:35,720
And those are the Ubuntu releases we release for WSL.

1067
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,240
You've probably seen 16.04, 18.04,

1068
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,360
while 20.04 is coming next, that's in April of 2020.

1069
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,440
18.04 under WSL 2 is what I was using for this week,

1070
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,000
but Hayden shares a little bit of the roadmap

1071
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,300
and you can get a feel from his statements here

1072
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,140
how seriously Canonical is taking the Windows subsystem

1073
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,000
for Linux as a target for Ubuntu.

1074
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,120
Ubuntu on WSL is now part

1075
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,600
of the official Ubuntu desktop roadmap.

1076
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,880
So this is very much part of the fabric of Ubuntu now.

1077
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,000
Ubuntu has been staffing up its WSL efforts,

1078
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,000
including the addition of Suhini Roy, the product manager,

1079
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,960
myself and engineering staff.

1080
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,160
Since we had to bail a little early,

1081
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,200
I don't feel like I have a complete take on the event

1082
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,000
and it's gonna continue tomorrow.

1083
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,880
I think overall though, it had less technical issues

1084
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,460
than you would expect if you've ever been

1085
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,280
in a company meeting where people are sharing

1086
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,240
and they have mic issues.

1087
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,440
I mean, they changed presentation software

1088
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,720
like a day before and it's working.

1089
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,560
It did work.

1090
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,240
I had to remind myself to participate in the chat

1091
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,840
because there was no hallway track.

1092
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,220
And I'm typically the guy that just watches

1093
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,280
and I never say anything.

1094
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,360
I never leave a comment.

1095
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,280
I never enter anything in the chat.

1096
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,200
And I had to remind myself, you gotta say something

1097
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,560
because this is the hallway track.

1098
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,800
That's all you're gonna get.

1099
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,280
Which I guess I feel like it was a,

1100
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,240
the information was conveyed,

1101
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,520
but the spirit of the event was a little muted

1102
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,960
because it's different when you're presenting

1103
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,680
at your computer with a webcam and a headset

1104
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,400
than when you're up in front of a room full of people.

1105
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,760
You don't have 40 eyes staring at you.

1106
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,120
There's a different energy for better or for worse,

1107
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,000
quite honestly.

1108
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,080
And there's just a different cadence.

1109
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,680
Like there maybe was more time in the schedule

1110
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,880
than necessary because everybody didn't need

1111
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,120
to move around and didn't have to swap out presenters

1112
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,480
and set up laptops and get projectors working.

1113
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,160
Everybody just pretty much for the most part

1114
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,960
just clicked on and started talking,

1115
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,320
which was great.

1116
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:38,720
It felt very low key, but very informational.

1117
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,600
And it felt like it was definitely targeted

1118
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,440
at the right crowd.

1119
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,400
People were getting a lot of good stuff

1120
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,240
out of every presentation.

1121
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:49,280
And I got a good sense of just how rich this ecosystem is.

1122
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,520
I think seeing the demonstration of Kubernetes

1123
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,600
and Ansible on WSL, it started like,

1124
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,000
oh, this is once this gets on Windows.

1125
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,600
And by the way, those demos were on Windows Server.

1126
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,480
Once this gets wider deployed on Windows Server,

1127
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,320
this could be a big deal.

1128
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,360
It's really becoming a legitimate target,

1129
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,600
not just for development.

1130
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,240
Yeah.

1131
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
We'll see how tomorrow goes,

1132
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,640
but I feel like I've learned a bit.

1133
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,960
Now let's talk about having actually used it.

1134
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,000
Because having actually used it,

1135
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,560
I'm not switching away from Linux anytime soon.

1136
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,160
It felt like something I would use

1137
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,640
if I didn't have any other option.

1138
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,720
I mean, here's the thing.

1139
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,120
To use it, you have to first use Windows.

1140
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,520
And you can't get around that.

1141
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,880
Let's start there.

1142
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,160
I didn't enjoy this as much as I was hoping I would.

1143
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,960
I thought maybe the time away coming back,

1144
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,920
I'd kind of like it a little bit more.

1145
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,640
First and foremost,

1146
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,320
the first thing that I always have to deal with

1147
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,040
on a Windows machine after I set it up

1148
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,120
is there's just way too many power options.

1149
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,440
Just way too much going on.

1150
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,640
The defaults are dumb.

1151
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,160
And then there's different sleep modes.

1152
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,160
There's sleep, there's hybrid sleep,

1153
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,520
there's hibernate, there's suspend.

1154
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,560
There's like fake shutdown, fastboot stuff.

1155
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,440
Yeah.

1156
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,040
It's too much.

1157
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,760
And I just hate having to fiddle with it.

1158
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,280
And the control panel is a freaking dumpster fire.

1159
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,080
However, the search has gotten pretty good.

1160
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,920
So if you just search for stuff, you find most of it.

1161
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,440
That is a nice surprise really,

1162
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,480
is I can just adopt the Linux workflow I have

1163
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,520
of Windows key and whatever I want to run.

1164
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,440
I was impressed how front and center the Linux stuff was

1165
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,280
in the Microsoft store.

1166
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,720
There's a whole Linux section.

1167
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,760
It's right there.

1168
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,480
Linux.

1169
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,440
All the Linux stuff.

1170
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,640
And I was like, whoa, they got like a big old logo,

1171
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,280
a banner for it.

1172
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,840
Like they're really embracing it.

1173
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,000
They're not hiding it at all.

1174
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,640
Right, I mean, you heard in one of those clips,

1175
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:34,000
thanking the distros for showing up.

1176
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,600
They're clearly excited about this ecosystem.

1177
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,280
If you want to go with WSL2, it's still a little rocky.

1178
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,160
It's clearly not fully released yet.

1179
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,760
Like I installed Ubuntu, but I didn't have WSL2.

1180
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,280
So then it didn't activate properly.

1181
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,640
So then I had to install WSL2,

1182
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,000
which didn't link me to the right information.

1183
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,520
I had to search for it myself.

1184
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,720
And then I had to rerun Ubuntu to get it all working.

1185
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,160
Had to be pretty dedicated to getting WSL2.

1186
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,000
That's basically it.

1187
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,400
I was like, okay, I'm really doing this.

1188
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,800
But once you have it up and installed,

1189
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,600
you got something kind of special.

1190
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,200
Like you combine that with the Windows terminal

1191
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,000
and you tell it just to jump right into the Ubuntu system.

1192
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,760
And the terminal takes longer than I'd like to launch,

1193
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,800
but once it's launched, it's fine.

1194
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,800
You know, those integrations are impressive

1195
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,880
and just something you can do when you control

1196
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,160
the whole stack that we don't always see on Linux.

1197
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,560
You know, you're just like, oh, right,

1198
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,080
you designed both parts.

1199
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,160
And so they work really well together.

1200
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,080
So I was thinking about why I didn't enjoy it as much.

1201
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,840
Because the Mac, I was like, oh, this is kind of fun.

1202
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,640
This is better than I expected, right?

1203
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,000
And what my experience so far,

1204
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,440
although it's been less time with Windows,

1205
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,560
has been this is exactly what I expected.

1206
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,840
And I had to think about it like I like to do these days.

1207
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,760
You know, I was on a walk with the old dog.

1208
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,640
Levi helps me work through these things better than you.

1209
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,480
It's always good to think about

1210
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,800
what you're gonna say before you say it.

1211
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,280
It is.

1212
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,520
I find that does fun.

1213
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,400
And also, Levi's a really good listener.

1214
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,800
You know, I get good feedback from him.

1215
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:50,840
Great questions.

1216
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,480
So Windows has really good big apps.

1217
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,840
You know, big enterprise apps, big commercial apps,

1218
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,920
like the Adobe stuff.

1219
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,760
It's got all of the standard work apps

1220
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,880
you'd need to participate in a workspace.

1221
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,680
It's got your Outlooks.

1222
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,040
It's got really good big apps.

1223
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,800
And I think if that's your need,

1224
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,680
it's sort of the, it's the champ there.

1225
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,520
And that's just something

1226
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,000
that Linux can't compete at right now

1227
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,880
because there's just not that same range of apps.

1228
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,360
But the fun little third-party tweak at utilities

1229
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:25,600
that I was poppin' like pills on Mac OS

1230
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,600
don't really quite exist the same for Windows.

1231
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,080
There's some, but they're more like fiddly little odd ones

1232
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,400
that look like Windows apps from 100 years ago

1233
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,120
or they're laced with totally wicked wild UIs.

1234
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:41,000
And they don't feel so much like clever tools

1235
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,360
that take advantage of built-in hidden API features

1236
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,800
that are ingrained into the OS.

1237
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,200
They feel more like hardcore tweaks

1238
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,720
that are altering the way Windows works.

1239
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,560
Right, I mean, you're like,

1240
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,040
this is kind of a hack, isn't it?

1241
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,920
It works, but it's kind of a hack.

1242
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,280
And they're just, they're not as fun.

1243
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,280
I know that seems silly, but,

1244
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,880
so on the Mac, and like it is when I distro hop

1245
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,560
every single time, and I think that's one of the reasons

1246
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,200
I like it, it's like a fun exploration

1247
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,400
of, oh, I can do this, oh, I can do this.

1248
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,880
Like every time I switch back to a desktop environment

1249
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:14,960
that I haven't used in years,

1250
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,640
when we recently tried Cinnamon, for example,

1251
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,120
I was like, oh yeah, I can do this.

1252
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,580
Oh, this is great.

1253
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,160
That's not how I feel in Windows.

1254
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,920
In Windows, it feels like a damn task.

1255
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,800
Like, oh, I've got to do this.

1256
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,600
Oh, now I've got to do this.

1257
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,000
Oh, now I've got to do this.

1258
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,720
And then once I get through all that crap, I have it.

1259
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,800
And it's okay, it's fine.

1260
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,600
It's got multiple virtual desktops now,

1261
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,560
which I think is pretty good.

1262
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,840
It's got, I could slam Windows into corners

1263
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,040
using the keyboard commands.

1264
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,680
It's, you know, it's funny enough,

1265
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,160
it's pretty good at doing Windows.

1266
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,600
Windows are fast, it pops them right up on the screen.

1267
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,360
We've had that nice snapping support for a long time now.

1268
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:55,080
Yeah, so once you get through the slog,

1269
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,720
well, all right, okay, all right.

1270
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,040
I mean, like the updates are still unpleasant.

1271
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,040
So much hasn't changed.

1272
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,320
And if anything, the settings

1273
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,520
and like control panel stuff is worse now.

1274
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,360
Yeah, and the file system's underwhelming,

1275
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,600
which it does matter to me.

1276
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,360
It doesn't matter to most users, but it matters to me.

1277
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:13,320
So I was trying to think of what I could learn.

1278
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,300
Like what I learned on the Mac experience

1279
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,240
was that Linux needs a healthy third-party app ecosystem

1280
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,880
if we want to avoid an Electron future.

1281
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,040
And I was trying to think, okay,

1282
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,640
well, what am I learning from the Windows experience?

1283
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,240
And what I'm learning from the Windows experience

1284
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,500
is we need to be a good tool for people.

1285
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,280
We need to provide a good utility

1286
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,600
that is predictable and reliable.

1287
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,360
But I think we're gonna get there in our own way

1288
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,280
with things like snapshots

1289
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,820
and the different kind of like improvements

1290
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,360
that we're seeing to the desktop environments,

1291
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,380
especially Gnome Shell and Plasma,

1292
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,420
and some of the app picks we're about to talk about.

1293
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,560
We're gonna get there,

1294
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,600
but we're getting there in sort of the Linux way,

1295
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,440
where Windows sort of started from that point.

1296
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,240
They started as a business purpose OS.

1297
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,000
And when you look at it from that way,

1298
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,040
when you look at what the whole point of the NT desktop was,

1299
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,120
it was to be a business workstation.

1300
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:01,480
And it makes a little more sense,

1301
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,280
especially when you consider the history of XP

1302
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,040
and how long it was around.

1303
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,960
Yeah, I don't know how we compete with that

1304
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:08,640
other than just trying to make our tools better,

1305
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,480
trying to make it a better and better workstation.

1306
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:13,200
Right, and there are those users that see already,

1307
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,920
Linux can get out of your way a little bit more

1308
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,340
than Windows can, and it might become more popular.

1309
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:21,660
So by then, they have a pretty decent multiple desktop,

1310
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,760
virtual desktop implementation, don't they?

1311
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,120
Yeah, but I find myself not using it that much.

1312
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:32,120
I'm more a guy of multiple screens and use it that way.

1313
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,640
I think when I just use Windows,

1314
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,080
I kind of don't think to use it.

1315
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:38,920
So I intentionally put some of my chat applications

1316
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:39,900
on different desktops,

1317
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,640
so that way I had to move over to see them.

1318
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,480
Get used to it.

1319
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,120
Get a terminal on a different one.

1320
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,360
So I think I could build the habit up

1321
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,320
just like I have on other desktop environments.

1322
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,320
And it's nice that it is built in,

1323
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:52,760
and it is a very quick, it's high performance.

1324
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,240
They're thinking way back to Windows.

1325
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,600
I will say it feels very stable.

1326
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,960
There's no weird lag in Explorer anymore,

1327
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,800
random problems.

1328
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,520
Well, we both are using fresh installs, though.

1329
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,400
That's a caveat.

1330
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,360
Okay, yeah, true.

1331
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:07,080
One week's not really enough to turn everything up.

1332
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,840
If we were doing this, if this was a year-long thing,

1333
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,480
which we could not survive, but if it was,

1334
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,360
there's no way it'd be as performant as it is, right?

1335
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,600
Isn't that just sort of, isn't that still true with Windows?

1336
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,640
I guess we're gonna have to find out.

1337
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,160
Well, I mean, you'd have to use it.

1338
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,000
I don't want to.

1339
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,480
I don't really want to.

1340
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,480
Do we have any volunteers from the audience?

1341
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,640
There must be people out there that,

1342
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,840
can you confirm if Windows 10 still suffers from that?

1343
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:29,840
Because I think it's just inherent

1344
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,300
to how Windows is designed, but what do I know?

1345
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,980
I guess here's another way to reframe

1346
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,240
this whole conversation that is also sort of reflective

1347
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:43,640
of my experience of WSL Conf so far.

1348
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:46,020
If you were always gonna be on the Windows platform,

1349
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:48,000
it is a better experience than it's ever been,

1350
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,300
and I say that as a bit of a Windows critic,

1351
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,380
but when you look at the work they're doing,

1352
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:54,240
their browser is competitive again.

1353
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,160
Their terminal is competitive again.

1354
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,960
The subsystem for Linux is looking

1355
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,600
like a really good piece of kit.

1356
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,320
Docker is really working on supporting the hell out of it,

1357
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,280
so essentially anything you can run in Docker,

1358
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,960
you can run on the subsystem.

1359
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,560
Canonical is focusing on it as a primary target

1360
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,120
for the Ubuntu platform.

1361
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:13,120
Kali Linux is targeting it as a primary target for them.

1362
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:16,260
It's clear that there is an ecosystem

1363
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,800
already building around this thing,

1364
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,160
and they haven't even gotten the second version out yet.

1365
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,640
So it's better than it's ever been for Windows users,

1366
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,780
and I think that's gonna lead to more Linux software.

1367
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:29,200
I think we will actually see more contributors

1368
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,600
to open source and free software

1369
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,880
because people won't have to leave their comfort zone

1370
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,640
or their mandated operating system to contribute now.

1371
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,720
I mean, it's gotta be better if more people are aware

1372
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,560
of Linux, right?

1373
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,680
You know, you start working on these Windows tooling,

1374
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,800
Linux is suddenly an easy, available, marketed option

1375
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,040
for you, and you're naturally, at some point,

1376
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,080
at least gonna wonder, oh, maybe I can use this

1377
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,000
in other areas of my life.

1378
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,320
Maybe you suddenly deploy a Raspberry Pi running Linux

1379
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,280
at home or explore the Linux desktop a little bit

1380
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,720
on that spare laptop that you have.

1381
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,460
Yeah, and you're already more familiar

1382
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:00,680
with the command line, so you've got an idea

1383
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,800
of what some of the commands are.

1384
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,240
Colonel, you have real-time follow-up

1385
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,400
on the Windows lag issue?

1386
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,200
Yeah, so due to college classes,

1387
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,760
I'm required to use Windows for certain things.

1388
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,760
I keep it in a VM, but even so, every time I run updates,

1389
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,760
it just seems to get slower and slower.

1390
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,360
I've actually taken to having a gold image

1391
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:25,620
that I then, it's the fresh install,

1392
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:30,000
and I run the updates on that, clone it off, and use it,

1393
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,360
and I snapshot that so that every time I go to run updates,

1394
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,320
it's coming from a fresh install.

1395
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:39,160
Otherwise, it starts slowing down like crazy.

1396
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,440
Interesting, okay.

1397
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,600
Yeah, I have a pretty recent build

1398
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,420
because I'm on the fast track, and I got the Insider ISO,

1399
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,160
so I haven't had to experience a lot of updates

1400
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,240
because it came pretty fresh.

1401
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:54,280
I have not this go-around played with Chocolaty,

1402
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,960
but Chocolaty is, it is like brute is to the Mac.

1403
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,420
It is a package manager for Windows,

1404
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,760
and last time around, I did a Windows test

1405
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,120
like two, three years ago.

1406
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,200
Maybe it wasn't even that long ago.

1407
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,040
Maybe a year ago, I tried out Chocolaty,

1408
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,200
and I was really impressed by it.

1409
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:12,520
Yeah, I installed it.

1410
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,680
I mean, almost just out of habit,

1411
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,120
I kind of think to myself, okay, Windows,

1412
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,320
let's get a package manager on there.

1413
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,680
And is there something like, is there like a go-to package

1414
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,200
that you install after you load it,

1415
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,760
or is it just you want to have it

1416
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,400
because you know you might call upon it?

1417
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,480
It just sort of helps complete the picture, you know?

1418
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,400
Like, I just expect that to be a part

1419
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,880
of an operating system, and I hate the sort of traditional,

1420
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,320
like, am I going to go around

1421
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,960
and go grab all these things individually?

1422
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,840
No, I can't do that.

1423
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,040
I'm not going to do that.

1424
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:43,040
And the default command prompt feels so just basic, and-

1425
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,720
I mean, they had to, that's why you needed this new terminal.

1426
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:48,480
Yeah, yeah, they really had to do this.

1427
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,640
I will say, using the new terminal,

1428
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,760
and I was trying to like,

1429
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,960
I did play around with the subsystem, obviously,

1430
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,440
but I was trying to use PowerShell 2

1431
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,320
just because, I mean, we're using Windows, right?

1432
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,800
I had to use it a little bit just to get WSL 2 working.

1433
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,680
It does, I mean, it's modern, you know?

1434
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,840
Even though there is plenty,

1435
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,060
especially in parts of the UI that has that Windows legacy,

1436
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,160
the command line is starting to feel first class.

1437
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,400
Yeah, I agree.

1438
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,040
And their new terminal adds, like,

1439
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,160
some nice search features that are similar

1440
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:22,800
to how you would search for something in a web browser.

1441
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,200
It can search back through your whole command line log.

1442
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,040
And then they've added silly things

1443
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,600
like the cool retro term.

1444
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,120
And then, of course, you can open up a terminal

1445
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,440
and have a tab that's in Ubuntu,

1446
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,640
a tab that's in Debian, and a tab that's in OpenSUSE,

1447
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,480
and a tab that's in Kali Linux,

1448
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,160
and a tab that's on the Windows command line,

1449
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:38,160
and a tab that's in PowerShell.

1450
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:39,160
It's pretty crazy.

1451
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,080
You could be running three or four Linux distros

1452
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:43,120
simultaneously.

1453
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,600
And you sit there and go, wow,

1454
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,760
that's something that's even hard to do on Linux itself.

1455
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:49,600
And look at Microsoft shipping it.

1456
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,520
Didn't really kind of make me go,

1457
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,600
well, all right, I'm done with Linux then.

1458
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,840
I'm gonna switch this.

1459
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,600
I'll do all, I love the Linux command line.

1460
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,320
I'll run it here, and I'll use the Windows UI

1461
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,680
and have all my Steam games.

1462
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,400
I thought like there was a risk of that for me

1463
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,600
because it'd be kind of nice to, you know,

1464
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,680
just have a really great desktop that has a,

1465
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,880
everybody talks about the Mac,

1466
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,080
how it's a great desktop

1467
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,320
with a real Unix terminal underneath.

1468
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,880
Well, here's a desktop with a Linux terminal underneath.

1469
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,160
No, no, it just still doesn't do it for me.

1470
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,280
It's the whole package.

1471
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,280
There's still too much Windows,

1472
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,560
and there is still weird Windows cruft lurking.

1473
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,920
You didn't have to go through the installation part,

1474
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,320
but I did.

1475
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,680
I mean, that's just unpleasant.

1476
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,600
The weird magic, the strange GUIDs everywhere.

1477
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,960
It's just such a foreign ecosystem,

1478
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,840
and I'm really grateful I don't need it.

1479
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,000
I'm glad that it's becoming more useful.

1480
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,440
That just seems like a good thing.

1481
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,600
But the dynamic is clear

1482
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,040
because we're Linux users coming to Windows,

1483
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,440
and we're going, oh, this stuff's all different.

1484
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,280
But if the situation was reversed

1485
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,120
and we were Windows users first coming to Linux,

1486
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:58,040
what they have now is so much more functional

1487
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,120
and it would be so much more appealing to me.

1488
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,240
I think for their customer base,

1489
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,760
for what they're targeting, they have fricking nailed it.

1490
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,080
And I'm not worried about it taking away Linux users

1491
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,720
because I think ultimately it'll make people

1492
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,640
more familiar with the Linux command line,

1493
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,520
and it will result in more people contributing to software.

1494
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,360
And I think ultimately it will lead to more Linux users

1495
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,720
because the Windows experience is still very much Windows,

1496
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,560
but this just shows you

1497
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,200
how much more power there is out there.

1498
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,560
And when you can tap into that,

1499
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:28,040
when you get involved in the communities,

1500
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,680
it's actually, it's just gonna be one more thing

1501
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,080
that draws people in.

1502
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,160
Kind of actually think it's a great thing overall.

1503
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:36,520
And I had a note that I wrote down like I do now

1504
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,220
on my old paper tab here, and I thought to myself,

1505
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:44,480
the way to explain what Microsoft is doing here

1506
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,480
is they say they love Linux and they love open source.

1507
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,600
But what it is is as a business,

1508
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,360
they've come up with a very clever way to monetize.

1509
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:57,920
Just like it's a cliche thing, but when this,

1510
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,500
if you wanna understand Microsoft's motivation,

1511
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,720
it comes down to one classic American cliche.

1512
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,000
And that is they are selling the picks, axes, and shovels

1513
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,720
to the gold miners.

1514
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,560
That's what they're doing.

1515
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:13,640
That's what Azure is, that's what VS Code is,

1516
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,280
that's what WSL is.

1517
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,380
They are tools for people that are in the gold rush,

1518
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,340
which is writing web applications

1519
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,240
in modern open source software.

1520
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,260
They are providing the tools.

1521
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,240
It's a brilliant strategy.

1522
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,080
It really is.

1523
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,960
And the whole thing, especially attending WSL Conf,

1524
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:32,840
is there wasn't a lot of discussion about licenses

1525
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:36,040
or philosophy, it's a pragmatic attitude.

1526
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,280
And sort of the change at Microsoft was dropping

1527
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,660
that anti-Linux philosophy and just realizing

1528
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,120
if we support more platforms,

1529
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,880
that's more places to sell our languages

1530
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,560
and our tooling and enterprise support contracts.

1531
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,600
And that's what they've done, and it's been very successful.

1532
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,240
Yes, and so their motivation is to continue this.

1533
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,160
That's their, and that's why it's not some secret plan

1534
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,000
to take over the Linux desktop and lock down everything.

1535
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,420
It's simply they wanna sell as many shovels as they can

1536
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,040
while the gold rush is in full swing,

1537
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,800
and they wanna capture that market.

1538
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,880
And by the way, have you tried Azure?

1539
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,940
Because there's some long-term revenue possibilities there,

1540
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,680
and it just, all this just plugs in real nice.

1541
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,760
I think it's a good strategy,

1542
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,280
and I think it's pretty easy to understand.

1543
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,360
And I think really the conversation

1544
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,000
around what's Microsoft's motivation

1545
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,280
and why are they doing this needs to come to an end.

1546
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,240
We just need to, we need to move past this

1547
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,000
and realize this is the new reality,

1548
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,400
because there are individuals that work at Microsoft now

1549
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,560
that have only ever worked there since it's been this way.

1550
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,840
Think about how that will over time

1551
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,100
change a company culture.

1552
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,360
It's pretty wild.

1553
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,760
It, for me, I mean, maybe I'm getting old,

1554
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,880
but I just, I remember visiting the Microsoft campus

1555
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,440
back in the late 80s, right after Windows 98 was released,

1556
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,620
things were on fire,

1557
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,840
and Microsoft was on top of the world.

1558
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,420
And they are now in a totally different position,

1559
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:58,320
and they've really figured out how to make it work for them.

1560
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,280
I'm looking forward to see what WSL day two has.

1561
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,680
Oh, yeah, I think there's a lot more to come

1562
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,880
out of this conference and the Microsoft and Linux ecosystem.

1563
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,080
Yeah, and in the meantime, in the meantime,

1564
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,040
I'm just gonna take advantage

1565
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,000
of all the great new software that'll run on Linux

1566
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,520
and be grateful for that.

1567
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,840
And when I do have to run Windows,

1568
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,760
first thing I do is get the subsystem going

1569
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,560
and get the latest Ubuntu environment installed.

1570
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,800
And I'm sitting there doing a Hapt update.

1571
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,640
And you know what?

1572
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,680
I can tell it's a little slower.

1573
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,280
It is a little bit slower, isn't it, Wes?

1574
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,560
Did you notice it's a little slower?

1575
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,400
Yeah, okay, a little bit.

1576
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,640
Yeah, it is a little bit slower, but it's there.

1577
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,280
That's how you tell it's not real.

1578
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:37,280
I'm curious of the overall impact on the Windows host

1579
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,400
when you're running all of these WSL environments

1580
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,560
in the new terminal, like you were talking about,

1581
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,520
you were running Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE,

1582
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,840
and all these distributions.

1583
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,440
How does that impact the system itself?

1584
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,480
Do you notice a significant slowdown?

1585
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,120
Do you notice some herky-jerky action going on there?

1586
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,480
So when they're just sitting there idle,

1587
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,320
and Kelly was the other one,

1588
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,640
when they're just sitting there idle,

1589
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,280
it's pretty much just whatever memory bash takes.

1590
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,240
It's very, very low impact.

1591
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,120
If you start doing a lot of things,

1592
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,760
like you start spinning up environments inside there,

1593
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,880
you start actually adding a lot of software

1594
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,720
and things like that,

1595
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,480
it seems like the performance

1596
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:20,080
kind of starts to drop off a cliff a little bit,

1597
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,640
and that was definitely prevalent

1598
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,280
in the demonstrations we saw today too.

1599
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,880
Like when they were spinning up Kubernetes clusters

1600
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,800
inside WSL, things definitely slowed down.

1601
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:33,320
Right, or if you launched all of those WSL environments

1602
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,240
and updated each one at the same time,

1603
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,480
I'm sure that would significantly impact the host.

1604
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:39,720
But to that end, like when I launched the terminal

1605
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,080
and those tabs preload,

1606
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,760
it just almost happens immediately.

1607
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,280
It's not like you're sitting there

1608
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,800
waiting for them to spin up.

1609
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,080
And I know Microsoft's done a lot of work

1610
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,000
to sort of craft a well-integrated

1611
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,240
and super minimal sort of Hyper-V setup for WSL too.

1612
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:53,240
Yeah, yeah.

1613
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:55,880
And I think you're gonna see a lot of projects

1614
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:57,520
that will shift support over for it

1615
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,720
and get serious about it.

1616
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,000
I mean, Docker Desktop looked really good,

1617
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,480
and Penguin, for example,

1618
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,000
making it super easy with an end curses.

1619
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,640
So it starts, you get in the Penguin environment,

1620
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,160
there's an end curses prompt to get X11 working,

1621
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:11,680
and you can get a full Qt development environment going

1622
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,560
with X11, XFCE, it's pretty nice.

1623
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,240
And it's all just walks you right through it.

1624
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:21,600
You don't have to be an expert on getting that stuff going.

1625
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,360
And I'm very impressed by what the different projects

1626
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,680
are doing to stay competitive.

1627
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:29,360
I think I heard that Ubuntu will officially support

1628
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,440
their distro for WSL too.

1629
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,960
Yeah, that was something Hayden touched on.

1630
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,280
It's on their roadmap now, and it's an official target.

1631
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,000
Speaking of which, I need to get Ubuntu installed

1632
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,600
on this laptop now.

1633
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,040
Maybe rather fast too.

1634
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,880
Yeah, we've got some work for after the show.

1635
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,920
Okay, so we have two pics to cover before we go.

1636
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,520
Number one is if you have been lured

1637
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,000
into using Google Photos,

1638
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,360
that handy, super useful, incredible tool

1639
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,200
called Google Photos.

1640
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,040
I mean, it is.

1641
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,240
It's so handy and easy.

1642
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,200
And if you're a pixel user, they just give you storage.

1643
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,160
Your friends are on there,

1644
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,440
so you can share albums really easily.

1645
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,640
It's the best search.

1646
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,240
Christmas tree and dog,

1647
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:08,360
and it shows me all the pictures with Levi

1648
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,240
in front of the Christmas tree.

1649
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,240
I mean, it's just something.

1650
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,800
RV, I just searched for RV,

1651
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,680
all the pictures of lady jupes just come up.

1652
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,680
It's just, so, but you know, it's gooks.

1653
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,920
And maybe you wanna switch off,

1654
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,440
but you gotta get all your photos out of there.

1655
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,480
Or maybe you just wanna have your own.

1656
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,840
For when eventually they shut it down.

1657
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,680
You wanna have your own stash?

1658
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,840
Yeah, they're gonna shut it down.

1659
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,160
Or you just want your own copy.

1660
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,120
Well, you can safely back up your Google Photos

1661
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,480
with our app pick this week.

1662
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,560
It's really simple.

1663
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,040
You can install it as a snap too,

1664
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:37,160
because our buddy, Mr. Popey snapped it up.

1665
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,360
It's called G Photo Sync.

1666
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,040
It's probably in your repo or it's a snap.

1667
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,360
It's gphotos-sync, photos with an S dash sync,

1668
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,160
just snap install gphotos sync.

1669
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,080
And then you run that and it pulls down all your photos

1670
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,920
right off the old Google Photos.

1671
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,840
You know, he's got a great post written up about this tool.

1672
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,200
My only issue is we didn't get any fun photos.

1673
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,480
Yeah.

1674
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,920
He did have one in the tweet about it.

1675
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:01,240
That's actually maybe what's his,

1676
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,440
he had a picture of his cat made me click it.

1677
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,120
So, okay, he knows what's going on.

1678
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,400
He knows what's up for the tweet.

1679
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,480
And then our second app pick this week is,

1680
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:12,440
you know, we talked a lot about Docker and WSL integration

1681
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,600
and how Windows is doing all this.

1682
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,080
Well, let's show them one better.

1683
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,800
Let's show them how Plasma does it.

1684
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,920
So this is a Plasmoid for managing your Docker containers.

1685
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,180
Now listen, I know not all of you use Docker,

1686
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,640
but this is really nice because it's a little menu

1687
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,240
right there with a graphical environment

1688
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,840
that shows you the status of your different containers.

1689
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,400
I don't know where this accent's coming from,

1690
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,320
but it won't go away.

1691
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,960
And you can start and stop them right there.

1692
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,160
You can jump into an environment.

1693
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,040
You can take notes, edit them right there.

1694
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,080
What do you think of that, Wes?

1695
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,040
Isn't that nice?

1696
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,520
Yeah, I tried to get it installed before the show.

1697
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:43,360
On your Plasma?

1698
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:45,760
Uh-huh, but it needed a couple build dependencies.

1699
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,840
And for whatever reason,

1700
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,440
the KDE Store links weren't loading.

1701
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:50,280
Damn it, Wes.

1702
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,600
But hopefully by the time you see this,

1703
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,440
you can give it a try.

1704
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,280
Because I was curious,

1705
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,840
and especially if you're only running a couple containers,

1706
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,500
you don't need any complicated management, that's perfect.

1707
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,340
I think it is.

1708
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,160
I think it's, I don't know,

1709
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,280
we'll put a link in the old show notes

1710
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,960
if you could use one of them two tools.

1711
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,480
That's where you'll get them.

1712
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:05,520
Check it out.

1713
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,720
Linuxunplugged.com slash 344.

1714
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,720
That's right there.

1715
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,040
Links to everything we talked about today.

1716
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:14,080
Well, Wes, what do you say?

1717
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,120
You about ready to pack it up

1718
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,720
and go install Ubuntu water machines

1719
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,080
and go back to the conference?

1720
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,120
More than ready.

1721
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:20,560
All right, well, we will be live, hopefully,

1722
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:21,400
if all goes as planned.

1723
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,080
I'll be from Denver.

1724
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:24,620
I'll sneak out.

1725
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,840
I'll be down there for like one day.

1726
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,160
So I'll probably spend the morning

1727
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,520
with the elementary OS guys

1728
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:30,920
and sneak out to do a lot.

1729
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:33,200
Maybe I could bring one of them with me back to the RV.

1730
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:34,520
Take a prisoner.

1731
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,200
I should, right?

1732
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,020
That'd be fun.

1733
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:38,800
So check out that at jblive.tv,

But, of course, as we always do,

1736
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,840
we'll release the edited version

1737
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,560
with the audio all cleaned up,

1738
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:50,840

And I'm at Chris Lass on the Twitter.

1747
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,840
Thanks so much for tuning in this week's episode

1748

of the Unplugged program.

1749
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,680
Oh, go check out the Ubuntu podcast.

1750
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,680
Rumor has it's coming back soon.

1751
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,520
Go get subscribed over there.

1752
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,360
Ooh.

1753
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,160
And we'll see you next Tuesday!

1754
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:28,000
The Unplugged.

1755
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:57,960
Unplugged program, 344, all right, JBtitles.com, the bot is up in the

1756
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:01,040
running and we've got lots of good title suggestions, so let's go pick our title.

1757
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:06,000
Go vote! Brent, how you holding up there in the north? Is it snowy? Is it cold? Is it all right?

1758
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,240
It's, there's lots of snow and it's always cold.

1759
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:14,160
Is it at the point where it's getting pretty old or are you still, can you enjoy it at all?

1760
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,120
You know, I will say this time of year, I really appreciate because it's, it's,

1761
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:23,440
it's longer sunny days. So I actually prefer this part of winter, you know, January and so

1762
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,920
is kind of depressive. But man, it's so sunny and there's still snow everywhere and it's just

1763
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:35,880
beautiful. So I actually decided before Linux Unplugged that I would go for a hike afterwards.

1764
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,360
So once we hang up here, I'm going for a hike.

1765
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:44,840
Nice. Good, good for you. I also have felt like the longer evenings have made a huge difference.

1766
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:47,960
Like I was just saying, I was barbecuing last night for the first time this year, I think.

1767
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:51,240
There's something about the sun being out, I sort of think to when it's going to be hot

1768
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,800
in the summer and it suddenly feels very refreshing now.

1769
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:58,800
Yeah. Oh, God, it was so nice. It was 50 degrees last night when I was out there barbecuing and

1770
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,920
it was no wind, you know, like the kind of wind where a light, you can, you can, your light doesn't

1771
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:10,000
even, you know, just stand straight up and barbecuing and sun setting. It was so nice.

1772
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,040
I was thinking to myself, why the hell am I driving to Denver? This is so nice right now.

1773
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:16,520
Wyoming's going to be just miserable.

1774
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,680
How many miles does that drive to Denver?

1775
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:22,520
Ah, I think 16.

1776
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,240
I'm on it. I'm on it.

1777
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,320
Thank you. That's the answer.

1778
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,640
A lot of gas. A lot of gas. Thankfully, the oil market is crashing right now and my trip

1779
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:35,920
will be slightly cheaper as a result. And I'm paying for it out of pocket too. So I'm very

1780
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:36,960
much watching the gas prices.

1781
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:40,640
From the studio, 1,334 miles.

1782
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,920
Do you get snow chains?

1783
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:49,120
I do not. That's what I'm, the number one concern with an underline I have is that we

1784
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:52,720
will get somewhere that requires chains. Now, last night we did a route sweep. We looked

1785
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,280
at all the webcams. We looked at all the route advisories and everything right now is, does

1786
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:01,800
not require chains, but obviously that could change any day. And that is a huge thing that

1787
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:07,040
I am concerned about and because we'll have no option but to turn around. And so, ah,

1788
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:10,360
I'm really hoping that doesn't happen, but it just depends on the weather.

1789
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,160
You said 1,334?

1790
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,160
Yeah.

1791
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:16,600
I think we should round that up to 1,337.

1792
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:22,320
And I'm going, yeah, that's right. And I'm going from like sea level to 8,000 feet and

1793
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:25,200
then I'll be going down to like 5,200 feet ultimately.

1794
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:28,960
Yeah, 11,000 is your delta in feet. That's crazy.

1795
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:34,280
Make sure to keep up on Wyoming 411. I-80 had a huge, oh my God, hundred car accident

1796
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:38,280
last week and was closed both ways. That's the exact kind of shit I don't want to have

1797
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:39,280
to deal with.

1798
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,200
You still got the, uh, the tracker going? The, the rover?

1799
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,280
No, the subscription expired. So I won't have the tracker for this trip. I know. And I went

1800
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,680
to go check it last night and their whole webpage is broken and busted. So I couldn't

1801
01:06:50,680 --> 01:07:10,120
even work.
