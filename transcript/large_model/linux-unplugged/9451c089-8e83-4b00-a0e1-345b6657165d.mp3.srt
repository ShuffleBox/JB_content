00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 17 for December 3rd, 2013.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,520
Hi everyone, and hello planet Earth! Your weekly Linux talk show welcomes you to the

3
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,080
closing act of 2013, pour yourself a cold one, and join us around the penguin-shaped

4
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:50,120
table. My name is Chris. My name is Matt. Hey Matt, here we are, episode 17, it's the

5
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,000
final hours of 2013, and it's been a big year, Matt. Oh, it's been huge. I guess this

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,040
is supposed to be the year of Steam, but now that we're coming to an end, the only thing

7
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,520
I can think about is Bitcoin. Oddly enough, yeah, I can understand. Yeah, well, yeah,

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,120
recently Bitcoin has been sitting above $1,000 right now on Bitstamp, which is where you

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,040
could actually cash out today if you wanted to. The price is $10.45. Other exchanges have

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,240
it higher. Those exchanges are full of crap, and I think it's interesting because I have

11
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,760
to hold myself back. I don't want to talk about it in the Linux Unplugged show, Matt.

12
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,360
That's all I'm thinking about. Oh yeah? Alright, so you know this week, Matt, I had a grab

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,080
bag called a Dev Random, because I'm funny like that, and I had several topics I wanted

14
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,760
to dig into, sort of suss out, and I wanted to start with some of our follow-up this week,

15
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,840
but before we get into that follow-up, I wanted to ask you, have you opened the boxes yet,

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Matt? I have. I did my, usually when I get a review item, and this is something I've

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,960
done for probably over 10 years, is I get a review item, I pop it out of the box, I

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,040
plug it in, make sure everything's working, looks good, drool for a while, then I cry

19
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,880
myself to sleep when I put it back in the box. Yesterday, Matt got three boxes from

20
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,560
System76 on his doorstep. You got the Leopard Extreme in there, and you got two laptops.

21
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,880
You got the new Kudu laptop and their Ultra Pro laptop. Can't wait to try those things

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,880
out. Oh, they're just gorgeous, gorgeous machines. Is the Leopard Extreme heavy? What's it look

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,320
like, Matt? Is it nice? I remember carrying it in the last time, and yeah, it has some

24
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,520
weight to it. That is solid hardware. You're going to be shown up on Sunday with a car

25
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,120
full of gear. That's going to be awesome. Can't wait to try that out. And we even got

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,180
a little bit of extra time to try these things out. I'm going to be banging on the Leopard

27
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,560
Extreme for like a week solid, so we'll have like an extended report on how that thing

28
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,800
performs on the big show. Well, speaking of the big show, so this week I want to talk

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,200
about Sailfish OS and the YoloPhone as sort of a follow-up. I don't know how many of you

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,440
out there, if any of you out there listen to Unplugged and don't listen to the Linux

31
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,520
Action Show, you're a crazy son of a bitch if you do that. What's the matter with you?

32
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,520
But one of the things that happened, the biggest thing that happened, we talked about Mint

33
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,760
16, mate and cinnamon edition, of the latest release from the Linux Mint project. You would

34
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,160
think that would be the thing that dominates the dialogue from the Linux Action Show audience.

35
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:14,480
No. No, pretty much everybody was talking about our coverage of YoloOS, or the YoloPhone

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,880
and Sailfish OS, and so Kyle wrote in to the Linux Action Show, and I broke into the Linux

37
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,520
Action Show's house, I ripped open their little sack they have hanging on their refrigerator

38
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,960
that holds the Linux Action Show feedback, and I stole it for this show, and so we're

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,280
going to read Kyle's email, even though it was directed to the Linux Action Show, we're

40
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,120
going to break all the rules and tie the knots together and cover it here. He writes, Hi

41
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,560
Chris, I'm sure you got more than a few of these emails this week, but hear me out. I

42
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,440
was interested to hear what you and Matt might have had to say about Yolo's launch of their

43
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,780
new phone and OS on this week's show, and I was disappointed to see you dismiss it out

44
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,680
of hand. You spent numerous segments and even a whole Linux Unplugged and Koda Radio talking

45
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,760
about Canonical's dismal mobile efforts, and when similar small groups of devs not

46
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,280
only creates a 1.0 version of their Linux-based OS, but actually ships it on non-vaporware

47
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,720
phone, you blow it off like it's no big deal and don't even bother to research some basic

48
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,560
facts about it. Sailfish OS does run Android apps. In fact, he linked us to some demos

49
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:24,120
online that show that, and it will run on Android hardware in the future. This is actually

50
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,840
one of their main strategies for expansion into China. The device has only been out for

51
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:32,740
a few days, and already community members have got Google Play Store support up and

52
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:36,800
running on it. This is exciting and just the sort of thing to expect from an enthusiastic

53
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,280
Linux community. In fact, smacks the table, Yolo's efforts to provide open source compatibility

54
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,400
for Android hardware helped out Ubuntu Mobile's efforts and represent a real contribution

55
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,700
to the open source community. Furthermore, the MakePlay Live project you got so excited

56
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:58,200
about is using Mer, which Sailfish OS is also based on, and which Jala is dedicated to supporting

57
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,080
in a similar way to how the Linux kernel gets contributions. There was a developer-oriented

58
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,880
talk by one of the Jala devs on a subreddit a while back that outlined how Sailfish OS

59
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,760
is just one aspect of their broader plans for Mer, which sounds very exciting in terms

60
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,480
of spreading Linux adoption through devices like the improv. Sorry if I came across as

61
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,680
a bit of a fanboy that Matt's always telling to settle down. I know you've probably been

62
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,720
in damage control since Amazon dropped their bomb on you, and you haven't had much time

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,880
to research the topic, but I think you might want to give Jala's a second look. At the

64
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,320
very least, I hope you review Sailfish OS once it hits the Nexus 5. On another note,

65
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,960
I can't afford to buy a new t-shirt with the cost of the international shipping, but

66
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,520
I will start a subscription on filter next week. I hope you get over the financial problems

67
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,960
on Amazon that they've dumped on you and continue making great content for the community.

68
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,720
Thanks, best, Kyle. So interesting points, Matt. What are your thoughts?

69
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,440
So here's the deal. We never said, and it's interesting how if you're not really enthusiastic

70
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,360
in a positive way, you're automatically negative. There can never be a gray area, and I noticed

71
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,600
that, because that's not what happened. What actually did happen is that, as he pointed

72
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
out, it's very early on, so at this moment in time, until I have something in front of

73
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,760
me that I can really hold on to, like say, I don't know, a Firefox OS, that I can actually

74
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,480
have an opinion on, we're at a meh moment right now, because there's nothing to really

75
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:22,680
judge. It sounds cool, but Firefox OS actually addresses a specific need. It brings low-end

76
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,640
smartphones, accessible smartphones to people that might not otherwise be in the Android

77
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
market.

78
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,840
If I understand the other side of this argument, what their point is, here's what they would

79
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,880
say to that. They would say, hey, dude, look, Sailfish OS is coming from the folks that

80
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,560
made me go, Nokia, we've got industry ties, we've got a proven track record, we've got

81
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:49,160
a community that's already built, we are here, we are the proven recipe, and we've just shipped,

82
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,720
and meanwhile, you're talking about Firefox OS and Ubuntu Touch.

83
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,200
I'm talking about something I can install on a phone and see right now. Now, again,

84
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,880
I've not researched this heavily, so if I can do that today, I'm excited. If I can't,

85
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,080
I will be excited tomorrow.

86
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,720
When Kyle says, yo, dawg, you're going to be able to install it on Nexus 5, I think

87
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,720
to myself, actually, that's when it crosses the line from interesting concept to practical

88
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
product.

89
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
Bingo.

90
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,400
It might be a limitation in just the fact that there's a lot of things to focus on these

91
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,680
days. Unless you can actually play with it, it just maybe doesn't spark that interest

92
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,240
internally. But I go back to that I think my senses from the Linux action show audience

93
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,800
and the Linux unplugged audience is there's just straight up mobile exhaustion.

94
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:45,080
Android didn't just kind of pull ahead, Android dominated everybody in a major way.

95
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,200
And not necessarily in a positive way, it just kind of happened. It's kind of like when

96
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,800
you spill something all over your keyboard, it's there.

97
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
You know what I mean?

98
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,760
It makes the deployment and the adoption rate of Windows look quaint.

99
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Oh, yeah.

100
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:03,840
And so I think in that shadow, it's hard to conjure up any genuine excitement because

101
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,080
it just seems like, it honestly seems like cavemen going up against the United States

102
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
government.

103
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,840
Oh, I wouldn't go that far. I think that once we, again, going back to, as you pointed

104
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,640
out, once we have something tangible in our hands, I can experience the performance of

105
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,800
those Android apps running on this. I can experience the flow of the phone, then I can

106
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,280
make an educated judgment based on that experience, but we're not there yet.

107
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,280
I guess.

108
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,280
He's asking me to be excited about nothing.

109
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
Okay.

110
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,680
But okay, let's say six months down the road, I can buy a Nexus 5 and guaranteed I hook

111
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,440
it up to the USB port of my computer, I flip a few buttons and I can install Sailfish OS

112
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
on it.

113
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
Sure.

114
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,200
I'm still probably not going to do it. I mean, I might do it in the sense of try it out,

115
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,600
give it my, you know, give it a go, try it for a couple of weeks, but the reality is

116
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,000
I want applications that are on Android.

117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,880
I want, if I'm going to have a mobile device, I want badass mapping. I want Waze, right?

118
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,400
I want to have all of these things that are just now come to be expected on a mobile device.

119
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,920
I want Netflix on a mobile device. For that 15 minutes where, you know, we have to wait

120
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,760
for something and I, oh my God, I got to do something to occupy my two kids who are running

121
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,600
around like crazy, let's put SpongeBob on the phone for 15 minutes and it gives me a better

122
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
piece of mind.

123
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,920
I want that on my mobile device. Can they offer that? I don't think so. And if they

124
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
can, how long do they can?

125
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,720
But do we know? But do we know yet? I mean, that's just it. I mean, and I'm not defending

126
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,420
the email, but I'm just saying, I honestly don't know. I mean, perhaps, possibly, maybe

127
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,960
it addresses something in a fashion we haven't experienced yet. If it does, that's cool.

128
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,560
But yeah, I mean, for myself, I just, because I think those are valid points, but I think

129
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,280
at the end of the day, until it's in my hands, in my universe, in my world, it's theory.

130
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,200
That doesn't mean it's theory for the developer, it just means for the end user it is.

131
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,640
Here's what they have to do. They have to make it good enough. And I think they're actually,

132
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,320
I think this is why people are really excited about Yala and Sailfish OS is I think they

133
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,360
are on the verge, like out of the gate, out of all the projects out of the gate. Because

134
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Ubuntu Touch has a bunch of phony icons that don't do anything and they're relying on their

135
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,360
community who-

136
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Doesn't really care.

137
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,280
Right, to make core functions of their operating system, right? So Yala comes along and they

138
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,440
have Sailfish OS and it's a 1.0. It's a straight up respectable 1.0. And they're like, and

139
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,460
I think these people are like, hey, you assholes, this is almost getting good enough. And I'm

140
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:29,560
not saying you have to replace Android one to one for somebody like me to switch, because

141
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:35,360
I will jump when it's, when it's all they got to do is I just got to change a few habits.

142
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
You know, I got to, I mean, I got to twist my arm a little bit, but man, I'll switch

143
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,560
to get off of Android. I, Android's doable, but I, you guys, I've documented the copious

144
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,040
amount of problems I had with Android.

145
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,400
Well, and see, that's just it. And I'm holding out hope and I would love to see this. I would

146
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,300
love to see it to where it provides me the same seamless experience, potentially even

147
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,360
a better experience than what Android does. And that includes, not only it runs Android

148
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,280
apps, but if it runs them at native speeds, performance, feel, I don't want to feel like

149
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,880
I'm running wine or something. I want it to feel good. If it does that, it very well may,

150
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,640
I don't know if it does, that's awesome. But until I see it, I have no opinion because

151
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,220
I can't judge it, you know?

152
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,680
So we, we, I want to, I want to make sure I may, I stress that I do believe we need

153
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,360
something like this. So I got the Nexus five. It's an amazing piece of hardware. It really

154
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:28,880
is great, but it, there's a creepy factor to every time I get a new Android device more

155
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,420
and more is a proprietary, it's closed up. Like now the photo management application

156
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,320
that shipped with the Nexus five is, is, is Google plus photos. Your, your, your photo

157
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,560
gallery is now integrated in with Google plus and they've deprecated the original gallery

158
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,920
app, right? And it's just abandoned where it's just totally abandoned. It totally sucks.

159
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:54,960
And so I, as, as somebody who is cognizant of these types of deficiencies, this bothers

160
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,040
me and it makes me want to switch. I don't think it ever make Joe user want to switch.

161
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,920
And this is where, this is where the fundamental lack of enthusiasm comes from for me is how

162
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,240
can I get excited about something that 70% of our audience will likely never use?

163
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,800
The same could be said for desktop Linux five years ago though. And so I would say that,

164
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,680
you know, that, that was the argument of, well, it's just a hobby operating system.

165
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,600
When obviously it's not, it's, it's a very core experience for a number of people, myself

166
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,000
included, yourself included. So I, I'm going to be, I'm going to go out on the optimistic

167
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,120
level of if it can in fact provide me with what I'm looking for, I will be its biggest

168
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,160
advocate. If it doesn't, I won't care.

169
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,120
So you're in a wait and see approach.

170
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,120
I'm a wait and see guy. Yeah. I'm very, and I look at that. It's like, I don't get too

171
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,920
bent into licensing. I prefer open source licensing, but I don't, it's not a lifestyle

172
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,600
for me. I'm not a developer. I just, I have a preference, but I'm not married to it.

173
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,320
Right. You have more security in products that use an open source license.

174
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,880
Right. Absolutely. I would prefer that. Absolutely. Hands down. We'll even take a hit on, you

175
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,960
know, user experience to a degree within reason.

176
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,960
Yeah.

177
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
Certainly.

178
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
Or the amount of hoops you might have to jump.

179
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,960
Oh yeah.

180
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,200
Yeah. I, that's where I fall down too. And I will see, we'll see, you know, all companies

181
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,880
go through their rockstar moment and then they fade and, and, and maybe as that happens

182
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,360
to Google, Android, more and more people look for alternatives. And, and by that point,

183
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,960
these operating systems and these devices will be at a stage where they've had enough

184
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,040
to R and D and development and progress for that. They're ready to pick up that slack

185
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,620
and that would be amazing. So, you know, as, as sailfish OS comes out for other, for other

186
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,400
devices that I can get my hands on, I'm totally going to check it out. I'm keeping my mind

187
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:36,560
open, but I'll be honest. Um, I couldn't, I couldn't push myself to research the Yala

188
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,440
announcement enough to like know it in and out. Like I researched it enough to know what

189
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,960
the important moments were and, and, and highlight some of those important stories in the show

190
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,760
notes. So folks wanted to go look in the show notes of last week's last, they could go get

191
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,600
that info. However, you know, myself, I was like, I, I more like wanted to cover it in

192
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,320
the show just to document the important moment for the, for the project itself and not much

193
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,120
more than that. And, and that really seemed to bother people.

194
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,840
Well, and they, it's comical because again, it's, we're victims of a, you know, we as

195
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,520
the Linux community tend to, we're almost religious about things and sometimes that's

196
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,600
not okay. I'm going to be brutally honest. It's, it's stupid. It's really annoying.

197
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,480
And quite frankly, it's, it's a real turnoff to people that aren't Linux people. I'm

198
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,520
calloused enough to where I, it's fine. Whatever. But, but regular people are looking at this

199
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,640
thinking, wow, you people are nuts. So, I mean, you know, for me, I need something tangible.

200
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm about a user experiences and that includes the benefits of the open source licensing

201
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,200
because there are, there are tangible benefits to that. So, I mean, I put that in the same

202
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,160
bucket, but a great analogy is looking at the difference between the steam box. We're

203
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,040
all really excited about that. You ask my 17 year old nephew what he's excited about

204
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,760
who was really excited about steam box last week until he saw a trailer for kill zone

205
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,440
for the PlayStation four. Right. He couldn't give a rat's butt about the box anymore because

206
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,760
something visually tangible is in front of them that he'd be like, Ooh, drool. And that's

207
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,000
what Androids got over these other operating systems. So I think we're going to have to

208
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,840
overcome that. Yeah. So yeah. Good point. All right. Well, so Kyle, when he wrote in

209
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,520
mentioned the the shirt drive with the problems we've been having with Amazon. So I got a

210
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,800
little update. We had a lot of people say, Hey guys, love the shirt. Don't want a long

211
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,200
sleeve t-shirt. I want a hoodie. So we added a hoodie. So if you go to teespring.com slash

212
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,120
Jupiter 2014, you can grab a hoodie. This is helping us get to our 2014 goal or at least

213
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,000
helping us get through 2013. This is a logo we'll be rolling out in 2014. So now we got

214
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,920
a hoodie available. We've got a woman's tee. Also, if you want to get one for your lady

215
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,000
or maybe that's all in the same, same, same addresses before just in the pull down or

216
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,760
pull down. And now it all goes towards to go all 319 out of 499. That's a great there.

217
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,320
Oh, it just went up to 319. Do you see change? You know what? You know what? I'll tell you

218
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,200
something, Matt. I'll tell you something. The bulk of that is the Linux action show

219
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,320
audience. Now there's a good mix of Coder radio in there too. Sure. But the bulk of

220
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,120
it is is a Linux unplugged and Linux action show audience that have right here alone have

221
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,440
almost got us to 320 shirts. I'd love to see that flip over to 320, 325 during the show

222
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,880
the goal here is is we have we have commissioned a new logo for the Jupiter Broadcasting Network.

223
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,480
We were planning to roll this out in about March of 2014. Yeah, you know, it's one of

224
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,720
those things like we're really proud of ourselves because like we were working like way ahead

225
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,440
of the game. Like we had secrets we were going to roll out in months. And I was like, yeah,

226
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,600
this is awesome. We're just like we're ruling. And then we had a falling out with Amazon

227
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,600
and the way that a lot of people contribute and support our network was removed. Now what

228
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,640
we're trying to do is close that financial gap. I sold some Bitcoin so that way we can

229
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,600
stay we can keep the lights on. But we are definitely still hurting. And this shirt we've

230
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,640
launched over at Teespring.com slash Jupiter 14. This is an effort for us to continue to

231
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,600
fund the network through the remainder of 2013. And also, oops, hi there to get you

232
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,320
guys a little bit of swag. So that way you got yourself something. Maybe you want to

233
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,440
give it up for the holidays or something like that. And that new logo is so gorgeous. Display

234
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,920
it, right? Just display it.

235
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,920
No, totally.

236
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,160
So based on your popular demand, we now have a hoodie. How awesome is that?

237
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,120
That is fantastic. No, it's definitely been very popular. And I think it makes sense.

238
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,140
I think people see the value in not only participating in the program itself by helping to support

239
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,600
it through buying this, but I think they also value the fact that, hey, I get to represent.

240
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,600
Yeah, dude.

241
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,600
Yeah.

242
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,520
You know what? That new logo looks good on black like that.

243
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,760
Oh, it looks excellent. It pops like crazy. It's awesome.

244
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:37,520
So thank you, everybody who has already picked up a shirt. And if you haven't gotten one

245
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:43,000
yet, go to teespring.com slash Jupiter 2014. We're trying to get to 500 shirts. We're not

246
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,760
there yet. And if we don't get to 500 shirts, none of them will ship. You won't get charged.

247
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,440
Don't worry. You won't get billed. But none of them will ship. So hopefully we can. And

248
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,680
that'll help us fund the remainder of the year. And thank you, everybody.

249
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
All right, man.

250
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,800
Yeah, I think it's also worth mentioning, too. A lot of people have the mindset of,

251
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,400
well, I might do it later, but someone undoubtedly will buy it. Every single purchase helps make

252
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
this happen. So definitely jump on.

253
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,280
We have an email. So there's a few recurring topics that we've talked about. Like on Tech

254
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:16,920
Snap, one of them is drive fragmentation. On this show, it's the whole philosophy of

255
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,720
to swap or not to swap. I've got an email about that that I want to touch on here in

256
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,840
just a second. But first, we should probably thank our first sponsor of The Unplugged Show.

257
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:29,640
And that, my friends, is Ting. Ting is mobile that makes sense. My mobile service provider

258
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,680
and Matt's mobile service provider, and they freaking rock. So Ting, what's great about

259
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,920
them? No contracts, no early termination fees, and pay for what you use. Pay for what you

260
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:45,960
use. Messages, megabytes, minutes, they all get added up at the end of the month. Whatever

261
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,020
you just use, that's what you pay for. Flat dollars, six months per line, and just whatever

262
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,560
you need on top of that. That's great if you sometimes use the phone, sometimes you don't

263
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,480
use the phone. And every Ting service includes hotspot and tethering, caller ID, voicemail,

264
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,400
and their amazing Ting dashboard. But something that was pointed out to me in the Linux Action

265
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,720
Show subreddit this week that we don't mention is Ting also doesn't have roaming charges.

266
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,000
There's no additional charges for voice roaming within the US as long as you have a CDMA signal,

267
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,720
you should be fine. The Ting network has agreements in place with Verizon that allows you to just

268
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,000
roam over to the Verizon network and use that service, and you don't get dinged for it.

269
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,600
It's one of the really nice little perks among the many other things with Ting. Now, of course,

270
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:33,320
the average Ting bill is around $33 per month. Think about that. $33 per month is the average

271
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:39,280
Ting bill, and that's your smartphone with data, text messaging, all of that contract

272
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,760
free with no early termination fees. Now, I just got my Nexus 5 on the Ting network.

273
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,760
Ting has a bunch of really great devices at all ranges of prices. Right now, if you go

274
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,520
to linux.ting.com, that's right, linux.ting.com, that'll take $25 off your first month of service

275
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,600
if you already have a Sprint compatible device. If you don't have a Sprint compatible device,

276
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,440
they'll give you $25 off your first device. When you buy this device, you own this device.

277
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,120
They're not leasing it to you on like a house on a mortgage where you pay into it every

278
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,640
single month and after two years, you now own a completely out of date smartphone. No,

279
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,880
like a computer, when you buy it, you own it. As an active consumer, as people out there

280
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,840
who are aware of the differences in that kind of setup, this is something I think we can

281
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,360
all elect to be involved in is let's change the dynamic of the mobile market because it's

282
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,040
obvious the mobile devices, even if you don't think they're that hot, are going to play

283
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,960
a huge role in the computing platform going forward. The problem is the cards are stacked

284
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,520
against us right now. Ting is changing all of that and they're doing it in a very dynamic

285
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,960
way. It's starting with no contract, starting with no early termination fees and starting

286
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,400
with the fact that you own your phone and then they price it at a rate that is absolutely

287
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,880
reasonable and not only that, but if you're in a contract right now and you want to get

288
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,240
out of that contract, Ting has an early termination relief program where they will pay up to $75

289
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:03,160
per line that you need to cancel. That's huge people because you can start saving right

290
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,240
now if you switch to Ting and you can get started by going to linux.ting.com. Man, I

291
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,600
love Ting. I've been using them for a while and as a long time customer now, I've got

292
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,680
to tell you, that dashboard, that dashboard, Matt, it's like nothing anybody else has.

293
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,200
I know that as a Ting customer, when you signed up, when I handed that note to you and said,

294
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,520
Matt, have at it, tell me what you think, that dashboard was it, wasn't it? That was

295
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
awesome.

296
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,920
It was really the big point for me and I still use it frequently because there are times

297
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:33,760
to where if I'm not going to be using the phone for a while or maybe I just don't need

298
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,960
any, I know I'm not going to be getting any important calls, I'll literally just go ahead

299
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,920
and toggle it off. I can keep the phone calls from coming in completely by using the dashboard.

300
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:47,360
This is a great point. So as you know, back when I was in IT, I would have several different

301
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:57,040
Blackberry devices and one Windows mobile device and I never used the Windows mobile

302
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,600
device. I was down with Blackberry, man. I was a Blackberry guy. But I only needed one,

303
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,640
right? But the company I worked for, they had to pay for all three lines all the time,

304
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,560
every single month. And then when like another tech needed to try something out for their

305
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,280
client, there's no transferring. Like unless you want to call the Verizon rep and ask them

306
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,560
after you explain to them what it is you're even trying to do, Ting does it all through

307
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,660
their dashboard with a couple of clicks unless you get right back to work. It's so awesome.

308
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,280
So we'll get started by linux.ting.com. And by the way, you need to order your device

309
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,400
by December 13th if you just want to get FedEx Ground or December 19th for FedEx Express

310
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,220
in order to guarantee delivery by December 23rd. So if you're giving somebody the gift

311
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,160
of Ting for the holidays, get your order in before December 13th for the cheap shipping

312
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:45,280
or December 19th for the express shipping to get that guaranteed by December 23rd. So

313
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,920
a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged. Love those guys. Okay, Matt. So

314
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,560
I want to cover this email that came in from Bab because it's a topic that we talk about

315
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:02,280
a lot. No, it's all good. Oh, it's good. It's good. I thought where this is going. I'm about

316
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,760
to get... Actually, I think we do have one of those at the end of the show. Oh, no. We

317
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,040
have to have at least one because otherwise, what's the point? I tell you what, we got

318
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,760
one that's going to get people really fired up next. Yeah. Okay, but this one comes in

319
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,840
from Bob. It's safe territory. We're not going to get anybody too upset. He says, hi, guys.

320
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,400
Just a quick note. Chris mused that maybe the day is near that you could run with a

321
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:26,760
machine without a swap partition. Well, this intrigued me. And for the last year, I've

322
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:32,360
been running my 8 gigabyte laptop with no swap partition and have not noticed any issues

323
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,920
even when giving it a pretty thorough workout. In fact, it worked so well that I honestly

324
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,760
forgot about it. One thing that had bugged me though was that the Hibernate hasn't been

325
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,780
an option on Ubuntu for me. I just assumed it was a config issue or the hardware not

326
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,260
being supported. I found out I could run pm-hibernate command, but it would just simply not Hibernate.

327
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,680
My frustration boiled over today and I went digging for clues. It looks like it may just

328
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:59,920
simply be a case that a swap partition is required for Hibernate to work as where the

329
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:05,600
memory image is written out before the machine shuts down. I goled, that's groaned out loud,

330
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,920
when I found this out. I cannot yet confirm this is an issue, but I thought I'd share

331
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,120
experiences for the benefit of all. Bab. Yeah, that is true. That is true. Interesting. That

332
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:22,360
is the downside to running without swap. All my machines have swap right now. Do you do

333
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:28,680
swap partitions still? I do. Honestly, it's just a legacy habit. It's almost like building

334
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,200
machines and putting a floppy drive in it. You do something out of habit. It's like,

335
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,960
why the hell am I putting this thing in here? Actually, Matt, I don't mean to age you, but

336
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,640
it's now CD-ROMs, Matt. It's not floppy drives anymore. What? It's CD-ROMs now, yeah. I've

337
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:48,040
got my cassette tape drive sitting right here. It works. Magnetic media is the future. God.

338
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,600
Why hibernate when you can just either suspend or boot? What kind of system takes that long

339
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,420
to boot anymore? I don't know. I'd put it out to the mumble room if anybody in here

340
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,480
has a strong feeling on swap partitions. Anybody in the mumble room running swap free these

341
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:09,960
days? Yes, kind of. I use swap files instead. Can I jump in quickly? You only need swap

342
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,920
if you're using a laptop and you want to put it into hibernate. If you've got more than

343
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,680
two gigs of RAM, you do not need swap. Swap is only used for hibernation. Well, what about

344
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:27,440
crashing? That's not true. Yeah. That's completely incorrect. Here we go. And it's on. Basically,

345
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,440
I actually need a swap partition. Let's say you've got three gigs of RAM. What is swap

346
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,720
used for? I use a swap partition in order to compile my kernel. Usually, I don't have

347
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,680
a five or six gigs partitioned or put on my rig, so I use a swap file. I knew this would

348
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:50,160
be a hot topic. I have 12 gigs of swap. Even on machines, I have 144 gigs of RAM. Yeah,

349
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:56,000
I do too. If you have no swap at all, the only negative thing I had is you can't hibernate.

350
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
That's it. No, there's no negative things. First of all, if you don't have any swap space,

351
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,780
as soon as you're out of memory, the kernel either has to start killing random processes

352
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:09,880
or panic. There's no other option. Okay, but you've got four gigs of RAM. It's not an

353
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:16,880
issue anymore. Yes, it is. Five or two gigs of swap, I think, should be enough. Just as

354
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,520
a safety, I mean, it's five or two gigs. You already have a good partition or a swap file.

355
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,400
Yeah, exactly. Oftentimes, you will make the swap only 512 megabytes or something, which

356
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:33,160
is just enough so that really inactive stuff can get out of your way because free RAM is

357
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:37,120
wasted RAM. You use as much of your RAM as you can for your file system cache and things

358
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,920
like that. If a program is completely idle, why have it wasting memory that could be being

359
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:47,920
used for cache if you could swap it out? This is my philosophy too. Just to be safe.

360
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,720
Having even just that little bit means that a program can be swapped out. Right, but if

361
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,640
the program is always idle and its memory is not in use, then it's even worse than just

362
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,480
wasting it. You may as well just write it to the disk even if it's slow. It's not being

363
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,200
used. Who cares if it's slow? The important thing is that a lot of applications will adjust

364
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:13,800
their behavior based on memory pressure. For example, the ZFS file system will free up

365
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,040
some RAM when there's memory pressure, but for those couple of seconds while that's happening,

366
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,360
there's nowhere for the program to go.

367
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:40,360
If you have even just a little bit of swap, most of the time if you need swap, you'll

368
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,600
know that you'll need a swap partition. Why do we need a swap if you've got more than

369
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:58,920
four gigs of RAM? Because it's using more than four gigs of RAM. All right, there you

370
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:05,080
go. So you can see, I did that as a pure demonstration that this is not a cut and dry topic, right?

371
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:10,200
That was Chris making a point right there. I think there's no total right answer other

372
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,040
than you should use some swap unless you're somebody who thinks you shouldn't, and that's

373
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,200
really the way to leave it. It's so funny because you can see how fired up people are,

374
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,560
which moves us perfectly to our next email from Michael who says, it's time to move on.

375
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:28,000
Get ready for this. This is going to play right into Alan's cards, Matt. If any of those

376
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,520
BSD guys are listening, maybe they could just skip ahead a couple of minutes. He says, hi

377
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,040
Chris and Matt. Long time viewer of the Linux Action Show and a short time viewer of Linux

378
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,720
Unplugs since it's, well, new. Put both of your flame suits on boys because I'm about

379
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,880
to get some backlash from the listeners about this. I'm done with Linux. I'm done with the

380
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:52,400
Linux community especially. I found Slackware in 2002 and I immediately fell in love. I

381
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,800
was an everyday Windows user and thought of a virus-free system and that seemed amazing

382
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:02,920
to me. I learned that right away more learning was required. No problem. I'm a math geek

383
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,160
so I should be able to figure out all of this Linux stuff with no problem, right? Well,

384
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,840
long story short, I've been on Linux for about 10 years. I loved it at first, but there were

385
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,520
always little things that bothered me. I didn't think that there was anywhere else to go though.

386
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,080
I didn't want to get a Mac and I certainly didn't want to go to Windows again. The community

387
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:26,160
of Linux users was driving me crazy with their irrational views and immature ways of expressing

388
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:31,000
those views. I have yet to meet a chill Linux guy. Now hold on. I think you and I are pretty

389
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,920
chill Linux guys. I'm literally the most... Oh, man. I mean, yeah. Not only do I run every

390
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:44,480
operating system there is in my office, but yeah, go ahead. Keep going. Okay. All right.

391
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,780
Funny enough, I found out about an alternative through Jupyter broadcasting. Hearing Alan

392
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:56,480
talk about BSD on TechSnap made me very curious as I'm sure it has a lot of other Linux guys.

393
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,320
I tried it out and everything seemed basically the same. I didn't even have to learn much

394
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,600
of anything except a different device name or something. He says, I use the system to

395
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,120
build and install ports. I explore it and get actively involved in the mailing list

396
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,760
and forms. Studying and passing on my own limited knowledge to those who could benefit

397
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,100
from it. I pursued my new journey in other open source software world, learned the differences

398
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:21,160
in BSD and GNU licensing and the fragmented nature of Linux distributions realizing the

399
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:27,640
free BSD community was more mature and well distributed about industry, education and

400
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:34,200
research. Everything steered me towards working with and on BSD, even though I expect some

401
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,920
of the listeners to get upset about this email and typical Linux fashion.

402
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,600
Well, so here's the thing. I've actually had fair dealings with both communities, mostly

403
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,880
with Linux community, but with the BSD community as well. And I'm going to go out on a limb

404
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:50,520
and actually agree them that truth be told, at the end of the day, when you look at hard

405
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,560
numbers of my own personal experiences, I can't speak for other people out there. There

406
00:30:54,560 --> 00:31:01,720
is a vast maturity difference. It's pretty, it's pretty significant. I don't get as much

407
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,880
monkey poop slinging with the BSD guys.

408
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
Is it that?

409
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Oh yeah, it's ridiculous.

410
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,600
Is it that it's a more narrow, narrow, more narrow spectrum on the conversation?

411
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,760
The BSD guys, they didn't, the ones I dealt with, they don't give a flying crap if I'm

412
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,920
on board or not. They're just there to answer questions to be polite about it. They're not

413
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
fanboys.

414
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,040
You don't think it's a factor of a smaller community that's more focused. Do you think

415
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,440
it's the fact that the people there are there to get some work done?

416
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,560
Yeah. I mean, that was, again, everybody's experience is going to vary. I'm going to

417
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,120
get flamed no matter how I put this, but my, my personal experience is just that when I

418
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,160
asked stupid BSD questions as a newbie, I didn't feel like I was going to be punished like

419
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,160
you do with the arch forms.

420
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,840
Oh, okay. That is interesting. Yeah. Sometimes like, when you mentioned, I'm using your

421
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,480
to install a VLC and then like 10 people pound on you. Oh, you should be using.

422
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,960
The BSD guys didn't drop links in a post. That was my, that's my number one pet peeve.

423
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,880
It's like, look, they're asking a dumb question. That's fair. Answer the question, then mention,

424
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,480
Hey, by the way, use the search feature. Don't, don't be a douchebag and put a link.

425
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,320
Oh my gosh. All right. Mumble room. So let me ask you, what do you think? Mumble room.

426
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,000
Why is the BSD community generally considered more civil and calm than the Linux community?

427
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:17,040
Anybody have any, the average age of a free BSD developer is 10 years older than a Linux

428
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
developer.

429
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,800
Yeah, that's there too. I'm not saying that's a good thing or a bad thing or whatever, but

430
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,280
I think that shows that BSD, yeah, it does help. I think that shows that free BSD has

431
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:33,880
a more technical, technically oriented, more server oriented user base than Linux, which

432
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
obviously is on the desktop.

433
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,600
I don't know. I don't know. It might be a wash there, but I definitely think the, the

434
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,360
age thing probably plays component. I'm 40 years old. The guys I'm dealing with are probably

435
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,720
40 and up. You know,

436
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,980
Popey, what do you think? So you're sitting, you're sitting from the perspective of canonical

437
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,760
who's, you know, sees a huge Linux user base. What do you think?

438
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,760
Right. I don't speak for all of canonical.

439
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,440
I know, but I'm curious because you have a unique perspective on this as somebody who's

440
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,200
involved in a very large Linux project.

441
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,200
Personal experience.

442
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,640
So yeah, we have like, you know, a fairly significant community and like any community,

443
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,360
we have people who are objectionable and say things that are unsavory and are unpleasant

444
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,640
to people. Same as any other community, same as Windows and OS X fans and yeah, iPad fans

445
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
and whoever.

446
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,800
I don't think it's necessarily unique to the Linux community that you get doofuses that

447
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,800
make other people feel uncomfortable. I think that's just people being dicks and their dicks

448
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,800
wherever they are.

449
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Yeah.

450
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
See, that's the thing.

451
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,600
Hold on here. I'd like to point out too that he felt a need to write a letter saying that

452
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:48,960
we're all a bunch of dicks because he's switching to previous dicks. It's exactly the same thing.

453
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,960
He's doing it too.

454
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,560
It's all anecdotal at this point anyway that this is true. The claim is all anecdotal.

455
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
It's not like we actually have data for this.

456
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
And everybody's mileage is going to vary.

457
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,160
Also, when you look at the documentation, the Arch forums, sorry, just one thing. The

458
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,280
Arch forums are not representative of the entire Linux community. Neither are the Ubuntu

459
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
forums.

460
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,040
I was using polar opposite ends of the spectrum. I was comparing Ubuntu community to the Arch

461
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,960
forum community. It runs hot and cold. It depends on the time of day, the time of year,

462
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,120
what it looks like outside, what the weather is, whether someone's pissed off or whatever.

463
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:27,080
Yeah. I've always assumed it's been a volume because there's more people in a community.

464
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,740
There's more chances for jackasses.

465
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,640
But I was looking at like if I was like literally take a checkbox and go yes and no for everyone,

466
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:36,440
it was awesome and everyone was no. I was running averages. And so for my averages,

467
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
that was my experience.

468
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:45,760
I think the problem is you get people who leave a community feel so angry that they

469
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:51,680
have to, in the same way that when someone unfollows a celebrity on Twitter, they'll

470
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,160
announce to the world, that's it, I'm unfollowing you. Or they'll leave a post on a blog saying,

471
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,760
you know, that's it, I'm switching to Arch. Or people feel the need to have their voice

472
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,800
heard even if it's a negative one. And yeah, and declare when they're leaving and they're

473
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,560
going away and throwing their tongues at the pan.

474
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,560
That's a good point.

475
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,160
In a way, I think it's a way of natural progression. All of us usually start upon Linux because

476
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,000
it's the largest and most common to start on. Most of the time, it's usually a choice

477
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,680
to change to a BSD base based on what we know and what we consider to be what rubs us right

478
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:29,680
and what floats our boat. That might be why the way of uniting together under the BSD

479
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,640
umbrella will be a little bit more civil versus the Linux.

480
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,480
Yeah, there's just as much fanboyism over there because they always, because I mean,

481
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,760
they just like pretty BSD, right? Or PC BSD. But then at the same time, they talk a bunch

482
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,360
of crap and whatever about people who use Linux or whatever.

483
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,360
Yeah, I've seen some.

484
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
It's the same exact thing.

485
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
Yeah, they do that.

486
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:58,760
Well, I look at it like this, is I think guys like Alan who have a very set of practical

487
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,560
expectations from the software they use. Okay, here's my background. Before I was even doing

488
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:09,040
the Linux action show, I was using Linux, of course, but I definitely experimented with

489
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,200
some free BSD file servers because at the time, there was a bug that dramatically affected

490
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:20,080
Linux's performance with AdaptX SCSI cards and free BSD did not suffer from this same

491
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:26,160
bug. I got massive better multi-user performance from a free BSD server than I did a Linux

492
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,520
server. So I started deploying free BSD in quite a bit, actually. I think about seven

493
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,880
or eight servers over the span of a six-month period that would have each of them having

494
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,320
300, 400, 500, 700 users hanging off of each server.

495
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,360
And in my experience doing that, free BSD was excellent. It definitely got the job done.

496
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:49,920
But where for me, I started to have some problems, it started to fall down, was this was really

497
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,600
early on in the Sombud project developing their WinBind technology where you could actually

498
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:02,640
bind to an Active Directory, import the Active Directory NTIDs as UIDs and actually set file

499
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,520
permissions based on entries in the Active Directory. And this became an absolutely mission

500
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,400
critical function of our file servers because this was during the transition from NT4 to

501
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:17,080
Active Directory. And the only place I could get that initially was on SUSE Enterprise

502
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,260
Linux and so we ended up going that route. And I found it interesting though that I was

503
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,800
very happy with free BSD, but then as I needed something that was really kind of emerging,

504
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,520
I ended up having to go back to Linux and that's always kind of kept me there.

505
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,360
That's weird because Samba would be in the ports tree, so it'd be just as updated on

506
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,400
free BSD as it is anywhere else, unless you're talking about development that is only happening

507
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,400
on SUSE because of their corporate package.

508
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,660
I don't remember what the details were, actually, to be honest with you, because it was so early

509
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:46,160
on that there were so many bugs, but I find it to be more like one-

510
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,080
Because Samba is actually developed on free BSD.

511
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:56,000
Here's what I find it to be like. There is a definite range of crossover where both operating

512
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,760
systems can do the same tasks, serve a web page, handle a print job, whatever it is.

513
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,760
And there's other-

514
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,200
I can't think of anything that either of them can't do.

515
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:08,480
Right. And well, there's other ranges. Come on, let's be fair. There's other ranges where

516
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,780
you start to get more into the desktop spectrum where there is some rationale behind using

517
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,080
Linux and there's other areas where there's some rationale behind using BSD. And I think

518
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:23,240
what happens is, as people make the transition and whatever kind of requirements they have,

519
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,800
when BSD fills those, they're kind of surprised all of a sudden.

520
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,800
They're like, wait a minute. This whole thing's been out there this whole time and it has-

521
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,400
It's this one cohesive system that's done by this group and it all makes sense and it's

522
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:38,120
well-documented. It's rational. This is so awesome. And people are like, holy shit, this

523
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:41,980
has been here the whole time and there's this massive realization about it.

524
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:45,520
And I think as a lot of people out there, they come to this realization, they're like,

525
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,920
holy crap, and they make this move just like our writer here has done, Michael. But at

526
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,280
the same time, I've been that person who's made that switch like on my router and on

527
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,720
my file server, and I've been like, it's awesome. But I haven't been able to make that switch

528
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,000
in other areas that I use.

529
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,320
So at the end of the day, I think Linux is a little more diverse in the sense that you

530
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:15,480
have a larger range of users from people who just want to play Minecraft to people like

531
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,160
Alan who are building these crazy, amazing infrastructures on Scale Engine. And there's

532
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:26,880
just this crazy range of users. And that sometimes leads to all this public drama and there's

533
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,160
all of this... I think the GPL also adds to a little bit more of this advocate mindset.

534
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,640
I think the BSD license is a little more practical in some senses and the GPL is a little more

535
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,440
advocate-based. And I think that also is a base of some of the attitude maybe?

536
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,320
Well, I think that the GPL is great. I think it's awesome. But there are headaches with

537
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,120
it at times as well. It really just depends on what your goals are. From an idealistic

538
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,880
point of view, it's wonderful. It's great. But it's not always the most practical thing

539
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,080
in the world. And I guess the best examples of that is you don't really ever see a whole

540
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:07,080
ton of monetized open source desktop applications for home users. I know it's like a niche within

541
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,920
the niche within a niche, but I'm kind of putting that out there with a closed source

542
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,900
license that's readily possible because no one is going to take your code and run with

543
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:17,920
it unless they've hired it. So I think there's facets like that. But where it's like you

544
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:22,920
have maybe the BSDs to where maybe people would see that as more of a – it's just

545
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:27,920
less – well, quite frankly, it's less verbiage in the license itself really. It's

546
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,520
almost – I hate to say it, but it's almost easier to understand. You pretty much know

547
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,600
where you stand. So there are advantages there. I'm not saying one is better than another.

548
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,120
I'm just saying I think they serve different purposes and so they probably appeal to different

549
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,640
people. As far as BSD itself, I don't have a ton of experience using it. I just had good

550
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,160
experiences with the community.

551
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,280
Have you ever tried out PC BSD?

552
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,880
I have. I was actually an early tester way back in the day. I love the PBIs. I still

553
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,880
do.

554
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
Oh, yeah. We've talked about that.

555
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,400
Yeah, I really, really do. I still think that's – I think they nailed it. The port system

556
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,280
is awesome on its own anyway. But that's just a no-brainer. But no, I mean it has its

557
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:08,480
advantages. It definitely interacts with your hardware differently as far as detection.

558
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,800
It's less about bleeding edge, more about stability. Yeah, it definitely kind of feels

559
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,640
like an old comfy chair that you know how it's going to work. You don't have to like

560
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,640
cross your fingers. It has some certain advantages, but it doesn't mean that PC BSD was perfect.

561
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,400
It definitely had some challenges along the way. But I think it's interesting to watch

562
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,640
and it's a hell of a great alternative. If Linux isn't your bag and you want to try

563
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,840
something else, I really – I recommend checking it out, certainly.

564
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,960
You know, if this is just – we're just scratching the surface.

565
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,960
We're all over the place.

566
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,040
I just want to get in deep on BSD. Go listen to BSD Now. It comes out every Friday on the

567
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,560
Jupiter Broadcasting Network. You heard from Alan. He's on there. He's my co-host on

568
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,280
TechSnap. He's the host of TechSnap. And also Chris Moore, the creator of PC BSD. He co-hosts

569
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,360
that with Alan and they do it every week live on Wednesdays. It comes out for download on

570
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,800
Fridays over at JupiterBroadcasting.com. They just – BSD Now just had an interview with

571
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,040
– this guy, he's not only one of the founders of the FreeBSD Project. I believe he also

572
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,760
was one of the co-creators – Alan's probably going to yell at me. I believe he was one

573
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,920
of the co-creators of SysInstall but also the inventor of ports, which is amazing. His

574
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:17,320
name is Jordan Hubbard and they did an interview with him on last week's BSD Now if you guys

575
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,480
want to go check that out.

576
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,160
All right, Alan. Boy, see, now I'm in TechSnap mode.

577
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Do what happens.

578
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,160
Hey, I've been upgraded.

579
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:30,920
So look, I thought we'd – last week when we were gearing up for our Linux Mint review,

580
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,160
one of the things – because people always kick around, like, Linux Mint is the perfect

581
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,120
distro for new users, right? So I brought the wife in and I said, okay, honey, here's

582
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,160
Linux Mint. Have at it. So I'm going to bring her in in just a second to get her opinion

583
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:47,160
on Linux Mint and kind of share some of her thoughts on some of the things she ran into.

584
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,580
But before we get to that, I want to say thank our second sponsor this week and that is Digital

585
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,000
Ocean.

586
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,500
Digital Ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

587
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:03,360
easy to spin up cloud server. And it is crazy easy. Users can create a cloud server in 55

588
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:09,600
seconds and pricing plans start only $5 per month for 512 megs of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

589
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,440
one CPU, and one terabyte of transfer.

590
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,400
Digital Ocean has data centers in New York, San Francisco, and Amsterdam. The interface

591
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,420
is simple. They've got a control panel that is amazing. Power users can replicate at a

592
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,800
large scale and they even have a straightforward API.

593
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,760
I've got an Archbox running over on Digital Ocean at $5 per month that distributes all

594
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,600
of the content for Unfilter supporters and also some additional content for just fans

595
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:39,520
of the Unfilter show. I have all of that running through a $5 a month Digital Ocean instance

596
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,860
and I'm looking at this Archbox. I'm like, damn, son, I got more resources available

597
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:48,400
to me. And I'll tell you, that SSD, it really actually, even on a system that's up in the

598
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,400
cloud, makes a big difference. Not only do the updates just rock on that thing, but anytime

599
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,880
I'm interacting with it, IO contention is never a problem for me.

600
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,460
Maybe I sound a bit like a jerk here, but I hate waiting on my disk. I do not spend

601
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,560
time getting memory and CPU to only wait on the damn disk. And SSDs solve that problem.

602
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:15,480
You combine that with Digital Ocean's incredible connection, it has been rocking. I downloaded

603
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:22,460
the Unfilter supporters show using BitTorrent Sync at two megabytes a second from my Digital

604
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:27,040
Ocean VPS. And I got to tell you, that's just the peak of it. I've seen 10 megabytes a second.

605
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,020
I've seen more coming out of that thing. It's awesome. And by the way, Digital Ocean is

606
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,120
offering a fantastic deal for listeners of Linux Unplugged. If you'd like to try out

607
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,320
Digital Ocean for two months, because they're going to give you a $10 credit, and if you

608
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,340
get the $5 server like I've got, it's going to get you two months, when you use our special

609
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:49,380
promo code Linux Unplugged December. Linux Unplugged December will get you a $10 credit

610
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:53,780
on a Digital Ocean account that you can go try out. Digital Ocean has these droplets.

611
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:58,300
It's all based on KVM virtualization. They deploy to these SSD drives with their amazing

612
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:04,780
hardware that's all backed up by RAID storage, ECC RAM, and these droplets let you spin up

613
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:11,380
a server in no time. You can pre-pick from Fedora, CentOS, Ubuntu, several others. You

614
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,920
can have them pre-configured with the LAMP stack. You can have them pre-configured with

615
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,540
Docker. You're ready to go. They've got a flexible API, and they even have, if you can

616
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:22,300
believe this, hourly pricing. So if you just need to test something for a little bit on

617
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,860
the public web, you can throw it up on a Digital Ocean VPS, take advantage of their hourly

618
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:30,660
pricing, bang on it for a while, because it's up on the web. It's public. It's got one terabyte

619
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,220
of transfer. It's got these SSD storage, so you can have hundreds of people bang on it

620
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:39,340
to actually get real world testing and only pay what you use for like, you know, what,

621
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,460
a half hour? That's nothing. In fact, I was just talking with Michael Dominic from our

622
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,460
Coda Radio program. He had a project over the last week where he spun up 10 Digital

623
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:51,500
Ocean servers for a little while. He didn't spend like 17 cents. It's crazy. Their web

624
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:56,220
administration panel is awesome, but Digital Ocean also offers a vast collection of tutorials

625
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,980
in their community section on their website. Users can submit articles to that section,

626
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,660
and if Digital Ocean publishes it, you'll get paid $50 per published piece. So I'll

627
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:09,340
have a link for that in the show notes. Go check out Digital Ocean. We have a brand new

628
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:14,700
promo code. It's going to get you a $10 credit on Digital Ocean service. That's Linux Unplugged

629
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:20,380
December. Brand new code. Go over there. Try it out. You guys are so many things. Here's

630
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,940
like a little taste of, I've been thinking about setting up an XMPP server on Digital

631
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:29,300
Ocean, a Zimbra server on Digital Ocean. I've already got BitTorrent Sync and a web server

632
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:34,380
on Digital Ocean. I'm even thinking about taking, I don't know, maybe Asygo in the chat

633
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,380
room could help me on the pronunciation. Quazl, the KDE, the awesome KDE IRC client, and putting

634
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:43,460
the Quazl client on my Digital Ocean VPS. That way I'm just always logged into the Jupiter

635
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:49,140
Broadcasting IRC chat and I can connect from my front end on my KDE desktop. It's just

636
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:55,140
so many things you can do and at $5 per month to have an awesome Linux powered VPS in the

637
00:46:55,140 --> 00:47:00,520
cloud that you get root access to, oh man, go check out Digital Ocean and use the promo

638
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,260
code Linux Unplugged December and take advantage of that two month offer. It's so great. A

639
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:09,580
lot of people out there have been trying this out and their support is fantastic. So go

640
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:13,700
try it out. DigitalOcean.com, Linux Unplugged December and thanks to Digital Unplugged for

641
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:18,260
sponsoring Linux Unplugged. When I say Digital Ocean Unplugged, it kind of fits.

642
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:21,380
Hey, that works for me. These guys are awesome.

643
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:26,100
So Matt, let's bring the wife in here. Andrew, are you with us? Are you here there, Andrews?

644
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:33,300
All right, so over the last week I had you try out Mint here and there, Spotty, and I

645
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,820
wanted to bring you into the show. Did you get a completely new Linux user's perspective

646
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:42,660
on Mint? Did you think was Linux Mint the distro like if you were going to switch, could

647
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:47,820
I put a Linux Mint computer in front of you and have you actually be successful?

648
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:53,660
Well, only if you actually like set it up for everything that I would use it for first.

649
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:54,660
Yeah.

650
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:58,900
Because I tried their App Store and it just really didn't do it for me.

651
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,900
Yeah, so what was the problem? Because I mentioned a little bit on last, but I don't know if

652
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:03,380
I gave it its due.

653
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,700
Well, basically, I mean, it's great that it's broken down into like five or six main

654
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:12,420
categories I think, or maybe there are like 10. Anyway, it was good the way they had internet,

655
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:16,660
photo, whatever. But after looking at like the photo things, that's where I went first

656
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:23,180
since I'm so photo centered, I was really discouraged. It looked like I would need to

657
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:29,740
have like minimum five programs just to import a picture or try out a lot of different programs

658
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,860
just to see what would be the best to import pictures.

659
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:39,020
Yeah, you kind of felt like there was like you could string several programs together

660
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:43,520
to get what you wanted, but you wanted like plug the camera in, one program comes up and

661
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,300
takes care of all of the things you needed.

662
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:46,300
Yeah.

663
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,980
And it's not that that wasn't there, but you just didn't find it in the App Store.

664
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:54,500
Well, I definitely didn't. The descriptions are very technical and I think I'm a little

665
00:48:54,500 --> 00:49:00,100
better than the average user, but I'm still an average user. So, having that it says I

666
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:06,300
know what a GUI is, that's great. That's kind of what I would expect as a typical user.

667
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:12,180
Yeah, they all kind of advertise the GUI aspect. Now, there was a little bit of a bumpy road.

668
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:16,860
So, when I'm testing out a distro and I want to try it on full hardware acceleration, I

669
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:24,220
don't want to use virtualization, I have this external USB 3 hybrid drive. It's like SSD,

670
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:32,180
it's like a 32GB SSD and a 1TB hard drive, spinning drive. And that's what I load the

671
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,780
distros on and then the Bonobo lets you choose what device you want to boot from. So, I just

672
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:39,820
choose the external USB device and I boot from that. And so, here I am, I'm like, here

673
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,580
you go wife, I'm going to give you this Bonobo and you just sit down here and you use Linux

674
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:48,500
Mint and Ange is like, oh cool, I'm going to get to use your System76. And then what

675
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,500
happened Ange?

676
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:53,480
Okay, so this is great. So, he's like, all right, here you go and he turns it around

677
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,860
and I'm sitting pretty much where Chase does when they do unfilter, so they face each other.

678
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:05,140
And I go to click on something and nothing happens. So, I try the corners.

679
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,900
And I'm not watching because the screen isn't facing me at this point. So, I'm just like,

680
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,820
I'm figuring like she's making mistakes.

681
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:16,140
Yeah, and I like double click the computer icon and the whole screen like freaks out

682
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:21,140
and I don't know what's going on. And I was asking him like, how do I do anything because

683
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:26,260
I didn't have a, oh gosh, all I can think of is calling it a start bar. What is it called

684
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,260
when it's on Linux?

685
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,180
Well, you can call it the start menu. Everybody knows what you're talking about.

686
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:34,460
Okay, well that menu wasn't even there. And so, when I asked what do I do and what do

687
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:39,820
I even do, he scoffed. I was like, well, okay. So, then I turned it towards him and he was

688
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:45,380
like, what did you do? And he's like, oh, he had unplugged the hard drive before he

689
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,860
turned around the laptop.

690
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:53,420
Her first experience with Linux Mint 16 was total crash fest because me being the dumbass,

691
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,800
I'm turning around the laptop and I'm like, well, we don't need to have all these things

692
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:00,620
connected as I'm moving the machine. So, I unplugged the USB devices. And then of course,

693
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:04,540
the USB device was the actual operating system's hard drive.

694
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:11,100
So, then he got it up and running and I was like, oh good, it's a start bar. That's a

695
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:17,260
good start. And he said, well, do something. So, I went to digitalblastforme.com from the

696
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:23,900
suggestions on Twitter. I got a new background, which surprisingly felt just normal. I did

697
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:28,380
that without any problems. Just right-click the right resolution, set his background just

698
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,060
like Windows, just like Mac. Super easy.

699
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,100
And then, let's see, what was the other thing I tried? Oh, I did the sticky note. That was

700
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,100
good.

701
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,180
Oh yeah, you liked that. In fact, you wanted me to add that to your Mac. I remember that.

702
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:46,500
Yeah, because I never – Okay, well, on my Mac, I have a really old version of Office

703
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,340
for Mac. And it's slower than Molasses. And I don't like TextEdit because of the lack

704
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:57,180
of formatting. So, I need something where I can just throw stuff temporarily so that

705
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,100
I can keep it there and then get it later.

706
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:08,100
Yeah. Well, so your overall, I guess, to encapsulate it, it was, yeah, I could use it, but you

707
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:13,500
didn't feel like – Now, do you feel like that would be the case if I gave you Windows

708
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,820
today? I have to completely set it up for you. Is that any different than if you were

709
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,820
switching to Windows?

710
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:24,180
No. No. I mean, the answer is, I think I could be just fine on Windows, surprisingly.

711
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:26,300
Do you think you could be just fine on Mint?

712
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,980
No, because I don't know if you recall, but you're like, go find a program. So,

713
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:36,260
I went to Firefox and I typed photo programs for Mint.

714
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:41,220
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Well, Windows 7 versus Windows 8, which one would you feel more comfortable

715
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,220
with?

716
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:45,140
Oh, I don't even want to look at Windows 8.

717
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,140
Good answer.

718
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,140
I don't know.

719
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:48,140
Good answer.

720
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,140
Yeah.

721
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:54,180
I was a big fan of Windows 2000. I didn't even like XP. So, no, I don't even want

722
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:57,220
to try 8. No.

723
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,220
It's pretty bad.

724
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:02,540
Yeah. Well, thank you for trying that. You were a good guinea pig, and I think in the

725
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:06,180
future I might have you try elementary OS and see what you think about it, and maybe

726
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,540
we'll have you come back on Linux Unplugged and share your thoughts.

727
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:09,540
Yeah.

728
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,540
That would make Ryan 516 happy.

729
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:17,180
Yeah. Well, you're a Mac user, and elementary OS is the closest Mac OS experience, I think,

730
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:22,460
on Linux right now, without being just a rip-off theme. They really try.

731
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,300
I think pair OS might be fun, just to see how different it is.

732
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,300
Pair OS. Yeah.

733
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,300
Yeah.

734
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,300
That would be my choice.

735
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,300
Okay. All right. Well, thanks, Ange.

736
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,300
Yep. No problem.

737
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,300
All righty.

738
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,300
Thank you.

739
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:37,220
So, Matt, we got one more little bit of email I wanted to get to before we go. Actually,

740
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,300
it wasn't even email. I keep calling that because we've gotten so much email recently,

741
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,340
but this was actually a subreddit post, and I'll read it, and then we'll jump into the

742
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:49,660
mumble group and see what the guys think. But he says, hello, I got a show idea for

743
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:55,700
you. Tiling window manager roundup. I feel the Linux action show has not showcased many

744
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:00,860
tiling window managers. They can be really customizable and, in turn, boost your productivity

745
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:06,140
when it comes to certain tasks. I personally run an i3wm setup, and although I sometimes

746
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:11,460
use KDE No Man's Cinnamon, I always keep coming back to good old i3. My main suggestion is

747
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:17,460
go over to reddit.com slash r slash Unix Porn. They regularly will show off how beautiful

748
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,740
a tiling window manager can be, both new and old. So he wanted us to take the tiling window

749
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:26,140
manager challenge. And I got to say, Matt, I just-

750
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,140
Are you as excited as I am?

751
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,220
Yeah. I think so. Like, for me, I've been actually-

752
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:37,660
I think it's worth doing. I think, in fairness, despite what we might feel, that we need,

753
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:42,460
we need, because remember the Arch thing? Oh, that stupid Arch crap. That was me. I

754
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:47,540
was Mr. Oh, Arch is stupid. I will never use Arch, and now I'm basically using Arch. So

755
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:51,860
based on that, even though I've tried it and I was never impressed with it, I have to eat

756
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,380
my own dog food and actually at least try it. Then I can dog on it intelligently.

757
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:01,820
But Matt, KDE is so nice. I'm liking KDE these days. All right, so I got to, let's jump in

758
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:06,860
the Mumba room. Let's ask the Mumba room, guys, what do you think? Do Matt and Chris

759
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:11,020
have to take the tiling window manager challenge?

760
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:12,340
It would definitely be interesting.

761
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:16,660
If you do it, you got to do all of them and there's about 11.

762
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,780
I don't want to do all of them. I want to narrow it down to one or two.

763
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:22,380
I'm sure there's more than 11.

764
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:28,800
We've talked about Awesome and Window End, and we've done Awesome and Exnomad on the

765
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,660
show before. At both times, I felt like I was just doing a fan service because to me,

766
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:41,360
I feel like I'm compromising a modern desktop experience. I come from the 80s, people, where

767
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,980
we didn't have desktops. God damn it, we finally have desktops and I want the best possible

768
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,660
desktop possible. Why the hell would I go back to a tiling window manager?

769
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:53,220
Windows 1.0 was a tiling window manager.

770
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,220
Yeah, exactly. That puts it in perspective.

771
00:55:55,220 --> 00:56:06,180
I think if you're going to do it, you don't need to do all 25,000 of them. You only really

772
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:14,860
need to do a dynamic tiling window manager, which would be i3.

773
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:19,360
And then you need to do, because most of the others, they're all forks of DWM. Even Awesome

774
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:25,020
is just a fork of DWM. I'd probably do i3, Awesome and Exmonad because those three seem

775
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,220
to be the three main ones.

776
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,220
Well, the one I hear the most about-

777
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,220
You need to do-

778
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:33,260
It's been at least a month or two with each one to really learn them.

779
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,260
A month?

780
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,260
Yeah.

781
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,260
That's not going to happen.

782
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,260
No.

783
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,860
You need to just use the right poison.

784
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:42,620
I use my- I have my fling with Exmonad and i3.

785
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:47,060
And then I'll go surf YouTube with links and, you know, I mean, it's just kind of like

786
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:48,060
clickbait.

787
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:49,060
To me, tiling windows managers are just not-

788
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,060
TTY4, TTY4.

789
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,760
Tiling window managers are for pretentious idiots who just want to feel cool about using

790
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,760
and can be-

791
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,760
Ouch.

792
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,760
Not at all.

793
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:58,760
That is exactly-

794
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,760
I completely agree.

795
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,620
Okay. All right. So there we go.

796
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,260
The links and YouTube thing may have been a little much.

797
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,060
I think we got to try out i3. I think we got to try out i3.

798
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:10,380
That would be fair because we can settle on one and really put it through its paces.

799
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,200
This is the one that we always- Everybody keeps coming back to i3. This is the one we

800
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:17,620
hear the most about these days. And we've done Exmonad, we've done Awesome window manager

801
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:22,020
on the last show. Maybe it's time to try out i3. Now, I'm not saying immediately because

802
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:27,540
we've got a lot of stuff lined up on the big show, but maybe the end of the year.

803
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:31,060
I'd say that once we get through our big stuff, I think once we're looking for topics, I think

804
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:35,660
it's a great- I think it's a fair thing. I mean, we tried Arch, it worked out. Who knows?

805
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:39,220
Maybe we'll have a passing affinity, maybe.

806
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:43,440
You know what, Matt? You're right. You're right. I said the same thing about Arch and

807
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,180
now here I am running Arch everywhere.

808
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:49,020
It just allows us to at least- For myself, I can speak intelligently and be like, you

809
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:52,500
know what? I really love it because of Blank or I really hate it because of Blank. I can

810
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:56,580
actually point to something directly versus just saying, no, I don't want to try it. That

811
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,580
kind of thing.

812
00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:00,260
Although, I'm going to tell you one of the reasons I like Arch is because I get the most

813
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,260
current KDE anywhere.

814
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:06,780
Right? Yeah, yeah. And that's a benefit we weren't even aware, really fully rationalizing

815
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:10,660
that we missed. We heard it, but we never really materialized in front of us, I guess.

816
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:14,380
What I'm going to do is I'm going to set up an i3 desktop that is powered on the backend

817
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,380
by Kaywin, right?

818
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:16,380
Oh, there you go.

819
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,380
There you go.

820
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:18,380
I see where you're going with this.

821
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:23,060
I will have wobbly windows, although I will never get wobbly windows, but I know it's

822
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:26,900
there. I know it's there. If I ever needed it, I know it's there. Look, before we run

823
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:32,060
this week, it is getting close to the holiday season, and I've gotten a lot of crap from

824
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:37,940
our very own mumble room about talking about Steam and Humble too much, but I don't know.

825
00:58:37,940 --> 00:58:41,260
If you're like me, every now and then around the holiday season, I get the gaming itch.

826
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:45,620
Even if I don't have the time, it's baked into my brain. It's time to game, and there's

827
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:49,940
a new Humble bundle, which we will probably talk about on the last, but it'll be several

828
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:55,540
days into it. Now it's just launched. There's a new Humble bundle out, and there's a couple

829
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:00,000
of games on there that make the entire thing worth it. Serious Sam 3, BFE, and Natural

830
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,180
Selection 2, which Natural Selection 2 is that game where you get to play as the human

831
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:04,540
or the alien?

832
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,260
That's the one I like, yeah.

833
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,380
Thirteen days left on this Humble bundle. Alls I'm saying is I want all of you to go

834
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,100
over there and dominate this thing for Linux again. Let's just go over there and remind

835
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:18,740
them why they go through all the effort on porting some of this S to Linux, because if

836
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:24,960
you look at this lineup, one, two, three of the games are not available for Linux. This

837
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:30,140
is not a trend we can allow, my friends, and the trend must be our friend, so therefore

838
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:36,840
we must go over to Humble Bundle and use our Linux dollars, or Linux Bitcoins as it were,

839
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:40,980
to own this chart so we can show them that it's still worth their effort to port to Linux,

840
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:45,740
and the entire damn thing is worth it for Natural Selection 2. Sanctum 2 is also in

841
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:51,020
there, Magica, plus all the DLC for Magica is in there. Orcs Must Die 2 is a community

842
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,980
favorite, but it is not available to Linux, and those bastards must fix that. So go over

843
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:59,020
there and buy that sucker, so that way the next time a developer gets in there without

844
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:01,820
a Linux version, Humble Bundle kicks them in the nuts.

845
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:05,940
The only way it's going to happen is if we vote with our wallet, and I don't know, I

846
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:10,220
get a little fired up. Let's see how we're doing right now. Let's see. Okay, okay, man,

847
01:00:10,220 --> 01:00:17,900
are you ready? Average purchase price, $3.89. Okay, okay. Average Windows price, $3.92.

848
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:24,140
Average Mac price, $4.29. Average Linux price, are you ready for it?

849
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,140
I'm ready.

850
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,140
$4.85.

851
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:27,140
Hello, everybody.

852
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,140
That's right.

853
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,140
That's right.

854
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:35,140
I don't know. I'm just thinking, those are some good games. Too bad I own all of them

855
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,140
already.

856
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,140
Right? It's like, oh wow.

857
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:39,660
Yeah, that's the only thing. It's Humble Bundle, it's getting a little harder for them to have

858
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:41,820
the exclusive, but that's understandable.

859
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:42,820
That's okay.

860
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:46,340
That's totally cool. All right, man. Well, we have a really big Linux action show coming

861
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:50,000
up on Sunday. Man, I got more stuff we could dig through, but I wanted to just, before

862
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:55,100
we run, I wanted to give people a little heads up. The holidays are coming, so Matt and I

863
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:00,260
are going to do a little double recording on Tuesday the 17th, so not next week, but

864
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:05,300
the following week, we're going to do two Linux unplugs back to back, starting at 12

865
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:12,780
p.m. Pacific, and that will probably go from about 12 p.m. Pacific to about 3.30 p.m. Pacific,

866
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:17,620
and that'll be our live show for the 24th, too, so we won't have a live show. That second

867
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:22,860
episode will be released on the 24th. That way we can take the holiday week off, so if

868
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:27,100
you'd like to join us for a special long edition, we're going to need your help out there, too.

869
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,620
We're going to need you in the mumble room. We're going to need your emails, so if you've

870
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:33,740
been waiting to email Linux Unplug, now's the time. Go over to Jupyter Broadcasting,

871
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:38,220
click that contact link, and choose Linux Unplug from the dropdown, because we need

872
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:44,540
your emails. We need your feedback. You fuel the show, and on Tuesday the 17th, without

873
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:48,220
you, we will have no show, so we need your feedback, and we need you in the mumble room.

874
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:52,500
Join us live. Normally we're live at 2 p.m. on Pacific, but on that Tuesday the 17th,

875
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:58,220
we'll be starting at 12 p.m. Pacific over at jblive.tv. Don't forget, you can always

876
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:02,540
get a hold of us on the subreddit over at linuxactionshow.reddit.com. We check that
