1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
I do have a pre-show topic that I thought maybe we could talk about.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,700
Have you guys, anybody in here been to Microsoft's website recently today?

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,940
Because they got a new page up we can talk about.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,640
Why Microsoft is better than Linux.

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,580
Microsoft versus Linux.

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:21,920
Not Windows versus Red Hat Enterprise, Linux, no no, Microsoft versus Linux.

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,000
Have you seen this?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,560
It's a comparison page.

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,560
Awesome.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,560
What's the page?

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,560
Microsoft.com?

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,360
No, why Microsoft.com.

13
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,880
Go to why Microsoft.com.

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:32,880
How great.

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,880
Look at this.

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,640
Did you know that Windows has a lower total cost of ownership?

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,120
Greater flexibility.

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,400
Did you know that being closed source gives you greater flexibility with Windows?

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,300
And you can have the sequel edge when you're using Windows.

20
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,600
And here's a good one.

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,960
So they got the Microsoft column on the left and the Linux column on the right.

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,560
Under the Microsoft column, you need to be future proofed for the cloud with Microsoft.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,280
Again, not Windows, which I think is fascinating.

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,760
With Microsoft, you're not just choosing a single solution provider, you're choosing

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,960
a trusted business solution provider and IT advisor.

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,680
IASS and PASS are available on Azure.

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,160
Office 365 enables great productivity in the cloud and Ubuntu CentOS and SUSE Linux enterprise

28
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,560
servers are all supported as clients on the Azure cloud platform.

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,200
But under the Linux column, clear roadmap to the cloud question mark?

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Will your Linux provider be able to support your entire infrastructure in the cloud if

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
the time comes?

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Okay.

33
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
What does that even mean?

34
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,200
Like, what are they even talking about right there?

35
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,600
The best is that they're saying that Google Apps is an untried service, but you should

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,360
use Office 365 instead.

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,360
Which is newer.

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
It's newer than Google Docs.

39
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
Oh, man.

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,200
I think they've actually got a section on security threats in that.

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
We don't want to try out Google.

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Okay.

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Found the other guy, but I found him.

44
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Okay.

45
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Security threats on this?

46
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
This is hilarious.

47
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
I know.

48
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Let's talk about the security threats.

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Oh, wow.

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
All right.

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,360
So, in the security, Microsoft has a proven security development lifecycle.

52
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,760
We've made security a top priority with our security development lifecycle, also, by the

53
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
way, called SDL.

54
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Hmm.

55
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,680
I feel like SDL has been taken by something else.

56
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,840
Customers also have direct access to the SDL under a Creative Commons license.

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
Wow.

58
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Oh, man.

59
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,840
Now, under the Linux column for security threats, persistent threats and dedicated attackers

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:23,680
can slow your projects and put your IT environment at risk with Linux projects.

61
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,160
What does that even mean?

62
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,480
Oh, man.

63
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,720
Do you think this is in response to Munich, the French gendarmerie, to lose the UK announcement

64
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,840
about open document format?

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,200
Do you think they realize they've got a fight on their hands now?

66
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,560
Well, I do find it to be particularly interesting that they're not trying to push Windows.

67
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,080
They're trying to push everything Microsoft has to offer.

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
All the things, yeah.

69
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,080
All the things.

70
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,440
That's one thing.

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,840
Like how focused we are, because all the things are now one thing.

72
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,040
I just hope that the BS marketing speak they use in these comparisons doesn't appeal to

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,920
people outside of Microsoft, because if it does, then that really sucks.

74
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
Right?

75
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
Yeah.

76
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,040
Any of these statements that have any value under the Linux column apply just as much

77
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,520
to Windows as it does to Linux.

78
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,520
I know.

79
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
Yeah.

80
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,760
But they've got a page there to compare themselves with Google.

81
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,320
I mean, they're just asking for a beating here, aren't they?

82
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
They do.

83
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,720
And the best part is, it's like, is Google reliable?

84
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
We are.

85
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
We are.

86
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
Microsoft versus Google.

87
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,720
We don't think they're reliable.

88
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Microsoft.

89
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,480
Is this story made even further by Microsoft?

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,120
Okay, here we go.

91
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,000
I actually do wonder that.

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
Privacy, security, and compliance.

93
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,520
You can trust.

94
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Now Google is riskier for the enterprise with a focus on advertising and a lack of clarity

95
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,120
around data governance policies.

96
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,560
Google apps are riskier for enterprise.

97
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,700
I would say that's the one bullet point I agree with, because Google just recently kind

98
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,640
of got caught with their hand in the cookie jar when it came to monitoring students' docs

99
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,820
for advertising, and they had to pull back on that.

100
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,600
So Microsoft now gets to lean on that kind of stuff.

101
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,180
Yeah, I don't know.

102
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,680
What about their comparison with Open Office?

103
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,240
They have Open Office on here?

104
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Look at this.

105
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Yes, they do.

106
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,680
They say, there's like a quote from a company that says something like, we used to use Open

107
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,700
Office, but we switched back to Microsoft Office.

108
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,840
You could practically hear the sigh of relief right after we switched back.

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
Oh my god.

110
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,400
That quote is over two years old.

111
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,480
That quote, we covered that two years ago on the Linux Action Show in a video.

112
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,840
And this same one where they said it was cumbersome, that was also from that same video.

113
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,780
Inefficient, if they're referencing the UI, is absolute BS.

114
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:32,820
Every time I'm forced to use Microsoft Office and I don't know where something is, there's

115
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:40,440
no logical way to find it, whereas in Libre Office, you just find the category and it's

116
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
there.

117
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,960
They are comparing it to Open Office, which who the heck knows how many years old that

118
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
is.

119
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,240
You guys, last time I checked, Open Office doesn't have the ribbon, so screw you.

120
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,440
All right, let's see.

121
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
No ribbon, no business.

122
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,080
Wait, someone should actually get a copy of this web page, because you know they're going

123
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
to take it down at some point.

124
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,380
Yeah, you know what I like too?

125
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,520
This is the biggest admittance that they're screwed, is right on their Microsoft versus

126
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,160
Linux page, right there on the right hand side.

127
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,120
Second link, speed up PHP performance.

128
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,400
Now this is, how telling is that?

129
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,080
But on their this is why we're better page, they have to give you right there front and

130
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,960
center a link on optimizing something that out of the box just works great on Linux.

131
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,240
Everything could use optimization, but I think that's extremely telling right there.

132
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,760
And PHP isn't a language that sort of cutting edge stuff is going to be deployed on these.

133
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,600
It's not a scale anyway.

134
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,760
You're not driving a ton of clicks by advertising your PHP support.

135
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,760
No.

136
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:43,840
And the companies they're using as examples aren't really good like big tech related companies

137
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
either.

138
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
It's interesting.

139
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
I don't know.

140
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
Yeah, yeah.

141
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:55,800
That how we compare those should really be list of companies that are eating our lunch.

142
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,280
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that just hit the one year mark.

143
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,880
Without missing a beat, I'm a little excited.

144
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,400
My name is Chris.

145
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
And my name is Matt.

146
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,240
And at episode 52, if I am doing my math right and it's easy math because we've never skipped

147
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,520
a week one year mark right here, buddy, we just landed on it.

148
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,160
It's like just fell right into our laps.

149
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,160
That's crazy.

150
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,800
It feels like it's been like three months maybe at most.

151
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Yeah.

152
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,580
And I think this actually what this teaches me is that I am just not very good at time

153
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,680
perception because I am also like at the same time, I'm like, you know what?

154
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,720
It kind of feels like it's been really like you said, like three months.

155
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,720
And then the other time it feels like, well, okay, I can't remember a time when we haven't

156
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
been doing this show.

157
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
True.

158
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Now that's true.

159
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,560
Now I could say that of last, but yeah, definitely with this show, it doesn't feel like it's

160
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
been that long.

161
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Yeah.

162
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
Yeah.

163
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
You know what?

164
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,560
That's what it is.

165
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
It's in perspective of the Linux action show.

166
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Yeah.

167
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
Definitely.

168
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
I know.

169
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
Yeah.

170
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
I'm a con says, it says every time a show hits a landmark, it makes me feel like I'm

171
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
around you guys for too long.

172
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
That's true.

173
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
I'm a con.

174
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
It's your warning sign.

175
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
It's time to take a breather.

176
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
No, I'm just kidding.

177
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Don't take a breather.

178
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,840
We've got a great episode today.

179
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,280
Frederick from the Crux Project is going to join us and talk about Crux Linux here in just

180
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,440
a little bit.

181
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,880
And we've also gotten some great emails in from the audience following up on some topics

182
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,860
that we covered on Sunday's Linux action show.

183
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,720
So I want to start with that because the first one was one that I was kind of talking out

184
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,920
my butt during the show and I knew we were going to get some feedback.

185
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,300
In fact, I was kind of hoping for some feedback and Odin wrote in and he delivered.

186
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,520
It's in regards to Copper, the Fedora project we talked about.

187
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,680
Odin says, from my understanding, the new Fedora Copper service is not really similar

188
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
to the AUR.

189
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,200
Instead, it's more like a PPA competitor.

190
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,320
Unlike the AUR, which is a single repository that allows users to download build scripts,

191
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,300
Copper is a build service that allows users to create personal repositories and upload

192
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,920
their source packages.

193
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,880
The Copper service builds the source packages and makes them available through each separate

194
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,980
repository.

195
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:55,080
Users who want to use Copper repositories need to add each new repository separately

196
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,600
to their system using DNF, which is the future yum replacement.

197
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,240
For example, I've had problems installing Google Chrome on Fedora 21 because it depends

198
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,240
on a legacy version of LibCrypt, which is no longer supported in Fedora 21.

199
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,880
But there's a Copper for that, so after running some DNF commands, he enables the repo, then

200
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,240
he installs that compatible library, and Bob's your uncle.

201
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
He's good to go.

202
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,640
He says it's kind of like a PPA, but with a central repository.

203
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Interesting.

204
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,440
I could work with that.

205
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,440
Right?

206
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
I could work with that.

207
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Yeah.

208
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,320
I think maybe the system I would prefer is the AUR in-hole, because I like the fact that

209
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,680
there's a voting system there, a comment system there.

210
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,200
I like the selection.

211
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,320
Copper obviously didn't have the same selection.

212
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,520
The other bit of feedback we got is that Copper has some of the same legal constraints that

213
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,140
Fedora as a whole has, since they're building those packages and whatnot.

214
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,640
So there's going to be certain things there that maybe, like for example, popcorn time

215
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,320
would show up in the AUR, but maybe isn't going to show up in the Copper repos, perhaps?

216
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
I don't know.

217
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
I don't know.

218
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,320
That's bizarre.

219
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
I'll bring in the mumble room.

220
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Hello, virtual lug.

221
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,600
Anybody in here a Fedora user and familiar with Copper?

222
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,000
Have we gotten anything wrong?

223
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Are we egregious?

224
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No.

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

226
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Good.

227
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Apparently not.

228
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No.

229
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I think that means no.

230
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Apparently you nailed it.

231
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yeah.

232
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I think so.

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's good.

234
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's a good sign.

235
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That means we're not leading people astray, Matt.

236
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
All right.

237
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's it.

238
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Next email.

239
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Let's get to the next email.

240
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It comes in from Michael, and Michael writes into the show.

241
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,880
I mean, you can write in too by going to JupiterBroadcasting.com, clicking contact, Linux

242
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,360
unplugged features, contact from the Linux unplugged form, and also from the Linux action

243
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,360
show.

244
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,160
We get so much email to both shows that we try to collect it all in one place.

245
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,240
So Michael writes in about emails and email clients.

246
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,240
He says, hi guys.

247
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Huge fan of the show.

248
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,600
When I was using Outlook, I was crazy about the integration with a really decent calendar

249
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
feature.

250
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
My question is, with all of the talk about viable Linux calendar apps and with the availability

251
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,320
of LibreOffice, why haven't we seen an email client or calendar from them?

252
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,320
It doesn't make any sense.

253
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,000
And I think it's time for one.

254
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,240
I could surely use it.

255
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,520
Keep up the great work, and thanks, Michael.

256
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,940
So Matt, do you think we have a...

257
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,360
This is the third week in a row, which is crazy to me that we've gotten people commenting

258
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,800
about productivity apps like calendar and email under Linux.

259
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,120
And do you think the LibreOffice project should be making a calendar?

260
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,240
I think it's overdue.

261
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,040
I think the problem is, and this is very true in the Linux world in general, is that everybody's

262
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,600
kind of focused on the projects they're passionate about, and the end users basically gets to

263
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,120
come along for the ride.

264
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,920
That sounds terrible to say, but that's been my general experience.

265
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,000
And I'm not speaking to distros.

266
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,260
I'm speaking to specific applications.

267
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,440
So I look at the Evolution project, or I'm looking at various things you can do to Thunderbird

268
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,520
to PIM it up, if you will.

269
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,440
And it always feels janky, I guess, at the end of the day.

270
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,640
And because you go to other platforms, and you've got a stupid amount of choice.

271
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,640
It's just ridiculous.

272
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
That's true.

273
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,800
But if it's like, you're pretty much going to end up going web-based.

274
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,800
You just are.

275
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,520
There really is no other alternative.

276
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,320
I mean, truly.

277
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,280
I've been using Evolution with some success, and then I have also been trying out Lightning

278
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
on Thunderbird.

279
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
But you're right.

280
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,280
It does feel a little janky.

281
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Oh, Evolution.

282
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
Yeah, Evolution.

283
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Well, yeah.

284
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,760
I mean, so what I've been using more so is the Evolution data server backend, which then

285
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,920
populates my GNOME calendar.

286
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,920
I don't actually use Evolution that much.

287
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,000
And then I have my Lightning calendar subscribed to the same calendars that my GNOME data servers

288
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
subscribe to.

289
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,160
But that means I have two different programs checking the same calendar feeds.

290
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,660
It's not super elegant, but at least they're referencing the same source.

291
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:34,520
So there was a blog post about the future of Thunderbird posted on July 31st.

292
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:38,440
And they say, so current update, which is good news for any Thunderbird users, guess

293
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
what?

294
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,560
Thunderbird usage is growing.

295
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,740
They say we have a strong core team and expect to remain relevant on the internet for the

296
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,360
foreseeable future.

297
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,000
And that Thunderbird, they recognize, is mission-critical to tens of millions of users.

298
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,080
Here's where they want to go in the near term.

299
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,460
Thunderbird should be a full-featured desktop personal information management system incorporating

300
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,120
messaging, calendar, and contacts.

301
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,400
We need to incorporate the calendar component, Lightning by default, and drastically improve

302
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
contact management.

303
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,640
We should be actively promoting open internet standards in messaging, calendar, and contacts

304
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
through implementation.

305
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,680
So they also apparently see the need to integrate calendars into Thunderbird.

306
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,680
I don't know, Matt.

307
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,680
I don't know.

308
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,520
I feel like Thunderbird needs to stick to email and just focus on email.

309
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,400
I think when you plug in Lightning into Thunderbird, it feels janky.

310
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:29,840
But I think that the Lightning idea and the app itself is actually just worlds better

311
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
than Evolution.

312
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,000
Evolution just feels like a trip back to the 90s.

313
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can't even deal with it.

314
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,120
And I used to use it a lot.

315
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,980
I mean, I've spent years with it, and I hate it with a passion.

316
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,280
But I'd say Lightning's a great idea.

317
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
I like the idea.

318
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,120
I don't really want to blend it in with current Thunderbird.

319
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,400
It just doesn't fit well enough.

320
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,480
But that being said, it's usable.

321
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,720
It's not horrible.

322
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,840
And if you have some sort of web-based calendar or have something that you can sync up with

323
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,840
a calendar, whatever.

324
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
As long as they get it right.

325
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
It's doable.

326
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
They've got to get it right.

327
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,000
Because if they screw it up, Matt, my Thunder, if they ruin my Thunderbird, what am I going

328
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
to do, Matt?

329
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,320
What am I going to do?

330
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
That's true.

331
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,100
And if you have the option to take kind of an opera approach and disable something you

332
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,360
don't want in it, problem solved.

333
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
I don't want a calendar.

334
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
I just want email.

335
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,360
Make it go away.

336
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Poof.

337
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Gone.

338
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Problem solved.

339
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
I agree with Evolution.

340
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,520
Like, strip out all the task stuff.

341
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,160
Because the task implementation in Evolution is just god-awful.

342
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,360
Like, please burn it alive sort of thing.

343
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,560
Honestly, Evolution just should be calendar and mail.

344
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,560
And that's it.

345
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Yeah.

346
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,560
Yeah.

347
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,320
As long as you don't implement the exchange backend, it's less painful.

348
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,200
The exchange backend will make you want to punch things.

349
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
It's horrible.

350
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Yes.

351
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Oh my goodness.

352
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
All right.

353
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
I think we're probably done talking about Thunderbird.

354
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,640
We have one more email to get to.

355
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,680
I mean, you guys can still, you can send in your feedback.

356
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
We'll read it.

357
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,040
If this is a topic people are obviously interested in, Andreas writes in, he says, hello, Chris

358
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
and Matt.

359
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,160
I've been watching almost all of the JB shows for a year now.

360
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
This is great content.

361
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,900
I have a DigitalOcean droplet serving up Django.

362
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
It's a Django project.

363
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,240
One of the things I want to do is some kind of virtual meeting, sometimes part of a group.

364
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,560
Oh, we have a little echo back there.

365
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Sometimes it's part of a group.

366
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,720
Or, you know, he wants to single to multiple people sometimes.

367
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,640
Maybe just a single person.

368
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,000
And also maybe have an embeddable IRC client.

369
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,420
It could be video or audio.

370
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,680
So he says, here's the requirements.

371
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,840
He needs to be able to run on a DigitalOcean droplet and a way to send out audio or video.

372
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,980
He wants to be able to serve anything from the droplet, not any third-party host.

373
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:32,480
So like no Google services, no Twitch.tv.

374
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,960
And the video is just one way, or the audio.

375
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,140
So he only needs to be able to send it out, doesn't need to be able to receive anything

376
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:42,160
from them, except for IRC.

377
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:46,600
So he wanted to know if we had any recommendations for virtual meetings, things that he could

378
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,080
do to broadcast something to multiple people, all hosted on his own system.

379
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,600
I was thinking, IRC, you could host your own IRC server.

380
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
I would not.

381
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,440
I would say go on to GeekShed or go on to FreeNode and just grab a room.

382
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,300
You can make it a private room, but don't bother with that.

383
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,800
For the broadcasting, I don't know, maybe somebody has a better idea.

384
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,360
I was thinking IceCast.

385
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,280
Just do an audio IceCast stream because he wants to be able to embed the player on the

386
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:21,040
website and you could use HTML5 audio, heyo, to stream IceCast right in the browser.

387
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,780
It wouldn't be video, but you would get audio though.

388
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,080
That's about the best I could come up with.

389
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,680
I mean, really, because he's not wanting to utilize other tools and services, that definitely

390
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
limits my ideas.

391
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,880
Well, chatroom points out WebRTC might be a solution here too, PalavaTV, P-A-L-A-V-A-T-V,

392
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,760
browser-to-browser video conferencing.

393
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,600
WebRTC might be able to solve this too.

394
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,680
Anybody in the Mumba room have any software suggestions for something to do self-hosted

395
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
video conferences?

396
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,600
I don't think so.

397
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
They're bubkissed today.

398
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
They're bubkissed.

399
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
They're just coming up nothing.

400
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Yeah.

401
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
There is one called Appear.in.

402
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
Okay.

403
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Is that a WebRTC one?

404
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
Yes.

405
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Yes.

406
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
That makes sense.

407
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
That makes sense.

408
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,040
That's probably your best bet right now.

409
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,680
And the nice thing about WebRTC is if they even have a semi-modern browser, you're not

410
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,820
going to have to have them install a plug-in or something.

411
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,640
If you're using a system that requires a plug-in, you're almost dead in the water right there.

412
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
So you know what?

413
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,140
WebRTC is probably actually the really sensible approach.

414
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,120
So Andreas, look into WebRTC solutions.

415
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,400
We actually did an episode of Linux Action Show a ways back.

416
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,680
There's a few.

417
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,320
Check out meet.jitzi.si or G-I-T-I dot S-I.

418
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,760
There's a couple of different options out there, and we'll try to collect a few links.

419
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:39,160
And oh, it would be a good time to say, if you're listening to this after the fact and

420
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:44,280
you're like, oh man, there's one the guys need to know about, please go over to linuxactionshow.reddit.com,

421
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,560
find the feedback thread for this episode, and drop a link in there.

422
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,680
And I'll try to remember to collect all of those, and we'll cover them in a future episode,

423
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,940
maybe episode 52.

424
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,000
So our buddy Mike there was talking about how he was hosting this, or I'm sorry, it

425
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,400
was Andreas, over on DigitalOcean Droplist.

426
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,160
So why don't I just take a minute here and tell you about DigitalOcean, because guess

427
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
what?

428
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,920
I rock DigitalOcean Droplets like a boss.

429
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,220
Over at digitalocean.com, we've got a brand new promo code for the month of August, which

430
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,800
is blowing my mind, Unplugged August.

431
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,280
Unplugged August, all lowercase, go over to digitalocean.com.

432
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,560
Let me tell you about DigitalOcean.

433
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,240
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

434
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,840
easy way to spin up a cloud server.

435
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,440
Now if you're a boss, you can probably do this in under 55 seconds, like myself.

436
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,400
But you know, for most of you, maybe it's your first time, you're new, you can spin

437
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,440
up a cloud server in less than 55 seconds, and pricey plans start at only $5 per month.

438
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,800
That gets you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer.

439
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,660
Their pricing plans are so straightforward and simple, too, that as you go up, you get

440
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,480
more bandwidth, you get more CPU, more storage, et cetera, et cetera.

441
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,880
And when you use that promo code, Unplugged August, you're going to get that $10 credit.

442
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,080
So if you grab the $5 rig, like I've been using forever now, you grab that $5 rig, you

443
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,160
can try it for two months for free when you use the promo code Unplugged August.

444
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,120
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

445
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,880
and a brand new one in London.

446
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,340
Their interface is so simple.

447
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,400
Their control panel is super intuitive, but extremely powerful.

448
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,400
And then you're like, hey, you know what?

449
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
I need more power.

450
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
I need more power.

451
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Well, guess what?

452
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,720
Boom, they got you covered, straightforward API available.

453
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,480
You can replicate a lot of the functions on a much larger scale.

454
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,760
Automate that ass, son.

455
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,020
Go out there with that straightforward API.

456
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,060
And if you go over to DigitalOcean right now, I want you to go over there and click on the

457
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,400
features tab and take a look at the control panel.

458
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,120
So they have the droplet management system.

459
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,920
They have the DNS system built into.

460
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,540
They also have snapshots, two-factor authentication, an HTML5 console written in Go.

461
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,480
You can resize and deploy applications with one click like Ruby on Rails, WordPress, GitLab,

462
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
all of that.

463
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Boom.

464
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Send it all there.

465
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,120
It's all running on top of a Linux box, sitting on these SSDs, so you get that super fast

466
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,480
I.O. connected to tier one bandwidth.

467
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,840
I mean, it's a really great offering, DigitalOcean.com.

468
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,480
And you can try it out for two months for free.

469
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,080
They also have some hourly pricing structures available.

470
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,720
So if you want to just try something out for some testing, you can do that.

471
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
I tell you what.

472
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,920
I've got a BitTorrent sync system over there working flawlessly.

473
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,560
Really unbelievable reliability.

474
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,880
I've now got an own Cloud 7 instance over there, and I don't know if I want to give

475
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
it out just yet.

476
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,440
I might eventually, but I've got a great domain name for it because some of the new TLDs that

477
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,440
are out there.

478
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,000
So now every time I SSH into my new DigitalOcean droplet with this new TLD, it makes me giggle.

479
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I love it.

480
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,360
Go over to DigitalOcean.com.

481
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,120
Use the promo code unpluggedaugust when you check it out.

482
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,820
Grab yourself something, and you'll get it for two months for free.

483
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:37,000
And since DigitalOcean is so cool, if you forgot, because maybe it's late, I'll forgive

484
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
you.

485
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You forgot to use the promo code.

486
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Bro, it happens.

487
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,760
It's okay.

488
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
DigitalOcean's got you covered.

489
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,840
You can go retroactively apply that promo code if you forgot.

490
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,720
DigitalOcean.com, unpluggedaugust when you check out.

491
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,120
That lets them know, too, that you really do appreciate them keeping us on the air.

492
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,560
DigitalOcean.com, huge thanks to those guys for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

493
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Okay, Matt.

494
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,400
Well, Fredrik joins us from the Crux Project.

495
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,760
Fredrik, it's great to have you on the show.

496
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,920
How long have you been with the Crux Project?

497
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
What's your background there?

498
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:17,840
Well, I started using Crux in, I think, about 2004, 2005, and I was the one who started,

499
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:28,360
I guess, the port that is now Crux 3.0 and 3.1 for x86-64.

500
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,160
So I think I started that in 2008 or something like that, perhaps.

501
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
Quite a while, then.

502
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Quite a while.

503
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
Very good.

504
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Well, I really appreciate you being here.

505
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:42,200
We had a chance to look at Crux on Sunday, and the thing that really sort of stood out

506
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,400
to both Matt and I is when you have a distribution that has a lineage of Crux, I think something

507
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,480
that people have a hard time really wrapping their brains around is this isn't based on

508
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
something else, is it?

509
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,760
This Crux is an OG Linux distribution, and do you feel like maybe that makes Crux stand

510
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,480
out from the crowd a little bit more?

511
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,440
Yeah, I suppose so.

512
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:08,040
I use quite a few distributions at work and on different platforms, so it's not like Debian

513
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,380
or not like CentOS or Red Hat or anything like that.

514
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:18,360
So I think if you need to compare it to anything, it's probably more like Slackware or just

515
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
Linux from scratch.

516
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Okay.

517
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,160
Well, I'm going to jump ahead a little bit because what you kind of touched on is probably

518
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,320
one of the number one questions we had sent to the show.

519
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,800
So we let the folks know that you'd be on the show, and if they had any questions, to

520
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
send them in.

521
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,380
And we got a bunch of questions into the show, and a lot of them were the same one.

522
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,240
So I guess I want to start there because you kind of just touched on, is a lot of people

523
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,800
wanted to hear where you felt, just in your opinion, Crux fits in, like I can say, compared

524
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
to Arch.

525
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,760
I think a lot of people wanted to know Crux versus Arch.

526
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,080
What would you say Crux's strengths are, say, over Arch?

527
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:59,160
Well, actually, I've never used Arch in my life, so perhaps I'm not the right person

528
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:09,240
to answer that question, but as far as I can understand, just by looking very not really

529
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,160
in depth on Arch, I guess it's pretty similar.

530
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,800
But yeah, I'm not really comfortable making a comparison.

531
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,800
That's fine.

532
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,160
I think a lot of people see that it's sort of a set up from scratch kind of scenario

533
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,200
that I think a lot of people see a similarity there.

534
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,240
I think your comparison more to Slackware, perhaps, is more apt.

535
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,040
And do you consider Crux to be competing with the Ubuntu's and the Debian's out there?

536
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:44,920
Are there similar use cases there, or is Crux not really competing in that kind of way?

537
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,760
No, we're not really competing with anyone, and we don't really look to compete either.

538
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:57,760
If you like Crux, if you think it fits your philosophy and how you use your computer,

539
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,520
that's great.

540
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,000
We like it.

541
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,120
Success isn't measured in user base size.

542
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,380
No, no, no, not at all.

543
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:12,960
Even if it was, if everyone else left Crux tomorrow, I'd still run it, and I'd still

544
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,960
maintain it.

545
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:20,320
Do you guys have a rough estimation of the user base size of Crux?

546
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,960
No, not really.

547
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,720
We don't really distribute the ISO from the Crux site itself, so it's only mirrors, and

548
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,100
that's pretty hard to really count, I guess.

549
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:43,040
Perhaps the best way to really get a count is to monitor the rsync usage from ports 3,

550
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,240
but I asked a few days ago and it didn't really get a response, so I'm not really sure how

551
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,240
many we are.

552
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,760
But I guess it's probably less than 10,000, more than 200.

553
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,040
Yeah, that's probably a pretty safe guess.

554
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:02,860
Wimpy, you were a former Crux maintainer.

555
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,060
Now you work with the Arch Project.

556
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,000
Did you want to share your insights on some of the similarities between the projects?

557
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,080
Yeah, there are some similarities.

558
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:19,760
You mentioned on Sunday that Arch, the original Arch developer, Judd Vinnette, was inspired

559
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:26,100
by Crux, and it was the inspiration that led to him developing Arch.

560
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,880
In that respect, there are some similarities.

561
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:40,760
I was a Crux maintainer from January 2002 to December 2003, so that was Crux 0.9 era,

562
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:47,100
and I was a bit shocked to learn I used to be the KDE maintainer for Crux, which I blanked

563
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:56,040
out of my memory, but in terms of the similarities, if you look at Arch Linux before the system

564
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:03,560
D switchover when it still used rc.conf, configuring Crux is very similar to how you used to set

565
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,760
up Arch.

566
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,160
The other similarity is, of course, it's a ports type system, which effectively the AUR

567
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,240
is like a ports tree, if you like.

568
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:21,200
If you actually go and look at the PKG files on Crux, and then go and look at a PKG build

569
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:28,000
file for Arch Linux, you can clearly see that Arch was heavily influenced by Crux, because

570
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,200
there's fewer functions in Crux, but they are almost identical, and I've even heard

571
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,760
rumors that you can take packages from Crux and build them on Arch without having to change

572
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
anything.

573
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,200
Yeah, you could do that, you need to change a few variables and stuff like that, but it's

574
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,680
really simple to just move it over to Crux, if you like.

575
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,680
That underscores it.

576
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:52,240
So that kind of brings me to the next, probably most common question.

577
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,120
This is not really controversial, but I suppose some people consider it to be, but Otter was

578
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
the first to ask.

579
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,260
He says, I noticed there's no system D package in the repos, and there's no system D page

580
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,520
on the Wiki.

581
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,360
Do you have any issues with system D as a distribution, like some of the same problems

582
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,480
some of the other source-based distros have?

583
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,640
Or what are your thoughts on that?

584
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,600
Because I know the BSD init script style system is sort of an important identity point for

585
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
Crux, isn't it?

586
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,600
Yeah, I guess so.

587
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:25,000
Our init scripts to boot the system is perhaps a couple of lines, perhaps 80 lines, I haven't

588
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
really counted.

589
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,400
And it's really simple, you can easily see everything that happens, you can change anything

590
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
if you like.

591
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:37,560
So we haven't really, yeah, we don't think system D really fits with our philosophy.

592
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,520
I'm not really personally interested in it.

593
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:50,680
The only contact we have with it is the merger of Udev to system D, and that has been a bit

594
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:57,760
of a headache for us, and I guess it's made us a bit worried on what to do from here.

595
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,720
Frederick, since you've been working with Crux since 2008, have there been any surprise

596
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,480
Crux use case scenarios where you'll bump in and find, oh, this embedded device is using

597
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Crux?

598
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,120
Or this company has Crux deployed on their servers that sort of surprised you that you

599
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,680
never even knew about until one day it just sort of fell in your lap?

600
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,960
Yeah, I guess one or two years ago we had a guy asking for support on a really old Crux

601
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
distribution.

602
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,920
I can't really remember the use case, but it turned out he was the boss of a company

603
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:35,240
that used Crux for data recovery, forensic data recovery on hard drives.

604
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,200
So that was a bit of a shock, actually.

605
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Cool.

606
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
That's a good one.

607
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,400
BitPuffin, you wanted to share some thoughts on system D and what kind of drove you to

608
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Crux?

609
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Yeah.

610
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,280
Well, basically I really liked the way Arch used to be configured, and when they switched

611
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,720
to system D it all kind of became magic, and I didn't really feel comfortable with that.

612
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,960
So I switched to Crux, and I actually like most of it more anyway.

613
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,920
So it was kind of what drove me there, but then I just liked everything more.

614
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,400
Yeah, I could see how Crux could be a refuge for a lot of folks that are not super happy

615
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,200
with system D. To me, I would feel as a distribution not implementing system D, I would feel like

616
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:20,440
it is looming over me, like I'm becoming surrounded, and that it's, I don't know, it seems like

617
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,920
it's just going to become more and more intertwined with every other distribution out there.

618
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,920
Yeah, absolutely.

619
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,960
It could be an uphill battle, Frederik.

620
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,680
Yeah, really.

621
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:40,000
I think we're the only other distribution, other than Gensu that use Udeb, the fork of

622
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Udeb.

623
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,440
But I guess we'll see in a few years how things look.

624
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,120
Yeah, you know what, it might turn out to be a really good long-term bet, actually.

625
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,360
You never know, right?

626
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,520
Crazier things have happened.

627
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,560
Did you have any Crux myths or common misconceptions you wanted to address or anything kind of

628
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
like that?

629
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:05,640
I know that sometimes some of the underrepresented distributions sort of misconceptions can kind

630
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,200
of crop up over time, so I always like to give the floor to a guest to have a chance

631
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,040
to pop some of those rumor bubbles if there are any.

632
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,120
I'm not really sure.

633
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:23,160
We're quite a close community, not close, but tight community, so I don't really think

634
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,840
many people have any misconceptions on what Crux is.

635
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:36,240
The one I would give you, the one I would shoot at you is, and I think it's actually

636
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,560
a good thing, is I think the common misconception is that people are little curmudgeons over

637
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
in Cruxland.

638
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,760
And I think really what it is is it's actually just a sense of pragmatism about what functionally

639
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:55,280
works for this group of people, and it's not about setting up a fence where the neckbeards

640
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
can hang out.

641
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,480
It's about just creating a very simple distribution that works, that doesn't have a lot of extra

642
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,120
stuff built around it that gets in the way, and it is extremely practical.

643
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,960
Is that essentially my sense, right, Fredrik?

644
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,600
Yeah, I think so.

645
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:16,960
I do need to shave, but we've had some users mailing to the mailing list asking for a gnome

646
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:25,000
or why doesn't this work on Crux, how do I get Steam to work, things like that, and you

647
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,560
can get it to work, but you just need to spend a lot of time building everything because

648
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:39,600
we don't want to do it, so, especially with that, you could do it, but yeah, I guess we

649
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,720
like to keep it simple.

650
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,080
Very well, and as you should, because I think that's what's particularly appealing about

651
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,080
it.

652
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,080
Well, Fredrik, if you don't mind, if you want to stick around, we're going to talk about

653
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
Crux.

654
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,520
We had the folks in the room kick the tires, and we're all kind of going into this knowing

655
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,000
that it's not a distro for everybody, but now, that said, Mumble Room, feel free to

656
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,920
speak your mind, and Fredrik, you feel free to respond to anything you want.

657
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,240
We'll talk about the community's reaction.

658
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:09,760
We have a virtual review lug, if you will, a strike team that goes in and tactically

659
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,760
assesses distribution.

660
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
That sounds ridiculous.

661
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,760
That sounds scary.

662
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:18,800
You know, we call them Linux Team Six.

663
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,680
Oh, my God.

664
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Oh, wow.

665
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
I'm sorry.

666
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Too soon.

667
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Too soon.

668
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,960
All right, but before we jump into that, I'll thank our next sponsor, because Linux Academy

669
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,940
has just recently rolled out some brand new stuff, so this is a great time to mention

670
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,940
Linux Academy.

671
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,000
Head over there to check them out, linuxacademy.com.

672
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,920
In fact, go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

673
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,680
That'll get you the Summer of Learning discount.

674
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,360
That's right, up to 33%.

675
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,340
That makes it $50 a quarter.

676
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:51,720
They just rolled out brand new stuff, an entire new course called OpenStack Essentials.

677
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,280
It's 100% complete, and it's up on Linux Academy right now.

678
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,920
Go over to linuxacademy.com and take the tour.

679
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,920
See their new AWS-certified SysOps Administration prep course?

680
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,920
It's really come together, and it's packed with over 14 hours of content.

681
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,360
Now, what is Linux Academy?

682
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,360
Think of it this way.

683
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,960
A group of extremely passionate Linux users who had an educational background, and then

684
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,420
the other side of the group had a development background that came together and said, we

685
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,620
need to create a platform for other Linux users to learn and expand their skill set.

686
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,800
So here's what they did.

687
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,540
They set up a system that's all based around step-by-step video courses with downloadable

688
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,560
comprehensive study guides.

689
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,760
Each course, when you're required, it comes with its own server.

690
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,160
They spin up on demand.

691
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,120
You can run seven-plus of the available Linux distributions they have.

692
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,560
They automatically adapt the courseware to match that distribution.

693
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,240
This is a great way, if you need to switch distros to learn how another one is done,

694
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,960
or if you've been primarily a Red Hat guy and now you're working on an Ubuntu box, go

695
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,800
get yourself up to speed, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

696
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,040
You can keep track of your progress as you go, too, so you'll see exactly how long it's

697
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,040
going to take you, so you'll know exactly how much time you need to budget.

698
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,260
You can come back later on and check it out, see where you're at, test yourself, keep up

699
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,000
to date, and they've got a community, too, that'll help kind of give you that incentive

700
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,320
if you choose to engage.

701
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,480
You can remain a loner.

702
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,480
That's fine.

703
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,940
That's my approach, but if you'd like to go in there and tell people and talk to people

704
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:10,480
about where you're getting stuck, help people kind of, get people to kind of help you move

705
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,160
along and sort of, it's like when I went to a gym, I would have, I would have a gym buddy

706
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,960
that would kind of encourage me to keep going.

707
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,300
The community can be that same kind of thing.

708
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,440
So go check out all of the intercourse where they're adding all of the time.

709
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,720
If you want to mess around with AWS, too, this is a great opportunity because they'll

710
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,940
spin up the AWS instances as you need them.

711
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,960
They've also been doing some live streaming with Q&A so you can ask the instructor questions,

712
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,080
and I think one of the things that I've enjoyed hearing a lot from our audience is when they're

713
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,520
learning and they really get excited about the topic and they're really starting to,

714
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,880
you know, it's really scratching that itch, but they need to step away for a while.

715
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,780
They're taking these comprehensive study guides because they're in video, PDF, and audio,

716
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,560
and they're downloading them offline and consuming them when they're in the shower, when they're

717
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,560
in the car, and they're always able to learn.

718
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,660
This is a great way to get your skill set up, to help you become a little more employable,

719
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,700
or land that next contract, or check that box off on the review, or just intellectually

720
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,460
stimulate yourself, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

721
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,680
Go take advantage of the Summer of Learning discount because you know what, summer's not

722
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:14,560
going to last forever, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

723
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,280
And a really big thank you to Linux Academy for being so damn awesome and supporting the

724
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,560
Linux Unplugged show, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

725
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,800
Okay, Mumble Room, so you guys got to do what Matt and I did for last Sunday.

726
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,920
You got to try out Crux.

727
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,120
I'm really kind of looking forward to it now.

728
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,640
I know we have a wide range of experience here.

729
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,560
Wimpy, obviously, as a former Crux maintainer, didn't have a hard time.

730
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,040
But Josh, I know that when you started to dig into it you realized it might be a little

731
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,680
more than you were willing to bite off, right?

732
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:52,960
Yeah, so first a disclaimer, I am completely spoiled by binary packages.

733
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,520
I refuse to compile anything unless I absolutely have to.

734
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,160
It's like a pride thing, is that what you're saying?

735
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,880
No, it's more of a time thing.

736
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,600
I don't have time to compile everything.

737
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:07,480
I understand some people have really high-end computers and they could compile stuff in

738
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
freaking milliseconds.

739
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,480
But Josh is on a Celeron, he's got, no, I'm kidding.

740
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,760
No, not quite.

741
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:23,760
When I looked at Crux and I came to the realization that I needed to compile my kernel and figure

742
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,680
out all the modules I needed, and I disclaimer, they do have a really good set of defaults,

743
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,480
that immediately turned me off.

744
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,440
But here is why I think you should use Crux, plain and simple, and that's their port system.

745
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,560
It would be insane if you're using Arch and you want something more source-based where

746
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:50,280
you want to control every little bit of source that goes into your system, Crux is for you.

747
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,320
And if you want to make sure that there isn't any unnecessary garbage that's getting thrown

748
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,680
in your system, the port system is just so flexible.

749
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,400
And from what I've seen, there is a lot of ports maintainers.

750
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,000
You have a core team and you have a lot of experienced individuals that maintain an extensive

751
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,880
amount of ports.

752
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:18,120
And you could easily enable different port sections such as Contrib, which is the most

753
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:22,920
experienced port maintainers from what I've seen.

754
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,040
And that opens up a huge variety of software.

755
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
That's good to know.

756
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,640
Now BitPuffin, you say there may be a solution for Josh who wants binary packages, right?

757
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:39,000
Yeah, so me and another fellow Cruxer named ProLogic are working on an open-source service

758
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,320
for maintaining port collections and stuff.

759
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:48,400
And it will also provide automatic builds so you get binary packages.

760
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,200
And there's actually a binary package manager in Crux called PackageGet, like PortGet, but

761
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,400
for binary packages basically.

762
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,440
So that might help a bit.

763
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,440
That's very true.

764
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,400
And so you've got some solutions.

765
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,740
It seems like every time I dig into something, Frederick, when it comes to Crux too, it sounds

766
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:13,840
a lot of times like the portions of the community just sort of spontaneously come together and

767
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,840
fill in gaps.

768
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,040
Like isn't that how PackageGet kind of also originally was materialized is by community

769
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,600
participation and it's like, okay, we as a community want to fix this thing, let's all

770
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
get together.

771
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,080
And that's really cool.

772
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:34,760
Yeah, I think most of the Crux system you see today actually was built by the community.

773
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:41,520
Crux was started by Pär Lidén and he was pretty much alone maintaining it for a number

774
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,760
of years before the community stepped in and joined up.

775
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:52,720
So PortGet, tools like that are mostly developed from scratch by the community.

776
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,280
So I guess so.

777
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:01,720
We have an ARM fork because somebody noticed that they wanted to put Crux on ARM, so that

778
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
was created.

779
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
And yeah.

780
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,720
Fair enough.

781
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
I guess so.

782
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Yeah.

783
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,720
Wimpy, you know, you touched on it.

784
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,600
Maybe it was in the pre-show, Josh was like, yeah, boy, when I found out I had to compile

785
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
my kernel.

786
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:17,840
Wimpy, do you have some wisdom when it comes to building the kernel under Crux?

787
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Not wisdom.

788
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,260
I mean, obviously, you read the Crux page and it makes it very clear that they use the

789
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,840
words experienced Linux users.

790
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,160
So I see this and I think, right, brilliant, let's get a large glass of whiskey, roll our

791
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,160
sleeves up and get stuck in.

792
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,560
So the install, I found very similar to Arch, if you've installed Arch since they got rid

793
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,520
of the menu based installer, Crux and Arch are very similar.

794
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:50,400
And I would say that installing Crux is as easy, in quotes, as installing Arch, although...

795
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,800
But you have to compile the majority of the stuff.

796
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,680
Well, the install, everything comes from binaries except the kernel.

797
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:06,520
So my critique would be that as part of the install, stick a kernel on that's pre-built

798
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,120
with the defaults because the defaults are very good.

799
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,560
And then for the tinkerers and tweakers, you can then...

800
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:20,320
Couldn't you grab the live cities kernel image from the live cities slash bot?

801
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
You could.

802
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
Yeah.

803
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,320
I didn't think...

804
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:29,720
The live city kernel, it's built with modules and stuff like that.

805
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,720
It might be a bit tricky to move over.

806
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
I'm not really sure it's simpler, but...

807
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
But I would actually...

808
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,080
I actually think building the kernel is the easiest part of the Crux install because you

809
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:45,200
just go into the kernel source directory, make menu config, choose your options, make

810
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
all...

811
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:49,920
Make module install and then copy the image over and then edit the grub.

812
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:54,160
The hard part is editing Lilo and moving the VMZ image over.

813
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,960
But because the source code is already on the ISO, it's not like...

814
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,720
For me, when it comes time to...

815
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:03,760
For me, building a kernel from scratch is you use links to go to kernel.org, you download

816
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,520
the freaking source code, you extract the freaking source code, then you go into that

817
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,380
new directory that you've just extracted and then you make menu config.

818
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,760
For me, the fact that the folder was already there and extracted made it easy.

819
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,040
It doesn't seem that hard to me.

820
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,120
Yes, there's the man who's got a Bonobo Extreme with a sexy CPU.

821
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,360
I'm on a seven-year-old laptop.

822
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,120
It's not how difficult it is, it's how long it takes.

823
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,120
Okay, all right.

824
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
Fair enough.

825
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
That's the real thing.

826
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,120
How long it takes.

827
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,520
It's like, I have other stuff I need to do.

828
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:36,680
And I get it, once you're up and running with it, it's potentially just as easy as running

829
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:43,520
an Arch install, if not easier, but it's the time you have to initially take into it might

830
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,320
not be appealing to some individuals.

831
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,320
Now hold on.

832
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
BitPuff and...

833
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
Oh, go ahead, Fredrik.

834
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,080
Yeah, and if you notice you need something that's not really provided by the community,

835
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,080
it might be a bit of a pain in the ass.

836
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Sorry.

837
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Well, I mean...

838
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,080
Like Steam, for example.

839
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,840
We have had a few people who got it running, but it is a lot of work and you need to install

840
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,960
half the internet for libraries and stuff like that.

841
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,040
So yeah, you could do it, but perhaps it's not really the distribution you want if you

842
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
need to do that.

843
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Well, there's that.

844
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,080
But it sounds like what BitPuffin is saying is that the port system might actually have

845
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,880
a solution for some folks.

846
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
BitPuffin?

847
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,880
Yeah.

848
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,040
So you could theoretically make a port that builds the kernel and stuff for you, and I

849
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,680
think people have attempted maintaining that in the past, just that they probably maybe

850
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,080
left or something, or very probably knows that they've been...

851
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,400
But it's technically possible.

852
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Yeah.

853
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
Okay.

854
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Well, all right.

855
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
That makes sense.

856
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,160
I've been dancing around this question the whole time, wimpy.

857
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,580
I really want to know, as a former Crux maintainer, but it gives you a bit of a bias, I'm sure,

858
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,580
but I'm really curious.

859
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,760
I know you dove into it more recently again.

860
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,220
What was it like going back and what were your impressions?

861
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:57,000
I was really surprised how little has changed in the last 10 or 12 years.

862
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,480
Is that good?

863
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,080
Well, I think it is.

864
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,520
I've got some notes here and towards the end I explain why I think it's a good thing.

865
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,400
But yeah, the package system, the way it's distributed, the way it's installed, the fact

866
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:18,000
you have to compile the kernel as part of the install, the package tools, PRT-GET even

867
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,520
or PKG-GET, I forget, PRT-GET, it's all as it was when there's no dependencies in the

868
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,840
base package system, which is just how I remember it.

869
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:35,280
But it was this compiling stuff from source that ultimately reminded me why it was I left

870
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,800
Crux in the first place.

871
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:44,680
And that was because I'd been using Crux for two years and what I realized was that I hadn't

872
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,880
actually used my Linux workstations for anything productive whatsoever.

873
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,760
I just spent two years compiling stuff, tinkering and configuring my system, but not actually

874
00:42:54,760 --> 00:43:00,840
using it, which is sort of bad, but it's also good because I learned an awful lot during

875
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:06,600
those two years and I owe the project a debt of gratitude because I learned about all of

876
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:12,120
the file systems, I learned about compiling kernels, I learned about loading modules and

877
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:16,240
when to choose to make kernel modules and when to build them into the kernel.

878
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,220
And this was all invaluable skills that have served me well to this day.

879
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:28,360
So there is a place for Crux to exist and I couldn't see myself using it now as my main

880
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:34,880
operating system, but for people that are out there that have installed Debian or Ubuntu

881
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,120
or Mint and then want to learn a bit more about how Linux works, then you can graduate

882
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:46,320
to maybe a Debian net install, text-based installer and then install all of your packages

883
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:52,680
and compile it and build it and then migrate to Arch Linux and then migrate to Crux, which

884
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:56,700
will give you an even deeper understanding of how you put together a Linux operating

885
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:01,920
system and then you can go for something like Linux from scratch to really learn how the

886
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:08,940
boot manager talks to the kernel, talks to the init process and round off your understanding

887
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,000
about how it will work.

888
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,440
So there's a place for Crux and without Crux there probably wouldn't have been an Arch

889
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:15,440
Linux.

890
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,440
So it's pretty great.

891
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,440
Whimby, let me ask you this then.

892
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,540
I mean I noticed, I like your graduation scale of ways like stepping up your learning, starting

893
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,520
with net install of Debian and stepping up there, but there's the elephant in the room

894
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,320
in your step there is it seems like it might be possible to take Crux out of that step

895
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,640
and insert Gentoo and have the same effect.

896
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,560
Do you feel like you have a clear differentiator in your mind where Crux is strongly differentiating

897
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,080
from Gentoo and why you might choose one over the other?

898
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:50,760
Yeah, I think you could say that Gentoo helps you a little bit more along than Crux does.

899
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,920
The package system eBuilds are a little bit more flexible and more mature as well.

900
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,440
I mean some of the things I ran into installing the system was footprint errors, which was

901
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,040
frustrating because installing a lot of packages takes a long time.

902
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:14,480
You can't rely on it to complete automatically in the background because you get footprint

903
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,480
errors that you have to then go to and sort out.

904
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:22,480
True, yeah, I guess regarding the footprint errors, I really do think we need to improve

905
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,720
that bit.

906
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,600
You could have new footprint errors or you could have missing and of course new.

907
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:38,440
It just might be because you installed CUPS or whatever and some crucial packages are

908
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,600
built with the printer support and you get a new library file and yeah, you get an error.

909
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:49,440
It's not really pretty at the moment but yeah, we could improve that and we probably will.

910
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,240
Yeah, I mean those things happen and it's an ongoing process.

911
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,080
I know some other folks in the mumble room had a chance to kick the tires.

912
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,880
Anybody else want to chime in with their thoughts about Crux?

913
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,180
I can see Wimpy's point as a learning tool.

914
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,480
It's a very humbling experience.

915
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,120
With every time I want to try and do something, I have to think a little bit but I don't see

916
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,760
a whole lot of, and I might get my head bit off for saying this, I didn't see a whole

917
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,920
lot of practical purpose for it.

918
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,980
Yeah, I guess that's a fair point I think.

919
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,980
You could use it.

920
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:31,680
I use it at home, at work, pretty much everywhere but yeah, you can find another tool that perhaps

921
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,680
does the job better.

922
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,960
Yeah, and I kind of like that attitude of the project.

923
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,320
It's like, hey, that's fine and I think Kernel Linux, I think you and I kind of fall in the

924
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:44,040
same camp where it's like, yeah, this tool isn't the right one for my box, hello, but

925
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:50,000
I think there are some boxes that tool fits quite well and like Joe Prager in the chat

926
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:56,040
room says that Crux has been his main workstation for almost a decade now.

927
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,800
For some folks, it does happen to fit that.

928
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,240
So Noah, were you able to get it installed or did you kind of read through the documentation

929
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,760
and hit some road bumps and stop there?

930
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,200
First I tried installing it on VirtualBox and that turned out to be a huge mistake.

931
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:17,780
I guess the way that the Kernel compiles, I understand that I guess it's a little bit

932
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:19,660
different if you're going to do it on a VirtualBox.

933
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:24,680
What I ended up doing is I bought one of those Chrome boxes from Best Buy for like 150 bucks,

934
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,760
I ended up installing it on that.

935
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,640
And yeah, I got it installed so everything worked okay, it was kind of what somebody

936
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,560
else said it already but it was one of those things that like after a couple hours of every

937
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,560
time I wanted to do something, going out and compiling all it, I just kind of was like,

938
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,040
well, that was Crux.

939
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:46,680
Yeah, I understand, but BitPuff, you say, hey, to me that means I know just about where

940
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,080
every file is on my system.

941
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,560
I can go in and fix anything I need to, right?

942
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:58,600
Yeah, and like when things go wrong, we just know how to fix them and we don't like having

943
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,640
to refer to a wiki and look for workarounds and stuff.

944
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,240
Is it a bit of a ticker aspect?

945
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:10,080
Not so much a ticker, it's just more like we have, it looks like a more close relationship

946
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,080
to the system.

947
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,080
I understand that.

948
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:16,800
In Arch, you might not know what everything does because it just magically configures

949
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,600
stuff but here we kind of do a lot of things on our own so we know how to fix things.

950
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,320
You are one with your file system.

951
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,320
Yeah.

952
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,640
Yeah, no, I get that.

953
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,920
I actually, I also don't feel like, you know, I don't think like, I think sometimes we're

954
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:35,080
always trying to look for like, and this comes back from like the 80s, like computers are

955
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,500
useful tools that have practical reasons to use them all the time and sometimes it's okay

956
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:43,640
to say, you know what, I have a computer over here and I like to tinker a little bit with

957
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:44,640
the OS.

958
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,360
I like to be a little bit of a hobbyist and I can also get my work, and I kind of feel

959
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,000
like that's for me, that's where Arch fits.

960
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,760
It's like it's very serious and gets work done but I can also tinker with it.

961
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,320
Do you feel it fits in there, Noah?

962
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,800
Yeah, I was just going to, you hit on something important.

963
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:03,200
I love that mentality and I think here's what bothered me specifically, Crux, and Arch falls

964
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,200
into this too.

965
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:09,320
I feel like I find myself in a monkey see, monkey do situation where I'm doing stuff

966
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,960
to get things done but I don't necessarily understand what I'm doing and I feel like

967
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,600
when I ask for help, everyone wants to give me the answer to how to get the job done but

968
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:22,400
nobody wants to explain why it is I'm executing the commands I'm executing.

969
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,400
Hmm.

970
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,960
Yeah, I get that can also, that can be a symptom of a wiki.

971
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,360
You know, because it's just there, you just kind of fall into this copy paste syndrome.

972
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,360
Right.

973
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,360
That makes sense.

974
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:36,360
And then you do, so maybe you're not learning if you're doing that.

975
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,880
I think you're always learning something, right?

976
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,600
Like even if, even if I know what, what commands to execute to get something done, even if

977
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,040
I don't understand what those commands are doing, I'm still learning something.

978
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:48,040
But there are, there are multiple times I was like, I wonder what exactly that's doing.

979
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,600
That's like, that's really interesting and I just feel, I mean, it's not that it's anyone's

980
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,180
job to explain it to me, but it would have been, it'd be nice if there was more explanation

981
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,800
to what each of those commands do.

982
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,800
Yeah, I do.

983
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:58,800
Yeah, I agree.

984
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,120
Well, like one thing about the community that I find kind of different also is like with

985
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,120
what you're saying.

986
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:08,400
Like in Arch, I definitely feel like people are just like, Oh, you know, you just do this.

987
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,280
But in the Crux IRC, for example, I feel like they are much more pedagogical, but of course

988
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,260
we could probably be better than we currently are, but I still feel like there was a big

989
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:22,360
difference from Arch to Crux in how friendly people are with helping new people.

990
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,360
Yeah.

991
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,360
Yeah.

992
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,720
I mean, Arch does kind of have a bad rep for that.

993
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:26,720
All right.

994
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,240
Last call for Crux thoughts before we move on to our next topic.

995
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:34,720
This has been a fascinating, I actually, in some ways, I think you guys are lining up

996
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,720
exactly with kind of where I fell on it on Sunday.

997
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:39,320
Matt, do you have any thoughts before we wrap up?

998
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,320
I think that's really it.

999
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:44,240
I think that the meat and potatoes of it, it comes down to that you can actually, you

1000
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,580
know, learn how Linux works, understand what's going on and go beyond merely reading a Wiki.

1001
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:53,080
That if you have a community with Crux that you can actually ask, why is it, why am I

1002
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,600
doing this specifically as Noah pointed out?

1003
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,640
That's really cool because in most other distributions, you are basically just copying and pasting.

1004
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,400
So I think it's a great learning tool.

1005
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,640
I think that's what I see it as.

1006
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,320
It's a great way to understand what your end result's going to be.

1007
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,120
If I do this, this happens, but I had to do this to get there.

1008
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,120
Oh, that's cool.

1009
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:13,120
Yeah.

1010
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,120
Yeah.

1011
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,120
Yeah.

1012
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,120
Very well said.

1013
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,120
All right, Mumble Room.

1014
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,120
Go ahead.

1015
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,120
Go ahead.

1016
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,120
Last call for any thoughts.

1017
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:24,840
I think if you're eyeballing Gentoo and you have the time or like Matt said, the urge

1018
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:28,360
to learn, try out Crux first.

1019
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,360
That's the one thing I have to say.

1020
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,360
Very nice.

1021
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,360
All right.

1022
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:36,480
Well, I've got something that's been floating around the web and seems to have really resonated

1023
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,520
with a lot of Linux users, long time Linux users and new Linux users that I want to bounce

1024
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,520
around with you guys and get your take on it.

1025
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,720
So first let's stop and thank Ting.

1026
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:50,760
Go over to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com, think about that for a second.

1027
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,320
First of all, we've got a mobile carrier to create a URL that has Linux in it.

1028
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:58,080
So go to linux.ting.com to rock it, to thank them for supporting Linux Unplugged.

1029
00:51:58,080 --> 00:51:59,080
Now what is Ting?

1030
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,400
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

1031
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,340
My mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider.

1032
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,560
And here's what Matt and I love about it.

1033
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,560
No contract.

1034
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,000
That means no ETF.

1035
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,200
Don't ever worry about that.

1036
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,600
You don't have to deal with it.

1037
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,920
Plus, it's pricing structure is so simple.

1038
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,480
It's a flat $6 a month.

1039
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,480
Okay.

1040
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,480
$6 a month.

1041
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,280
Then any taxes the man's going to put on that because the man be taxing.

1042
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,440
But then it's just your usage, minutes, messages, megabytes.

1043
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,440
They add them up.

1044
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:27,160
Whatever bucket you fall into, that's what you pay.

1045
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,960
That's how all mobile companies should be.

1046
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:29,960
It's so unbelievable.

1047
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,300
It seems impossible, but it's legit.

1048
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,300
That's how Ting works.

1049
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,040
In fact, if you go over to Ting, they have the savings calculator.

1050
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,840
Pop that savings calculator.

1051
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,040
Put your usage in there.

1052
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,080
Not what they're scamming you out of.

1053
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,520
Not the amounts they're getting you to pay.

1054
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,880
Oh, well, you might use a thousand minutes, right?

1055
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,800
You better pay a thousand minutes every single month.

1056
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,000
Oh, actually, it turns out I only use 500 minutes.

1057
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,880
Well, I'm in a two-year contract.

1058
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,400
No, no, no.

1059
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,840
Go over to linux.ting.com.

1060
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,960
Click the savings calculator.

1061
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,640
Put your actual usage in there, and then get ready for this.

1062
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,000
Look at the savings, and then I've got good news.

1063
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,960
Ting has an early termination relief program.

1064
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,080
They'll pay up to $75 per line that you have to cancel.

1065
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,200
Then you're like, Chris, not good enough, buddy, because I got this phone, and this

1066
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,800
phone don't work on the Ting network.

1067
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,280
I got you covered.

1068
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,960
Actually, Ting's got you covered.

1069
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,040
They have a swap program.

1070
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:19,360
You can bring your smartphone over to Ting, and they'll swap it for a Ting-ready device.

1071
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,440
If you've got an AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobes device, bring that over to Ting, and take

1072
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,160
advantage of their swap program, and they're going to hook you up.

1073
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,440
And then you're taking advantage of the Ting control panel.

1074
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,120
Then you're only paying for what you've used.

1075
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:34,600
Then you've got no-hold customer service at 1855-TING-FTW, where a real person answers

1076
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,600
the phone.

1077
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,600
You've got hotspot.

1078
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:41,040
You've got tethering, picture messaging, caller ID, all built into every single plan, and

1079
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,160
you only pay for your usage.

1080
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:44,720
That's what's so awesome about Ting.

1081
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,900
And when you combine it with devices like the Nexus 5, hello, you can go get an awesome

1082
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,920
smartphone that you straight-up, legit own, and then go put it on a network where there's

1083
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,920
no contract, no early termination fee, and you're paying for your usage.

1084
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,280
Linux.ting.com will take $25 off your first device, $25 off your first device if you're

1085
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,440
going to bring a device.

1086
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,520
They'll give you a $25 service credit, and if you're like me, that's going to pay for

1087
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,360
more than your first month.

1088
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,360
Linux.ting.com.

1089
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,360
Linux.ting.com.

1090
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:17,640
And a really big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

1091
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,640
Matt and I are here to tell you, the Ting service rocks.

1092
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:24,440
And Matt, I don't know if you've traveled outside of Washington much because, you know,

1093
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,440
I don't think you have since we haven't missed a week of shows.

1094
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,440
I don't think you have.

1095
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,320
I was going to say, the big secret is I never leave the house.

1096
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,320
Yeah.

1097
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,200
So, but that was great because I'm pretty much always here at the studio or I'm at the

1098
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,200
house and I'm on Wi-Fi.

1099
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,340
So, I save a ton of money that way, and if you out there are in a similar situation,

1100
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:44,280
there is ridiculous savings to be had, but even if you do end up on the road and use

1101
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,760
a fair amount of data or minutes, there's still savings to be had.

1102
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,880
If you can take advantage of Wi-Fi, then it really gets blitz nuts.

1103
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:53,960
I'll tell you though, Matt, since you don't travel much, I was very happy to report that

1104
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:58,200
when we were down in Portland, I was getting LTE coverage like a boss everywhere I went.

1105
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,200
Nice.

1106
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,280
So, yeah, I felt like I was actually living in 2014.

1107
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,280
It was pretty cool.

1108
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,920
Well, and what's weird here recently is I've always had good coverage in the house, actually.

1109
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,200
I have a Verizon phone and I have a Ting phone, and, you know, they're both different companies

1110
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,480
doing their thing, but I've noticed that Ting always got better coverage.

1111
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,440
What was interesting is recently, and I don't know what happened, I got more bars.

1112
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,440
Boom!

1113
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,440
I don't know what...

1114
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,440
More bars, yeah.

1115
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,440
I don't know if they...

1116
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,440
Well, they're firing up LTE...

1117
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,440
Did they turn on a power?

1118
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,440
No, yeah, they are.

1119
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,440
Yeah, all over it.

1120
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:27,440
So, they're...

1121
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,440
It just totally destroyed Verizon.

1122
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,440
Yeah, there has been a big rollout for the last...

1123
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,440
So, this is the other thing, too, about the coverage.

1124
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,120
The coverage, the entire coverage map has changed in the last year and it's still continuing

1125
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,120
to change, too.

1126
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:35,120
It's really kind of neat.

1127
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:37,240
They're really making an investment in that.

1128
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:41,760
Okay, I wanted to bounce around a topic with you in the mumble room.

1129
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:50,080
It's a piece that was over on fosforce.com and it's been making the rounds.

1130
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:54,640
Every news outlet I follow to collect news for these shows has been carrying this piece.

1131
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,400
And the title is, you've probably heard about it, When Linux Was Perfect Enough.

1132
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,120
All right, I'm not going to quibble about the title.

1133
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,400
I'm not a huge fan of it, but okay, whatever.

1134
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,400
So, here it is.

1135
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,400
The other day, this is...

1136
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,400
I'm going to summarize it for you.

1137
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,800
This is from Christine Hall and she writes, the other day, my colleague, friend, and sometimes

1138
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:14,280
partner in crime, Ken Starks, published an article here on Fosforce on one of his favorite

1139
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,080
gripes, that things didn't work right in Linux.

1140
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,760
This time, he was complaining about the font issue in Mint when using KDE.

1141
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,000
This is nothing new for Ken.

1142
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,440
In the past, he's written other articles about broken aspects of various Linux distros that

1143
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,320
never seem to get quite fixed and his contention is these small bugs, which remain unfixed

1144
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:36,600
release after release, are largely responsible for desktop Linux failures to take hold with

1145
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,600
the general public.

1146
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,760
Now, here's the thing, she says, he might be right.

1147
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:45,080
For Christmas, I bought my roommate a new second generation Nexus 7 tablet running Android,

1148
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,520
an OS built around the Linux kernel.

1149
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,120
It just worked out of the box with no tweaking necessary.

1150
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,480
During the last seven months, she's used it for hours daily and as far as I know, she's

1151
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,120
never found any glitches that require fixing.

1152
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:02,360
I point this out because Linux is all but taken over the tablet and phone end of the

1153
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,360
computing spectrum.

1154
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:06,800
Alba makes plenty of money with the iPhone and iPad, but that's due to their high prices.

1155
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,760
In market share, they lag far behind Android devices.

1156
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:14,760
And Microsoft has proven that Windows is not unbeatable anymore.

1157
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,680
It's not the giant it once was.

1158
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:20,180
Even with massive money spent on television ads and conspicuous product placement in nearly

1159
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:25,120
every scripted drama on CBS, mobile devices running Windows remain a mere asterisk when

1160
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:26,120
looking at market share.

1161
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:31,000
Today's average computer users, and I loathe to use the word consumers, want to get things

1162
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
done on their computers without having to delve under the hood to fix things.

1163
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,520
This is understandable and isn't unlike the average automobile owner who just want to

1164
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,960
drive their cars without knowing or caring how it works.

1165
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,680
Just as most drivers take their cars to the shop for repair to solve mechanical and computer

1166
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,200
related issues, most computer users take their device to the shop with no concern about whether

1167
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,260
the problem is hardware or software related.

1168
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,120
They just want the damn thing to work.

1169
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:58,720
Back in 2002, I installed GNU Linux for the first time.

1170
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,680
At that time, like most Americans, I was tethered to a dial-up connection.

1171
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,080
And she goes on to talk about all of the little hardware problems that she had but didn't

1172
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,080
care about.

1173
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,780
You know, sound card didn't work, scanners didn't work.

1174
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:15,640
But gone finally was the blue screen of death and that nearly daily crash that was business

1175
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,240
as usual with Windows.

1176
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:21,040
Unfortunately, gone were a lot of my peripherals that used to just work.

1177
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,080
But I didn't mind.

1178
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:26,260
I was free of Microsoft and I was using a different operating system that made me feel

1179
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:29,140
like some sort of computer genius.

1180
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:34,240
My point is that back in those days, none of these flaws mattered.

1181
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:39,640
Most of us were already used to having to fiddle with configuration files and such.

1182
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:43,960
Even using IBM compatible computers running Microsoft products, you still had problems.

1183
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,340
Like most users in those days, I'd cut my teeth on command line DOS machines where printers

1184
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,680
had to be configured separately for each and every program and where the ability to write

1185
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:55,420
a succinct autoexec.bat was necessary.

1186
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,560
But that's not who's using computers today.

1187
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:02,520
Today computer users just want the computer to work without problems out of the box.

1188
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,560
They don't want to have to figure out why Hulu or Netflix doesn't work or why their

1189
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:09,480
fonts display properly in some applications but not others.

1190
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,720
These days, that includes me.

1191
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:17,800
While I'm happy I have enough skills to usually fix a bug that made in the past, while I'm

1192
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:23,040
glad I have the skills to usually fix a bug that made past developers of Mint and Fedora,

1193
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,120
I just assume not be able to deal with it at all.

1194
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:31,040
I have work I have to get done and when I'm not working, I want to be wasting my time

1195
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,920
with friends on Facebook, not getting aggravated with my computer.

1196
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:41,320
So she's making the point, what she's trying to say here is Linux's amount of tweaking

1197
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:48,480
it takes to work sometimes was okay five years ago or so, back when all computers were like

1198
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:49,480
that.

1199
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,480
But a lot of computers, when you look at Chromebooks and iPads and MacBooks, have moved forward

1200
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:59,880
where that tweaking and that stuff just doesn't really happen at all anymore on those.

1201
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:03,880
And it's no longer acceptable that Linux is still requiring that amount of configuration.

1202
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:08,600
Matt, on its face, do you think the premise is roughly accurate?

1203
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:14,720
Not only is it accurate, but her source actually, unlike us who talk a lot, actually is in the

1204
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,280
trenches putting Linux and computers in front of people that can't afford them.

1205
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:22,640
So I mean, he really knows what he's talking about, literally, at the base level.

1206
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:23,640
Ken does.

1207
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,640
Yeah, Ken does.

1208
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,640
Exactly.

1209
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,560
And I used to be one of those guys that actually swap people out and stuff like that, but nothing

1210
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,560
like he does.

1211
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:33,640
So he's seen this and loving Linux and he's seen this on a daily basis.

1212
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:34,640
And he's right.

1213
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:38,080
I mean, at the end of the day, there are certain paper cuts that exist on the most polished

1214
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:41,920
Linux desktop that can frustrate people to a certain extent.

1215
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,200
That being said, I've been a big supporter of the idea that with a proper support system

1216
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,800
in place, this would not be a problem.

1217
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:53,360
I've seen various companies attempt this, Linspire, Zombo, various, various attempts

1218
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:57,560
all failures, but the idea was sound.

1219
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,520
Provide that Apple-like experience.

1220
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:00,520
Here's the rub.

1221
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:05,560
As soon as you point to anything that basically has the word A in it, like Apple, or has any

1222
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:10,560
other non-Linux flavor to it or doesn't require you to get your hands dirty, a lot of Linux

1223
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:14,120
people get really butt-hurt and really upset by that.

1224
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,720
And I never really understood what the big deal was.

1225
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,040
First of all, how many of them have actually experienced what Ken's talking about or what

1226
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:24,920
she's talking about specifically, the author of the article.

1227
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,920
It's interesting.

1228
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,840
I think that we're going to have to really noodle that over.

1229
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,920
Let me toss this to Faith.

1230
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:33,600
Faith says the problem here is that there's not enough pre-installed Linux machines.

1231
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,920
Faith, do you think it's not a fair comparison because a lot of people buy a machine and

1232
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:38,640
a lot of stuff is already set up for them?

1233
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,640
What do you think?

1234
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,280
Well, I just think the issue is a little bit more complex.

1235
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,320
It's not any one thing.

1236
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:47,360
And for some people that need, like you said, Hulu or Netflix, that's going to be an issue.

1237
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:50,360
But I've done installs for my friends and family.

1238
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:54,960
And for example, I don't think anybody I've installed Linux for, they've used Hulu or

1239
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,320
Netflix on their computer.

1240
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,840
They have it on their set-top box.

1241
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:03,640
So that hasn't been an issue, but they never would have used Linux if it wasn't for me.

1242
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,600
Because even if you have a perfect distro where you never have to get your hands dirty,

1243
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:10,200
you still have to get your hands dirty to get the distro on the computer.

1244
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:14,000
And it's just there are companies that sell pre-installed Linux, but you have to already

1245
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,600
know what Linux is and go find them.

1246
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,800
Colonel Linux, you've got your ears on.

1247
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:22,560
You've moved a lot of users over to desktop Linux.

1248
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:26,020
But when you do it, you're probably maybe smoothing over a few rough edges, even if

1249
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:30,560
it's just somebody setting up creating user accounts, maybe adding the printer.

1250
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,280
What's your take on this article, Colonel Linux?

1251
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,280
Right.

1252
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,280
No.

1253
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,280
So I agree completely.

1254
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,280
And I want to echo what Faith said.

1255
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:41,800
I think the biggest problem is, I watched, and I was ragging on this in the mumble room

1256
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:45,600
I think a couple days ago, but I was in Best Buy and this lady comes in and she's sitting

1257
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:48,160
there and she goes, yeah, I need to buy a new computer.

1258
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,080
And so I was looking at one of those MacBooks, so they go over, well, what do you do?

1259
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:55,680
Well, I checked my Gmail and I like to watch YouTube videos.

1260
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,920
Oh, and I like to go on Facebook.

1261
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,040
And I'm like, that's a Linux user right there.

1262
01:03:00,040 --> 01:03:01,040
That could be a Linux user.

1263
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:04,360
And the only reason she's not a Linux user is because there's no computer she can pick

1264
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,560
up in this brick and mortar store other than a Chromebook that has Linux installed.

1265
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:11,560
But when I was listening to you read that article, one of the things that stood out

1266
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,800
to me is how many of those problems are not Linux's fault.

1267
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:15,800
For example, Netflix.

1268
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,320
Yes, we don't have Netflix.

1269
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,200
Yes, it's a hack together solution.

1270
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,360
What are we supposed to do about it?

1271
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:28,180
If Netflix won't, if the market share doesn't dictate enough users for Netflix to make the

1272
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:32,800
necessary changes to support Linux, what are we as Linux users supposed to do about that?

1273
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:36,920
Well, okay, so, I mean, you mentioned the Chromebook.

1274
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,360
That's the elephant in the room, I think.

1275
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:43,200
I think the Chromebook is successful Linux in a sense.

1276
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:48,400
I think the Chromebook represents what a company that takes Linux and consumerizes it and ships

1277
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,120
it on the desktop, just like the Android is also that.

1278
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:54,880
See, the thing is, is that Linux itself is just a general technology.

1279
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:59,840
And what I think we sometimes forget is we are the ones electing to implement this general

1280
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:02,680
technology as a purpose workstation, right?

1281
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:07,940
And it's not necessarily, we are taking something that's not necessarily an end product and

1282
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:11,600
forming it into an end product, and it's not like we're doing it on billions of dollars

1283
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:14,960
of budgets like the folks at Google are doing when they're making Chrome OS.

1284
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:19,640
So I think when you look at it from that standpoint, it's not a fair measurement to completely

1285
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,720
compare it to a commercial offering.

1286
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:27,680
And I think we need companies like System76 to come in and say, here it is as a product.

1287
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,240
I've always said, I think one of the important roles that System76 plays is they productize

1288
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:37,600
Linux because it isn't just, here's the ISO, or here's the DVD, or here's the box set.

1289
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,600
We've tried that.

1290
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,600
It doesn't work.

1291
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,680
It's really got to be kind of an end-to-end consumer solution.

1292
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:50,840
And right now, it's kind of Android and Chrome OS as far as Linux goes at a large scale.

1293
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:51,840
So here's my...

1294
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,840
Yeah.

1295
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:53,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

1296
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:54,840
No, go ahead.

1297
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:55,840
No, so here's my question to you.

1298
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:59,340
So Chrome OS is technically Linux under the hood, and I can get to a root shell.

1299
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:04,080
So why can't I install GNOME 3 on, what is it, Gen 2 that it's based off of?

1300
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,080
Yeah, probably.

1301
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,080
Well, you know...

1302
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:13,160
Gen 2 is the build system, it's just used as the staging builds.

1303
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:14,160
That's what I'm getting at.

1304
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,160
Yeah.

1305
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,160
It's almost an...

1306
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,800
I guess what I'm getting at is it's almost unfair to call Chrome OS Linux because, yes,

1307
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:25,000
it uses a Linux kernel, but it's really not, I mean, it's not even...

1308
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,840
Android is actually even closer to Linux than Chrome OS is, isn't it?

1309
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:28,840
I don't know.

1310
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:29,840
No.

1311
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:30,840
No.

1312
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:31,840
I think Chrome's closer.

1313
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:32,840
No.

1314
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:33,840
Yeah.

1315
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:41,760
I think it's an Ubuntu workstation to bootstrap the Gen 2 bootstages in a CH root.

1316
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,920
I don't even look at it like that.

1317
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:47,680
When you run a binary on Chrome OS, that's a native Linux binary.

1318
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:51,640
If you did a PSAX, you'd actually see a Linux binary process.

1319
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,380
When you run an application on Android, most of the time you're running it inside a Java

1320
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,380
virtual machine.

1321
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:58,920
That could be just as easily running on top of a Mac inside a JVM, right?

1322
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:03,120
If they ported Dalvik over to Windows, you could run that same app.

1323
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,720
If you had all of the APIs available to you.

1324
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,040
So it's not a Linux app, right?

1325
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:10,980
But on Chrome OS, those are native Linux processes.

1326
01:06:10,980 --> 01:06:14,840
That's why I think Chrome OS is more of a true Linux in a sense.

1327
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:18,880
It's a funky distinction, really.

1328
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:23,520
Chrome OS kind of takes a lot of the zeal that people have out of the whole Linux topic

1329
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:27,360
because you get to run a web browser and that's about it.

1330
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:33,120
Yeah, I think what Christine Hall and what Ken are touching on is it's definitely worth

1331
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,840
us taking it in.

1332
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:38,200
We need people out there thinking about this.

1333
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:43,760
I've got a story that we'll cover on Sunday's Linux Action Show that really does demonstrate

1334
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:48,560
that when you take somebody, like what Colonel Linux aka NOAA is doing, where you go out

1335
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:53,640
to a client or you go out to a company or you offer a service and you productize it,

1336
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,920
it does work and it is usable.

1337
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:03,840
That's like the last mile essentially is that piece that takes the most work.

1338
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:12,120
I think as Chrome OS continues to show success and as Microsoft continues to sort of focus

1339
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:18,040
on trying to create some sort of amazing synergy across all of their devices and all of the

1340
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:24,740
UIs and as Apple continues to eventually move towards iOS and they armify their desktop,

1341
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:27,640
there is going to be people watching Chrome OS and go, you know, I could do that.

1342
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:32,400
I could make it even more like an actual computer and I could do that.

1343
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,560
Maybe it's HP one day, right?

1344
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:35,560
We don't know.

1345
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:38,480
One of these companies could have something in the skunkworks for all we know and all

1346
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:43,640
of a sudden, boom, they bust out a new laptop and it's like Chrome OS only it's maybe based

1347
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:45,040
on Gnome 3 or something.

1348
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:46,360
Who knows?

1349
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:52,160
I think what the future holds is Linux is going to have an answer for somebody who wants

1350
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,680
to bring something to market and maybe what we see today isn't even what we'll have in

1351
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,840
five years.

1352
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,640
So I'm not too worried about it and in the meantime, as long as I can keep building my

1353
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:02,880
desktop, I'm happy.

1354
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:03,880
All right.

1355
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:04,880
We'll wrap it at that.

1356
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:05,880
Go ahead.

1357
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:08,000
You can close it out.

1358
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:13,760
I would have to say that I'm not much of an Ubuntu guy, but I would really wish that Canonical

1359
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:18,380
stopped focusing on the mobile so much and go out back to the desktop a little bit and

1360
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:25,480
actually gave us a real Linux desktop that people can buy and people can look forward

1361
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:30,420
to buying on the shelves instead of only looking towards the phone as if the mobile was the

1362
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:32,120
only future that we have.

1363
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,680
We have a lot of desktops, a lot of laptops, they're not selling anywhere.

1364
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:36,680
Preach it, brother.

1365
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,040
Preach it, brother.

1366
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,080
Hold those thoughts because that's actually going to... I have a topic I want to cover

1367
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:45,120
in the post show that'll sort of underscore what Heaven's just said and I think what Wimpy

1368
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,240
wants to touch on too.

1369
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,080
So I'll wrap us up with this.

1370
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,080

zone.

1391
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,760
The robots do that, Matt.

1392
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,320
We got robots just on standby.

1393
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:47,200
That's how much skills we got here, I think.

1394
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,200
Something like that.

1395
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,200
All right.

1396
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,200
Well, we'll wrap it up right there.

1397
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,120
Thank you everyone for joining us this week on Linux Unplugged.

1398
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:55,320
Be sure to join us on Sunday for a great Linux Action Show.

1399
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,360
That's coming up and then we'll be right back here next Tuesday.

1400
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:04,720
Matt, have a great week and make sure, I'll make sure I have some Coca-Cola for you on

1401
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,360
Sunday because that was a disaster last time.

1402
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:08,360
That was unforgivable.

1403
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:09,360
All right, everyone.

1404
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:13,560
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1405
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,920
See you right back here next week.

1406
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:22,760
You know what I realized is out of context, it sounds like I'm talking about like the

1407
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,840
kind of Coke you snort.

1408
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:27,600
I'll get you some more Coke, Matt.

1409
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,920
This makes sure the mirror's actually been wiped off this time.

1410
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,760
That's the biggest issue I have.

1411
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:34,000
I mean, I can't stand it when there's like snot.

1412
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
Sorry about that.

1413
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
That's terrible.

1414
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Yeah, blame that on the kids, Matt.

1415
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
I blame that on the kids.

1416
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
All right.

1417
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,480
So there was a story I wanted to talk about in the post show.

1418
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,520
Everybody go to JBtitles.com when we talk about this and vote real quick.

1419
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:47,360
But I don't know if you guys saw this, but the Times of India today ran a story talking

1420
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,400
about massive gross that Ubuntu is seeing in India.

1421
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,720
And it's not Ubuntu Touch.

1422
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:54,340
It's Ubuntu on the desktop.

1423
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:59,340
The Linux-based operating system grew 50% year over year in – oh, look at that nice

1424
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:01,160
full-screen pop-up Times of India.

1425
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,160
That's so classy.

1426
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,760
50% year over year, Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, has partnered with Dell and

1427
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:09,160
HP to bundle the OS.

1428
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,720
Enterprises have been moving more to the cloud.

1429
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,720
They've not commented.

1430
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,880
And as more enterprises move to the cloud, they'd like to have the same operating system

1431
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,400
on the desktop and on the server.

1432
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,200
This is according to Greyhound Research's CEO.

1433
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:24,000
And online directory service just dials among early adopters of Ubuntu, has 4,500 desktops

1434
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
running Ubuntu currently.

1435
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,240
And I say it because they have a web-based app.

1436
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,580
It works real nice.

1437
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,920
So here you go.

1438
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,920
India.

1439
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,240
Ubuntu is exploding in India.

1440
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:38,680
And I guess what my point is, I guess what I get all upset about, and maybe I'm just

1441
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,680
totally wrong.

1442
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:42,320
I admit that I could be wrong on this.

1443
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:47,720
But damn, it seems like Ubuntu just has like some kind of crazy-ass inertia right now.

1444
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:51,960
And more and more people and governments and countries are adopting it.

1445
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:55,320
Right at the time, they're like, oh, mobile, over here, look at this, over here.

1446
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:59,160
Like they're getting like, oh yeah, 50% year over year growth in India.

1447
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:00,160
In India.

1448
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,160
That's huge, right?

1449
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,720
That's fundamentally huge.

1450
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:09,480
Yeah, I mean, I think my big concern is that I do feel like that they constantly are – they

1451
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,040
fall into the PC is dying mindset.

1452
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:16,600
Okay, yes, mathematically, statistically, if you pound numbers hard enough, technically

1453
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:17,880
speaking, there's a big decline.

1454
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:18,880
No question about that.

1455
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,480
Well, actually, just recently, actually tablet sales are down.

1456
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,480
Apple's tablet sales are down.

1457
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,200
Tablet sales are down and PC sales are up right now.

1458
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:27,200
Well then there you go.

1459
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:28,200
The numbers would be yes.

1460
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:30,720
So yeah, that totally kind of makes the point.

1461
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,280
You can't get caught into these trends.

1462
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:35,400
I mean, at the end of the day, people need to do things on their computers.

1463
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,000
I've tried doing things on a tablet.

1464
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,200
I can't stand it.

1465
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:40,920
I can't actually get work done on a tablet.

1466
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:41,920
But I can on a computer.

1467
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,920
I'm weird.

1468
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:43,920
I like a keyboard and mouse.

1469
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:44,920
I'm strange.

1470
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:45,920
So –

1471
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,240
Am I wrong in the – my general sense of it is like they're like Luke Skywalker and

1472
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:53,240
like somebody on the radio is like stay on target, stay on target, Luke, stay on target.

1473
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:59,600
And then at the last stretch, they veered off target and like now it's just – now

1474
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,840
despite that, they're still seeing adoption.

1475
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,880
Well, here's what's happening.

1476
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,640
Luke Skywalker's on target doing his thing.

1477
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:10,880
And here comes Han Solo on the big mobile phone, yeehaw, you know, and he does whatever

1478
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:11,880
the hell he does.

1479
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:12,880
He gets all the credit.

1480
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:13,880
You got it, kid.

1481
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:14,880
Josh, you think I got it wrong, Josh?

1482
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:15,880
Yeah.

1483
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:20,280
I mean, most of these governments are, you know, deploying large bounds of LTSs.

1484
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:25,080
You know, it's not like they're going to be putting the bleeding edge 14.10 unicorns

1485
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,080
on there or something.

1486
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,080
So you think it doesn't matter?

1487
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,080
No.

1488
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:29,080
I mean, that still matters.

1489
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:34,840
A lot of the work that's being done for mobile is going to occur during the times between

1490
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:35,840
LTSs.

1491
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:41,120
So by the time an LTS lands, it's theoretically going to be stable and unit D8 should by then

1492
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,520
have landed an LTS and if not, then they'll just be supporting unit D7.

1493
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:52,520
Where that argument falls down is that presupposes that they can afford about a two to five year

1494
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:56,280
window where not a lot of improvements are made on the desktop.

1495
01:14:56,280 --> 01:15:00,960
And I mean, you just look at that article we just read, Linux is trapped in this uncanny

1496
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:06,400
valley where we're like good CG, but we're not yet convincing CG.

1497
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:10,560
And every time we release a new movie, we're finally like, yeah, man, that CG was good.

1498
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,200
And then you see the next movie and you're like, oh yeah, that CG was way better than

1499
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,320
the last movie.

1500
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,400
That's where desktop Linux is at.

1501
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:20,000
We're in the uncanny valley where we just can't quite seem to nail it.

1502
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:25,080
And I would argue the last, last thing we need to do is dial it back and put it on the

1503
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:28,800
back burner for a couple of years while we focus on a completely unproven platform that's

1504
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:32,600
completely already dominated by massive multinational companies.

1505
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:38,360
Well, I'd just like to also point out, they may not work on the desktop for a couple of

1506
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,360
years.

1507
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,200
How long did XP go in use without it being worked on?

1508
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:45,840
But that's not fair though, because no, that's not fair because Microsoft continued to release

1509
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:46,880
service packs.

1510
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,120
They made fundamental changes in SP3 to Windows XP.

1511
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:54,280
I mean, so they've continued to release, they've continued to release Internet Explorer, Windows

1512
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:58,560
Media, DirectX, all of these things over the lifespan of Windows XP got updates that added

1513
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,880
fundamental new functionality to the operating system.

1514
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:05,120
Right, but Ubuntu is doing the same thing for, I mean, Canonical is doing the same thing

1515
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,120
for Ubuntu.

1516
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:10,440
They released hardware enablement stacks for new kernels and new drivers and such, and

1517
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,080
they keep deploying new versions.

1518
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:17,280
You're comparing a finished product to something that's not good enough.

1519
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:20,400
The Ubuntu desktop is not good enough.

1520
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,400
It's not good enough.

1521
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,120
XP at the time was good enough for the market.

1522
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,120
I think that's subjective.

1523
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:26,120
Right.

1524
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,120
Yeah.

1525
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:28,120
No, no, no, no, no, it's not.

1526
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,120
It's subjective to who?

1527
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,040
The millions of people that are not buying Ubuntu-based machines?

1528
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,040
That's who it's subjective to.

1529
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,040
I mean, look at the sales.

1530
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:35,360
The sales bear it out.

1531
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:41,000
It's subjective to only us because we're the ones willing to tolerate the pain.

1532
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:45,240
I think as a community, we fail to recognize the severity of the problem, and I think this

1533
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:50,320
plays into the mass sales of MacBooks and Mac OS X, is we are blind to it.

1534
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:52,840
We recognize it's kind of there, but we don't see it.

1535
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:57,120
It's that, again, I go back to Uncanny Valley, to us, it looks good, but you show it to somebody

1536
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,120
else.

1537
01:16:58,120 --> 01:16:59,120
You're like, man, that looks like horrible CG.

1538
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:04,440
I've had people who think that Linux looks great, but they think it's too expensive or

1539
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:10,160
too hard to set it up, but if there was a company that just took Chromebooks and System

1540
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:14,680
76 dialed it and just turned it into a Linux machine and then they sold it as a product,

1541
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,320
that would bring in a ton of people.

1542
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:17,320
Yeah, I mean-

1543
01:17:17,320 --> 01:17:21,560
Well, since the proposed argument here is that we aren't objective because we're using

1544
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:26,600
it, but everyone that I've- every single person I've installed Ubuntu on, and I always

1545
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:31,320
installed Ubuntu with Unity, none of them have hated it or thought it was bad.

1546
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,320
They just never knew it existed.

1547
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:36,000
Yeah, but you could make that same argument if you gave them a MacBook Air.

1548
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,040
I definitely would make the same argument, too, it's just they can't afford that.

1549
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:40,760
They probably have a Mac if they could afford it.

1550
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:47,000
Yeah, I think part of the mistake is we almost should really stop comparing it to Windows

1551
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,200
in a sense because I think people who have decided to make the Switch aren't necessarily

1552
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,160
shopping to other Windows machines.

1553
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:57,880
If you're making the Switch away from Windows, by right now, by default, you're almost just

1554
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:58,880
going to the Mac.

1555
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,600
There's also a really weird fundamental thing here.

1556
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,960
Tablets are tablets, PCs are PCs, mainframes are fucking mainframes.

1557
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:07,320
They don't go anywhere.

1558
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,560
They're still around from like 40, 50 years-

1559
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:11,360
Yeah, they're their own technology branch.

1560
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,360
Yeah, true.

1561
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:13,360
That's a great point.

1562
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:17,640
Little desktops or little friggin' mobile things, that's their own niche.

1563
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,920
They're not gonna replace desktops.

1564
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:25,520
Desktops are here for pretty much the end until we, I don't know, 120 years from now.

1565
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:34,040
I guess the core issue, back to Josh's point that I take the most problem with is this,

1566
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:38,680
I go back to this problem that I've talked about a million times, but we've had two huge

1567
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:43,600
windows of opportunity for desktop Linux, specifically for Ubuntu, more so than any

1568
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:44,960
other distribution.

1569
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,800
One was Windows Vista, which they blew it by that's when they switched to Unity, and

1570
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:53,320
the second one is Windows 8, which we've now blown it by just kind of sitting and putting

1571
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,840
the desktop on the back burner.

1572
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,940
And maybe for some of you, and this is no judgey, I mean, legitimate, maybe for some

1573
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:04,640
of you, Ubuntu truly has solved all of the little niggles that bother you, and it's fine.

1574
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,640
You're very fortunate.

1575
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:09,520
For me, when I use Ubuntu, it starts to feel very dated.

1576
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:10,520
It feels very old.

1577
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,200
There's things about it that should have been addressed a long time ago.

1578
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:16,320
There's little things that shouldn't be like that anymore.

1579
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:20,920
And it, to me, I sit there and I see a desktop that's been neglected, and I can't see past

1580
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,480
that neglection when I use Unity and when I use Ubuntu.

1581
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:26,120
All I can see is the neglection.

1582
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:30,160
Now if you don't see that neglection, that's great for you, but it is a reality because

1583
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:34,080
they're obviously focused on other things, and isn't this just, God damn it, the wrong

1584
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,320
time to lose your focus on the ball?

1585
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,400
It's coming right into the mitt.

1586
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,960
You can make the perfect catch.

1587
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:42,680
Well, and to reiterate what you were saying, I want to expand on that.

1588
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:46,280
Take the software center, you know, that thing that has not been updated since I can't even

1589
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:47,480
remember how long.

1590
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:51,840
The comical part of it is, is they, when Canonical actually went and did this whole thing, they

1591
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,320
got people from Linspire who did the original software center, which, by the way, in 5.0,

1592
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:02,560
was way cleaner and way, way, way, way easier to use than it is in Ubuntu.

1593
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,440
It was one click to install software.

1594
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:08,280
Granted, bad, bad, bad permissions.

1595
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,280
It was admin.

1596
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,280
It was evil.

1597
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,280
It was terrible.

1598
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,280
I get that.

1599
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:15,300
But the point is, is the end user didn't care, and yet, and now they managed to actually

1600
01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:20,480
take those developers, apparently make them make a crappier product, and then, okay, we're

1601
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:21,480
done.

1602
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,480
Let's make a phone.

1603
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:23,480
I mean, what the hell were they smoking?

1604
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,560
I don't understand that.

1605
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:27,840
I mean, to this day, it infuriates me when I show, when I see the software center.

1606
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,840
I just want to, I just want to punch my screen.

1607
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:29,840
I hate it.

1608
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,560
Well, and it's systemic of like a failure to complete, like, like they almost get there

1609
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:34,840
and then they never bust it.

1610
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:36,720
Like so, for example, like they get so.

1611
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:37,880
Well, how the hell is it production?

1612
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:40,860
They get so close to something good, and then they say, oh, we're not making any money off

1613
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:42,000
the software center.

1614
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,160
Instead of making the software center great, they just kind of bail and say, well, that

1615
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:46,360
was our path to revenue.

1616
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:47,360
That didn't pan out.

1617
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,040
It's a bloated bag of stuff.

1618
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,040
I'm not going to say on the air.

1619
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,040
I mean, it's horrible.

1620
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,040
So, you know, I can't understand.

1621
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,040
I mean, let me put it this way.

1622
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,120
I can run it faster in the most bloated browser possible.

1623
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:01,760
I can run it like IE6 faster than I can, and it is better on the web.

1624
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:02,760
All right.

1625
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:10,240
Well, that's why I hate you, but when people know our perspectives of why I don't trust

1626
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:15,440
them anymore or dislike them, yeah, so the same way, too, about everything that you said

1627
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,440
about Ubuntu.

1628
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:21,180
Like, that's why I run Gnome 3 on Arch, but I just don't think that perspective that they're

1629
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:27,080
not doing enough is inherent in the average consumer that these companies and governments

1630
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:28,080
are catering to.

1631
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,080
Right.

1632
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:33,040
So for enterprise and governments is not necessarily as important.

1633
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,040
Let's be honest.

1634
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,040
They're not.

1635
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,040
They do a good job there.

1636
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:37,040
They do a good job for enterprise.

1637
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,040
Generally speaking.

1638
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:39,040
Yeah.

1639
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:40,040
If you need a calendar, if you need email, it's not as important.

1640
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:41,040
It doesn't matter as much.

1641
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,040
It just got to work.

1642
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,040
Yeah.

1643
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,040
That's why XP worked for them.

1644
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,040
Yeah.

1645
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:46,040
Oh, God.

1646
01:21:46,040 --> 01:21:47,040
Okay.

1647
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,040
You know?

1648
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,040
Yeah.

1649
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:53,480
So if we all hate Ubuntu, then what do we go to?

1650
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:55,480
What's the next solution that we can hand out to people?

1651
01:21:55,480 --> 01:22:00,460
I would say the outrage comes from the fact that people don't hate it.

1652
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:02,600
The outrage comes from the fact that people want it fixed.

1653
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:03,600
Yeah.

1654
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:04,600
That's it.

1655
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,600
That's my problem is that I like the Ubuntu core.

1656
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,600
I do.

1657
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:08,600
I like the base.

1658
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,160
I like Ubuntu.

1659
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,880
Even Unity, with all its faults, is great.

1660
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,640
I can get over so much of all the things because they do a lot of nice things that I notice.

1661
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,400
When I boot into it, it's like, oh, hey, things that I would normally like to tweak are just

1662
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,400
done.

1663
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,040
And look at what happened when Steam was announced.

1664
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:27,000
You could see how it was important for Valve to have a company to reach out to canonical

1665
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,440
and say, hey, we want to work with you guys.

1666
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:30,440
We're going to use this.

1667
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,560
And hey, how does this work?

1668
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,920
How does this work in your kernel?

1669
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:34,960
Can you do hardware enablement?

1670
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,440
These kind of things, these back and forths.

1671
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:42,280
Having a company behind a widely used desktop product is beneficial because that's how the

1672
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,280
industry works.

1673
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:44,280
Right?

1674
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:47,760
I don't think you could ever have Arch be the number one distro on desktops because

1675
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:50,820
there's not a company for the rest of the business world to interface with.

1676
01:22:50,820 --> 01:22:55,480
There's not a CEO that goes up on stage and announces features and gets everyone's attention.

1677
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:57,580
So you need a canonical.

1678
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:58,580
You do.

1679
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:02,560
And I think going even further than that, I would point out the fact that I realize wholeheartedly

1680
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,760
that Ubuntu, there's certain things you're just not going to be able to just magically

1681
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:06,760
fix.

1682
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:07,760
I get that.

1683
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,040
But some of the things that are wrong with it are so stupid obvious.

1684
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,560
It makes my brain hurt.

1685
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:18,080
If you know an app sucks, first of all, for the love of Pete, fix your stupid bug reporting

1686
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,120
system.

1687
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,120
Get a grip.

1688
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,120
We're not all developers.

1689
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,080
I don't want to sit there and spit out a buttload of text about stuff, half of which I'm not

1690
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:26,080
going to read.

1691
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,600
Look, make it stupid easy.

1692
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,720
When I crash something on any other operating system, God, just get a grip, guys.

1693
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:33,960
There's just little things they can fix.

1694
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:34,960
That's an example of negligence.

1695
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:42,240
That's a perfect, like the app report thing, how is that still a thing after all this time?

1696
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,240
How is that still a thing?

1697
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:44,240
It's negligence.

1698
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,240
Especially when it doesn't tell you.

1699
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:46,240
Yeah.

1700
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:47,240
There's been an error when it doesn't tell you what it is.

1701
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,240
Go after yourself.

1702
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,240
We want them to succeed, but they just freaking aren't doing it, right?

1703
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,240
My favorite.

1704
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:53,240
We're pissed off that they're not doing it.

1705
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,240
They should.

1706
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:58,760
My favorite one was, there's a new version of your proprietary graphics driver.

1707
01:23:58,760 --> 01:23:59,760
Okay.

1708
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:00,960
Well, let's install that.

1709
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:03,040
Oh, now I don't have any picture.

1710
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,120
Now I'm in a shell.

1711
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,120
Now what do I do?

1712
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:09,840
Oh, I'd look it up on the internet, except I don't have internet, because I have no picture.

1713
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:14,400
Is that really the fault of Ubuntu and not the fault specifically about the developers

1714
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:15,400
of said driver?

1715
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,400
Well, they're the ones that pushed it out to me.

1716
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:17,400
That's the problem.

1717
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:22,400
Yeah, the end user, all they know is there's a driver, and it's newer than what's there,

1718
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,440
and they might want to play their games better, so why don't I click to install it?

1719
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,440
Oh, now I don't have a picture.

1720
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:28,520
Well, and that was probably a function of the tool, right?

1721
01:24:28,520 --> 01:24:31,240
The tool shouldn't have completed the installation if there was a mistake.

1722
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:32,240
Exactly.

1723
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,040
Let's do it again if you haven't updated.
