1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
I learned something new about both of you this week.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,800
Really?

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,200
I learned that Brent is in denial about rats in his walls, and I learned that you must

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,200
have a new monitor.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,160
I have yet to confirm it, but I think you are now rocking the multi-monitor lifestyle.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,160
Am I right?

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,840
Oh, I was already multi-monitor.

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,080
I'm just more multi-monitor as I slowly piece together a better office environment.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,360
Well, I can attest your productivity seems to have increased.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,520
You are preemptively responding to messages now.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,240
I tell you what, I don't know how recently you turned it on, but there was one day where

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,440
three times in a row you responded to a message before I or Hadeah finished writing the message,

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,520
and I'm like, West must have a new monitor.

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:59,760
Or I'm living a little bit in the future.

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,760
Well hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

16
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
My name is Chris.

17
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,760
My name is Wes.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,760
And my name is Brent.

19
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,720
Hello you handsome gentlemen coming up on the show today.

20
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,860
It might be hard to believe, but there is some data that shows that as Linux grows,

21
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,120
so does its malware problem.

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,280
No, don't worry.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,920
Today we're actually taking a look at some work that's been going on on the down low

24
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,560
in Mac OS to respond to a growing malware problem over there.

25
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,160
So we're going to use that lens to see if maybe there's a precautionary tale for Linux

26
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,600
users as we reach mass adoption.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,040
Plus, we're going to take a look at the old days of Linux that are new again, then we'll

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,520
round out the show with some boosts and picks and more.

29
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,280
So before we go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings to that virtual lug.

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,280
Hello mumble room.

31
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Hello Chris.

32
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,280
Hi Brent.

33
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Hi Wes.

34
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
Hello.

35
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,280
Hello everybody.

36
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,760
And hello to everybody up there in the quiet listening as well.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
Thank you for joining us.

38
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,280
Good morning to all of you.

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,640
We are doing this over at Jupiter.tube on Sunday.

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,000
This is our second to last regular episode in studio before the road trip.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,280
Then things are going to get crazy.

42
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,400
So why not catch one over at Jupiter.tube next Sunday.

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,220
Also a big good morning to our friends over at TailScale.

44
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,040
TailScale is a mesh VPN protected by WireGuard's noise protocol.

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,120
You can build yourself a flat mesh network that's all WireGuarded up and it is a thing

46
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
of beauty.

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,680
It works across all your devices.

48
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,960
So go say good morning and try it out for free for 20 devices when you go to TailScale.com.

49
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:36,440
And I don't know, tell them Lop sent you the unplugged program, would you?

50
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,880
Okay guys, can we get a little nostalgic?

51
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,640
All of us at some point, I believe on the show have used Unity back in its heyday.

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Of course.

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
Oh yeah.

54
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,040
And it was a little sad to see Unity go, but it seemed like, you know, if they were going

55
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,920
to, if Ubuntu was going to make the switch over to GNOME, this was the route things needed

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
to go.

57
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,280
And we had some positives too, right?

58
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,000
We were hopeful that some of those extra canonical contributions more focused at GNOME would

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,200
be a wide benefit.

60
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
I think we've seen that.

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,660
I think that's played out.

62
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,400
I think GNOME is better off.

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,440
Well as is one to happen in the Linux community, somebody decided to up and fork Unity and

64
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,480
they created the Ubuntu Unity Remix.

65
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,640
We've looked at it from time to time.

66
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,880
We haven't talked about it too much, but this week it caught our attention when it appears

67
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,400
that starting with Ubuntu 22.10 in late October, Canonical is going to recognize the Unity

68
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,180
Remix as an official flavor of Ubuntu.

69
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,800
So this means there are certain things you can expect that's going to participate in

70
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
the beta processes.

71
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,520
It's going to have certain applications.

72
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:40,840
It's going to have snap support and it's now going to be part of the Canonical release

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,840
infrastructure.

74
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,000
Hello Brent, were you surprised to see this happen since this is sort of a very backwards

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,800
looking desktop environment in some sense, but yet clearly has its fans, right?

76
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,360
Yeah, I was surprised actually that Canonical is now taking it under the wing in a sense

77
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,840
and also quite happy about it.

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,520
I think the other flavors have been great, but it sort of makes sense for Unity to come

79
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,040
back around full circle.

80
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,760
I wonder how that feels internally at Canonical to see a project that you've sort of for a

81
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,920
variety of reasons abandoned a while ago, but I feel like there's been, I hope this

82
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:23,760
is true, I feel like there's been good energy between the project and Canonical ever since

83
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,600
it was forked and energy has been going into it, but I think this is great.

84
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,920
I know a lot of people really love that desktop and seeing this now makes me kind of want

85
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,440
to, Chris, I've been telling you that I might be wanting to try some different stuff, so

86
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,400
maybe I'm going to give this a go.

87
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,280
This feels like kind of tempting.

88
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,560
I mean, maybe it's the new XFCE, Wes has got to be a little validating, I suppose, for

89
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,640
the Canonical dev team because there's still user demand for something that they created.

90
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,840
It does seem like just a real kind of sweet open source success story and just like this

91
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,260
is something we talk about having the ability to do, even if it doesn't necessarily happen

92
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:03,000
that often, but here's a case where some community was able to say, look, we were enjoying that,

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,040
we get it, Canonical, you're going a different route, you don't want to allocate resources

94
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,440
here, but we can step up and we can keep this thing going along because we're still getting

95
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,560
value out of it.

96
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,720
You know, as I use it, I got to say, a few things still hold up.

97
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,300
They got that launcher with the search to launch.

98
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,920
They were one of the first to that and it holds up.

99
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:27,400
The layout where you have your top icons and your clock in the top right and then they

100
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,400
have the one integrated bar where the menus and the minimize, maximize go all up in the

101
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
top.

102
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
It works.

103
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,440
It works, especially on lower, smaller, tighter screens.

104
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,320
A lot of the conventions still make sense.

105
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,880
In fact, it's a lot of what I end up configuring a GNOME desktop for myself very frequently.

106
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,000
It's like pretty close to that layout.

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,800
I mean, they really got it.

108
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,640
And one of the things that the Ubuntu Unity project is doing, ubuntuunity.org, is they're

109
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,520
essentially, they're giving you the option to use Unity 7, which was the last like released

110
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,560
version by Canonical, but they're upgrading components as they can.

111
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,680
So the last version of Ubuntu that officially shipped with a Canonical developed version

112
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,640
was in 16.04, but now they're offering it on modern Ubuntu basis.

113
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,280
So you can get it with the most current Ubuntu release.

114
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,880
Yeah, there was just like a huge release with the first release in six years back in June

115
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,880
of this year.

116
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,400
So it's like, oh, yeah, exciting days.

117
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,360
Then they've done a couple of other things to modernize it.

118
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,760
They've replaced the theme, obviously.

119
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,120
They've included a tool called Unity tweak, which is great.

120
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,880
I seem to recall it was available in Unity's past life, but it's really an essential tool.

121
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,860
It's a really well laid out classic tool as well that lets you just modify things and

122
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,240
make it more or less like a modern desktop, but you can go back to some of the older Unity

123
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,280
themes if you want, or you can use the latest and greatest.

124
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,160
And then something else they've done to kind of just bring it all together that I wanted

125
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,860
to just note before we go on, is that they've mixed together a series of apps.

126
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,320
So they have in here Terminal from GNOME 42.

127
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,640
They've got the file manager is NEMO 5.24 for Mint.

128
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,040
And the text editor is Pluma 1.26 for Mate, for example.

129
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,200
So it's kind of like mixing modern tools in there from different places, sort of a best

130
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
of breed.

131
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
I like that.

132
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,480
It feels like a kind of nice pragmatic approach, perhaps.

133
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,760
I have a question, Chris.

134
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,960
Do you have a sense at all in looking into this with how many developers are active in

135
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,960
this project?

136
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,960
You know, is it three people?

137
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Is it 30?

138
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Is it 300?

139
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
I'd be curious.

140
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,600
I know, I think it is about three.

141
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,400
I did know, but I lost track of that.

142
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:44,240
It's not a huge project, which I think is kind of why it's nice to see it get flavor

143
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,440
status because they get some of that canonical infrastructure now.

144
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,320
It's like, you know, the ISO download is not super quick.

145
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,520
OK, another question I have then is, what does it take to become an official flavor?

146
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,260
What's the bar that you need to match?

147
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Do we know?

148
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,260
That's a great question.

149
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,600
Yeah, so you can get a sense of that actually in the mailing list thread that we'll have

150
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,840
linked in the show notes.

151
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,540
But you know, reading through this mailing list thread, it seems certain like certain

152
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,640
details like media applications like VLC versus Totem, there's some defaults that they want

153
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,640
there.

154
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,280
If you need to ship SNAP by default, that's another one of the requirements which they're

155
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,560
doing.

156
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,280
There is this sort of like minimum requirement to participating in the beta milestone releases

157
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,120
along with the other Ubuntu releases that you also have to do that to be a flavor.

158
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
It's an application process.

159
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,280
And then several people vote on it to say, yes, we reviewed your case and it looks like

160
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,720
you've met these baselines so you can now become an official flavor status.

161
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,040
Once you do that, the work actually just kind of begins for the team because then they need

162
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,160
to migrate a lot of their stuff over to the canonical infrastructure.

163
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,440
Some of that's detailed in this mailing list too.

164
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,120
It's interesting.

165
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,720
It's interesting to see Unity coming back.

166
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:57,360
My question that I had for me, was it Unity that was capable to display the menu in the

167
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,000
top bar, the old menu?

168
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,440
Yes, it still rocks it too.

169
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,080
When you maximize the window, it goes all the way up and the file and the edit menu

170
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,000
that goes up under the top bar.

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,560
And I think the advantage of it is that you get more application real estate space.

172
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,460
Everything looks a lot cleaner as well.

173
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,920
The disadvantage is if you haven't used Unity in a while, it takes you a minute to remember

174
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,160
that that stuff's up there.

175
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,720
Wait, where are my menus?

176
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
Yeah.

177
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,200
So that was definitely a thing for me.

178
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,720
Using it, it felt a little nostalgic and it also felt like I could see a world where if

179
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,740
I had a workstation that didn't change much, I wanted something that was a kind of a modern

180
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,320
looking desktop that had conventions that I like today because this is often how I set

181
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,960
up Plasma and GNOME, I could see the logic in it.

182
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,920
I really actually could because it's pretty low resource usage.

183
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,200
It's pretty lightweight compared to modern desktops.

184
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Simple.

185
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,720
You don't need to do a bunch of configuring, but you have some configuration options if

186
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,720
you'd like to.

187
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Yeah.

188
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,840
I mean, you're not going to be like getting a showcase of the latest GTK4 applications

189
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,400
or a pure Wayland experience.

190
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,160
That's not what's happening here.

191
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,920
And you know, some people aren't building their systems for that.

192
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,560
I think there is a spot in that Mate XFCE cinnamon market.

193
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,560
I think Unity is a real contender.

194
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:22,360
And I think the question was when they launched this fork forever ago now, could they actually

195
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
do it?

196
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Could they actually maintain it?

197
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,000
I mean, sure, one release, you know, getting one more version of Unity out, sure, fine.

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,160
But could they actually do it?

199
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,440
And it seems like they can.

200
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,680
And the little trick that they've done is they've bundled a bunch of apps that, you

201
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,200
know, weren't originally in the Ubuntu mix for this, but sure seem to work great for

202
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
it.

203
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,320
Which hopefully is a nice sort of, you know, to set the scope appropriately here, right?

204
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,620
Keeping Unity going, you can provide a whole sort of experience, but you don't need to

205
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,840
reinvent the whole world.

206
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,000
Linode.com slash unplugged.

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,400
That's where you go to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account.

208
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,440
It's just a great way to support the show.

209
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,920
And it gets you down the path of trying out Linode's feature set on their dime, not yours,

210
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,960
which is just always a better way to go.

211
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,240
You know, Linode is really the Linux geeks cloud.

212
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:14,000
We've deployed our new website, jupyterbroadcasting.com now runs from Linode.

213
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,680
After a long time on a previous provider, we just had to rebuild and we wanted to rebuild

214
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,280
it in a modern way.

215
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,680
And one of the things I appreciate at a whole new level now is just how well Linode integrates

216
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,680
with infrastructure management tools that we already have in place.

217
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,120
You know, like Ansible and Kubernetes and Terraform, which by the way, side tangent,

218
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,720
they have incredible Kubernetes documentation that they have just been working with just

219
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:44,440
like tons of different really well known, really educated, really smart Kubernetes content

220
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
providers.

221
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
And they're putting some of that information out now on Linode's platform and on different

222
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
YouTube channels.

223
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,600
Anyways, it's worth going to their documentation website if you're trying to learn Kubernetes

224
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,320
because they've just put together some of the best resources out there.

225
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,760
They really have done a great job at that.

226
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,520
But anyways, I just I really can appreciate it now because here's the crazy thing.

227
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,360
And I was joking about this in a recent office hours, you guys.

228
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,480
I make a website change and deploy it using Git.

229
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,620
It goes to a GitHub repo and then like two minutes later, our website's updated.

230
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,760
And Linode is just part of that entire pipeline and it's so perfectly part of that pipeline

231
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,280
and then you combine it with their incredible performance.

232
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,560
It's awesome.

233
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,320
It's working so well for us.

234
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,760
And of course, they've been rolling out screaming fast MVME PCIe storage.

235
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,000
They have reliable, flexible S3 compatible object storage.

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,200
And this dashboard is so easy to use that everyone on our team, you know, brand new

237
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,720
to server stuff, people have been doing it forever.

238
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,720
We can all work together.

239
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,720
And they have that API.

240
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,140
They snap in with Ansible and then they just kind of back it all up with the best customer

241
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:54,080
support in the business, like, you know, no bigs, but it's actually like the biggest of

242
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,360
the bigs.

243
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,920
And they're architected in a way where all of their competitors are not.

244
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,960
So they just cannot even compete on this front.

245
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,280
Linode's been doing this for nearly 19 years.

246
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,560
So they figured this stuff out.

247
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,120
They got super fast rigs.

248
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,480
They are their own ISP, 11 data centers around the world and a Linux culture that runs deep.

249
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,720
So go try them out, support the show and get 100 bucks to do it.

250
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,120
You go to linode.com slash unplugged.

251
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,320
Go see why we chose to build our new website and we chose to run it on Linode, linode.com

252
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,920
slash unplugged.

253
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,120
We got some big news.

254
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,380
We got some really big news.

255
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:43,320
This week, our new website went live, built by our community, truly an awesome moment

256
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,360
in value for value.

257
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:50,200
Our community came together and just built us an awesome Hugo based website.

258
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,160
I knew I wanted to move away from WordPress.

259
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Love you WordPress.

260
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
But it was time.

261
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,120
It was time.

262
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
So great.

263
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,040
So if you haven't seen the new Jupiter Broadcasting dot com, go check it out.

264
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,840
And then we've got the details in office hours 11.

265
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,760
We actually because you know how we roll.

266
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,220
We flip the switch live.

267
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,080
We published the website while we were doing the show.

268
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
YOLO.

269
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,680
We didn't break too many things.

270
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,480
There was some interesting breakage, but we'll talk about that later in the show.

271
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,280
But so happy to have that big thank you to our community.

272
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,440
Go get all the details in office hours 11.

273
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,940
You can watch the video version, too, at Jupiter Dot Tube for that.

274
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:31,520
Now just weeks away to our West Coast crew meetups, a string of meetups on the West Coast.

275
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,120
Go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting to find the one near you.

276
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
Join us.

277
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,120
Let us know.

278
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
We got to get the venues updated.

279
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,340
We've sent out the invites to the JPL tour.

280
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,480
We had a couple of names, you know, get swapped.

281
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
We had our backup list.

282
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,860
It's been going real smooth.

283
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,020
People are people are verifying that they can go.

284
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,020
That's getting locked in.

285
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,020
It's getting close.

286
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,900
We'll have more details on that soon.

287
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,080
The real excitement starting now, I'm starting to get very hyped about the road trip.

288
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,320
Hey, don't forget to we've also got like a handy dandy little matrix room.

289
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,320
If you want to chat, you want to do some planning, you want to find out what's going on leveling

290
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,560
for that in the show notes as well.

291
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,840
All right, now, I want to thank some of our top supporters for this week's episode.

292
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,700
And our first one came in from Nilth as our top baller boost.

293
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:24,240
And it is three hundred and seven thousand two hundred sats, which is oh, my goodness.

294
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Yeah.

295
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,540
So I said, hi, all Nilth here.

296
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,180
This is my first boost ever.

297
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,440
Loving Fountain.

298
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,440
You did it right.

299
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,260
Live in Linux and I work in enterprise windows.

300
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,260
So he lives.

301
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,260
I think he means like day to day.

302
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:41,220
He lives in Linux and he works in enterprise windows, which been there, man.

303
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,140
He says, what are your thoughts on Dotnet on Linux and what sort of future do you see

304
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,140
for it?

305
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:50,260
Do you envision any form of scale in its adoption among the community and what sort of open

306
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,860
source authentication protocol you could get access by paying sats, sort of like a toll

307
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,940
booth, maybe a sat booth?

308
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,980
We'll take both questions.

309
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,980
So first question.

310
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,540
Wes, you and I actually talked about this off air.

311
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,920
I think Dotnet is going to continue to be a very successful platform on Linux, not so

312
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,180
much in our bubble, but very much so in the enterprise bubble, the kind of area that Nilth

313
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,180
is in.

314
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,500
I think Dotnet is going to be huge there and continue to just have massive adoption, if

315
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:24,780
not for just the massive momentum of Microsoft's platform in the small to medium business space.

316
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,540
And then, you know, you just combine that with, I mean, who wants to keep running Windows

317
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,540
servers these days?

318
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:31,460
And if you, you know, if you are keeping up with things and you're moving things to using

319
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,620
the Dotnet core world and you get off some of the stuff that was Windows only.

320
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
Yeah, right.

321
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,100
You can just containerize that stuff.

322
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,500
They've made a lot of improvements for running containerized Dotnet apps.

323
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,740
The Dotnet runtime keeps getting better and it just sort of, you know, you could fit it

324
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:46,220
into a regular Linux server side deploy platform.

325
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,500
That's the thing, you know, like it's not like we're going to do a show on it or something,

326
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,060
but Dotnet seems like it's actually been doing really well.

327
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,480
We cover its development in Coderadio and you got to you got to acknowledge when they're

328
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
making good strides.

329
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,460
They seem to be making genuinely competitive strides with Dotnet.

330
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,020
It's always nice to have Linux support.

331
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,260
And then that second part, what about like some sort of open source authentication protocol

332
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:16,540
that you get access by paying SATs and think of like maybe a Linux ISO download or a special

333
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,300
edition of a podcast.

334
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Maybe you get access.

335
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,100
There are projects in the works right now for that.

336
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,940
I'm drawing a blank on the name.

337
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,140
So if you do know, boost in or email in, but there's a couple of projects out there that

338
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,900
are working on it.

339
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,700
I want to take a moment, though, and just thank you for the significant support here.

340
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:38,540
I don't talk about this a lot, especially in relation to just how extremely passionate

341
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,540
I am about this topic.

342
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,540
All right.

343
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:43,600
I'm bringing the receipts to office hours 12 to back up what I'm about to say.

344
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,100
But I don't want to make this any longer than it has to be because I know not all of you

345
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,540
care about the future of podcasting.

346
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:57,980
But there is a rapid freight train approaching of dynamic ad insertion that they've realized

347
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,380
the way to make money now, the dynamic ad insertion companies, is not to go after large

348
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,340
podcasts, but to go after the smaller podcasts.

349
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,180
Get a ton of the tiny guys.

350
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,640
Get a ton of them and just blast them with the same dynamic ads over and over again.

351
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,700
And they are making offers and letters to podcasters like crazy.

352
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,700
And something that you might not understand if you're not a content creator, but it becomes

353
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,080
immediately obvious if you ever want to try to do this as a business.

354
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,820
If you create a YouTube channel, there is an inherent path to monetization built into

355
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,820
the platform.

356
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,660
You just have to get to a certain number of views.

357
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:34,000
To do that, you have to placate the algorithm.

358
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
We all know what that leads to.

359
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,200
I don't need to explain the downsides to that.

360
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,340
But in order to get views, you placate the algorithm.

361
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,400
When you placate the algorithm, you get featured.

362
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,700
People watch you.

363
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,700
You get monetized.

364
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
That's how it works.

365
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,020
Some of that ad money goes your way.

366
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,220
Right.

367
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,300
Nothing like that exists in podcasting.

368
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,300
There's no path to monetization in podcasting.

369
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,540
You start out, you just throw some MP3s and an RSS feed out there, and it doesn't get

370
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,540
you money.

371
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,740
It's all decentralized.

372
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,200
It's an open market.

373
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:06,660
There's no platform that's going to have an algorithm.

374
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,660
People are building that.

375
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,380
But there hasn't been something like that traditionally.

376
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,940
And so what you've had is a bunch of bespoke business models.

377
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,940
Individual content creators coming up with their own models.

378
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,620
But it is an intense amount of work.

379
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,820
Plus you have to be able to run a business and manage your taxes and just do general

380
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,040
things that sometimes people find challenging.

381
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,860
And you have to do it and not get in trouble by the IRS and all of that, too.

382
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:37,540
It leads to all different types of approaches, which is probably a good thing in a marketplace.

383
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,460
But it also leads to whatever is going to be just the easiest route.

384
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,860
And because it's hard, because it's bespoke, and because you have to build it yourself,

385
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,100
it's so much easier if somebody just says, I'll give you $1,000 a month.

386
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:56,340
You just run our dynamic ads, and you're going to get $1,000 plus a performance bonus.

387
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,100
If you hit this level, you're going to get this bonus.

388
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Right.

389
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,500
And suddenly you're thinking, all right, now I've got some revenue coming in.

390
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,860
I don't have to worry about finding my next set of advertisers or whatever else I need

391
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,300
to do to bring in that money.

392
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,220
And I'm focusing on the content over here.

393
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,220
Right.

394
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,340
But the reality is you start tweaking the content to whatever operator, whatever platform

395
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,340
is divvying out those ads.

396
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,260
That becomes who you tweak the content for because you have to maximize that return.

397
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,100
That becomes your incentive is maximizing that.

398
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,900
And it's a perverse incentive.

399
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,160
And you see it, I think the best example is on YouTube.

400
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,180
You see what it has done to YouTube.

401
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,660
And now it's beginning to happen with podcasts because of Spotify, because of groups like

402
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,660
Libsyn.

403
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
I'm calling Libsyn out.

404
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,660
They're bad for the podcast industry.

405
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:46,020
And because of this dynamic insertion technology that several different providers are trying

406
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:52,140
to go after, it creates a perverse set of incentives for content creators.

407
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:58,660
Boosts are the only solution that is truly decentralized, that is truly global, that

408
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,300
there is no middleman.

409
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,260
I run my node up in my office.

410
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,500
I run that.

411
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,380
I manage that.

412
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,100
There's no middleman.

413
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,120
And there's no algorithm.

414
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,220
My only incentive is to please the audience so they're encouraged to boost.

415
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,620
I think we get lost in like the sats and the crypto aspect of it.

416
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:29,180
And we don't zoom out and realize that what we have is a massive shift in an industry.

417
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:34,100
And what we are trying to champion here is a better way to do things where there can

418
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,040
be a built in way to monetization and podcasting that is truly decentralized, that puts the

419
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,660
audience first because you were incentivized to encourage the audience to boost by giving

420
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,260
them the content they want.

421
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,220
And it is the incentives are aligned with the expectations of the audience, and it is

422
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,220
truly decentralized.

423
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,220
Oh, and by the way, it's all built on free software.

424
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,540
This is why the boosts are a big deal.

425
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:02,900
And that's why when Nilf boosts in with 307,000 sats, he's helping to vote into a decentralized

426
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,700
participant network that as more people come online becomes even more valuable.

427
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,020
And now when Nilf's favorite free software project comes online to the Lightning Network,

428
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,420
Nilf can send them a boost.

429
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,420
Sorry if I'm saying the name wrong.

430
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,420
Am I getting it right?

431
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,420
No, you're doing great.

432
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
All right.

433
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,480
So thank you very much for the support.

434
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,920
That's why we talk about the boosts on the show, because it is a bigger picture.

435
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,720
There's a broader trend happening in the industry.

436
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,380
And like I said, I will bring the receipts to the next office hours to prove it to you.

437
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:32,740
I have the audio, I have the links, I have all of it to show you what's happening.

438
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,540
Or you could just take my word for being in this industry for 15 years up to you.

439
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,000
But that's why I thank you to our baller boost, to everybody who boosts in, to our members

440
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
as well.

441
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,740
The membership programs play absolutely an essential role in that.

442
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,740
So-

443
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,140
We want to be here making content for you.

444
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:54,660
With that, because I just have to get that out there because I think short-sighted individuals

445
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:59,420
can look at just the sats aspect of it because it's ooh, it's crypto.

446
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,140
Or they can think about like the jingles and that can be distracting.

447
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,980
And that's the surface level stuff.

448
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,340
Now what we're trying to do here is to create a monetization platform that incentivizes

449
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,300
creators to produce good content for their audience.

450
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,540
And anything else, dynamic ad insertion, Spotify centralization, Apple memberships, is bad

451
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,540
for the listeners.

452
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,060
It's bad for podcasting.

453
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:27,060
It is the difference between free software and commercial software, decentralized and

454
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,060
centralized.

455
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:33,520
End of rant and we wrap it up with John A's 25,000 baller boost, our last baller boost

456
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
of the episode.

457
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,740
He says, you know what guys?

458
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,860
Doing it the Nix way, it forces you to put everything into documentation.

459
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,500
It is self-documenting.

460
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,220
It's light years ahead of any other way of doing things.

461
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,100
Who cares if you forget how it's set up?

462
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
He's talking to me because I mentioned-

463
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,220
Yeah, you were saying like, oh, I like this, but I'm worried that I'll forget how I'd set

464
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,220
it up.

465
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,220
Who cares if you forget how it's set up?

466
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,220
It's self-documenting.

467
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,900
I agree.

468
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,700
I love the Nix love out there.

469
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,380
There's some serious Nix love.

470
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,380
I will say there's still room for comments and notes though because, you know, it's self

471
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,100
documented the way it's going to work and it'll just run and set up, but if you need

472
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,300
to make changes, you will probably need to remember a few things here or there.

473
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:14,100
I like putting the comments in there with the date because then I look back and go,

474
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,180
oh, huh, I figured that out back in June.

475
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
Oh, that's interesting.

476
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,180
Right.

477
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,200
And you can leave yourself some little notes to be like, oh, here's like the Wiki page

478
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,780
that I found some notes on this or the actual manual page and then just jump right back

479
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,780
there.

480
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,780
Yeah.

481
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:31,260
I definitely am a big fan of just adding a little note to Future Chris, you know, just

482
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,260
to remind Future Chris-

483
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,060
Because that guy, he's got a lot going on.

484
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,060
Yeah.

485
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,060
Two RVs now?

486
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,060
Wow.

487
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,060
Really?

488
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,060
Two RVs.

489
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,060
All right.

490
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,860
You got to have your work in RV and your sleep in RV.

491
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
That's right.

492
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,860
Right.

493
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,980
Or just a whole studio RV that's dedicated for road trips.

494
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,980
All right.

495
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,220
If you'd like to send us in a boost and to get into our Baller Boost segment, please

496
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,220
do so.

497
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,180
You can get a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com or go grab Breeze if you don't want to switch

498
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,980
podcast apps.

499
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,260
And if your boost is of a certain large amount, we don't specify, we allow you to sign the

500
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,260
value.

501
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,180
That's into the Baller Boost segment.

502
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,180
All right.

503
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:12,980
I want to talk about a future where we have a pretty decent market share for desktop Linux.

504
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,260
Maybe it's, maybe it's via Chrome OS.

505
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:19,820
I think for today's, unless you guys disagree, I think for today's conversation, let's say

506
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:28,020
a distribution like Endless or Ubuntu proper just kind of reaches four, five, 8%, 10% of

507
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,020
the market.

508
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,020
Somewhere around probably where the max, I don't even know if the max that high, but

509
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,100
somewhere in the max territory today, let's say, you know, in five to 10 years, Linux

510
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,100
gets there.

511
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
All right.

512
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
So that's kind of the timeline.

513
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,100
That's kind of the category.

514
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,460
There's maybe a few more, a few more sort of shops have defaulted to offering it as

515
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,500
an option alongside windows when you're buying PCs and it's relatively, you know, a little

516
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,500
common.

517
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,540
And if we go five to 10 years back in time, Apple had a very specific message to position

518
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,940
their operating system over their competitors.

519
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,540
Hello, I'm a Mac and I'm a PC.

520
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,340
You okay?

521
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:07,140
No, I'm not okay.

522
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,580
I have that virus that's going around.

523
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,540
Oh, you better, you better stay back.

524
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,540
This one's a doozy.

525
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
That's okay.

526
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,540
I'll be fine.

527
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,540
No, no.

528
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,540
Do not be a hero.

529
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,580
Last year there were 114,000 known viruses for PCs.

530
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,060
PCs, not Macs.

531
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,860
So just grab this thing.

532
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:23,860
I think I got a crash.

533
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,900
Hey, if you feel like that'll help.

534
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,900
Good.

535
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:34,180
There was a such a non-issue for Apple's platform that it was the basis of an ad campaign that

536
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:37,020
actually was very successful for them.

537
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,860
It really started life as the no viruses platform that used to be the pitch.

538
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,860
You know, if you're sick of your viruses on your windows XP and your windows seven, go

539
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
get a Mac.

540
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
It's got no viruses.

541
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,700
You won't get three levels of browser bars suddenly added in there.

542
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,460
And they got almost a decade with that reputation, almost.

543
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,980
And so for a while, the Mac fans just kind of started telling themselves, well, it's

544
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,780
because Mac OS is built better.

545
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,840
We have a user permission to system.

546
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,860
You have to have pseudo privileges to alter the system.

547
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,500
Mac OS is just built better than windows.

548
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,700
I mean, we all know how annoying it is to run a random download you get off the internet

549
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,140
on Mac OS these days.

550
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,140
Yeah.

551
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
Yeah.

552
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,140
Well, that's part of it.

553
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,760
They've had to build in a lot of these security features over the year.

554
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:22,420
And now it seems they're almost at a scrambling pace, adding features into the latest version

555
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,420
of Mac OS.

556
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,420
It's currently under development.

557
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,180
We'll have a link in the show notes Mac OS malware development has surged by over a thousand

558
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:34,500
percent in the last couple of years, according to Atlas VPN.

559
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:42,140
And Apple is aggressively building in new real time, always running malware scanners.

560
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,820
Now they're taking it to a whole new level.

561
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,420
If you are not using your Mac, it's like windows defender.

562
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:52,540
They're going to now be scanning for all different kinds of malware in the background actively

563
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,280
when your system is idle.

564
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,740
They're building in their own virus scanner.

565
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,100
They're doing a new set of virus definition updates they can push to it silently in the

566
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,300
background.

567
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,840
This is all happening.

568
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:06,340
It's been kind of building for the last few Mac OS releases, but they're really going

569
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:11,340
aggressive because the issue, you know, a thousand percent growth is starting to actually

570
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,860
become a problem for their end users because it turns out there's a lot of damage you can

571
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,660
do just as the regular user and you can get a lot of information.

572
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,660
Right.

573
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,500
And, you know, it turns out your regular user owns most of your files.

574
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,980
And so it seems as the Mac has grown in popularity, so has Mac malware.

575
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:32,540
And Apple has been kind of slow to come around to it, but they're pretty aggressive now.

576
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:37,660
And so I wonder for the sake of discussion, is it possible we could see Linux go down

577
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,960
a similar route?

578
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,400
Could we see this become an issue where today, you know, they're not not that big of a deal.

579
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,580
Viruses aren't really a problem.

580
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,580
They're not really doing much.

581
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,860
Yeah, there's a few, but it's not a big deal.

582
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:57,340
Well, who says developers wouldn't start targeting Linux users if there were a bunch of bunch

583
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,340
of them out there?

584
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,940
I mean, even just there's an article over in ZDNet on the first just a couple of days

585
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,780
ago, Linux devices increasingly under attack from hackers or on security researchers pointing

586
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:10,140
to, you know, just more and more, even if it's not the primary platform, more and more

587
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,980
popular things like lockbit or other cryptocurrency mining things or just malware in general.

588
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,460
They're at least offering a Linux version now.

589
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,740
So it seems plausible that that could just get worse, especially because, I mean, Linux

590
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,340
isn't going anywhere on the server, right?

591
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,840
So there's there's reasons to target it there.

592
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,420
And it's it's the same Linux.

593
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,420
And Clam AV doesn't count.

594
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,980
I mean, it is a great tool, but it just this isn't what we're talking about.

595
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,680
We're talking about Mac OS is building in Windows Defender type technology that scans

596
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:41,540
the system every 15 to 35 seconds.

597
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,180
Every hour or two it does that scan.

598
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:47,140
The face you're making right now suggests to me that you're not excited about this running

599
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,140
on your machine.

600
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,140
Would you want this?

601
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,580
Like, do you ever want to run antivirus on your machines ever?

602
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,740
I mean, not to be like an elitist, but I don't want to run antivirus.

603
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,620
Part of me kind of thinks it's it's not that I'm opposed to that.

604
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,000
Like the idea, you know, it's already common in a lot of sort of production environments

605
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,180
to have endpoint detection.

606
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,220
They're trying to scan for anomalies and changes, but all that stuff sucks.

607
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,060
Well, the desktop ones do not necessarily some of the server side.

608
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,060
Yeah.

609
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,180
So I think that's where I think it's maybe useful to like, are we objecting to the idea

610
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,380
or the implementation?

611
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,820
Because like the idea that my system could be self-monitoring and give me data is kind

612
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,540
of like, you know, when we talk about other things like having data on cars where I want

613
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:29,220
that info, I'd like to be alerted to changes in my system.

614
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,660
But I also want to be able to configure how that runs, how often and how many resources

615
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,660
it'll use.

616
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,780
Here's where it crosses the line for me.

617
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,940
It's turned on.

618
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,100
It's like a deep level thing.

619
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,980
There's not really any user control.

620
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,500
And when it runs, it turns on telemetry.

621
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,700
So it's reporting back to Apple all the time, too.

622
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,540
Oh, well, that's a problem.

623
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,540
Yeah.

624
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,980
You have something that's built in.

625
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:51,900
You have something that's reporting telemetry back to Apple.

626
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,180
I just feel like if we got to this point in Linux and we needed this kind of tooling,

627
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,820
I got to hope we do it better.

628
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,820
Right?

629
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,780
Like you'd be able to turn it off, you know, or you'd be able to not have it at all in

630
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,780
theory.

631
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,060
Now, the flip side, I wonder, is there some, you know, is there also an incentive to try

632
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,100
to get some of that tooling in place just in the if we want to see more Linux adoption,

633
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,180
it seems like more and more users will begin to expect it.

634
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:18,620
And certainly, you know, enterprises and serious shops that are using it as workstations already

635
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,620
do.

636
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:23,660
Yeah, I've seen distros that sell to enterprises that, you know, advertisers that come in with

637
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,660
built in antivirus.

638
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,540
And that's not really what I'm picturing.

639
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:32,400
I'm picturing something like system D scan, you know, something that's built in like Apple's

640
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,580
doing built into the lower levels of Linux.

641
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,420
But I have to think we would do it differently.

642
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:42,060
And I'm not sure if it's 100% better, because this seems like an area where fragmentation

643
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:46,660
would provide less effectiveness, but also gives us more choice.

644
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,940
So I could choose a distro that just doesn't include this, or you could easily turn it

645
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,940
off.

646
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,980
But it wouldn't be as effective because it's not being centrally managed and controlled

647
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,420
and not centrally pushing out to all machines at the same time on the same OS and, you know,

648
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,460
which could mitigate an active problem.

649
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,460
Right.

650
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,500
If we if we kind of keep that mentality we have now of whatever, at least somewhat assembling

651
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,100
and tweaking and changing things.

652
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,180
But maybe that's harder to in a world where you're you are using something like endless

653
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:15,860
or silver blue, and that stuff's kind of just pre baked in for you into the image and starts

654
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,860
up.

655
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,780
Brent, what do you think is somebody who likes to know exactly what his machine is up to?

656
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:24,640
Does this maybe convert a few Mac OS power users to Linux?

657
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,380
This is a hacker news comment I saw quote, Mac OS really seems to try to frustrate power

658
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:31,940
users with these non optional security features.

659
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:36,820
I even had to make a separate note document with the commands and references to disable

660
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,340
various security features.

661
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:43,580
I don't understand why they choose to frustrate this audience by making it so difficult.

662
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:49,480
And then there was a cascade of child comment threads just talking about different ways

663
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:55,200
they disable like security checks and like all these like hodgepodge solutions to turn

664
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,740
this crap off.

665
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,380
And at certain points, like, don't you just get frustrated fighting your your work tool?

666
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,060
Well, yeah, absolutely.

667
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:08,220
I mean, that's one of okay, and I'm not necessarily gonna put myself in the power user box or

668
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:12,060
but that's one of the reasons I left the Mac 10 years ago was exactly that is like all

669
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:16,980
this stuff's on and you had to change a bunch of stuff to make it your own, or at least

670
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,480
to have it run the way you wanted.

671
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,580
And that became more and more frustrating.

672
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,120
And I would imagine now this could easily tip some people over the edge.

673
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:31,420
But the question I have then is, and maybe it's the whole crux of the issue is like,

674
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,220
those are implemented to try to help the user.

675
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:39,140
And so what is the delta there between it being helpful and it being harmful to say

676
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,860
productivity or something like that.

677
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,900
So I, I feel like there's a better balance there or maybe it's better communication or

678
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,820
like you said, better options for tweaking it.

679
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,100
Because you know, if a bunch of people are just by default disabling the securities that

680
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:58,020
are in place to try to keep them, you know, a little bit safer than what happens next,

681
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:59,220
you know, is that really problematic?

682
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:05,540
Yeah, I wonder if Apple would argue because it's built into the OS, it's less resource

683
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,340
intensive because they can monitor what the system is doing more carefully and then run

684
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,340
it.

685
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,340
I don't know.

686
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,900
I don't know if I buy that, because anything that's using more disk IO and using more

687
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,700
memory and more processor, I'm not really a fan of.

688
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,700
I don't really care.

689
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,220
I don't care how who built it or how you know, low end it is.

690
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,460
I just don't like it.

691
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:28,860
I think too, you have to figure maybe the lesson that us Linux users could take away

692
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,420
from this is let's not be snarky now, right?

693
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:37,660
So that way some jackass isn't playing YouTube clips of us 10 years later laughing about

694
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,460
how there's no viruses for Linux.

695
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:43,940
I think we have to acknowledge that if the user base was large enough, people would start

696
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,980
developing malware for the desktop.

697
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,180
I like to think, though, that even when that starts to happen, it's not really ever going

698
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,260
to get as bad as it did in Windows heyday, you know?

699
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,820
I know not to channel some of that early, you know, a Mac overconfidence that they seem

700
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:02,860
to have, but I just can't imagine it could be that bad.

701
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,860
I think we'll have definitely user information loss.

702
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:10,340
You're going to have stuff that can get encrypted, that kind of stuff, but it doesn't seem like

703
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:15,900
it's going to ever be the scale it was back then just because the penetration of mobile

704
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:20,700
and all these other platforms that are so popular, there isn't that one ginormous target

705
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,700
like there was with Windows.

706
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,740
And I mean, just as a whole industry, we've matured a lot in our approaches to security

707
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,740
and sure, right?

708
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,540
The Linux desktop in particular still has a long way to go.

709
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,860
We're only now trying to get to things like containerized apps and immutability and, you

710
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,740
know, sort of eventually maybe switching to Wayland and all of these things.

711
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,820
But we are at least thinking of them and the, you know, some of the browsers and OS is way

712
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,820
back in the day.

713
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,360
They just that that was not the world of computing they were developed in.

714
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,860
You just touched on something there.

715
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:50,860
Like if we shipped, say, Linux today, where most people are on X11 and most people are

716
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,860
using local packages.

717
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:57,100
I just download devs I find on random forums and install them personally.

718
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,600
That Linux would be in a worse position, right?

719
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,780
That Linux is extremely vulnerable, especially X11 desktops.

720
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,860
I mean, malware authors could just have a heyday with that.

721
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,380
But I'm picturing Linux of the future is Wayland.

722
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,540
Most applications are probably flat packed.

723
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,340
So even if something gets on your system, you know, that's that application is self-contained

724
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,740
and that's going to provide a lot of security because only you can only speak to that application

725
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,480
in theory through the appropriate portals.

726
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,540
So that that adds a layer of security.

727
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,180
Then you look at these immutable desktops that we've been looking at.

728
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:28,540
That adds a layer of security where you could just revert back.

729
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,880
You start to bring all those technologies forward.

730
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,860
And I think Linux would be in a lot better position by the time it has that kind of user

731
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,860
share.

732
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,860
I still think it's an issue.

733
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,780
I still think we shouldn't be, you know, cocky about it.

734
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,020
But I think it's not worth panicking.

735
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,020
It's not.

736
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,900
I do hope, too, that maybe at the same time, some of those methodologies enable us to keep

737
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,900
really on top.

738
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,780
Because often you see with these issues, right, they often stem from vulnerabilities that

739
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,540
may not yet be patched on machines.

740
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,220
And so if we can build rock solid desktops that can just easily roll forward and keep

741
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,620
up with security updates, I think that'll help our position.

742
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:02,500
Brandly, you did a little digging around just to kind of see like what major vendors are

743
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,180
recommending today in 2022.

744
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
What'd you find?

745
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,180
Well, I had a look to see like, okay, well, it's been I think it was like five years ago,

746
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:16,580
I really dug into this and thought, okay, well, I know it's everyone says I don't need

747
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:21,460
a virus program on Linux, but I'm gonna really have a look.

748
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,080
And the answer was, no, no, don't worry about it.

749
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,860
And almost every suggestion has like Clam AV in it.

750
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,580
And it's not really a solution, as you mentioned, good for it.

751
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,460
It's basically designed for other purposes.

752
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:41,020
But I did find Red Hat had an article that was updated pretty recently, March 2022.

753
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,260
So I think for an article like that, that's pretty darn recent.

754
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:50,820
And the question was, is any virus protection software needed for Red Hat Enterprise Linux?

755
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:55,040
And the post goes into a little bit of detail, but basically says, well, we've got a bunch

756
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,040
of things built in.

757
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,920
And we would say, nah, you don't really need it.

758
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,180
But if you really want to, there's this Clam thing.

759
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:07,460
And that's just a, you know, a one liner at the end of the article, but to have them describe,

760
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:12,540
you know, to all of their vendors and everyone running their software that they don't really

761
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,900
need it was interesting to me.

762
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:20,980
And I think maybe not the whole story, but definitely a point to pay attention to.

763
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:25,080
Yeah, I think we should probably do an episode on some comprehensive security.

764
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,380
And I'd love tips, boosted and emailed in from the audience or in the matrix room as

765
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,900
we kind of prepare for that.

766
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:37,460
Because right now, today, the real threat model is going to be things like your SSH hanging

767
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:41,580
open like a fool or you got some box directly on the Internet and you have software that's

768
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:42,920
out of date.

769
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,180
These are going to be more of your common attack threat vectors in Linux, in my opinion,

770
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:54,100
today in 2022, because Linux is predominantly used in the server space and so predominantly

771
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
the malware.

772
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,420
Guess what?

773
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,620
It targets servers because that's where the user base is.

774
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,620
And so it's typical things you would do to keep a server safe online is what will generally

775
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,900
keep your Linux box safe, even if it's your desktop.

776
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,920
I mean, that's just the reality of it.

777
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,140
And so I could totally see us doing an episode on that.

778
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:14,060
The reason why we've kind of shied away from talking specifically about how to secure your

779
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,420
Linux box is because it's going to vary depending on distro.

780
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:21,240
But I think there are some concepts and some ideas we could cover if we could make it interesting.

781
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,540
So I'd love to see what people suggest, because that's really what you got to worry about

782
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,540
today.

783
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:29,660
We're going to build some malware maybe one day, but we'll build the tooling when that

784
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,660
time comes.

785
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,660
Right?

786
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,660
Oh, you're going to build that tooling?

787
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,660
Yeah.

788
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,660
No, I'm a developer.

789
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,660
You're not.

790
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
You're a developer.

791
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,660
Yeah.

792
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,660
I'll just do a pull request and then I'll merge it.

793
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,660
I'd like a Flutter UI.

794
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,660
Right.

795
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,660
I guess all I have to do is make the pull request.

796
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:45,340
Sometimes I just think I don't really know.

797
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,800
I just like put something in there and then somebody else actually puts the real code

798
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
in there.

799
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,800
I don't even do that.

800
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
I'm a really good developer.

801
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,700
If you're in the community and GitHub co-pilot, you'll be set.

802
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,300
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

803
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,740
Go get started with a free trial for a team or an individual at bitwarden.com slash Linux.

804
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:08,620
You know, Bitwarden is the easiest way for yourself or a business to share and sync sensitive

805
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,620
data.

806
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,540
It's what we use for our password management and it's open source.

807
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,820
It's trusted by millions of individuals.

808
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,860
You know, one of the things that I think I'm going to use the heck out of with Bitwarden

809
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,740
is their offline support.

810
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,700
If there's ever a chance you're going to need to access your vault while offline, Bitwarden

811
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,180
has you covered here.

812
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,580
You can read how to configure your application on their support site and on their blog post

813
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,580
too.

814
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,580
That's how I was reminded of it.

815
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,580
And I'm pretty grateful because there will be times on our road trip where I won't have

816
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:36,580
cell service.

817
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,340
So I'm going to take advantage of that.

818
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,300
And you know, it really seems like Bitwarden has been firing on all cylinders this last

819
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,300
year.

820
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,300
Have you noticed that?

821
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,980
They have been cranking out features that I didn't even realize I needed in my password

822
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:50,380
manager and now they've set the bar.

823
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:55,140
I love how they're integrating in with email relay services to allow you to use my term

824
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,140
relay.

825
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,140
But you know what I'm talking about.

826
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,100
These email front services that allow you to use an anonymous email address.

827
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:04,140
So that way the service or the app doesn't have your actual email address.

828
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,860
That's always been such a pain in the neck to actually go do.

829
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,820
I mean, it's doable, but it's going to take you like another couple extra minutes and

830
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,380
you just want to get this thing signed up.

831
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,900
So they've integrated that capability now into Bitwarden.

832
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,020
They also have automatic username generation along with the password generation.

833
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:25,620
So you could use a unique username, a unique password and a unique email address for every

834
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,420
site and service and app you use.

835
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,300
And they all need logins now.

836
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,740
All of them.

837
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,140
Everything needs logins now.

838
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:37,800
And so it's so tempting to use the same password across all of them just to make life simpler.

839
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,660
But that's a fatal mistake.

840
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,340
We have all seen it happen.

841
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:48,620
I mean, it just happens almost on a weekly basis where an account somewhere at some service,

842
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,820
maybe you signed up four years ago, maybe you signed up for recently.

843
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,300
That just happened to me, actually.

844
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,420
I recently signed up for a service and then a couple of months later their username password

845
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,920
database got leaked.

846
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,640
And I felt a lot better knowing that I had generated a unique password.

847
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,780
Now I generate unique usernames as well, which makes me feel even better.

848
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,220
So go try out Bitwarden.

849
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,220
Go see why I love it.

850
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:13,780
Go see just really why millions of the community out there trust it and go see how it can improve

851
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,780
your game.

852
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,380
And maybe you already know all this.

853
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,380
You probably do.

854
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:24,680
But maybe somebody you know, maybe your workplace, maybe a friend, maybe a family member, go

855
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,340
take care of them.

856
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,700
You know they need this too.

857
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,100
Send them to bitwarden.com slash Linux.

858
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,660
That's where you go to support the show and try out Bitwarden for yourself for free, for

859
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:37,380
a team or for an individual.

860
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:43,340
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

861
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:49,700
Well if you're one of our beloved Matrix community members out there, you may have noticed something

862
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:55,380
funny going on this week.

863
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:59,220
Yeah we broke Federation, sorry about that.

864
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,780
That was a fun one.

865
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,900
Running Matrix is a lot of fun because you learn a lot.

866
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,780
And so if you come out with that attitude, you're going to do great.

867
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,980
Because it is a complex, it's got a complex server side application.

868
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,980
It's fast moving.

869
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,620
I mean it has a lot of active development.

870
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:17,500
It's several different clients that are all independently developed.

871
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,320
And that's a bit of complexity.

872
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,780
And then of course there's this Federation aspect, which is another bit of complexity.

873
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,940
So there's really like three layers to the Matrix dip.

874
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,940
I'm not saying you shouldn't self host or anything like that.

875
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,300
But you just need to be aware of these things.

876
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:36,460
So of course one of the ways that the Matrix network can verify your server is legitimate

877
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:39,500
in the Federation, is by verifying that server.

878
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,380
And it'll do a lookup, it'll check your domain, and then one of your options, there's several

879
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,060
options, but one of your options is to put a little file.

880
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,780
Just a little couple of files like in a hidden directory inside another folder, and then

881
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,020
there's like a file in there.

882
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,700
And in particular we've made this more complicated for ourselves as usual because we wanted like

883
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:01,840
our usernames to be chris at jupitabroadcasting.com, but we're not hosting the server at jupitabroadcasting.com.

884
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,520
It's got a separate subdomain for itself.

885
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,060
So you need some of these little files to verify that and basically delegate from your

886
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,320
real name to the name you want.

887
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,260
Because we want to just have at jupitabroadcasting in our usernames.

888
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:19,120
And so that was just living in the depths of our old WordPress website that's been

889
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,380
running on ScaleEngine for like 13 years and just kind of got added.

890
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:27,140
But because it's in a hidden folder, I think when some of the community members reviewed

891
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:30,620
that folder, they didn't see it, it was a hidden folder, they didn't see it.

892
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:35,780
And so we published the new website during office hours, everything goes live, and we're

893
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:39,220
using the matrix chat room for the live show.

894
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:44,820
We're chatting with people, we're voting on titles, everything's great.

895
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:50,360
And then that evening, the matrix chat just kind of starts to slow down.

896
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:55,620
And then the next day I notice, Wednesday, huh, the only people chatting are people on

897
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,300
the server that have jupitabroadcasting.com accounts.

898
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,940
And I'm talking to Wes, and Wes and I are like, what do you think, it's like a summer

899
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,940
lull?

900
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,940
You think people are just like...

901
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,940
Yeah, we were debating.

902
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,140
We were checking, server seems fine, pinging each other, it's like, okay.

903
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,980
And it was odd because the volume recently on the server has been pretty consistent.

904
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,460
If I look away for two minutes and look back, there's several unread threads.

905
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:21,420
And so I'm like, okay, weird, but maybe healthy, maybe it's good, everybody's out.

906
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,180
People are taking a break from being online, going and enjoying their friends and family

907
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,740
or the outdoors.

908
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:28,420
We hadn't changed anything on the matrix server.

909
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:33,380
I mean, there hadn't been a new Synapse update for a bit and hadn't updated the Linux system

910
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:34,380
on it.

911
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,020
It's just been around there, which we did get around to, but Thursday, I'm off.

912
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:41,420
I'm out driving all day because I'm looking for RV furniture.

913
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:46,520
By the way, if you refurbish RV furniture in my area, contact me because I'm looking.

914
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,940
And so I spent the whole day driving all over this here state looking for somebody who can

915
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:50,940
do this.

916
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,060
And I wasn't really paying attention to the matrix yet.

917
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,800
So Friday I get in and I'm like, Wes, it's still totally dead.

918
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,020
What's going on here?

919
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,060
And I've also, people had PMed me asking for info.

920
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,380
I've gotten back to them and then I was expecting to hear back from them and none of them had

921
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,380
gotten back to me.

922
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,380
I'm like, that's weird.

923
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:09,020
I'm supposed to be recording a show here in a couple of hours.

924
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,660
And so I start doing some troubleshooting and I realized, oh, our federation is broken.

925
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,740
We're not federating.

926
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,300
And so people who are on different servers like matrix.org or their home server can't

927
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,060
get on our server anymore.

928
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:22,780
But beautifully, because who wants to be troubled with air messages?

929
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,900
There's no air.

930
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,260
There's no air in element chat, right?

931
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,020
There's no air on the other person's end.

932
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,700
Perhaps if we dug through the server logs, there may have been an air, but there's like

933
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,780
no outward like air to tell us something's wrong.

934
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,420
And because the people were chatting with us during office hours, I didn't make the

935
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,620
connection to the website immediately.

936
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:41,680
But once I kind of like explained to you what was going on, you put the connection together

937
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,540
pretty quick and realized we were missing a file.

938
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,180
And then we figured out, then we had to figure out how to get it on the new site.

939
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,180
Yeah.

940
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,500
You know, we've got to go add the static file and make sure it's actually going to show

941
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
up.

942
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,500
Yep.

943
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,500
This is when I turned into a developer.

944
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,500
It was very exciting.

945
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Yeah.

946
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,500
You got it.

947
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,500
I mean, Hugo is ready for it, obviously.

948
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,500
It has no problem serving static files.

949
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,500
Yeah.

950
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:03,580
So we just had to go, you know, find that little file, which really isn't much.

951
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:08,020
Thankfully, now it's in Git and Git turns out can actually show you hidden files.

952
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,020
No problem.

953
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,580
So we won't go missing again.

954
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,960
What a concept.

955
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,860
And so now we know about it.

956
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:14,900
Now we've documented it.

957
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:16,660
Now it's there.

958
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:21,440
And the matrix, you know, once we restored the file, things just started fixing itself.

959
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:25,980
It just took a little bit and then all these messages started filtering in and we started,

960
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,340
everybody got reconnected and it was like, oh, hey, I missed you.

961
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,340
It is kind of neat though.

962
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,600
You know, I mean, as confusing as it was for us dummies, just that like us, us messing

963
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,220
up our server and some of our infrastructure, the community could just keep chatting away

964
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,620
in the same places, right?

965
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:42,020
That they didn't have to go down just because we mess things up.

966
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:45,500
And that's, and that's really nice when we're still learning how to send apps.

967
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
That is a good thing.

968
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,380
And I suppose at first it just looks like we're just totally AFK for a few days and

969
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,620
maybe they were all hoping we were taking an ice break.

970
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,880
So it's back online.

971
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,980
One other benefit is that Kyle Potts recently put in some end to end tests for the website,

972
00:47:58,980 --> 00:47:59,980
which is really cool.

973
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,960
So there's some testing happening whenever you push to production and whenever you push

974
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,880
a PR as well.

975
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:12,580
And so Elray, which has been a real, been a real dream these last few weeks with the

976
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:18,560
website has integrated some tests to make sure that that file exists in the future.

977
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:23,600
And so if for some reason, you know, it vanishes again, that's part of our testing.

978
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,720
And it'll come up with an error message before, you know, before we have to wait a few days

979
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,200
and realize things are wrong.

980
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,160
Would you guys fricking look at us?

981
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,760
Would you just fricking look at us for a second?

982
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,560
Hey, we might break fewer things next time.

983
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,680
We've gone from like this rickety WordPress website that was literally collapsing on itself.

984
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,680
It sure was.

985
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,380
Where like a couple of us had access to it to now an entire community is building this

986
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,000
website together and then building tests to validate the changes work and that we don't

987
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,360
make that mistake again, like, would you just fricking look at us right now?

988
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,640
I'm so proud of us.

989
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,800
I am so proud of us right now.

990
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,080
Community has been so great on this.

991
00:48:56,080 --> 00:49:01,560
And it's thrilling to be able to say that as a result of this project, other open source

992
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,280
code was also improved.

993
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,280
Definitely.

994
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,280
That is for the show.

995
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,280
That's just like a big deal.

996
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,280
Like to be able to do this.

997
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,360
And I actually, I kind of want to, I kind of want to take this mentality further if

998
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:13,360
we can.

999
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:17,920
I don't know how possible it is, but, you know, I think we could open source elements

1000
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:18,920
of the show.

1001
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,000
I think the soundboard clips for like the boost and stuff, if, if there's soundboard

1002
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,520
bites that people don't like, well, why couldn't we have like people submitting a couple of

1003
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,040
different ideas on GitHub for a different soundboard file or ideas or something like

1004
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,040
that.

1005
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,360
So I've been trying to think of like how we could extend this concept more.

1006
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:40,400
So what do you think Brent, as somebody who's been diving into GitHub a lot and using it

1007
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,400
for different things, is this something we could extend to elements of a show segment?

1008
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,360
Yeah, I think you're onto something.

1009
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,600
What I've really enjoyed about the website is that this like collective brain that we've

1010
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,920
created through all the collaborators that we have working on on this site, it's been

1011
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,480
amazing to watch all of the different ideas come in and it's because we all had different

1012
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:05,160
personalities and we all care about, you know, someone might visit the website on their mobile

1013
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:10,780
phone and they're really sensitive to the padding on the website.

1014
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:14,760
And so they'll put in an issue on that where I browse through it, I'm like, I don't know.

1015
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:20,600
So what's been interesting is that collectively, we're a pretty amazing little engine making

1016
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,880
some some amazing tweaks and observations to the website and just making it better and

1017
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,080
better and better through everyone's diverse interests.

1018
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:34,880
And so I don't see why that wouldn't work for elements of the show, or maybe it's improving

1019
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,360
the voting on gamma bot that we have running live on the shows.

1020
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,520
You know, I think there are many opportunities for a bunch of people to get involved and

1021
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:49,780
do some of the value for value stuff that we've been suggesting and just improve JB

1022
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:50,780
for everyone.

1023
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,480
I think that sounds amazing to me.

1024
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,480
Right?

1025
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:55,440
I mean, we're making we're making the show for the audience, right?

1026
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,200
We're not just here for our own for our own.

1027
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,800
So I mean, if the audience can help make the show that they want, how is that not awesome?

1028
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,840
We really will you help me will you create a an area for Linux unplugged and an issue

1029
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,920
for the baller boost theme?

1030
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,920
Sure, while we're doing just thank you, because I think that's a great way to go.

1031
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,880
It's so because I want to put a link in the show notes.

1032
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,840
So if people want to participate in that, let's start there.

1033
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:18,840
I've never loved it.

1034
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,840
And we all have a boost.

1035
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,840
We'll get to there.

1036
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,840
We'll talk about that in a moment.

1037
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:25,880
But I just think this could be an option for us to all collectively make the show better.

1038
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,720
So I want to give it a shot.

1039
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,040
Let's give it a shake, guys.

1040
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,800
Let's see what happens.

1041
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,600
So just one more thing before we move on while we're talking about matrix and we're talking

1042
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,300
about GitHub and Hugo and all of that.

1043
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,760
It was it was noted by Oh, Walker in the chat room.

1044
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:46,900
He says I'm watching Linux unplugged on peer tube while chatting about it on matrix.

1045
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,600
It's absolutely glorious.

1046
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,200
And of course, we have the low latency quiet listening on mumble.

1047
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:57,360
We're doing this entire stream now on decentralized free software.

1048
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,800
mumble is centralized on our own server, but there's lots of people that have their own

1049
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,800
mumble server.

1050
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,000
So it's decentralized in that respect.

1051
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,640
Matrix decentralized, peer tube decentralized, and it's all free software.

1052
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,620
And we made a couple of bets this year on our technology stacks.

1053
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,800
We kind of we kind of made a commitment.

1054
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,240
We kind of decided matrix was something we were going to pursue this year.

1055
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,920
And we kind of made a bet on it.

1056
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,780
And we kind of made a bet on peer tube again.

1057
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,100
And I think that's paying off.

1058
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,480
And we've made a bet on boosts more.

1059
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,040
And I think that's gaining steam and paying off.

1060
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,880
Like I feel I'm feeling really good about all of these technologies and all of them

1061
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,280
are about decentralization, which has been a big theme for me.

1062
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:40,480
And not only have we been able to pick the platforms that are free and decentralized

1063
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:44,520
and under the creator's control, but the audience is adopting them more and more willingly

1064
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:47,400
to like, feels like a pretty big win.

1065
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,080
Just look at I think every now and you got to reflect on them W's, you know, because

1066
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,040
usually we just move right along and don't think about it, but you know, it's pretty

1067
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,040
great.

1068
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,480
Well, that's I mean, it's just real nice to have some of the things that we opine about

1069
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:04,440
so often here on the show, really put into practice and working so darn well.

1070
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,120
And now it is time for the boost.

1071
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,800
We got 5000 sats from John a he says, Hey, it's my first boost to Graham.

1072
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,020
I'm going to check out peer tube next.

1073
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,000
Great work pushing these decentralized systems.

1074
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Love it.

1075
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Nice.

1076
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
Thank you, John.

1077
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,000
That's a very on topic boost.

1078
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,800
Look at how that happened.

1079
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:32,600
Next up from the golden dragon 1024 sats or one one kilo set.

1080
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,600
I don't know.

1081
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,600
Yeah.

1082
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,600
Is that a gigabyte set?

1083
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:41,160
Maybe I'll give him a little hard drive.

1084
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,280
Boosting while listening to coder 481.

1085
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,400
I can be the love mascot.

1086
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,760
Here's a partial list of resume pieces.

1087
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,960
I got that rove ducks thing moving in the community.

1088
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,360
Dragons are powerful.

1089
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,300
And oh, why not?

1090
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:02,680
Just like Egon said, what does the world come to where your podcast doesn't have a mascot?

1091
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:08,000
So that is embarrassing because Coder Radio has a mascot and I think it's pretty embarrassing

1092
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,000
that this show does.

1093
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Are we worse than Coder?

1094
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,320
Is that what you're trying to tell us?

1095
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,960
Those jerks on the street, you're going to offend Brent.

1096
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,960
Those jerks only have two hosts over on that show.

1097
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,000
We got three hosts.

1098
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,780
This show deserves a mascot.

1099
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:22,480
And I think golden dragon deserves credit for getting the duck ball rolling.

1100
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,200
So now golden dragon, I mean, you've got to realize this is a commitment.

1101
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,120
You got to have a social media presence from time to time.

1102
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:33,000
You got to come to events because the whole thing about having a mascot is you need to

1103
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,360
be able to walk up to other podcasters and ask them if they have a mascot.

1104
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,360
And if they don't have a mascot for their podcast, you get to just harrumph and walk

1105
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,360
away.

1106
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:45,720
You know, so you got to really, you know, master that face where you just judge them

1107
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:46,720
a little bit.

1108
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,000
Oh, oh, oh.

1109
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
So practice that.

1110
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Are you good, Brent?

1111
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,120
You good with a golden dragon being the official podcast mascot of the unplugged program?

1112
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,120
Well, I think so.

1113
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,840
Yeah, that's a pretty, uh, pretty fancy resume, so, but send in a video.

1114
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,320
We'd love to see it.

1115
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:08,320
Margie boosts in with 5,000 sets been listening and loving for years.

1116
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:14,500
Usually I enjoy the jingles on the show, though for some reason the back home baller clips

1117
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:21,840
really rubbed me the wrong way.

1118
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,520
So I was wondering if it's possible to maybe gauge the temperature of audience sentiment

1119
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,520
on this.

1120
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,320
If it's just a minority that it annoys or just me, I'll pipe down and just fast forward

1121
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,320
through that part.

1122
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,320
No worries.

1123
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:35,320
Margie goes on here.

1124
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,400
Maybe if I was part of the matrix server, I could pull the community myself, though

1125
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,720
to my shame, I've never quite gotten around.

1126
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,280
I love he's being hard on himself.

1127
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,160
I mean, thank you for boosting and thank you for listening for us.

1128
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,440
We love all of that.

1129
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,440
Yeah.

1130
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,440
Also for being so reasonable.

1131
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,440
It's like, well, if you don't want to change it.

1132
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,440
Okay.

1133
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,440
I don't love it.

1134
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,520
It's I think Saturday Night Live fans will probably recognize it.

1135
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,720
It's it's a it's from a funny skit on Saturday Night Live.

1136
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:05,800
But you know what I'm trying to think what when you think of a big spender or a big baller,

1137
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:08,960
like what imagery do you invoke and what sound goes with that?

1138
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,840
Do we need some like cash register sounds?

1139
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:14,320
Do we need some like I think it needs to be I think it needs to be kind of iconic.

1140
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,320
We want to honor them.

1141
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,320
Right.

1142
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,320
Yeah.

1143
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,320
The point I think it needs to be like a sound like a sound bite from a movie or something

1144
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:24,240
that is recognizable and memorable and not annoying.

1145
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,360
So that's where I think we open that up as like maybe one of the first like pull requests

1146
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:32,260
where the community can submit ideas to the show and then we can modify the show based

1147
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,420
on whichever one we go with.

1148
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,560
I think that's an opportunity there because I don't love it, but I don't know what else

1149
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,120
to replace it with.

1150
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,040
So I'll take input from that.

1151
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,600
But thank you, Margie.

1152
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:45,560
Woden wrote in with 5000 sats coming in hot with the blues.

1153
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:52,240
As always, loving the show I've got a long 10 hour each way plus kids end of summer road

1154
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:57,620
trip coming up and would love your guys recommendation on what parts of any of the J.B. shows back

1155
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,760
catalog would make a good listen during the drive.

1156
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,280
Any specific series of episodes?

1157
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,680
Happy to take recommendations from my fellow listeners as well.

1158
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,360
Just take me in the J.B. chat matrix room.

1159
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,360
What in 501?

1160
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:15,160
You know, would it be interesting if we had series like the system D series of unplugged

1161
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,520
would that be interesting?

1162
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,520
I'd listen.

1163
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:21,840
I think one way to do it might be with the tags that we put on each episode.

1164
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:26,440
You know, if you're interested in a particular topic, you know, we have this summer of immutability

1165
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:31,280
that would be perhaps a way to get a series of episodes customized to your interests.

1166
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:35,520
Another tool to help find some of that might be notes dot Jupiter broadcasting dot com

1167
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,720
to kind of dig through all of that stuff.

1168
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:44,100
I'd probably go completionist and probably just look back for over the last year or something.

1169
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:48,000
Or like if you're new to the network, one thing that might be interesting is to try

1170
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,400
to find the episodes of Linux Unplugged where we announced the merger and acquisition.

1171
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,840
And then the Linux Unplugged where we announced that we've gone or maybe that I don't know

1172
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:00,480
if there's I guess there might be a Linux Unplugged where we announced the ACG acquisition.

1173
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,480
I don't know.

1174
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,480
Maybe not.

1175
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,680
And then, you know, find the one where we go independent again.

1176
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,320
That'd be an interesting little arc.

1177
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,360
You're thinking like epochs of Linux Unplugged.

1178
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,560
Yeah, that could be another way to go.

1179
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,300
Or like, you know, there's there's a stretch of the West era on CoderRadio.

1180
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,680
If you haven't caught that, that might be interesting because people love the coding

1181
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,680
challenges from that era.

1182
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,680
Oh, that was fun.

1183
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,680
It comes up all the time.

1184
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,680
So that could be good.

1185
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:26,120
I think there's some really neat live episodes that we've done that have a little bit of

1186
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,120
a different energy.

1187
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:33,320
And, you know, the one we did System76 last year, for instance, had a lot of people who

1188
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,200
were just at the tour.

1189
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,800
And that was a fun go.

1190
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,800
Yeah.

1191
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:38,800
So extras dot show.

1192
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,240
There's a bunch of bonus content over there.

1193
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:45,040
And then there's Jupiter Dot Tube as well for just like if you actually want to see

1194
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:48,000
how we make the shows and video.

1195
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
That's over there as well.

1196
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,880
I'm going to recommend taking some brunches.

1197
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,800
There's some really great ones in there that are perfect for a road trip.

1198
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,640
They're pretty evergreen, I would say.

1199
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,640
And that's a good way to go.

1200
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,640
Yeah.

1201
00:58:58,640 --> 00:58:59,640
How come we didn't think of that?

1202
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,640
Yeah.

1203
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,640
Go make sure you've caught up on all the brunches.

1204
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,640
Those are always really great.

1205
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,120
And some of them are perfect, I think, road show content as well.

1206
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,960
You know, that listening while you're driving.

1207
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:12,920
And I mean, the guests are diverse, so you got you got all kinds of different topics.

1208
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:13,920
All right.

1209
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:14,920
Moving right along.

1210
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,000
Mississippi Mayhem boosted in with eight thousand sats.

1211
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Boost!

1212
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,520
I'm cleaning out my fountain wallet because I'm setting up my own node to use Boost CLI.

1213
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,840
You gotta love command line software.

1214
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:28,120
That's full geek self-hosted mode right there.

1215
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,400
Sure is.

1216
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,640
We asked for feedback about folks' endless OS usage.

1217
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:36,760
He writes, I took one on a deployment to Africa back in 2017.

1218
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,120
It wasn't great, but then again, I'm not the typical use case.

1219
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:43,680
I eventually wiped the computer and gave it to a local man because I had a second one

1220
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:44,680
with me.

1221
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:47,680
He says, I wish I could be more descriptive, but I don't have enough characters.

1222
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,760
What I'll say, though, is I'd love to try it again, maybe as a bedrock strata.

1223
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:52,760
Oh, nice.

1224
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:55,000
Interesting idea, Mayhem.

1225
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,600
I like that.

1226
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:03,040
Green Eagle boosted in with three thousand three hundred and thirty three sats.

1227
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:07,320
He says, with no commute, I listen to the podcast while doing chores around the house

1228
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:11,720
and I just finished episode 471 two days ago, so I'm not very current.

1229
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:12,720
And this got me thinking.

1230
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,040
I wanted to ask other people, how far behind are you?

1231
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,040
Yeah.

1232
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,040
What's your average leg time?

1233
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,040
Yeah.

1234
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,240
Which means we're going to hear from them in a couple of weeks, probably.

1235
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,240
And then see you in 2024.

1236
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:25,960
I hope they're not that far behind, Wes.

1237
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,160
That would be too bad.

1238
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:34,920
And then Green Eagle boosted in with a double boost, a row of ducks, two thousand two hundred

1239
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,920
and twenty two sats.

1240
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,120
He says, I tried for two days to get sats into Podverse, but I ended up using Breeze,

1241
01:00:40,120 --> 01:00:43,560
which only took an evening to get sats set up.

1242
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,560
Yeah, thank you.

1243
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,640
I know some of you out there do struggle with this.

1244
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,660
And so the fact that we're asking you to do this crazy thing and then you also spend so

1245
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:53,240
much time getting it working, that really is putting a lot of effort and value into

1246
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,240
this.

1247
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,640
And once you get it set up, it is like greased lightning.

1248
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:01,040
It just is super easy, super smooth.

1249
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,960
But I know every now and then it can be challenging.

1250
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:09,520
My current favorite like privacy focused way to get those sats is I go to RoboSats.

1251
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:12,360
And if you Google search RoboSats, you can find their educational website will tell you

1252
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:14,040
everything you need to know.

1253
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:20,000
You can work with the moon wallet, M U U N. That works between Bitcoin and lightning and

1254
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,720
just manages all that for you.

1255
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:25,960
It's super easy to get RoboSats, get them in your app, and there will be no trace when

1256
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:26,960
you do that.

1257
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,480
Of course, there's other options like strike and blue wallet where you can buy it through

1258
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,480
the conventional means.

1259
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,520
You just have to identify yourself, which some people are totally cool with.

1260
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:39,360
I think another way to do it as well that would be pretty user friendly is using fountain

1261
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:44,360
and collecting some sats as you listen to podcasts you likely already listen to, including

1262
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,360
this year show.

1263
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,700
And then, you know, once you've collected those, you can send them to whichever show

1264
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,760
you want.

1265
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,760
The pro tip on fountain is if you go look in your profile, they have this screen called

1266
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,280
flow.

1267
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,960
And you just that kind of tells you it's in the little hamburger menu.

1268
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:05,620
And that flow bar tells you what your kind of sat earn rate is going to be.

1269
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:10,760
And you can up your flow by listening to clips, by clipping shows, by boosting, doing all

1270
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,800
of that basically by participating in the app community.

1271
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:18,520
You up your flow and then you earn sats as you listen.

1272
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:22,320
I have switched to Podverse as my daily player.

1273
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:29,080
But even still, when I was using fountain, I earned forty one thousand five hundred and

1274
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:34,020
fifteen sats just by listening to podcasts that I was going to listen to already.

1275
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,020
So that is a great way.

1276
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:38,840
And then I hear that a lot in the booths, I see people, you know, boosting in the sats

1277
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:39,840
I earned in fountain.

1278
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,200
And it's just a circular system.

1279
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,200
You don't even have to leave it.

1280
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,280
But you just have to listen to a lot of podcasts today.

1281
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,120
I suspect some of you do that anyway.

1282
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:50,200
It might just be easier to go to newpodcastapps.com and just grab a podcast app and do it that

1283
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,200
way.

1284
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,640
Gene Bean was really generous this week, boosting in kind of thoughts as he was listening.

1285
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,400
You know, it's one of the advantages of having the button right there in the app is you can

1286
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,680
just give your feedback right away.

1287
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,560
He wants somebody to package up Google Teller and link it up if they would.

1288
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:04,600
And he said he'd also be down to hear more about Ham Radio.

1289
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:08,160
I'm still trying to take the temperature on the audience on Ham Radio.

1290
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:11,280
I have a sense we'll hear a lot from people who do want to hear about it, but I don't

1291
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,960
know if we're going to hear from people who don't.

1292
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,560
And I'd like to hear from both.

1293
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:20,500
And then lastly, Mega Strike 3 sent a congrats to all the JPL winners, which is so awesome.

1294
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:24,040
We had people who didn't get their name pulled, but they were still super cool about it and

1295
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,040
congratulating everybody.

1296
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,040
Yeah, we wish.

1297
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,720
I mean, we obviously wish we could take everyone.

1298
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,480
That's just so that part sucks.

1299
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,220
But we're very glad we have such a courteous community.

1300
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:35,840
And if you're a member at unpluggedcore.com or Jupiter Party, you're thinking, I want

1301
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:36,840
to boost in.

1302
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,320
We do have that on our radar for hopefully towards the end of the year.

1303
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:45,060
And we also are discussing like a private matrix room, kind of kicking around the pros

1304
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:47,020
and cons of that still.

1305
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:49,480
So we'll have an announcement for you pretty soon.

1306
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,200
But it might be post road trip.

1307
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,200
Just that way.

1308
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,720
I can only focus on so many things and that way I'll make sure we do it right.

1309
01:03:55,720 --> 01:04:00,000
But thank you, everybody who supports us through a membership or by boosting into the show.

1310
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,620
And we do have a pick this week.

1311
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:05,520
It was boosted in by listener John.

1312
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:11,440
He says it's a beautiful music player for Linux, works on Android and Windows with material

1313
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:12,440
design.

1314
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,800
So uses flutter and MPV under the hood.

1315
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,880
It's really easy to get installed.

1316
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,380
I don't know if it didn't seem like there was a flat pack anymore, but there are devs

1317
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:26,840
and rpms and a tar and I just needed to install lib MPV.

1318
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:27,840
I love MPV.

1319
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,760
So that makes me fairly happy.

1320
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,400
And then, yeah, it's got a kind of slick looks kind of like an online Google app might, you

1321
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,920
know, I actually think it looks like an iteration ago of Spotify's UI.

1322
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:39,920
Oh, yeah.

1323
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,380
But, you know, not Spotify.

1324
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:44,600
So like the elements of Spotify I like, but it was really easy to get going.

1325
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,140
Like I just had to go by default to look under your home doors music folder.

1326
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:51,320
I don't actually have anything on there right now, but I pointed it at my downloads folder

1327
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,480
and I mean it automatically in no time at all.

1328
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,920
It's reading all the metadata.

1329
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,040
It's finding images of it.

1330
01:04:57,040 --> 01:05:00,420
It's showing I have some of our podcast and I found those no problem.

1331
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,360
So that's great.

1332
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,440
All right.

1333
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:07,200
So it does podcasts, too, or at least it recognizes podcasts.

1334
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:13,760
Harmanoid, harmanoid, H-R-M-O-N-O-I-D dot com.

1335
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,760
Harmanoid for that.

1336
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:21,960
Well, um, are you guys, either one of you still using like a jukebox on your desktop?

1337
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,560
Does anybody do that still?

1338
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:29,740
I do it occasionally, but sometimes, yeah, I do from time to time, especially when I'm

1339
01:05:29,740 --> 01:05:35,240
trying to focus for many hours on something like, for instance, Jupiter Broadcasting's

1340
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:41,120
new website and I find having, you know, my favorite music, that really works for me having

1341
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:45,560
my favorite music just kind of either in a loop or a few albums that I know really well

1342
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:47,100
just playing in the background.

1343
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:52,840
That's a really nice thing for me and I find still, you know, not having to play it in

1344
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:57,660
a web page or something like that is just, there's some simplicity there and some integrations

1345
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:00,620
with, with, you know, media keys on your keyboard or something like that.

1346
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:04,620
So there's, there's still something there that is nice and I've been using Clementine

1347
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:08,880
for a while, you know, pick whichever app you want, but I think there's still a place

1348
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:09,880
for it.

1349
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:10,880
Yeah.

1350
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,680
I also, I like it for focus music, basically stuff that isn't going to distract me and

1351
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,320
isn't going to surprise me.

1352
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,640
I just find all of the automatic recommended music just sucks.

1353
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:22,000
Like it doesn't feel like it goes together.

1354
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:26,320
It's like music that's popular, but I, nothing does as well as like old Pandora did back in

1355
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,320
the day.

1356
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:28,320
Yeah.

1357
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,320
Ain't that the truth?

1358
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,320
With the music DNA.

1359
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:31,320
And I've still kind of got a core set.

1360
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,000
Like I don't mind using the streaming services for, you know, new albums that come out that

1361
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,480
I want to try or just like random stuff to put on in the background.

1362
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:39,880
But I've got a core set of music that much like, you know, you might have some LPs at

1363
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,840
home or whatever, like that you just collect cause you know, you'll kind of always want

1364
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,840
to have around.

1365
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:47,000
And ideally I can get those, you know, off Bandcamp or something and Flackfile.

1366
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,040
And so it's nice to have something that looks decent to play those when, when I want to.

1367
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,440
This is why I don't go any further with it because I'm like two minutes away from like,

1368
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,600
I need Flack everything.

1369
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,920
I need high fidelity, high quality, all my music gotta be Flack.

1370
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,240
And then I'm like, I'm 200 gigs deep into Flackfiles on music and I listen to it like

1371
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,100
once a month.

1372
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:11,840
But I, you know, I, I know this sounds cliche, but you guys probably all saw that news story

1373
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:17,240
about Google that reported the dad to police and shut down his account and sent over all

1374
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:21,540
of his account contents because he was using telemedicine and took a picture of his son

1375
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:24,980
that Google deemed as child porn.

1376
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:29,280
And being a dad and being somebody who uses telemedicine, I started thinking to myself

1377
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,960
like, God, that could be me.

1378
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:37,500
And I think it was really the thing that made me realize we've gone too far.

1379
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:41,760
And so now I'm thinking about music more and I'm thinking about my photos.

1380
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,460
And I kind of wanted to put the question out there to the audience.

1381
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:51,100
Have you solved photo backup on your phone that isn't just going to Nextcloud?

1382
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:55,600
I'm not totally opposed to that solution, but I'd really like something like PhotoPrism,

1383
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:00,960
but that has a really good client that is automatically sucking up the phone's photos

1384
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,600
from Android or iOS and saving them.

1385
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:08,120
And then I have a web UI, I can search for stuff and it doesn't have to be a complete

1386
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,120
end-to-end solution.

1387
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:13,300
I'd be curious to know what people are just using to solve this problem because photos

1388
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,720
is definitely just, I got to get that solved.

1389
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,280
I keep sliding back to Google Photos.

1390
01:08:18,280 --> 01:08:19,280
Yeah, right.

1391
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,680
There might be some stuff you don't care about, like your listening habits that you're okay

1392
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:26,240
with people knowing about in the cloud, but photos are pretty personal.

1393
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:27,240
Yeah.

1394
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:31,160
And I also, I realized over the years that I've taken photos of people who implicitly

1395
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,980
have chosen never to be online in any form.

1396
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:37,400
And if they're in my Google Photos, then now Google knows about them.

1397
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,000
And then somebody else uploads a photo of them and then Google can start networking

1398
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,000
it.

1399
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:47,000
And I'm like, I'm compromising other people's OPSEC basically, you know, including my own.

1400
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
So let us know, send a boost into the show or go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

1401
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,640
How are you solving automatic photo backup on your phone?

1402
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,640
And did you use Kexec?

1403
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:56,640
Because I hope so.

1404
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,600
Brennan, you must be playing around with this kind of stuff.

1405
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:02,240
Well, you know, I was actually remembering an episode that we did.

1406
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:08,080
I believe it may have been of Linux Unplugged now that Alex did some deep dives of alternatives

1407
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,140
to Google Photos.

1408
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:13,760
I believe that may have been six months ago, maybe even a year ago.

1409
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:17,560
Someone should go to notes.jupiterbroadcasting.com and let me know which one.

1410
01:09:17,560 --> 01:09:21,240
But I remember he dove into a bunch of alternatives that were self-hosted.

1411
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,240
And there were some that were good.

1412
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:27,320
There was some AI tooling in there to do a bunch of recognizing of faces and objects

1413
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,760
and hot dogs and such.

1414
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:33,500
And I think back then it wasn't quite where he was happy.

1415
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:37,620
But I'm curious now, I wonder where it's come in that last six months.

1416
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:41,920
And that was episode 409, launch your memories into the future.

1417
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:47,200
And Photoprism, which we talk about in that episode, is a really good solution, but it

1418
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,000
isn't the complete solution.

1419
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,960
And I think that's the piece I'm missing, especially on iOS, because iOS is such a jerk

1420
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:57,440
about background processes.

1421
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:03,020
So getting the files off the phone, but then also something that has a workflow for bigger

1422
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:06,440
picture photos that you import off an SD card.

1423
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:09,120
You want to be able to have one unified photo collection, right?

1424
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,120
Ideally.

1425
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:11,120
And I could use Prism.

1426
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,120
I don't mind.

1427
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:15,320
If I need to like hodgepodge this, kind of like we talked about in that episode, I could

1428
01:10:15,320 --> 01:10:16,320
go that route.

1429
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,540
But I'm just, I'm curious if anybody else has a better solution now.

1430
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:23,080
Maybe they don't, but if we hear something, we'll pass it along for those of you listening

1431
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:24,080
to that way.

1432
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,080
Yeah.

1433
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,080
Hey, one more problem to solve as a group.

1434
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,080
Yeah.

1435
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,080
Let's solve it together, everybody.

1436
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:32,600
I remember if you want more show, you can become a member, then you get a recorded extended

1437
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:36,560
version of the show that has a live show and a post show, a lot more.

1438
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,200
We also archive the sausage as it's made over at jupyter.tube if you want to check it out.

1439
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,760
And then there's only one really big pro tip we should leave everybody with, Wes.

1440
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:47,200
Like the one tip you should take away from this week's episode.

1441
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,920
Do you know what it is?

1442
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:50,400
Better get your antivirus sorted.

1443
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,400
Okay.

1444
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,400
There's two tips.

1445
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,400
Antivirus tip.

1446
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:54,400
See you next week.

1447
01:10:54,400 --> 01:11:00,360
Same bat time, same bat station.

1448
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:03,880
And of course, linuxactionnews.com.

1449
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,640
Join us live, hang out here, and then when we're all done, you go over to linuxactionnews.com,

1450
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,640
you catch up on the news.

1451
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,640
Yeah.

1452
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:11,640
How about that?

1453
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,320
Less fussing around, just what you need to know.

1454
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:15,320
That's what I would do.

1455
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,320
Tell you what.

1456
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,840
Actually, I mean, we were listening to something before the show.

1457
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,880
So you already got your Linux Action News site for the day.

1458
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:21,880
You're right.

1459
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:22,880
We did it before the show.

1460
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,880
That is true.

1461
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:24,880
That's documented.

1462
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:25,880
We got the receipts.

1463
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:26,880
All right.

1464
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,880
Details and links, I don't know.

1465
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:31,840
Stuff we talked about today, linuxunplugged.com, contact pages over there.

1466
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,720
Or check out the new website, jupitabroadcasting.com.

1467
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:35,880
We got links over there now.

1468
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,880
It's so impressive.

1469
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,520
Thanks so much for joining us.

1470
01:11:38,520 --> 01:12:06,320
See you right back here next Sunday.

1471
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:21,240
Have we officially moved 100% to the matrix, sir, for this?

1472
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,240
This is right.

1473
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:23,240
Yes.

1474
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,240
Right.

1475
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,000
This is our first show where we did the live chat on matrix.

1476
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,240
Coder made the jump first and it seemed to go smooth.

1477
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:29,600
Office Hours really made the jump first.

1478
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:30,600
Well, come on.

1479
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,540
Coder was the first long-running live show.

1480
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:33,540
And now LUP.

1481
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,520
You know, and Coder has the mask on.

1482
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,480
I don't know what's going on over there.

1483
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,240
And they're probably going to get to 500 first, too.

1484
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,960
That's just some big Coder energy lately.

1485
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:41,960
I know.

1486
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:45,360
Maybe we should start doing double episodes, two a week, to catch up so we can get to 500

1487
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:46,360
first.

1488
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,360
Okay.

1489
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,360
Okay.

1490
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:49,360
Oh, I was thinking Sabotage would be the other way to go.

1491
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,200
Oh, that's way easier.

1492
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,760
We send Brent down to Florida.

1493
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:54,760
Yeah.

1494
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,480
We get him a Jar Jar costume.

1495
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,480
Right?

1496
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,480
Hmm.

1497
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:02,920
Put some squirrels in his walls, you know, and see what happens.

1498
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:05,040
Yeah, I think he'll get there.

1499
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,040
I think it's going to be awesome.

1500
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:07,760
I can't wait for 500.

1501
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,760
That's such a big number.

1502
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:11,400
I don't think any of my shows have ever made it to 500.

1503
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:12,920
So that's a landmark.

1504
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:15,680
And I wonder if I'll make it to a thousand one day for any of my shows.

1505
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,680
Oh, I bet you will.

1506
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,680
You think so?

1507
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,680
Uh-huh.

1508
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,680
If I survive.

1509
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:40,200
Well, you got to.
