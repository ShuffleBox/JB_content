WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.500
It's a Linux-unplugged birthday party.

00:01.500 --> 00:03.800
Slackware has turned 25.

00:03.800 --> 00:05.660
No, no, no, they didn't turn 25 before.

00:05.660 --> 00:08.320
I know, we all thought so, but it was originally released,

00:08.320 --> 00:11.500
version 1.0, on July 17th, 1993,

00:11.500 --> 00:13.620
and its founder, Patrick, originally never intended

00:13.620 --> 00:15.480
to do a Linux distribution.

00:15.480 --> 00:18.100
He just wanted to help out Softlanding Linux,

00:18.100 --> 00:20.820
but you know how things go in the open source community.

00:20.820 --> 00:22.700
It's the oldest distro around,

00:22.700 --> 00:24.740
and it's been very influential.

00:24.740 --> 00:27.420
The earliest releases of Soos Linux were based on Slackware.

00:27.420 --> 00:30.260
Distributions such as Arch Linux can see their

00:30.260 --> 00:33.580
philosophical heritage back into Slackware.

00:33.580 --> 00:35.360
It's been around for a long time.

00:35.360 --> 00:37.820
So for this episode only,

00:37.820 --> 00:40.120
Wes and I are running exclusively on Slackware.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.540
I mean, since we did that whole Slackware experiment,

00:42.540 --> 00:43.980
I just have never gotten rid of it.

00:43.980 --> 00:45.960
It has its own little place on my hard drive.

00:45.960 --> 00:47.580
We've never gone back.

00:47.580 --> 00:49.660
Right next to Gen 2, no doubt.

00:49.660 --> 00:50.500
Ooh.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.540
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:53.540 --> 00:57.300
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 258 for July 17th,

00:57.300 --> 00:58.700
2018.

00:58.700 --> 01:03.700
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged,

01:10.980 --> 01:12.700
your weekly Linux talk show

01:12.700 --> 01:14.820
that's loaded for bear this week.

01:14.820 --> 01:16.860
And I'm not so sure if that's a good thing,

01:16.860 --> 01:18.320
but we have so much to get into

01:18.320 --> 01:20.320
that maybe you won't even notice.

01:20.320 --> 01:23.620
We'll come around to how SSH got its port number.

01:23.620 --> 01:26.820
We'll talk about Chrome using a little more memory,

01:26.820 --> 01:30.980
but then we'll dig in to some crazy projects

01:30.980 --> 01:31.940
that are going down this week.

01:31.940 --> 01:35.380
I'm talking stuff that we've been meaning to get to

01:35.380 --> 01:37.900
for months now that are finally making it into the show.

01:37.900 --> 01:41.020
Plus some ideas that I'm not so sure are fully cooked,

01:41.020 --> 01:43.300
but we'll run them past you guys and see what you think.

01:43.300 --> 01:47.780
We've got an update on the Atari VCS and the Librem 5.

01:47.780 --> 01:49.800
And then towards the end of the show,

01:49.800 --> 01:51.820
after we've gotten through some app picks

01:51.820 --> 01:55.740
and some community news, we have a question.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.000
This is in light of Python's benevolent dictator

01:58.000 --> 01:59.060
for life stepping down.

01:59.060 --> 02:01.420
We covered that on Linux Action News this week.

02:01.420 --> 02:03.780
And I thought maybe we could use the context

02:03.780 --> 02:06.560
of that situation to talk about a broader topic.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.380
What happens when Linus steps down?

02:11.240 --> 02:12.180
What happens to Linux?

02:12.180 --> 02:13.460
What happens to the structure?

02:13.460 --> 02:14.820
Where does that go?

02:14.820 --> 02:16.020
Does it go to Greg KH?

02:16.020 --> 02:17.620
Does it go to the Linux Foundation?

02:17.620 --> 02:18.900
We'll talk about that.

02:18.900 --> 02:20.420
And then we'll also discuss maybe

02:20.420 --> 02:22.260
how other open source projects could learn

02:22.260 --> 02:23.380
from what happened with Python.

02:23.380 --> 02:26.460
We'll do a quick recap too, just in case you didn't hear that.

02:26.460 --> 02:28.500
So Mr. West, we're fully loaded.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.500
It's just you and I this week.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.180
No, no Brent.

02:31.180 --> 02:32.620
No Brent, he's ditched us.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.220
But I think he might've been intimidated

02:34.220 --> 02:36.300
by just how much show we've packed in here.

02:36.300 --> 02:37.620
I was scared myself.

02:37.620 --> 02:40.660
Yeah, it was either that or it was the man eating clams.

02:40.660 --> 02:43.900
I'm not sure, it was something to that effect.

02:43.900 --> 02:46.020
But I think after the show, we'll head out

02:46.020 --> 02:47.820
and see if we can't find him and save him

02:47.820 --> 02:49.180
so we can make it back.

02:49.180 --> 02:50.820
But we do have a mumble room and they're here.

02:50.820 --> 02:52.660
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

02:52.660 --> 02:53.820
What's up?

02:53.820 --> 02:55.180
Good evening.

02:55.180 --> 02:58.220
Hello, oh, you stop it you guys, you stop it.

02:58.220 --> 02:59.900
There's so much to get into this week.

02:59.900 --> 03:02.220
I don't even know where to start with it.

03:02.220 --> 03:03.700
We have a bunch of community news.

03:03.700 --> 03:07.980
It's good to see some familiar faces in the mumble room.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.620
Daniel Foray made it back, even though,

03:09.620 --> 03:12.660
I mean, I thought he's busy working on elementary OS.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.700
Dan, how'd you make it here?

03:13.700 --> 03:15.100
Aren't you supposed to be busy?

03:15.100 --> 03:16.460
Oh, you know, taking a break.

03:16.460 --> 03:18.980
That's my nice way of thanking you for being here really.

03:18.980 --> 03:23.660
You know, I'm nice to my guests, what can I say?

03:23.660 --> 03:27.740
All right, so we have much to get into, so much to talk about.

03:27.740 --> 03:29.820
So let's start with the one that I thought

03:29.820 --> 03:31.420
was kind of just the most interesting.

03:31.420 --> 03:36.420
I'd never really known the story about how SSH got its port

03:36.420 --> 03:38.060
and the author wrote it up.

03:38.060 --> 03:39.660
And I wanted to relay it to you guys

03:39.660 --> 03:42.700
because it's fascinating how SSH received

03:42.700 --> 03:46.500
its port in the spring of 1995.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.460
The author starts with, I designed SSH to replace

03:49.460 --> 03:53.300
both Telnet and FTP, Telnet being on port 23

03:53.300 --> 03:56.100
and FTP being on port 21.

03:56.100 --> 03:59.740
Port 22 was free at the time, and it sat conveniently

03:59.740 --> 04:01.740
between ports for Telnet and FTP.

04:01.740 --> 04:03.500
I figured having that port number

04:03.500 --> 04:05.660
might be one of those small things that would give

04:05.660 --> 04:08.660
some extra credibility to SSH.

04:08.660 --> 04:11.260
But how could I get that port number, he writes.

04:11.260 --> 04:13.780
I had never allocated one, but I knew somebody who

04:13.780 --> 04:15.740
had allocated a port before.

04:15.740 --> 04:17.620
The basic process for port allocation

04:17.620 --> 04:19.620
was fairly simple at that time.

04:19.620 --> 04:22.740
The internet was smaller, and we were in the very early stages

04:22.740 --> 04:23.620
of the internet boom.

04:23.620 --> 04:27.060
Port numbers were allocated by the Internet Assigned Numbers

04:27.060 --> 04:30.260
Authority, which really at that time,

04:30.260 --> 04:33.580
run by John Postel and Joyce K. Reynolds.

04:33.580 --> 04:35.460
Among other things, John had been the editor

04:35.460 --> 04:39.060
of some minor protocol standards you may have heard,

04:39.060 --> 04:44.500
such as IP, ICMP, and TCP.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.460
And he was a little intimidated by that fact,

04:48.460 --> 04:52.460
but he built up the courage, and he wrote an email to John.

04:52.460 --> 04:57.100
And he wrote in July of 1995, dear sir, just before,

04:57.100 --> 04:59.580
just like a week before the announcement of SSH,

04:59.580 --> 05:01.300
dear sir, I have written a program

05:01.300 --> 05:04.700
to securely log from one machine onto another

05:04.700 --> 05:06.580
over an insecure network.

05:06.580 --> 05:09.100
It provides major improvements in security and functionality

05:09.100 --> 05:11.740
over existing Telnet and R login protocols

05:11.740 --> 05:12.860
and implementations.

05:12.860 --> 05:16.700
In particular, it prevents IP, DNS, and routing spoofing.

05:16.700 --> 05:19.940
My plan is to distribute the software freely on the internet

05:19.940 --> 05:23.900
and to get it as wide of use as possible.

05:23.900 --> 05:26.220
I would like to get a registered privileged port

05:26.220 --> 05:27.580
number for the software.

05:27.580 --> 05:31.820
The number should preferably be in the range of 1 to 255.

05:31.820 --> 05:34.740
And then he goes on to notice, I am currently

05:34.740 --> 05:38.540
using port 22 in the latest beta test,

05:38.540 --> 05:42.180
and it would just be great if I could just keep using that.

05:42.180 --> 05:43.780
The service software name is called

05:43.780 --> 05:47.220
SSH for Secure Shell, sincerely yours.

05:47.220 --> 05:52.900
And then it looks like the next day, almost within just

05:52.900 --> 05:56.060
a couple of hours, but I think it was a different time zone,

05:56.060 --> 06:00.780
Joyce writes back, we have assigned port number 22 to SSH,

06:00.780 --> 06:02.540
and we've marked your email address

06:02.540 --> 06:04.380
as the point of contact, Joyce.

06:04.380 --> 06:05.460
And that's it.

06:05.460 --> 06:11.100
On July 12, 1995, at 2 AM, the final beta of SSH

06:11.100 --> 06:13.660
was announced using port 22, and it

06:13.660 --> 06:16.780
was one of those small touches that he believes

06:16.780 --> 06:19.340
helped it gain credibility.

06:19.340 --> 06:22.620
And it's such a simple, easy, elegant story.

06:22.620 --> 06:26.220
Like, it's not this big corporate explanation.

06:26.220 --> 06:29.620
I guess I always thought it was like a big standards body, Wes.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.580
I made that assumption.

06:31.580 --> 06:33.340
Where are the forms filled out in triplicate

06:33.340 --> 06:35.140
and the months of procedures before you

06:35.140 --> 06:36.660
can get anything approved?

06:36.660 --> 06:39.340
I don't see that here, and it's very confusing and kind

06:39.340 --> 06:40.100
of heartening.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.620
Yeah, it's just a simple email.

06:42.620 --> 06:46.620
Dear sir or ma'am, to whom it may be concerned.

06:46.620 --> 06:48.820
And the response email is so short, too.

06:48.820 --> 06:52.220
Just like, yeah, no problem, 22 is yours.

06:52.220 --> 06:55.620
And we just added your email address, no big deal.

06:55.620 --> 06:59.220
Makes me think of the Steve Jobs quote in Steve Jobs' book,

06:59.220 --> 07:00.900
that when you realize the world around you

07:00.900 --> 07:04.780
is just made by people, it's just two people emailing,

07:04.780 --> 07:06.580
and yeah, that's fine, let's do that.

07:06.580 --> 07:09.820
Yeah, yeah, everybody's just as smart as you.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.260
I think it also sort of harkens back

07:11.260 --> 07:14.740
to that era of the internet when if you were on the internet,

07:14.740 --> 07:16.260
you probably had an email and you

07:16.260 --> 07:18.140
used it to correspond with real humans,

07:18.140 --> 07:20.900
not just receive junk mail or ads in your inbox.

07:20.900 --> 07:22.700
So it's kind of quaint in that respect,

07:22.700 --> 07:24.900
like that you don't have to be all your guards up.

07:24.900 --> 07:26.020
You can actually communicate.

07:26.020 --> 07:27.660
Yeah, quaint is a good way to put it.

07:27.660 --> 07:29.740
It's like, aw, it's a simpler time.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.780
It was so easy back then.

07:31.780 --> 07:35.460
And it's fascinating, the launch of projects

07:35.460 --> 07:42.100
like Linux and SSH and many, many others, the just blatantly

07:42.100 --> 07:46.140
humbleness of the like, I think this could be a good thing.

07:46.140 --> 07:49.340
Maybe it'll replace our login and telnet.

07:49.340 --> 07:51.820
You know, it helps fight against DNS spoofing.

07:51.820 --> 07:53.500
And I think that's kind of a good thing.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.460
And now it's like the underpinnings

07:55.460 --> 07:57.540
of how we administer all of these systems.

07:57.540 --> 08:00.420
Like SSH is so pivotal to what we do now.

08:00.420 --> 08:01.900
It starts so humble.

08:01.900 --> 08:05.260
I think that's fascinating, just like Linux itself.

08:05.260 --> 08:07.220
We have some books we could talk about.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.540
Maybe mention those right here at the top of the show.

08:10.540 --> 08:13.500
The Humble Bundle folks have a Humble Book Bundle.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.580
And it's the Linux Geek Bundle by Non-Starch Press.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.620
So they have a whole bunch in here that you might

08:18.620 --> 08:21.380
want to go check out, including Perl one-liners,

08:21.380 --> 08:25.020
The Art of Debugging, The Book of GIMP.

08:25.020 --> 08:26.220
That's kind of cool.

08:26.220 --> 08:29.220
The Book of Inkscape, that's also very cool.

08:29.220 --> 08:31.900
Blender Masterclass, oh, I might just

08:31.900 --> 08:33.300
have to pop on over there.

08:33.300 --> 08:36.820
How Linux Works is probably just a good one to page.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.700
Oh, Absolute OpenBSD, who would ever want that?

08:39.700 --> 08:41.100
I don't know about that.

08:41.100 --> 08:44.060
Think Like a Programmer, the Linux Programming Interface,

08:44.060 --> 08:45.740
that's awesome.

08:45.740 --> 08:46.900
So there you go.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.580
Humble Bundle, I'll have a link in the show notes

08:48.580 --> 08:49.420
if you want to check that out.

08:49.420 --> 08:51.420
It's got 12 days as we record this.

08:51.420 --> 08:54.660
You know, we think a little bit too much about our desktops,

08:54.660 --> 08:56.620
things that we have like bookshelves in our home.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.100
Make sure you have a robust e-bookshelf, too, though.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.500
And these will really stack the deck

09:00.500 --> 09:01.860
when you want to open up your browser

09:01.860 --> 09:03.980
and look really smart in front of your friends.

09:03.980 --> 09:06.940
Yeah, when you want to open up the browser

09:06.940 --> 09:09.020
in front of your friends, because that's something

09:09.020 --> 09:10.980
you do all the time.

09:10.980 --> 09:12.820
Well, I don't know about you, Chris.

09:12.820 --> 09:16.020
Hey, guys, come over here and look at my browser real quick.

09:16.020 --> 09:17.820
You know, just get a really big monitor.

09:17.820 --> 09:19.820
If only the e-book market wasn't taken over

09:19.820 --> 09:24.020
by one single proprietary source, RIP.

09:24.020 --> 09:25.060
RIP.

09:25.060 --> 09:28.100
Now, I wanted to just give a quick mention, just

09:28.100 --> 09:29.700
an update on everybody.

09:29.700 --> 09:32.900
I am still down here in the Tejas, Texas.

09:32.900 --> 09:35.060
And boy, was that a mistake.

09:35.060 --> 09:36.900
Holy crap.

09:36.900 --> 09:38.940
I have learned a new kind of hot.

09:38.940 --> 09:41.180
112 degrees outside right now.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.740
The National Weather Service has just

09:42.740 --> 09:45.460
issued a warning for the next two days.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.140
The dead of night, it's going to be like 86 degrees.

09:48.140 --> 09:49.980
It's intense.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.740
But boy, have I been having a blast.

09:51.740 --> 09:54.260
So Linux Academy has been doing these live streams

09:54.260 --> 09:56.980
where they're like doing giveaways and launching

09:56.980 --> 09:57.740
new content.

09:57.740 --> 09:58.700
So I've been hanging out for that.

09:58.700 --> 09:59.820
They put me up in a hotel.

09:59.820 --> 10:02.700
So it's not like I'm not having to pay for it out

10:02.700 --> 10:04.140
of my pocket or anything.

10:04.140 --> 10:06.140
So they put me up in a nice hotel.

10:06.140 --> 10:07.940
And I decided to stay here because they just

10:07.940 --> 10:10.620
had me give a talk a bit ago at their summit.

10:10.620 --> 10:12.100
They have a company-wide summit here

10:12.100 --> 10:13.900
that most of the company is at, and had

10:13.900 --> 10:16.780
me give a talk on community and leadership

10:16.780 --> 10:19.100
and contributing upstream.

10:19.100 --> 10:21.380
They're working on something that I probably

10:21.380 --> 10:24.300
can't say what it is that will be a big code

10:24.300 --> 10:26.380
project that they're going to start contributing

10:26.380 --> 10:27.460
to open source upstream.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.540
And they're getting ready to try to figure out,

10:29.540 --> 10:31.300
try to learn how to do that, and how to position it,

10:31.300 --> 10:31.900
and all of that.

10:31.900 --> 10:32.740
Wow.

10:32.740 --> 10:34.060
That's really exciting.

10:34.060 --> 10:34.580
It is.

10:34.580 --> 10:36.060
It's really neat to see them do that.

10:36.060 --> 10:38.700
They've, the other thing that they've talked a lot about

10:38.700 --> 10:42.260
at the summit is they've had a program in place

10:42.260 --> 10:44.300
where it's like choose your own weapon.

10:44.300 --> 10:47.820
So you come in and you say, I'd like a Chromebook.

10:47.820 --> 10:49.780
Or hi, I'd like a MacBook.

10:49.780 --> 10:50.860
Or hi, I'd like a Linux box.

10:50.860 --> 10:54.140
And you just picked whatever worked best for you.

10:54.140 --> 10:55.700
But now what they're doing is to try

10:55.700 --> 10:57.740
to encourage people to pick more Linux boxes.

10:57.740 --> 11:01.220
They're setting up a little Linux support group,

11:01.220 --> 11:04.220
like people that are also, not like support in terms

11:04.220 --> 11:05.820
of technical support, but like support group.

11:05.820 --> 11:08.460
And like, hey, I'm switching and I don't know how to do this.

11:08.460 --> 11:12.060
So they have a little internal group that helps everybody

11:12.060 --> 11:13.020
figure that stuff out.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.020
And so that's pretty neat.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.100
Seen a lot of gnome shell here at Linux Academy,

11:16.100 --> 11:18.540
which I'm not too surprised by.

11:18.540 --> 11:20.740
I don't think I've seen any Plasma desktop yet.

11:20.740 --> 11:22.520
So I don't know if I can leave just yet.

11:22.520 --> 11:25.140
I may have to stick around until I've converted a few people

11:25.140 --> 11:26.860
over to the Plasma desktop.

11:26.860 --> 11:29.780
Yeah, if you join that group, you can just sort of be like,

11:29.780 --> 11:31.580
oh, no, that's just a gnome problem.

11:31.580 --> 11:35.100
If you install this other shell, it works way better.

11:35.100 --> 11:38.020
Oh, man, that's so insidious.

11:38.020 --> 11:39.100
You troll, you.

11:39.100 --> 11:40.100
I'm trying from the top.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.780
So I'm trying to get the CEO switched over to Kubuntu 18.04.

11:43.780 --> 11:45.920
And then once I get Anthony on Kubuntu,

11:45.920 --> 11:47.580
I'm going to set him up with LatteDoc.

11:47.580 --> 11:49.140
Because the other thing I've noticed

11:49.140 --> 11:53.060
is when people see my Plasma desktop setup,

11:53.060 --> 11:55.260
they are, you know, it's like the old days when

11:55.260 --> 11:58.140
I used to have Compiz and Barrel.

11:58.140 --> 11:59.980
People used to be like, oh, what's that?

11:59.980 --> 12:02.640
And in my IT department, then they started trying out Linux.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.820
And it's why I actually became a big fan of desktop effects,

12:05.820 --> 12:07.580
not because they had any practical effect

12:07.580 --> 12:09.660
other than they helped me switch people to Linux.

12:09.660 --> 12:10.860
And so I was all for it.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.300
Same thing now with my Plasma desktop setup,

12:13.300 --> 12:16.940
which does look good on that XPS 13 with the Infinity

12:16.940 --> 12:17.780
edge-to-edge display.

12:17.780 --> 12:18.900
It's 4K.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.600
And I got a high-res background.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.220
And then I got LatteDoc going.

12:22.220 --> 12:23.820
And I got a dark theme going.

12:23.820 --> 12:26.940
And so I was showing Anthony, I'm like, yeah,

12:26.940 --> 12:28.300
this is how you can make it look.

12:28.300 --> 12:29.660
And this is pretty nice, right?

12:29.660 --> 12:30.980
I'm like, this is LatteDoc here?

12:30.980 --> 12:32.500
He's like, I'm doing that.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.740
So you'll see.

12:33.740 --> 12:36.180
I'm beginning to spread my tentacles.

12:36.180 --> 12:38.300
And I don't know, it's like, it's not good enough

12:38.300 --> 12:39.620
just to get them on Linux anymore?

12:39.620 --> 12:40.140
No, no.

12:40.140 --> 12:41.820
No, I must go all the way.

12:41.820 --> 12:44.260
But actually, the folks that are running Gnome, they love it.

12:44.260 --> 12:45.260
It's great for them.

12:45.260 --> 12:46.840
So it's been pretty cool to see that.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.220
It's been cool to see people that come in

12:49.220 --> 12:51.260
from different organizations.

12:51.260 --> 12:54.060
There's some folks that they hired recently from Rackspace

12:54.060 --> 12:55.100
and brought them in here.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.620
And Rackspace was all Macs.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.900
And so they came in here, and they wanted a Mac.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.340
But then they started seeing other people's Linux desktops,

13:01.340 --> 13:03.460
and started working here at Linux Academy for a while.

13:03.460 --> 13:04.260
And now they're trying to figure out

13:04.260 --> 13:05.420
how to switch over to Linux.

13:05.420 --> 13:07.940
And there's people that are like,

13:07.940 --> 13:10.340
how do I run Linux on a touch bar Macbook?

13:10.340 --> 13:11.300
I'm like, oh.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.820
Don't even start.

13:12.820 --> 13:13.820
That's been a thing.

13:13.820 --> 13:15.540
It's been a real thing watching that.

13:15.540 --> 13:18.060
I'd be curious to keep tabs on how that goes

13:18.060 --> 13:21.700
throughout the company as they kind of make that shift.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.140
Yeah, it's unique to see.

13:23.140 --> 13:26.220
It's not like you're a secret group hiding around like,

13:26.220 --> 13:27.360
oh, yeah, we use Linux.

13:27.360 --> 13:28.360
We don't really talk about it much,

13:28.360 --> 13:29.660
and don't tell desktop support.

13:29.660 --> 13:30.900
But here's some tips.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.060
It's out in the open.

13:32.060 --> 13:33.380
It's even almost sponsored.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.540
That is awesome.

13:34.540 --> 13:36.780
I know that if I was an employee,

13:36.780 --> 13:41.220
I would much prefer a you choose your system policy

13:41.220 --> 13:45.260
than you have to use X, Y, Z, regardless of whatever it is.

13:45.260 --> 13:47.260
Because it's never going to be perfect.

13:47.260 --> 13:51.180
And one year, maybe I'd like to use Kubuntu.

13:51.180 --> 13:53.220
And then maybe the next year, I'd like to use KDE Neon

13:53.220 --> 13:53.620
or something.

13:53.620 --> 13:55.280
And I want to be able to move around,

13:55.280 --> 13:56.020
and I want to be able to change.

13:56.020 --> 13:57.060
And so I like that.

13:57.060 --> 13:57.860
I would like that.

13:57.860 --> 14:00.620
If I wanted to use Windows 10, I think I should be able to.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.620
So I think that's kind of a cool policy.

14:02.620 --> 14:05.140
It feels a little bit, too, like if you were a master carpenter

14:05.140 --> 14:06.460
and you came into a job, and they're like, no,

14:06.460 --> 14:08.220
we only use this brand of hammer.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.380
So here you go.

14:09.380 --> 14:12.260
Throw away any tools that you know and love.

14:12.260 --> 14:14.180
And I think from the security side, it's good.

14:14.180 --> 14:16.340
If you have to deal with whatever operating systems are

14:16.340 --> 14:17.420
going to be on your network, you have

14:17.420 --> 14:18.880
to have a better level of security

14:18.880 --> 14:21.900
than if you're just going to trust whatever crappy programs

14:21.900 --> 14:23.580
you force on the Windows desktop.

14:23.580 --> 14:27.940
I think this is probably the most prolonged time I've

14:27.940 --> 14:31.300
spent at a company that is a Linux shop,

14:31.300 --> 14:32.820
and what they do is Linux.

14:32.820 --> 14:33.700
You know what I mean?

14:33.700 --> 14:35.120
Like, I've definitely been at lots

14:35.120 --> 14:38.000
of places that use Linux, lots of places that use Linux.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.220
But the product is all based around Linux,

14:41.220 --> 14:43.340
and the people are using Linux, and the server side's

14:43.340 --> 14:43.980
all Linux.

14:43.980 --> 14:48.420
And like, it's not like a thing.

14:48.420 --> 14:49.620
It's just normal.

14:49.620 --> 14:52.420
It's not like this weird thing.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.540
It's just, well, yeah, it's Linux.

14:54.540 --> 14:55.740
Of course I'm using it.

14:55.740 --> 14:57.980
I started a job as a developer a few years ago,

14:57.980 --> 15:02.420
and the first day, the girl who was doing my mentoring said,

15:02.420 --> 15:03.220
here's your laptop.

15:03.220 --> 15:04.100
It's running Windows.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.800
What I do is I run Ubuntu in a VM

15:05.800 --> 15:07.420
and do all my dev work in a VM.

15:07.420 --> 15:10.300
I'm like, why couldn't you just erase it

15:10.300 --> 15:11.940
and put Linux straight on it?

15:11.940 --> 15:15.140
Oh, it's too complicated.

15:15.140 --> 15:16.660
Yeah, I mean, sometimes there's an advantage

15:16.660 --> 15:18.700
to having your dev environment in a VM, for sure.

15:18.700 --> 15:21.500
But I could just never live with the performance.

15:21.500 --> 15:22.460
I've tried.

15:22.460 --> 15:23.340
It's just no good.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.560
Yeah, it's been pretty interesting to sort of be

15:25.560 --> 15:29.540
around where it's, I was trying to come up with a term for it.

15:29.540 --> 15:32.380
This isn't a great term, but what it feels like

15:32.380 --> 15:33.740
is just ambient Linux.

15:33.740 --> 15:36.380
Like, Linux is just an assumed.

15:36.380 --> 15:39.520
It's just like this normal, not this edge thing.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.660
It's just this normal thing.

15:40.660 --> 15:41.860
It's just Linux isn't assumed.

15:41.860 --> 15:47.340
It's just ambient Linux, and that's not a big deal.

15:47.340 --> 15:50.060
It's never been a big deal here, so it's not part of the cult.

15:50.060 --> 15:54.860
It's just so weird, though, because it's always

15:54.860 --> 15:56.220
been other companies I go to, it's

15:56.220 --> 16:01.260
like maybe they have a product that runs on Linux or something.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.140
And then there have been companies like System76

16:03.140 --> 16:06.180
that are all Linux, but it's 20 people, where

16:06.180 --> 16:07.380
this is over 100 people.

16:07.380 --> 16:09.460
And it's a huge summit and all that kind of stuff.

16:09.460 --> 16:10.660
It's a big group of people.

16:10.660 --> 16:14.700
So it's an experience to be inside a corporation,

16:14.700 --> 16:16.940
like an actual legitimate corporation

16:16.940 --> 16:20.780
with over 100 employees.

16:20.780 --> 16:21.980
But they're all geeks.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.420
It's just a very strange experience to me,

16:24.420 --> 16:28.300
but a good one, but one that the younger version of me,

16:28.300 --> 16:31.060
who fought the good old wars of Microsoft and Linux

16:31.060 --> 16:33.820
and trying to get people to use Linux all the time

16:33.820 --> 16:36.260
and trying to convince people that open source didn't mean

16:36.260 --> 16:39.420
it was bad quality and fighting all of those fights

16:39.420 --> 16:41.620
that I used to get in the middle of to try

16:41.620 --> 16:45.060
to get clients to switch their systems over to Linux.

16:45.060 --> 16:47.460
That version of me now seeing this

16:47.460 --> 16:50.780
is still having a hard time accepting what I'm seeing.

16:50.780 --> 16:54.380
You mean people besides my little social group

16:54.380 --> 16:55.620
use this now?

16:55.620 --> 16:56.540
It really is a thing.

16:56.540 --> 16:58.900
You're no longer a cool outsider, right?

16:58.900 --> 16:59.940
There's no fight to win.

16:59.940 --> 17:01.580
You just can get work done now.

17:01.580 --> 17:04.860
In the best way possible, in the best way possible.

17:04.860 --> 17:08.540
The fight is so over that the Earth is no longer warm

17:08.540 --> 17:09.780
from the bombs even.

17:09.780 --> 17:11.780
They've rebuilt and repaved the roads

17:11.780 --> 17:13.500
and now life just goes on.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.540
You've mourned for the dead, you're moving on.

17:15.540 --> 17:16.380
Yeah, exactly.

17:16.380 --> 17:19.260
Yeah, and I'm like the old war vet going,

17:19.260 --> 17:21.780
I remember how it used to be though.

17:21.780 --> 17:23.540
We're all okay with this now?

17:23.540 --> 17:26.340
It's where the latent distrust of Microsoft is still there

17:26.340 --> 17:29.260
and we have all these wounds deep in our psyches.

17:29.260 --> 17:31.740
And it's just kind of bringing some of that up.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.020
So that's the thing is like,

17:35.020 --> 17:38.700
there's a couple of people here running Windows

17:38.700 --> 17:41.100
but they're Azure administrators.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.460
That's what they do, is they write Azure courseware.

17:43.460 --> 17:45.140
And then it makes whatever, then you can be,

17:45.140 --> 17:46.780
there's no judgment on either of the sides.

17:46.780 --> 17:47.820
I don't mind if you use Windows,

17:47.820 --> 17:49.980
if that is what helped you get your job done

17:49.980 --> 17:51.860
and you don't care if I use Linux to get my job done

17:51.860 --> 17:54.260
and we can all be happy and everyone gets stuff done.

17:54.260 --> 17:56.660
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty cool.

17:56.660 --> 18:00.460
It's pretty neat and I'm really glad

18:00.460 --> 18:01.620
I stuck around a little bit longer

18:01.620 --> 18:04.700
even though the heat is, it is now a heat death.

18:04.700 --> 18:07.740
It is a massive, massive heat death right now.

18:07.740 --> 18:09.900
So in fact, this, I'll move on,

18:09.900 --> 18:11.580
but just something I've never witnessed before,

18:11.580 --> 18:15.380
but grasshoppers like get paralyzed by the heat down here.

18:15.380 --> 18:18.300
So they, when you walk around the sidewalks in some places,

18:18.300 --> 18:20.020
there's grasshoppers everywhere.

18:20.020 --> 18:21.620
Like you're crunching them as you're walking around

18:21.620 --> 18:23.820
because they jump out of the bushes

18:23.820 --> 18:26.860
and they land on the cement and then they paralyzed.

18:26.860 --> 18:28.140
Oh, it's so hot.

18:28.140 --> 18:31.460
And so you have these grasshoppers all over the ground

18:31.460 --> 18:34.860
in some areas all day long until the evening

18:34.860 --> 18:37.340
when the sun sets and the ground starts to cool

18:37.340 --> 18:38.900
and then they come back to life

18:38.900 --> 18:42.260
and they hop back in the bushes and it's super gross.

18:42.260 --> 18:44.780
Oh, that sounds like a really useful trait.

18:44.780 --> 18:46.340
Yeah, it's great for harvesting

18:46.340 --> 18:48.540
if you wanna cook some grasshoppers.

18:49.740 --> 18:51.740
Just go get some sun-dried grasshoppers.

18:52.660 --> 18:54.020
All right, well, let's talk about Linux.

18:54.020 --> 18:55.660
I just wanted to update you guys

18:55.660 --> 18:58.740
and while I'm still down here roasting my balls,

18:58.740 --> 19:01.300
but it's been a really good eye-opening experience

19:01.300 --> 19:05.180
to just spend some time around a largish,

19:05.180 --> 19:08.340
or to me, 100 plus organizations getting there.

19:08.340 --> 19:10.340
It's obviously not a big, it's still a small business,

19:10.340 --> 19:13.340
but it's been really kind of a good experience

19:13.340 --> 19:15.740
to just be around a whole bunch of Linux users

19:15.740 --> 19:17.100
for an extended period of time

19:17.100 --> 19:20.700
and where it's not like, oh, we're fighting a good fight.

19:20.700 --> 19:22.940
It's just, this is life, this is how we do our work

19:22.940 --> 19:24.940
and it's not even a big deal.

19:24.940 --> 19:26.020
Let's talk about Fedora though

19:26.020 --> 19:27.300
because speaking of Fedora,

19:27.300 --> 19:29.460
that seems to be one of the more popular ones around here.

19:29.460 --> 19:34.340
Fedora 29 isn't eliminating Yum as we reported recently.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.180
It looks like it was up for debate

19:36.180 --> 19:39.100
and at Fedora's engineering and steering committee meeting,

19:39.100 --> 19:41.940
the plan to drop Yum for Fedora 29 was rejected

19:41.940 --> 19:43.980
when the council realized it was still shipping in RHEL.

19:43.980 --> 19:44.820
No, I'm kidding.

19:44.820 --> 19:46.820
When they realized that it was connected

19:46.820 --> 19:49.120
to a bunch of other components in the infrastructure

19:49.120 --> 19:51.620
that would cause major logistic issues

19:51.620 --> 19:52.540
if they wanted to pull it out.

19:52.540 --> 19:56.500
So if when I said recently that Fedora was losing Yum

19:56.500 --> 19:59.420
and you panicked, well, now don't you feel silly.

19:59.420 --> 20:01.820
Because I was just wrong and they hadn't decided yet

20:01.820 --> 20:02.860
and now they have decided.

20:02.860 --> 20:03.860
I did panic.

20:03.860 --> 20:05.780
I just, sometimes I get a little worked up,

20:05.780 --> 20:08.140
especially on these Tuesdays that are so intense

20:08.140 --> 20:09.340
with all the Linux news.

20:09.340 --> 20:10.180
I know.

20:10.180 --> 20:12.460
But I think actually it's a pretty mature choice,

20:12.460 --> 20:13.500
especially, I don't know,

20:13.500 --> 20:16.100
I certainly do get that itch for spring cleaning

20:16.100 --> 20:18.020
and I don't want any extra binaries floating around,

20:18.020 --> 20:19.420
but in the world of open source

20:19.420 --> 20:21.020
where you really wanna make things compatible

20:21.020 --> 20:22.980
and you want things that worked on Fedora 27

20:22.980 --> 20:25.180
to work on Fedora 28 and you want it to work on 29

20:25.180 --> 20:28.120
and 30 and 31, just keeping these things around

20:28.120 --> 20:29.700
for a little longer than feels necessary,

20:29.700 --> 20:33.060
sometimes can make a good subset of users' lives

20:33.060 --> 20:35.160
that much easier and it's probably worth it

20:35.160 --> 20:37.900
for one megabyte of disk space.

20:37.900 --> 20:41.320
Yeah, these seem to be fitting in line

20:41.320 --> 20:43.780
with a series of decisions that I feel like

20:43.780 --> 20:45.720
I've witnessed the Fedora project make recently

20:45.720 --> 20:48.660
that conservative is the wrong label,

20:48.660 --> 20:50.540
but it's not as breakneck pace

20:50.540 --> 20:52.060
as it once was in some regards.

20:52.060 --> 20:54.880
Like they're still hall and button innovating,

20:54.880 --> 20:59.420
but there was a time where they would ship stuff

20:59.420 --> 21:03.300
just way early as almost like a point of pride.

21:03.300 --> 21:06.340
And it seems like they've sort of dialed it back a bit

21:06.340 --> 21:07.660
where they're trying to find a balance there

21:07.660 --> 21:09.980
where people can get a little more predictability

21:09.980 --> 21:12.580
and experience like a little bit more,

21:12.580 --> 21:14.200
I don't know, is consistency the word

21:14.200 --> 21:15.540
I'm looking here for, Wes?

21:15.540 --> 21:17.660
Yeah, I mean, it seems like there's a little more intent.

21:17.660 --> 21:21.620
It's no longer just the sort of bleeding edge proving ground

21:21.620 --> 21:24.260
for things that might make it into RHEL later,

21:24.260 --> 21:27.140
it is actually sort of shipped and marketed

21:27.140 --> 21:30.380
as something that an end user could and should use.

21:30.380 --> 21:33.000
I mean, you still have to be the right end user,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.500
but that doesn't mean that you grab some,

21:34.500 --> 21:36.460
like it's not like getting a random snapshot of Arch

21:36.460 --> 21:39.080
and just hoping things are all working nicely together.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.420
There's actually been a lot of intent

21:40.420 --> 21:41.660
and design put into it.

21:41.660 --> 21:44.020
Yeah, speaking of a lot of intent and design,

21:44.020 --> 21:47.340
Mir, yeah, Canonical's Mir, still kicking,

21:47.340 --> 21:52.180
still rocking with version 0.321 coming out recently,

21:52.180 --> 21:53.760
and it's looking really good.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.820
Think of it as an abstraction layer,

21:55.820 --> 21:58.940
and it's more than just a Wayland client now,

21:58.940 --> 22:01.380
but of course, they've been rewriting it,

22:01.380 --> 22:05.020
I suppose you could say, in a way, for Wayland support,

22:05.020 --> 22:09.420
and the Mir AL shell, which has reinstated the spinner

22:09.420 --> 22:10.660
when you're starting the Wayland shell,

22:10.660 --> 22:13.300
so now you'll have somewhat of a status indicator

22:13.300 --> 22:14.620
when the shell's launching,

22:14.620 --> 22:19.100
and the developers are working on support for XDG shell,

22:19.100 --> 22:20.920
as well as supporting the Wayland extensions

22:20.920 --> 22:22.980
and other upcoming work.

22:22.980 --> 22:26.300
So this was, oh, I thought, okay, that's kind of interesting.

22:26.300 --> 22:28.340
It was like following a trail,

22:28.340 --> 22:30.100
so then after I read that, I thought, well,

22:30.100 --> 22:33.660
what is Canonical really envisioning the use of Mir?

22:33.660 --> 22:35.020
Like, really?

22:35.020 --> 22:40.020
Like, why are they actually spending real money?

22:40.180 --> 22:42.500
Well, it's funny money,

22:42.500 --> 22:46.160
but I mean, their version of real money on Mir.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.860
Like, what's the, why, and the individual,

22:48.860 --> 22:50.800
at least that I have met, and there's probably more than one,

22:50.800 --> 22:53.060
but the individual I've met that's working on Mir

22:53.060 --> 22:55.440
has gotta be one of the more talented developers

22:55.440 --> 22:56.360
I've ever met.

22:56.360 --> 22:59.860
So it's like real money they're probably spending.

22:59.860 --> 23:01.460
At least I hope he's getting real money.

23:01.460 --> 23:04.440
And it's an implementation of something

23:04.440 --> 23:06.420
that we are starting to see other solutions for,

23:06.420 --> 23:08.780
especially when it comes to stuff sitting on top of Wayland.

23:08.780 --> 23:11.380
So I really was trying to grok where it fit in.

23:11.380 --> 23:13.620
And it appears that the Mir graphical stack

23:13.620 --> 23:15.500
is really being positioned down the road

23:15.500 --> 23:17.500
for IoT devices by Canonical.

23:17.500 --> 23:19.660
They say, when we first conceived of it six years ago

23:19.660 --> 23:22.380
as part of an initiative to unify the graphical environments

23:22.380 --> 23:24.860
across desktops, TV, and mobile devices,

23:24.860 --> 23:27.140
we continue to move it forward into modern standards

23:27.140 --> 23:28.740
like the Wayland protocol.

23:28.740 --> 23:32.260
The thing is, is Mir is designed with low memory

23:32.260 --> 23:35.740
and disk space and CPU usage baked in.

23:35.740 --> 23:39.020
So memory and disk space is much lower than other solutions,

23:39.020 --> 23:42.020
and they've also tried to build it with security in mind.

23:42.020 --> 23:45.140
If you, for example, were setting up an Ubuntu Core

23:45.140 --> 23:48.360
distro, Mir, and a small LCD display server

23:48.360 --> 23:51.060
with a low-cost sensor and a Raspberry Pi 3,

23:51.060 --> 23:54.500
the next thing you know, you have a 24-7 monitoring solution

23:54.500 --> 23:58.100
which could graph information with Mir and Ubuntu

23:58.100 --> 23:59.260
at the core.

23:59.260 --> 24:01.980
And I thought to myself, I said, self?

24:01.980 --> 24:04.580
That sounds like a very specific example

24:04.580 --> 24:05.980
that they just gave there.

24:05.980 --> 24:08.460
Why that specific example?

24:08.460 --> 24:10.060
So Jamie is the author.

24:10.060 --> 24:12.220
He's a developer over at Canonical

24:12.220 --> 24:14.100
and is involved in their IoT efforts.

24:14.100 --> 24:15.740
So I started digging around a little bit.

24:15.740 --> 24:17.460
I saw he has a blog post, which I'll

24:17.460 --> 24:20.360
have a link in the show notes, about setting up

24:20.360 --> 24:25.100
an Ubuntu-powered greenhouse monitoring system on his home.

24:25.100 --> 24:27.780
In one of my favorite areas in the UK,

24:27.780 --> 24:29.740
it's a town or an area, I don't know, a village.

24:29.740 --> 24:32.060
I don't know what you guys call them over there, called Bath.

24:32.060 --> 24:32.800
It's a city.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.060
It's a city, OK.

24:34.060 --> 24:35.440
Bath.

24:35.440 --> 24:35.940
I love it.

24:35.940 --> 24:36.940
That's so awesome.

24:36.940 --> 24:39.000
It's so awesome.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.140
And over in Bath, he's got a greenhouse.

24:41.140 --> 24:42.980
And he's been looking at different solutions

24:42.980 --> 24:45.760
on the market to monitor his greenhouse.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.860
And so many of them are consumer products.

24:47.860 --> 24:50.340
They only work with iOS or Android.

24:50.340 --> 24:52.540
They don't really let you get to the data.

24:52.540 --> 24:53.060
You know what?

24:53.060 --> 24:54.620
You and I have talked about this quite a bit,

24:54.620 --> 24:56.960
sort of off-air more, but like sensor data and things

24:56.960 --> 24:58.340
like that that I've wanted to track.

24:58.340 --> 24:59.380
Yeah, very much so.

24:59.380 --> 25:01.860
And he was looking at some different solutions.

25:01.860 --> 25:04.420
He came across, by the way, his greenhouse

25:04.420 --> 25:06.620
is a pretty cool little greenhouse.

25:06.620 --> 25:07.860
He says that he's cooking, or he's

25:07.860 --> 25:10.360
cooking, growing in their chilies, tomatoes, cucumbers,

25:10.360 --> 25:12.220
strawberries, probably cannabis.

25:12.220 --> 25:13.080
Although he doesn't say that.

25:13.080 --> 25:13.740
I'm just assuming.

25:13.740 --> 25:15.100
Lemons and things like that.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.340
The UK exports more cannabis than any other country.

25:17.340 --> 25:18.300
Just saying.

25:18.300 --> 25:19.460
No way.

25:19.460 --> 25:20.500
Is that true?

25:20.500 --> 25:21.780
Yeah, apparently so.

25:21.780 --> 25:23.060
You guys.

25:23.060 --> 25:26.020
And also, our minister for drug controls, husband,

25:26.020 --> 25:29.300
also works for the largest medical cannabis company

25:29.300 --> 25:32.140
in the world, apparently, or something like that.

25:32.140 --> 25:32.660
Jeez.

25:32.660 --> 25:34.340
You stoners, you.

25:34.340 --> 25:35.340
Yeah, really.

25:35.340 --> 25:38.460
Gosh, get to work, you slackers.

25:38.460 --> 25:43.140
So after a bit of research, Jamie came across the YaoMei

25:43.140 --> 25:47.100
temperature sensor, which does temperature and humidity

25:47.100 --> 25:49.620
for like nine funny dollars.

25:49.620 --> 25:51.780
And you just get it from a Chinese reseller.

25:51.780 --> 25:54.420
The sensor itself is small, ZigBee based.

25:54.420 --> 25:57.380
It's powered by just a little cell watch battery kind

25:57.380 --> 25:58.660
of thing.

25:58.660 --> 26:01.180
And it has a range of negative 20 to 60 Celsius,

26:01.180 --> 26:03.140
as well as bringing in the humidity.

26:03.140 --> 26:05.380
And he can get access to it.

26:05.380 --> 26:10.340
Now, YaoMei, they provide an Android and iOS application.

26:10.340 --> 26:13.240
But he wanted something where he could get the data elsewhere.

26:13.240 --> 26:14.900
So his initial idea was to put together

26:14.900 --> 26:18.060
a small, dedicated, low-powered device, like a Raspberry Pi 3,

26:18.060 --> 26:19.540
running Ubuntu MATE.

26:19.540 --> 26:21.220
Ah, that's awesome.

26:21.220 --> 26:22.260
Set up SSH.

26:22.260 --> 26:22.860
Ding.

26:22.860 --> 26:24.780
Boy, we're hitting all of the points today.

26:24.780 --> 26:27.260
And then from there, he had a fresh Ubuntu environment.

26:27.260 --> 26:32.140
He also installed a MQTT messaging system

26:32.140 --> 26:36.700
in the form of Mosquito, which is an open source,

26:36.700 --> 26:39.180
I guess, message gateway would be the way to put that,

26:39.180 --> 26:41.180
where you can send messages between applications.

26:41.180 --> 26:44.740
Not like text messages, like data messages.

26:44.740 --> 26:46.500
He also loaded some Python on there,

26:46.500 --> 26:50.260
and Wes's favorite, Grafina, to visualize the whole thing

26:50.260 --> 26:52.860
into some beautiful charts, which is pretty cool.

26:52.860 --> 26:55.360
I know when you see the charts, you're really like, oh, yeah,

26:55.360 --> 26:56.740
this was all totally worth it.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.040
Just like looking at the temperature

26:58.040 --> 26:59.620
in the greenhouse over multiple days,

26:59.620 --> 27:02.900
as you can see the cycles of the sun, it's just so cool.

27:02.900 --> 27:03.620
Yeah.

27:03.620 --> 27:05.460
Yeah, and the weather's been hot over there recently, too.

27:05.460 --> 27:07.460
So it's actually been pretty great to have this.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.660
So he puts all of that into an InfluxDB,

27:09.660 --> 27:11.340
and then Grafina looks at that.

27:11.340 --> 27:13.340
He generates two charts, one for the temperature

27:13.340 --> 27:14.580
and one for the humidity.

27:14.580 --> 27:16.080
And he points out that then you could

27:16.080 --> 27:18.540
put Mir in kiosk mode with a nice little display

27:18.540 --> 27:20.780
on there, a little small LCD cheapo,

27:20.780 --> 27:25.560
and have it visualizing 24-7 in real time a view of the data.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.900
And you can do all of this on small ARM devices

27:27.900 --> 27:32.380
with Ubuntu Core, and then using Mir to generate the displays.

27:32.380 --> 27:34.500
Grafina, which is another open source project.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.340
It's pretty nice how you can build all this.

27:36.340 --> 27:38.020
It should all scale pretty well.

27:38.020 --> 27:40.100
You invest a little bit of money in the sensors,

27:40.100 --> 27:41.380
a little bit of money in the pie.

27:41.380 --> 27:43.880
If you're like me, you probably have pies just floating around

27:43.880 --> 27:45.820
that you haven't yet found a use for anyway.

27:45.820 --> 27:46.940
So you need to stick it out there.

27:46.940 --> 27:48.660
And then as you go, if you want more sensors,

27:48.660 --> 27:50.380
you find more sensors to buy, you add them on there.

27:50.380 --> 27:52.420
They can all just send data to the same back end

27:52.420 --> 27:53.660
you already have.

27:53.660 --> 27:55.980
So boy, this is a fun project.

27:55.980 --> 27:57.860
Poby, before we move off of the Mir topic,

27:57.860 --> 28:00.620
is there anything we're missing about this subject

28:00.620 --> 28:02.100
that you've heard in the hallways,

28:02.100 --> 28:05.740
the virtual hallways of Canonical about Mir?

28:05.740 --> 28:07.420
No, you've got it about right there.

28:07.420 --> 28:10.140
I personally have it running on a laptop here.

28:10.140 --> 28:12.140
I've got an Ubuntu Core laptop.

28:12.140 --> 28:16.020
So it's only Ubuntu Core, like super minimal install

28:16.020 --> 28:17.180
with a bunch of snaps on top.

28:17.180 --> 28:20.140
And I've got the Mir kiosk on top

28:20.140 --> 28:23.500
to test out delivering graphical applications

28:23.500 --> 28:26.060
as snaps for Ubuntu Core, which should be fun.

28:26.060 --> 28:28.020
But that's something we're just playing with.

28:28.020 --> 28:29.500
Have you looked at what the total install

28:29.500 --> 28:30.660
size of that setup is?

28:30.660 --> 28:33.100
It's got to be not much.

28:33.100 --> 28:34.620
Yeah, it's not a lot.

28:34.620 --> 28:36.420
It's not much at all.

28:36.420 --> 28:37.740
That's neat.

28:37.740 --> 28:38.260
Well, cool.

28:38.260 --> 28:40.620
And I'm glad to see that Mir's chugging along.

28:40.620 --> 28:43.140
It sounds like it may be just digging itself out

28:43.140 --> 28:44.980
a little niche that it could serve quite well.

28:44.980 --> 28:46.620
So I'll keep tabs on that.

28:46.620 --> 28:48.460
Let's move up the stack a bit.

28:48.460 --> 28:51.020
And let's talk about Mutter.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.380
Big, big performance improvements

28:53.380 --> 28:54.900
coming to Mutter because it's going

28:54.900 --> 28:57.300
to be doing a lot less math.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.620
This is going to be landing if all things go as planned

28:59.620 --> 29:01.780
in GNOME 3.3.0.

29:01.780 --> 29:04.740
And it looks like, aside also from just other little things

29:04.740 --> 29:08.460
like, I don't know, dependencies on X11,

29:08.460 --> 29:11.140
there's going to be performance optimizations.

29:11.140 --> 29:14.860
A GitLab request was merged about reusing paint volumes.

29:14.860 --> 29:17.700
Now, that sounds like a simple thing.

29:17.700 --> 29:20.900
But it cuts down approximately all paint volume calculations,

29:20.900 --> 29:23.580
all of them, any time it has to redraw a window.

29:23.580 --> 29:26.100
And particularly, there is massive improvements

29:26.100 --> 29:29.020
if there's a window for some reason that needs to be redrawn

29:29.020 --> 29:30.220
but hasn't moved.

29:30.220 --> 29:34.100
In the past, essentially, Mutter would do all of the math

29:34.100 --> 29:37.420
and repaint that entire thing and recalculate all of it

29:37.420 --> 29:38.420
every time constantly.

29:38.420 --> 29:39.940
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.780
It's that way faster than that.

29:42.780 --> 29:46.060
And this, instead, essentially will just

29:46.060 --> 29:49.380
keep a cheat sheet of the math answer

29:49.380 --> 29:51.420
and just keep referring to that until it

29:51.420 --> 29:54.980
has a reason to change things and redraw,

29:54.980 --> 29:56.940
like the window's been moved.

29:56.940 --> 30:00.420
That could be a big improvement for Gnome.

30:00.420 --> 30:03.180
And I think I've witnessed this issue, perhaps,

30:03.180 --> 30:06.660
although it could be way wrong with my terminal window.

30:06.660 --> 30:11.540
So if you've been a Gnome user and all of this Plasma talk

30:11.540 --> 30:13.980
has really been kind of tempting you,

30:13.980 --> 30:15.740
maybe don't disrupt the whole workflow yet.

30:15.740 --> 30:20.020
Maybe stick it out for Gnome 3.30.

30:20.020 --> 30:21.860
Maybe, although things are getting

30:21.860 --> 30:23.500
good on the Plasma side, too.

30:23.500 --> 30:25.140
I was just talking to Wes on the pre-show

30:25.140 --> 30:29.020
about how we're still kind of like going back and forth

30:29.020 --> 30:30.260
on just the perfect laptop.

30:30.260 --> 30:34.340
And Alex in the Mumble Room has been sort of convincing me

30:34.340 --> 30:37.900
that perhaps a Lenovo T480 would be the way to go.

30:37.900 --> 30:41.460
14-inch, 2K display.

30:41.460 --> 30:44.180
And it's got an i7 four-core processor.

30:44.180 --> 30:46.420
It's got Thunderbolt 3.

30:46.420 --> 30:49.020
It's got a 512 megabyte MVD drive.

30:49.020 --> 30:50.060
It's $2,000.

30:50.060 --> 30:52.140
Now, that sounds like a lot of money,

30:52.140 --> 30:54.820
but this is a machine to do live media production.

30:54.820 --> 30:59.340
And it's cheaper than an equivalently priced MacBook.

30:59.340 --> 31:00.300
It's really tempting.

31:00.300 --> 31:01.880
And when I think about that, the reason

31:01.880 --> 31:05.620
why I bring all that up is when I think about when I get

31:05.620 --> 31:08.980
a new piece of hardware, I really, really, really

31:08.980 --> 31:11.340
can start to understand why some people do these super

31:11.340 --> 31:12.460
minimal desktops.

31:12.460 --> 31:17.220
Because the idea that the fact that Mudder is sitting there

31:17.220 --> 31:20.100
redoing this math every time it has to repaint a window

31:20.100 --> 31:24.100
from scratch every single time is disappointing.

31:24.100 --> 31:26.220
It was really, really disappointing.

31:26.220 --> 31:29.100
It sort of makes me think like I'm

31:29.100 --> 31:30.620
wasting some of that horsepower.

31:30.620 --> 31:34.740
I'm wasting my money when I try to get something that powerful.

31:34.740 --> 31:39.260
So I say all that with I really, I can really kind of,

31:39.260 --> 31:41.500
even though I'm never going to be like an awesome window

31:41.500 --> 31:45.780
manager guy or an ex-monad, I can completely appreciate

31:45.780 --> 31:47.340
some of the logic behind it.

31:47.340 --> 31:50.100
I thought you were just running OBS straight on top of X11

31:50.100 --> 31:50.900
these days.

31:50.900 --> 31:53.140
You know, that's what I should be doing.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.740
That's what I should be doing, shouldn't I?

31:54.740 --> 31:55.700
It takes all the things.

31:55.700 --> 31:58.060
Yeah, it did.

31:58.060 --> 32:01.100
Oh, I have in the day.

32:01.100 --> 32:04.540
We also have ourselves GTK 4 coming in the spring of 2019,

32:04.540 --> 32:05.700
it looks like at this point.

32:05.700 --> 32:09.220
Of course, all of that is possibly to change.

32:09.220 --> 32:12.060
And we're going to be getting, just as a reminder,

32:12.060 --> 32:16.900
GTK Plus 3.24, which is a minor feature update, very soon.

32:16.900 --> 32:19.060
It looks like there will be some things we are hoping

32:19.060 --> 32:20.860
for that won't land in GTK 4.

32:20.860 --> 32:23.340
They're going to be postponed until GTK 5,

32:23.340 --> 32:25.420
like constraint-based layout support,

32:25.420 --> 32:28.140
shader compilers, application-provided shader

32:28.140 --> 32:30.940
support, and the UI designer support.

32:30.940 --> 32:34.420
It also looks like GTK 4, with the Mac OS Quartz back end,

32:34.420 --> 32:36.500
is in a pretty bad state.

32:36.500 --> 32:38.380
But they think that they can probably get it cleaned up

32:38.380 --> 32:38.980
soon.

32:38.980 --> 32:40.100
So there you go.

32:40.100 --> 32:42.060
How's that for a little gnome corner?

32:42.060 --> 32:42.940
Little gnome corner.

32:42.940 --> 32:43.500
Look at you.

32:43.500 --> 32:46.820
I mean, we all know that you're secretly forever plasma biased,

32:46.820 --> 32:48.860
but you're really doing a good job of pretending

32:48.860 --> 32:50.300
that you're not.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.260
But plasma's really good, though, Wes.

32:52.260 --> 32:53.940
Come on.

32:53.940 --> 32:55.380
That's true.

32:55.380 --> 32:57.380
We've got to turn the show into The Plasma Hour

32:57.380 --> 32:59.380
at this rate.

32:59.380 --> 33:00.460
Hey, that's a cool title.

33:00.460 --> 33:00.820
Hold on.

33:00.820 --> 33:01.300
Hold on.

33:01.300 --> 33:01.980
I know, right?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.620
Yeah, go ahead and suggest that.

33:03.620 --> 33:06.140
Our next story is really probably,

33:06.140 --> 33:08.580
I should just defer to Poby, because he

33:08.580 --> 33:10.700
is an expert on all things Bitcoin and blockchain.

33:10.700 --> 33:13.020
And he is our resident expert.

33:13.020 --> 33:13.940
So I don't know.

33:13.940 --> 33:15.740
I'm sure you're probably aware of this,

33:15.740 --> 33:17.440
but there is a very fancy phone.

33:17.440 --> 33:19.340
I think you pronounce it SerenLabs.

33:19.340 --> 33:21.340
They're the folks, you may have heard it.

33:21.340 --> 33:25.300
They once had this celebrity phone that was $16,000.

33:25.300 --> 33:27.860
They call it the world's most secure phone.

33:27.860 --> 33:29.980
And they're out with their next product.

33:29.980 --> 33:31.340
They call it the Finney.

33:31.340 --> 33:34.620
And this time, it's only $1,000.

33:34.620 --> 33:37.180
And it's got blockchain built in.

33:37.180 --> 33:39.460
It costs much less than that $16,000 too,

33:39.460 --> 33:41.700
so it's already a great deal.

33:41.700 --> 33:43.500
And it's got the world's best security.

33:43.500 --> 33:44.740
Just ask them.

33:44.740 --> 33:47.540
They've included phrases like decentralized economy

33:47.540 --> 33:51.740
in the advertising, decentralized apps, clouds,

33:51.740 --> 33:56.060
or I'm sorry, cold storage wallets,

33:56.060 --> 33:59.700
and a decentralized app store, as well as

33:59.700 --> 34:01.620
their own cryptocurrency.

34:01.620 --> 34:03.500
And that's right, it doesn't use Bitcoin,

34:03.500 --> 34:06.500
doesn't use any actual established cryptocurrency.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.380
It uses their own tokens.

34:08.380 --> 34:12.500
And then users can trade tokens on their own blockchain.

34:12.500 --> 34:16.500
It has a dedicated firmware for verifying wallet transactions.

34:16.500 --> 34:19.860
It has supposedly intrusion protection.

34:19.860 --> 34:23.180
It has a decent Qualcomm chip with six gigs of RAM

34:23.180 --> 34:24.380
and 120 gigs of storage.

34:24.380 --> 34:28.020
But the most interesting thing about this blockchain powered

34:28.020 --> 34:31.620
phone is it has a secondary two inch display, which

34:31.620 --> 34:35.340
slides up from the body of the phone,

34:35.340 --> 34:38.380
like some of those new cameras we've seen on a few phones,

34:38.380 --> 34:40.260
that is your wallet display.

34:40.260 --> 34:42.220
So you can check your balances in your wallet

34:42.220 --> 34:43.980
without having to wake up your entire phone.

34:43.980 --> 34:46.300
Oh my, wow.

34:46.300 --> 34:48.140
Maybe it's just an extra heat sink

34:48.140 --> 34:50.340
when it does all the crypto mining in the background

34:50.340 --> 34:50.860
for you.

34:50.860 --> 34:52.300
It's definitely an extra heater.

34:52.300 --> 34:53.860
That little screen probably, I could just

34:53.860 --> 34:56.300
see it sliding down and failing to turn off and warming up

34:56.300 --> 34:58.860
the back of your phone, which warms your battery

34:58.860 --> 34:59.980
and decreases battery life.

34:59.980 --> 35:01.180
It's a brilliant idea.

35:01.180 --> 35:04.180
You also didn't mention that it has a notch every once.

35:04.180 --> 35:05.980
So don't worry, the notch is there.

35:05.980 --> 35:06.620
Yes, it does.

35:06.620 --> 35:07.540
I somehow missed that.

35:07.540 --> 35:08.820
I must have blacked that out.

35:08.820 --> 35:11.740
So HTC might be the ones to pull this off then.

35:11.740 --> 35:13.460
So they're coming out with the Exodus.

35:13.460 --> 35:16.140
And no, it's not an Exodus of HTC's customer base.

35:16.140 --> 35:18.260
It's the name of their next smartphone.

35:18.260 --> 35:21.860
And they really, really need this thing to pay off.

35:21.860 --> 35:23.460
They announced it back in May.

35:23.460 --> 35:25.780
And I kind of made a little murmur about it.

35:25.780 --> 35:29.140
But now, this week, we've got some details.

35:29.140 --> 35:33.180
And it's not looking good, in my opinion.

35:33.180 --> 35:35.900
It appears we can expect their blockchain-powered phone

35:35.900 --> 35:38.380
from HTC at the end of this year.

35:38.380 --> 35:41.620
And the price, although they wouldn't commit,

35:41.620 --> 35:44.460
will probably be around $1,000 for this, too.

35:44.460 --> 35:47.260
They envision a phone where you hold your own keys,

35:47.260 --> 35:48.860
your own identity and data.

35:48.860 --> 35:50.940
Your phone is the hub.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.740
That was what they said back in May.

35:52.740 --> 35:55.340
But now, they're kind of walking that back a little bit,

35:55.340 --> 35:57.940
that whole stuff about your identity and keys.

35:57.940 --> 36:01.220
That's not so much in the first model.

36:01.220 --> 36:04.060
But the first model will have a wallet.

36:04.060 --> 36:08.540
And it'll come with CryptoKitties, a crypto game

36:08.540 --> 36:11.620
where you play with crypto cats on your screen.

36:11.620 --> 36:12.940
Can I ask a question?

36:12.940 --> 36:17.420
What does blockchain-powered actually mean?

36:17.420 --> 36:20.260
Oh, yeah, that's a completely reasonable question, Alex,

36:20.260 --> 36:22.300
and one that you would think that they

36:22.300 --> 36:23.880
would have a very solid answer to,

36:23.880 --> 36:26.860
since they're basing the entire messaging around that.

36:26.860 --> 36:29.940
Well, you see, it's going to have a cryptocurrency wallet

36:29.940 --> 36:33.020
that will, quote, be the most secure hardware

36:33.020 --> 36:34.460
wallet out there.

36:34.460 --> 36:37.700
He also hopes that by trading virtual cats,

36:37.700 --> 36:39.660
it'll encourage gamers and people

36:39.660 --> 36:42.100
who are less familiar with cryptocurrency

36:42.100 --> 36:43.300
to try out the phone.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.460
They think it's going to be the most approachable thing

36:45.460 --> 36:47.940
on mobile for the non-crypto crowd,

36:47.940 --> 36:50.020
even though the crypto crowd is the only people that

36:50.020 --> 36:52.340
ever be interested in buying this.

36:52.340 --> 36:56.220
So they don't really talk about how it's a blockchain phone,

36:56.220 --> 36:58.860
other than it can have a wallet on it.

36:58.860 --> 37:01.980
They wanted it to be like the storage of your driver's

37:01.980 --> 37:04.340
license or whatever, like whatever identity information

37:04.340 --> 37:05.500
you'd have.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.000
But of course, that would take wide-ranging government

37:08.000 --> 37:10.700
support, and nobody's going to do that for HTC.

37:10.700 --> 37:13.100
I'll tell you what blockchain-powered means.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.740
It means we go high up in the Google search results.

37:15.740 --> 37:18.660
That's what it means.

37:18.660 --> 37:20.660
This is so sad.

37:20.660 --> 37:22.780
This is really sad to see this happening.

37:22.780 --> 37:23.720
And there's a trend.

37:23.720 --> 37:26.100
A lot of companies are just relaunching and just

37:26.100 --> 37:27.660
putting blockchain in the name.

37:27.660 --> 37:29.340
And like Kodak did that.

37:29.340 --> 37:31.920
Obviously, now Kodak's pulling back on their plans.

37:31.920 --> 37:33.420
That's kind of one of the famous ones.

37:33.420 --> 37:35.620
And just today, I saw a news story

37:35.620 --> 37:37.580
go by saying that Kodak's basically

37:37.580 --> 37:39.660
screwing the pooch on that.

37:39.660 --> 37:42.140
So here's their idea.

37:42.140 --> 37:43.780
It's a conflicted message.

37:43.780 --> 37:48.260
HTC hopes to build an Android phone with all of this Bitcoin

37:48.260 --> 37:50.020
wallet stuff baked in.

37:50.020 --> 37:51.820
But of course, I would fundamentally argue

37:51.820 --> 37:54.900
that if you're shipping Android, especially with the Google

37:54.900 --> 37:58.940
apps pre-installed, that automatically disqualifies it

37:58.940 --> 38:01.220
as the world's most secure hardware wallet,

38:01.220 --> 38:02.820
automatically, especially when it

38:02.820 --> 38:09.020
has a hardware wallet with an always-on cellular modem that

38:09.020 --> 38:13.380
runs a firmware that we have no control, no insights, no even

38:13.380 --> 38:16.020
insights into what it's doing at all, not even,

38:16.020 --> 38:16.940
let alone source code.

38:16.940 --> 38:20.700
Just you're not even aware of what it's doing at any point.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.780
That, by its very definition, makes

38:22.780 --> 38:25.340
this an insecure hardware wallet.

38:25.340 --> 38:26.260
So they're blowing it.

38:26.260 --> 38:27.920
They're blowing the very premise.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.500
And then they have this mixed message.

38:29.500 --> 38:32.100
Like Chen here says that they think

38:32.100 --> 38:35.720
that the niche market of 30 million Bitcoin wallet users

38:35.720 --> 38:37.180
is their demo.

38:37.180 --> 38:39.740
But then early on, he says, but we're

38:39.740 --> 38:41.340
bundling CryptoKitties because we're

38:41.340 --> 38:44.940
hoping to convince gamers to try out a Bitcoin blockchain

38:44.940 --> 38:46.700
wallet phone.

38:46.700 --> 38:47.900
So are they targeting gamers?

38:47.900 --> 38:49.840
Or are they targeting Bitcoin users?

38:49.840 --> 38:52.420
Because neither group is going to take this thing seriously.

38:52.420 --> 38:54.620
Nobody gives two shits about CryptoKitties.

38:54.620 --> 38:57.420
And no Bitcoin enthusiast is dumb enough

38:57.420 --> 39:01.940
to think that an always-on, Google-connected,

39:01.940 --> 39:05.900
cellular modem-powered hardware wallet is secure.

39:05.900 --> 39:07.780
No Bitcoin enthusiast is going to buy that.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.240
Don't print out your keys anymore

39:09.240 --> 39:10.540
and put them in secure storage.

39:10.540 --> 39:11.580
Just use your phone.

39:11.580 --> 39:12.860
It's fine.

39:12.860 --> 39:16.300
I'd love to think that after the craziness that

39:16.300 --> 39:18.740
was last December, January, that people

39:18.740 --> 39:21.420
have learned their lessons about crypto and blockchain.

39:21.420 --> 39:24.460
And it's not a way to make a quick buck.

39:24.460 --> 39:26.460
But things like this makes me think

39:26.460 --> 39:29.500
that maybe people are more gullible than we

39:29.500 --> 39:30.500
give them credit for.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.340
Yeah, I think also it's just one more way

39:32.340 --> 39:34.620
they can try to get you to buy into their, oh,

39:34.620 --> 39:38.440
use our currency on our chain to buy media from our apps

39:38.440 --> 39:41.100
and purchase things in this weird little private community.

39:41.100 --> 39:41.780
Right, yeah.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.460
Who is the target market?

39:43.460 --> 39:46.180
People with money, that's who.

39:46.180 --> 39:49.620
I'm really, I am such a hypocrite about this topic.

39:49.620 --> 39:54.140
Because I completely agree, creating their own cryptocurrency

39:54.140 --> 39:55.340
feels so cheap.

39:55.340 --> 39:58.100
It feels so basic.

39:58.100 --> 40:01.620
But then at the same time, I'm sitting here thinking to myself,

40:01.620 --> 40:03.940
man, I really wish cryptocurrencies had gotten

40:03.940 --> 40:05.820
more traction in some ways.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.420
I don't mean Bitcoin should be $20,000 a coin.

40:08.420 --> 40:13.300
But I wish there was a healthy, legitimate cryptocurrency

40:13.300 --> 40:14.500
ecosystem.

40:14.500 --> 40:17.980
Because the idea of open source money is a good one.

40:17.980 --> 40:19.140
Well, it's coming.

40:19.140 --> 40:21.020
There are some customers that I'm

40:21.020 --> 40:25.780
aware of that are working on all sorts of blockchain things.

40:25.780 --> 40:31.220
And there was a house sale ledgers in Northeast US

40:31.220 --> 40:33.300
somewhere that someone sold a house

40:33.300 --> 40:35.260
and recorded those house sales on the ledgers.

40:35.260 --> 40:36.380
So they're coming.

40:36.380 --> 40:39.940
But it's just not as crazy as we've all thought.

40:39.940 --> 40:40.940
I agree, it is coming.

40:40.940 --> 40:43.700
And what we're seeing right now is the leg

40:43.700 --> 40:46.380
as businesses build their products and research markets

40:46.380 --> 40:47.140
and stuff like that.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.780
We're just in the leg of that, I think.

40:48.780 --> 40:53.900
But just it'll take time for legitimate, trusting brands

40:53.900 --> 40:56.000
to build products around this technology

40:56.000 --> 40:58.780
and then market in a way that customers will accept.

40:58.780 --> 41:01.000
But where I was going with that is

41:01.000 --> 41:05.140
I think it could have gotten better traction faster and more

41:05.140 --> 41:07.100
usable amongst open source projects.

41:10.100 --> 41:14.500
I really saw there was a potential avenue there

41:14.500 --> 41:16.300
where there could have been a way for,

41:16.300 --> 41:17.700
I mean, this is really dumb.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.700
But just because this is off the top of my head,

41:19.700 --> 41:21.200
so I hadn't really thought this out.

41:21.200 --> 41:26.420
But I imagine if, I don't know, let's just pick Solus.

41:26.420 --> 41:31.180
Let's say Solus had a package in their app center.

41:31.180 --> 41:33.660
And it was the Solus donate package.

41:33.660 --> 41:35.540
And I click that.

41:35.540 --> 41:36.500
And I install it.

41:36.500 --> 41:39.140
And it spends the evening.

41:39.140 --> 41:42.660
And I set it a small, minimal, but approachable

41:42.660 --> 41:44.060
UI where I have a little slider.

41:44.060 --> 41:47.940
And I say, dedicate three hours of CPU time a day to Solus.

41:47.940 --> 41:49.300
And I run it.

41:49.300 --> 41:50.940
And it keeps a little system tray icon.

41:50.940 --> 41:52.180
It lights up when it's going.

41:52.180 --> 41:53.600
It lets me know what's happening.

41:53.600 --> 41:59.660
And maybe back, bake in even some cool stats there, maybe.

41:59.660 --> 42:02.260
So I can see some chart numbers, make a pool,

42:02.260 --> 42:05.500
and have a Solus pool, and have all of the Solus distribution

42:05.500 --> 42:08.220
users who go into the app center and choose to install this,

42:08.220 --> 42:10.260
and choose to dedicate a certain amount of CPU time

42:10.260 --> 42:13.380
to the project, all automatically join a pool,

42:13.380 --> 42:17.900
and have that revenue go towards the project.

42:17.900 --> 42:20.420
It could be a sustainable model that

42:20.420 --> 42:23.180
scales with the distribution as it grows.

42:23.180 --> 42:24.900
And it could be something that they promote.

42:24.900 --> 42:27.020
They say, hey, if you want to support Solus,

42:27.020 --> 42:29.500
install it, and launch that miner for us,

42:29.500 --> 42:30.580
and be completely upfront.

42:30.580 --> 42:34.500
But instead, it has a negative connotation now.

42:34.500 --> 42:36.980
It's seen as more like spyware and malware,

42:36.980 --> 42:38.780
like a browser toolbar.

42:38.780 --> 42:41.100
And I think that was a really missed opportunity,

42:41.100 --> 42:45.660
because it's something that a technical audience would grok.

42:45.660 --> 42:48.260
It's something that one thing that people are experimenting

42:48.260 --> 42:50.540
with is crypto mining in the web browser.

42:50.540 --> 42:53.060
But legitimately, you go to a project's website,

42:53.060 --> 42:54.500
and you press a button.

42:54.500 --> 42:55.900
And you say, donate some time.

42:55.900 --> 42:58.220
And it just runs while you have the browser open.

42:58.220 --> 42:59.620
It's not hidden.

42:59.620 --> 43:02.060
It's not sneaky.

43:02.060 --> 43:03.900
It's a user opt-in thing.

43:03.900 --> 43:06.100
And then all of a sudden, you're donating something

43:06.100 --> 43:07.020
to the project.

43:07.020 --> 43:09.260
I really don't feel like it's any different than people

43:09.260 --> 43:10.980
who seed torrents for weeks at a time,

43:10.980 --> 43:13.780
and donate gigs and gigs of bandwidth to projects

43:13.780 --> 43:14.660
by seeding torrents.

43:14.660 --> 43:19.500
Or they mirror infrastructure, and set up FTP mirrors,

43:19.500 --> 43:21.320
and donate their server bandwidth.

43:21.320 --> 43:23.100
I see it as a similar thing.

43:23.100 --> 43:25.820
But it could have been that.

43:25.820 --> 43:29.020
But instead, it's turning like this negative association.

43:29.020 --> 43:30.380
Am I crazy, Wes?

43:30.380 --> 43:34.180
No, I mean, it seems like another symptom of all the hype

43:34.180 --> 43:36.500
before things are very useful.

43:36.500 --> 43:39.300
Because I think this discussion has been pretty spot on.

43:39.300 --> 43:40.500
It's not there yet.

43:40.500 --> 43:41.980
We've seen a lot of false claims.

43:41.980 --> 43:43.700
But the technology itself is interesting,

43:43.700 --> 43:45.620
and certainly does have some use cases,

43:45.620 --> 43:47.900
and will probably lead to some exciting things in the future.

43:47.900 --> 43:48.980
But everyone's just soured.

43:48.980 --> 43:50.360
Everyone's burnt out on like, I've

43:50.360 --> 43:54.020
been overly hyped, I've had all of these web pages trying

43:54.020 --> 43:55.220
to steal my CPU time.

43:55.220 --> 43:57.260
I just don't want to have anything to do with it.

43:57.260 --> 44:01.380
And I think it's a long, slow march of showing real deliverables

44:01.380 --> 44:04.340
before people's attitudes start to turn around again.

44:04.340 --> 44:05.540
Maybe it will over time.

44:05.540 --> 44:07.300
A lot of people lost a lot of money.

44:07.300 --> 44:09.500
That's one way to get burnout.

44:09.500 --> 44:11.540
Yeah, that sours people too.

44:11.540 --> 44:12.580
Right.

44:12.580 --> 44:14.740
All right, well, let's talk about the Atari VCS.

44:14.740 --> 44:18.100
It's sort of struggling for credibility right now as well,

44:18.100 --> 44:21.140
especially after a pretty brutal trolling by the register.

44:21.140 --> 44:24.180
So Rob Wyatt, the system architect for the Atari VCS

44:24.180 --> 44:26.300
project, did a FAQ.

44:26.300 --> 44:29.020
And I want to go through just a couple of them.

44:29.020 --> 44:32.540
Real quick reminder, Atari VCS is a Linux powered Atari console

44:32.540 --> 44:34.580
that's coming out next year.

44:34.580 --> 44:36.180
And I backed it.

44:36.180 --> 44:38.840
I backed it so that way I can talk about it on the shows.

44:38.840 --> 44:40.340
I backed it because after going through it,

44:40.340 --> 44:41.980
I think they have something here.

44:41.980 --> 44:43.720
And I think what they're trying to pull off

44:43.720 --> 44:44.740
is not insurmountable.

44:44.740 --> 44:46.860
And one of the things that I really

44:46.860 --> 44:48.700
appreciate about the Atari VCS project

44:48.700 --> 44:50.340
is they looked at the Ouya specifically,

44:50.340 --> 44:53.740
that little Android cube, and said, well, how did that fail?

44:53.740 --> 44:54.860
And why did that fail?

44:54.860 --> 44:56.820
And then they said, OK, let's not do that.

44:56.820 --> 45:00.180
And I think that is, I think, a really good starting

45:00.180 --> 45:02.220
point of lessons learned.

45:02.220 --> 45:04.780
So Rob here answers various questions

45:04.780 --> 45:07.100
that I can only presume he created himself and then

45:07.100 --> 45:09.100
asked himself, which is always a little awkward.

45:09.100 --> 45:11.480
Or maybe they were really legitimately frequently asked.

45:11.480 --> 45:15.020
But he gives us some details on the VCS hardware specs.

45:15.020 --> 45:20.060
The Atari VCS hardware will be powered by an AMD Bristol Ridge

45:20.060 --> 45:23.420
family APU with Radeon R7 graphics.

45:23.420 --> 45:25.860
And they're going to add eight gigabytes of RAM, which

45:25.860 --> 45:28.180
is more than the original amount they're going to add.

45:28.180 --> 45:29.580
And he does note, yes, that means

45:29.580 --> 45:33.500
this is not going to be a Ryzen family board.

45:33.500 --> 45:34.700
But they did the math.

45:34.700 --> 45:36.380
They ran the tests.

45:36.380 --> 45:38.260
And they said increasing the cost

45:38.260 --> 45:40.740
and increasing the thermal ceiling for a Ryzen

45:40.740 --> 45:43.940
APU that couldn't run at full performance because

45:43.940 --> 45:47.300
of the thermal ceiling didn't net an appropriate amount

45:47.300 --> 45:48.720
of performance increase.

45:48.720 --> 45:51.020
It was a marginal improvement.

45:51.020 --> 45:52.560
And so they figured that cost would

45:52.560 --> 45:56.900
be better spent on adding more RAM to maximize bandwidth.

45:56.900 --> 45:59.780
And then that benefits everybody all the time

45:59.780 --> 46:02.780
because now the RAM, I believe, is,

46:02.780 --> 46:05.500
I guess you call it unified.

46:05.500 --> 46:08.000
And I know some people were upset about that.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.660
That seems completely reasonable to me,

46:09.660 --> 46:10.700
especially for the types of games

46:10.700 --> 46:12.460
you're going to be playing on this thing.

46:12.460 --> 46:14.460
So that leads the question then to development.

46:14.460 --> 46:15.980
So will there be development hardware?

46:15.980 --> 46:18.940
And he answers, you won't need development hardware.

46:18.940 --> 46:22.380
Any Atari VCS device will be a development kit.

46:22.380 --> 46:24.060
To get an application in the Atari store,

46:24.060 --> 46:26.220
there will be a few technical requirements and rules

46:26.220 --> 46:29.460
as to what is permissible, as with other curated stores.

46:29.460 --> 46:30.780
Atari is a neutral partner.

46:30.780 --> 46:33.580
And we have no say in what applications get developed

46:33.580 --> 46:35.120
or when an application gets released.

46:35.120 --> 46:37.460
You are free to develop any application you like,

46:37.460 --> 46:39.260
as long as it fits the guidelines.

46:39.260 --> 46:41.740
There is no developer program that is open yet.

46:41.740 --> 46:44.380
But there will be one that comes online in the coming months.

46:44.380 --> 46:46.880
And if you have an application in mind, you can start today.

46:46.880 --> 46:50.820
And I love this part by making sure it runs on Linux

46:50.820 --> 46:56.780
at a high resolution using a standard runtime libraries.

46:56.780 --> 46:59.740
And then you're pretty much good to go.

46:59.740 --> 47:01.740
The changes from that to what they

47:01.740 --> 47:05.980
are going to be calling Atari OS will

47:05.980 --> 47:09.980
be minimal and mostly related to application startup

47:09.980 --> 47:11.740
and packaging.

47:11.740 --> 47:16.780
So Atari OS will be based on Linux

47:16.780 --> 47:18.700
with a modified Linux kernel.

47:18.700 --> 47:20.700
Now, you remember, they're also going

47:20.700 --> 47:22.940
to allow you to load your own OS, they claim.

47:22.940 --> 47:26.260
They have an open platform and a sandbox for that.

47:26.260 --> 47:28.380
So say you want to run XBMC, something like that.

47:28.380 --> 47:31.340
They specifically talk about this in the FAQ and mention

47:31.340 --> 47:32.140
that.

47:32.140 --> 47:33.560
So the way they're going to do this

47:33.560 --> 47:35.420
is they're going to have the Atari Secure

47:35.420 --> 47:39.040
Hypervisor, which is probably KVM.

47:39.040 --> 47:43.900
And they'll have all this stuff, all of the core stuff

47:43.900 --> 47:45.060
for this in flash memory.

47:45.060 --> 47:47.660
And before the Atari loads, any external storage device

47:47.660 --> 47:52.340
that is checked for a bootloader file, if it's bootable,

47:52.340 --> 47:55.860
the Atari VCS will boot that device instead.

47:55.860 --> 47:58.300
So you can hook up external USB storage.

47:58.300 --> 48:01.980
And if it detects it and it's got the right type of boot setup,

48:01.980 --> 48:02.660
it'll work.

48:02.660 --> 48:04.860
They don't have a typical bootloader like Grub

48:04.860 --> 48:08.580
because they have the CPU in protected mode

48:08.580 --> 48:11.100
and they have their own firmware to check

48:11.100 --> 48:12.700
for the other OS drive.

48:12.700 --> 48:14.660
And they're going to release example code on how

48:14.660 --> 48:16.340
to do all of this, they say.

48:16.340 --> 48:19.620
And they're going to release a demo OS, the boots

48:19.620 --> 48:23.460
on the Atari VCS, that's based on a standard Ubuntu image.

48:23.460 --> 48:25.900
So how is this thing going to compare to the NVIDIA Shield

48:25.900 --> 48:28.700
TV, in terms of power and everything else?

48:28.700 --> 48:31.460
Well, the NVIDIA Shield is an ARM platform, right?

48:31.460 --> 48:36.540
So this is an i6-86 platform, so there's that aspect to it.

48:36.540 --> 48:38.260
So that's kind of nice.

48:38.260 --> 48:42.340
But yeah, and it's going to have newer graphics, more

48:42.340 --> 48:43.660
capable graphics.

48:43.660 --> 48:47.380
So it should be, in some ways, more competent.

48:47.380 --> 48:48.860
But of course, the NVIDIA Shield now

48:48.860 --> 48:50.380
has multiple years on the market.

48:50.380 --> 48:52.660
If they do even half as good of a job as NVIDIA have done,

48:52.660 --> 48:53.700
then they're on to a winner.

48:53.700 --> 48:55.820
And that box, damn, is beautiful.

48:55.820 --> 48:57.460
Yeah, it looks good, right?

48:57.460 --> 48:57.960
Yeah.

48:57.960 --> 49:00.420
And by the way, when you load the, quote, other OS,

49:00.420 --> 49:02.380
you'll get access to the hardware.

49:02.380 --> 49:06.300
The hypervisor setup in a way where you get raw access

49:06.300 --> 49:08.740
to CPU, GPU, memory, audio, USB.

49:08.740 --> 49:10.060
Oh, wow.

49:10.060 --> 49:11.340
So that's not bad.

49:11.340 --> 49:12.860
And then you just reboot, unplug it,

49:12.860 --> 49:14.580
and you're back in Atari OS.

49:14.580 --> 49:16.500
They say they have test hardware running.

49:16.500 --> 49:17.880
They have different prototypes.

49:17.880 --> 49:20.740
So they have crazy, ugly, wires everywhere,

49:20.740 --> 49:22.620
doesn't fit in a box prototypes.

49:22.620 --> 49:25.660
And then they have prototypes of the hardware mold,

49:25.660 --> 49:28.540
but with no motherboard in there and stuff.

49:28.540 --> 49:30.260
But I think it's pretty cool.

49:30.260 --> 49:32.020
I think it's a decent solution.

49:32.020 --> 49:34.580
I know there's a lot of skepticism around this.

49:34.580 --> 49:36.900
People really think they've screwed the pooch here.

49:36.900 --> 49:39.280
But I think what they're trying to pull off is achievable.

49:39.280 --> 49:42.960
The hardest job they have, outside from the hardware,

49:42.960 --> 49:44.700
which is achievable, because they're

49:44.700 --> 49:46.580
working with all known good quantities here.

49:46.580 --> 49:48.460
They know the thermals and all this stuff.

49:48.460 --> 49:50.420
They're working with the Linux kernel.

49:50.420 --> 49:52.620
They've got all of that that they bring with it,

49:52.620 --> 49:54.500
including all of the networking, all of that

49:54.500 --> 49:56.420
that they don't have to invent themselves.

49:56.420 --> 50:01.720
Now they just have to manage to stuff a Bristol Ridge APU

50:01.720 --> 50:04.180
into this little case, which they've already figured out

50:04.180 --> 50:04.680
the thermals.

50:04.680 --> 50:08.860
That's why they rejected the Vega or the Ryzen stuff.

50:08.860 --> 50:10.540
So they're obviously monitoring that.

50:10.540 --> 50:13.140
And then they've got to write their UI, which they've already

50:13.140 --> 50:15.180
got art mockups for.

50:15.180 --> 50:16.980
And I'm not saying writing a UI is hard.

50:16.980 --> 50:17.820
But let's be honest.

50:17.820 --> 50:22.820
It's writing a television UI is, as far as UIs goes,

50:22.820 --> 50:27.260
much simpler than creating a desktop UI or even a phone UI.

50:27.260 --> 50:28.620
All this is achievable.

50:28.620 --> 50:29.740
No, I think you're right.

50:29.740 --> 50:32.300
They have a lot of the basics there.

50:32.300 --> 50:34.900
They just have to actually deliver on all the goods.

50:34.900 --> 50:37.100
I wonder, too, is there any chance

50:37.100 --> 50:40.300
that this will be something people who haven't heard

50:40.300 --> 50:42.100
of Atari would be at all interested in?

50:42.100 --> 50:44.180
Or is it really only a retro market

50:44.180 --> 50:46.980
for those of us old enough to have fond remembrances

50:46.980 --> 50:49.780
and who also are interested in open source technology?

50:49.780 --> 50:51.520
To anybody listening, I highly recommend

50:51.520 --> 50:53.500
going and reading the Medium article on this in the show

50:53.500 --> 50:54.260
notes.

50:54.260 --> 50:56.780
There's a wonderful description about how

50:56.780 --> 51:00.900
Sony made loads of missteps not giving people GPU access,

51:00.900 --> 51:03.860
how Microsoft made missteps allowing XBMC to be installed

51:03.860 --> 51:05.060
on the original Xbox.

51:05.060 --> 51:05.780
It's fascinating.

51:05.780 --> 51:07.420
I highly recommend going and reading that.

51:07.420 --> 51:08.340
Yeah, I agree.

51:08.340 --> 51:12.680
We have a link, linuxunplugged.com, slash 258.

51:12.680 --> 51:15.700
And I hope Atari pulls it off, not just because I backed it,

51:15.700 --> 51:20.700
but because every time somebody's tried to do this,

51:20.700 --> 51:23.780
like I just mentioned the Ouya, but there's been others.

51:23.780 --> 51:25.360
I mean, going back to the Boxee Box,

51:25.360 --> 51:28.100
really, every time somebody's tried to do this,

51:28.100 --> 51:32.300
they've gotten so close and just missed the mark.

51:32.300 --> 51:34.540
And I'm not saying that they are hitting the mark,

51:34.540 --> 51:36.020
but I think they're close.

51:36.020 --> 51:39.020
They're like really close to hitting the mark.

51:39.020 --> 51:41.540
And I think the fundamentals are there.

51:41.540 --> 51:43.260
And the stuff where they're going to miss

51:43.260 --> 51:45.580
is going to be content partnerships

51:45.580 --> 51:46.880
or the applications.

51:46.880 --> 51:51.700
But all of that can be added after the core product ships.

51:51.700 --> 51:53.200
It has a lot of potential, especially

51:53.200 --> 51:56.060
because what you get these days for a decent price

51:56.060 --> 51:58.460
is fully capable of playing HD video.

51:58.460 --> 52:00.260
It's fully capable of playing HD games.

52:00.260 --> 52:02.340
I mean, most people are going to be hooking this up

52:02.340 --> 52:03.460
to a 1080p display.

52:03.460 --> 52:04.700
Right, exactly.

52:04.700 --> 52:08.620
So I think if they get all the other little bits right,

52:08.620 --> 52:09.180
it could work.

52:09.180 --> 52:11.420
Speaking of a lot of bits to get right,

52:11.420 --> 52:13.520
Purism has an update on the Librem 5.

52:13.520 --> 52:15.580
This is their 15th progress report.

52:15.580 --> 52:20.420
And so this is not looking good as far as I'm concerned.

52:20.420 --> 52:23.020
I really appreciate their hard work.

52:23.020 --> 52:25.180
I think their laptops are really banging these days.

52:25.180 --> 52:28.460
And I'm really glad they're keeping us updated.

52:28.460 --> 52:33.500
But every red light is going off that I could possibly

52:33.500 --> 52:35.220
think of for this.

52:35.220 --> 52:38.780
So this is kind of understandable.

52:38.780 --> 52:40.460
But let's start with this one.

52:40.460 --> 52:42.100
The dev boards have slipped.

52:42.100 --> 52:43.500
They were supposed to ship in June.

52:43.500 --> 52:46.580
That was the projected ship date.

52:46.580 --> 52:50.260
And the current rough estimate they have now is August,

52:50.260 --> 52:52.060
so next month as we record this.

52:52.060 --> 52:54.220
But they're going to have more details as that firms up.

52:54.220 --> 52:59.060
When these things happen, there's red flags, though.

52:59.060 --> 53:01.540
They had certain issues, like getting

53:01.540 --> 53:03.460
all the information available to what

53:03.460 --> 53:07.860
appears to be possible builders, information like the camera,

53:07.860 --> 53:10.420
wireless, the battery, how the buttons work,

53:10.420 --> 53:11.380
those kinds of things.

53:11.380 --> 53:14.020
So those weren't finalized and ready yet.

53:14.020 --> 53:15.140
But that's understandable.

53:15.140 --> 53:17.660
Yeah, that's early days, and you got to get things rolling.

53:17.660 --> 53:19.020
The other thing that I'm pretty concerned about

53:19.020 --> 53:21.200
is if you remember from the specs, for those of you who

53:21.200 --> 53:26.940
don't, they promised to build in around the iMX8 development

53:26.940 --> 53:27.440
board.

53:27.440 --> 53:28.520
That's the actual phone.

53:28.520 --> 53:31.460
It's got a little bit faster of a processor.

53:31.460 --> 53:33.940
Still a MediaTek, but it's a little bit of a faster one.

53:33.940 --> 53:35.900
However, after some experimentation,

53:35.900 --> 53:40.020
they've learned that there's basically

53:40.020 --> 53:42.940
very little support for getting actual Linux working

53:42.940 --> 53:44.780
on the iMX8 board right now.

53:44.780 --> 53:47.620
Very basic mainline Linux kernel is possible,

53:47.620 --> 53:49.780
but drivers, like display driver and all that stuff,

53:49.780 --> 53:52.220
it's not happening right now.

53:52.220 --> 53:54.340
So all of their development images

53:54.340 --> 53:58.740
are based around an older board, the iMX6.

53:58.740 --> 54:00.340
That's what's in the hardware team.

54:00.340 --> 54:02.100
That's what the image they've built around.

54:02.100 --> 54:04.980
Now, they believe that they can use this

54:04.980 --> 54:06.380
to kind of get things rolling.

54:06.380 --> 54:09.440
And then once the iMX8 boards are onboard and working

54:09.440 --> 54:11.500
with the Linux kernel a little better and the drivers,

54:11.500 --> 54:15.980
they can do work to shore up the gap between the iMX6 and the 8.

54:15.980 --> 54:20.860
But I don't know, Wes, building all of this stuff

54:20.860 --> 54:22.940
around one version of the CPU and board

54:22.940 --> 54:25.780
and then trying to up right before a release or something,

54:25.780 --> 54:27.940
doesn't that sound like potentially disastrous?

54:27.940 --> 54:28.820
What do I know, though?

54:28.820 --> 54:29.900
It's a hard game.

54:29.900 --> 54:31.420
I mean, this is just a hard space

54:31.420 --> 54:33.780
to be in in trying to get this all right

54:33.780 --> 54:35.700
and still make a good release time

54:35.700 --> 54:38.860
and have something that is really well battle tested.

54:38.860 --> 54:39.360
You're right.

54:39.360 --> 54:40.780
I think that's a tall order.

54:40.780 --> 54:42.200
I don't know that it's impossible.

54:42.200 --> 54:44.620
And I think the people over at Purism

54:44.620 --> 54:46.820
have done some pretty incredible things in the past.

54:46.820 --> 54:48.460
So I wouldn't put it past them.

54:48.460 --> 54:49.620
It does make me a little nervous.

54:49.620 --> 54:50.300
Yeah.

54:50.300 --> 54:52.260
Yeah, maybe they can pull a real rabbit out of their hat.

54:52.260 --> 54:53.180
You might be right.

54:53.180 --> 54:55.180
I really want Purism to succeed.

54:55.180 --> 54:57.620
But wasn't Purism the one where you

54:57.620 --> 55:01.420
had a laptop without a fan that worked and all the rest of it?

55:01.420 --> 55:02.300
The fan worked.

55:02.300 --> 55:04.140
The fan just never stopped working.

55:04.140 --> 55:05.900
And they did a make good.

55:05.900 --> 55:09.580
And they sent me a working one.

55:09.580 --> 55:11.420
And that's one thing that gives me a little hope,

55:11.420 --> 55:14.140
to tell you the truth, is I had a really early version

55:14.140 --> 55:14.900
of their laptops.

55:14.900 --> 55:17.220
And then I had the third crack at it.

55:17.220 --> 55:19.820
And there is noticeable improvement in the unit.

55:19.820 --> 55:20.340
Right.

55:20.340 --> 55:22.460
I mean, it seems like they care about this stuff a lot

55:22.460 --> 55:23.620
and take it very seriously.

55:23.620 --> 55:26.460
It's really just the limitations of physics and the universe

55:26.460 --> 55:27.920
that are the most threatening here.

55:27.920 --> 55:28.420
Yeah.

55:28.420 --> 55:30.300
Plus, then there's the software stack,

55:30.300 --> 55:32.140
which I'm really uncomfortable with.

55:32.140 --> 55:33.800
If they had me in there as a consultant,

55:33.800 --> 55:35.340
I would be pushing hard against this.

55:35.340 --> 55:38.100
Because they're writing to, well, they're

55:38.100 --> 55:40.940
writing or contributing, trying to contribute code upstream,

55:40.940 --> 55:43.340
to create their own whaling client.

55:43.340 --> 55:45.540
So you have Posh, or however you say it, Posh.

55:45.540 --> 55:47.300
And you have WL Roots.

55:47.300 --> 55:51.740
WL Roots comes from Sway, which that's good heritage there.

55:51.740 --> 55:53.940
But they are trying to contribute things to that,

55:53.940 --> 55:54.980
too, to make it work.

55:54.980 --> 55:57.980
And Posh, or Posh, is sort of their creation.

55:57.980 --> 56:00.500
That's the shell that will be running on top of Whalen.

56:00.500 --> 56:03.660
Their GTK shell is Posh, or Plosh,

56:03.660 --> 56:05.180
however you freaking pronounce it.

56:05.180 --> 56:06.820
Because they've made up a word.

56:06.820 --> 56:09.320
Now I'm just sitting here, and I'm a dumbass on a microphone,

56:09.320 --> 56:10.740
trying to say it for the first time.

56:10.740 --> 56:16.940
So this is all getting work to try to support the D-Bus API.

56:16.940 --> 56:19.140
They're trying to get Redshift to work.

56:19.140 --> 56:21.620
They're doing a bunch of groundwork

56:21.620 --> 56:23.300
that would already be done if they

56:23.300 --> 56:25.860
were, say, using Plasma Mobile.

56:25.860 --> 56:27.740
And so they're having to create work.

56:27.740 --> 56:30.820
Epiphany is going to be the phone's default web browser.

56:30.820 --> 56:33.140
I couldn't think of a browser I'd least

56:33.140 --> 56:35.060
like to have on my mobile phone.

56:35.060 --> 56:36.860
But I guess they don't have any other choice.

56:36.860 --> 56:41.420
They've kind of got an XMPP mobile messenger working.

56:41.420 --> 56:44.140
And they say down here in a footnote

56:44.140 --> 56:46.740
that their collaboration with the Plasma community

56:46.740 --> 56:47.980
continues.

56:47.980 --> 56:51.900
They have some flat packs of Plasma software

56:51.900 --> 56:53.620
for their architecture now.

56:53.620 --> 56:55.700
And they're actively investigating a Plasma image

56:55.700 --> 56:58.460
for the iMX6 board as well.

56:58.460 --> 57:01.180
So what gets me, the real red light here is,

57:01.180 --> 57:03.780
if in case it wasn't clear, is they're building things

57:03.780 --> 57:05.800
like libhandy-gtk.

57:05.800 --> 57:08.980
They're creating a keyboard and a phone dialer in GTK,

57:08.980 --> 57:10.660
like a full phone interface.

57:10.660 --> 57:12.540
They're trying to patch a version of Mutter

57:12.540 --> 57:14.180
to work on their phone.

57:14.180 --> 57:19.420
And they're creating their own GTK-based shell.

57:19.420 --> 57:20.900
They're not using Gnome shell.

57:20.900 --> 57:23.140
They're creating their own.

57:23.140 --> 57:25.820
And they're using a CPU and board

57:25.820 --> 57:28.860
that will not be the final CPU and board that they ship.

57:28.860 --> 57:33.180
None of this is unbelievable and just completely untolerable.

57:33.180 --> 57:35.420
It's like, OK, I can kind of see the logical reasons

57:35.420 --> 57:36.140
for all of this.

57:36.140 --> 57:37.580
The hardware wasn't ready.

57:37.580 --> 57:39.460
You don't think the other software stacks it.

57:39.460 --> 57:41.100
You want to build something you own.

57:41.100 --> 57:43.100
I can kind of get all of it.

57:43.100 --> 57:46.780
But I'm thinking that Q1 2019 ship date

57:46.780 --> 57:48.460
is slipping at this point.

57:48.460 --> 57:50.740
This is a massive investment.

57:50.740 --> 57:52.480
And Wes, I suspect it's one of those things

57:52.480 --> 57:55.700
where you don't know what you don't know until you start it.

57:55.700 --> 57:59.300
If I knew how much work it was to do podcasts

57:59.300 --> 58:01.220
and to do broadcasting and live shows,

58:01.220 --> 58:02.460
I never would have done it.

58:02.460 --> 58:04.020
You don't know until you start.

58:04.020 --> 58:05.940
And it's always those last minute details

58:05.940 --> 58:08.140
that suddenly you couldn't have planned for because you

58:08.140 --> 58:09.660
didn't think or couldn't have known

58:09.660 --> 58:11.060
that it was going to be a problem.

58:11.060 --> 58:12.720
And then it's three days before you need to happen.

58:12.720 --> 58:14.220
And you realize, oh, yeah, no, this

58:14.220 --> 58:17.240
has a higher failure rate than we expected, or whatever it is.

58:17.240 --> 58:20.340
And suddenly, the whole world falls to pieces.

58:20.340 --> 58:23.380
Yeah, I really want this to succeed.

58:23.380 --> 58:26.220
And I wonder, and I kind of want to toss this

58:26.220 --> 58:27.500
to the Mumble Room.

58:27.500 --> 58:29.140
Popey, I'm going to maybe ask you.

58:29.140 --> 58:31.740
Dan, I'd like to ask you too.

58:31.740 --> 58:34.060
Alex, I'd like to get your take on this.

58:34.060 --> 58:38.580
If this bombs, maybe they ship something,

58:38.580 --> 58:40.620
but it never takes off, or they never even ship it.

58:40.620 --> 58:43.740
If this doesn't work, is this concept

58:43.740 --> 58:46.620
of a crowdfunded, all-free phone dead?

58:46.620 --> 58:48.860
Does it die here?

58:48.860 --> 58:51.440
Well, speaking as someone who worked for a company who tried

58:51.440 --> 58:56.420
to do this, the whole concept of building on one device

58:56.420 --> 59:00.180
and then switching to another device later in the cycle,

59:00.180 --> 59:02.260
fingers crossed that it'll work.

59:02.260 --> 59:04.940
It will take way more time to do that switch

59:04.940 --> 59:07.020
than they can possibly imagine.

59:07.020 --> 59:08.820
And they will need a long lead time

59:08.820 --> 59:12.000
to do all the necessary hardware enablement and conversion

59:12.000 --> 59:13.460
to this new device.

59:13.460 --> 59:17.340
It won't be like sticking a USB key in a new laptop,

59:17.340 --> 59:20.820
and the same software will just work on this.

59:20.820 --> 59:24.100
History has taught us that does not work.

59:24.100 --> 59:30.020
And so when we were building on the lowest end hardware

59:30.020 --> 59:34.300
that we could, like the Nexus 4 and the BQ 4.5,

59:34.300 --> 59:35.840
we had an eye to the future, and we

59:35.840 --> 59:37.340
knew there were other devices coming.

59:37.340 --> 59:43.780
And we had those on site flashed with Ubuntu Touch.

59:43.780 --> 59:49.300
So we had access to the devices, and we couldn't make that work.

59:49.300 --> 59:53.140
Now, neither could Firefox with Firefox OS.

59:53.140 --> 59:56.020
And Tizen isn't a blazing success on phone.

59:56.020 --> 59:58.340
It's certainly way more successful than Firefox

59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.620
or Ubuntu Touch ever was.

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:05.380
So maybe Purism aren't the right people to do this.

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.700
I don't know who is.

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.580
Yeah, that's why we need this to work.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.940
Dan, what do you think about this from a project standpoint

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:12.820
even?

01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:15.320
I started looking at this from a project management standpoint,

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:16.980
and it starts to make me cry a little bit.

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:17.620
I don't know.

01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.340
I talked to some of these guys at WADEC,

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:23.820
and I think, like you said, they have

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:26.860
a lot of reasons for the things that they're doing,

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:31.100
especially stuff with, like, GNOME Shell isn't really set up

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:35.020
to work as a mobile shell.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:37.300
But they're actually making a lot of headway

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:42.560
as far as trying to make GNOME applications more responsively

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.300
designed, doing some interesting things there.

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:47.660
And actually, we're showing off some concepts they have

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.940
and talking to different people, and there's designs

01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:51.420
they're trying to push upstream.

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.620
And I've seen some patches landing in Epiphany

01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:56.180
to this end.

01:00:56.180 --> 01:01:01.780
So like you said, I don't know how realistic Q1 2019 is,

01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:04.460
because I could tell you out of anybody

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.260
that deadlines are hard.

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:06.940
Yeah.

01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:08.140
It's totally unrealistic.

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:08.820
They're not Google.

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:09.500
They're not Apple.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:10.420
They're not Microsoft.

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:11.500
They don't have enough.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:14.240
I mean, you look at what Microsoft did,

01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.860
and they failed spectacularly with Nokia.

01:01:17.860 --> 01:01:20.780
They just don't have enough clout, I'm afraid.

01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:24.540
Is the goal mark here maybe not a successful phone

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:29.500
in the market, but is perhaps the goal post for us

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:34.260
improvements to GTK and making GNOME and the GNOME desktop

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:35.860
even more modern?

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.060
Some of this may remain.

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:40.460
This upstream work they're doing may

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:44.200
persist regardless of the success of the phone.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.860
And either way, we'll have purism to thank for that.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.300
I'm not sure.

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.980
We got a lot of flack when we got

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:54.380
innovative commerce distracted by Ubuntu phone,

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:57.180
and the desktop took a backseat.

01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:02.220
I don't see how GNOME can improve by being,

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.860
I'm not saying core GNOME developers are

01:02:03.860 --> 01:02:05.540
going to get diverted by this, but I

01:02:05.540 --> 01:02:07.460
don't see how core GNOME can get made better

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:11.260
by a phone project that may not even come to fruition.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:12.980
They're going to come back to the desktop

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:14.540
again after that, are they?

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:15.580
Quick question, Popey.

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:18.140
How many people worked on a Ubuntu phone versus,

01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:20.060
I don't know if anybody knows, how many people

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:21.500
were working on this Librem project?

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:28.300
Well, a significant chunk of the company, at the time

01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.060
the company was, I don't know, 800 people.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.420
So there was a fair chunk of people

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:41.180
across many disciplines, like Harbor Enablement, Qt, OpenGL,

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:45.460
QML, Qt, like people with many, and then

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.380
the general infrastructure stuff,

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.700
people building build systems.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:50.860
There was a ton of people.

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:55.660
It was more than 100 people working on it at its height.

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.780
That's a lot of people.

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.540
Wow.

01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:58.580
Yep.

01:02:58.580 --> 01:03:01.980
I think that a phone is just such a high bar for just

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:05.100
an even minimum viable product that people will even consider

01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.780
putting in their pockets.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:08.540
And even if you get all the pieces right

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:11.140
and build a perfect mobile OS, then you

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:13.300
don't have an app ecosystem.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:15.620
And what are people going to do on this phone?

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:16.820
Look at the Essential phone.

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:18.860
That was a beautiful piece of hardware,

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.780
but it went nowhere.

01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:22.620
Yeah, if you're not in every carrier store,

01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:24.620
you're never going to get mass market adoption.

01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:26.300
Now, maybe that's not the goal.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.620
And even if you get just the tech audience,

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.340
I don't mind having a couple of extra, maybe less useful

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:33.660
devices at home, but I'm not going

01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.580
to carry a second phone around if it

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:36.820
doesn't meet all of my needs.

01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:39.980
That's what I was thinking is, how fricking

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:43.820
bad ass would this be if we were just dominating some tablet?

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:47.140
We had a great tablet workflow.

01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:49.700
I hear a lot of Apple users talking

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.660
about using the iPad Pro, and there was talk

01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.380
of convergence forever ago.

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:57.220
But I just would love to be able to pick up,

01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:00.060
say, three or four market tablets out there

01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:02.860
that I could go get, like you would

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:05.220
get from a community project that's supporting

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:06.860
a small range of hardware.

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:10.900
And what I get is a complete kickass hardware and tablet

01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:12.900
experience where I have multiple windows.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:13.900
I can multitask.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:17.820
I can do real work, and I could even maybe hook up

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.660
a USB device somehow to this thing,

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:22.580
and it's got the whole Linux USB stack inside there.

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:25.260
Really, I think what I'd kind of like,

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:29.340
the more I talk about this, is just a really, really great

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.900
Surface Book-focused Linux distribution

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:34.540
where you could just go get the latest Surface Book.

01:04:34.540 --> 01:04:36.740
Isn't that just a laptop, what you've just described?

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:37.460
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.460
The tablet thing is there is something

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:43.020
about when you're at home, you're watching TV,

01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:45.100
or it's the weekend, and you want

01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:46.580
to consider yourself not working,

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:48.080
but you just want to stay connected.

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.180
A tablet is that extra level of casualness.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.300
And the ARM processor and its long battery life

01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:54.860
contribute to that, so I don't know if a Surface Book would

01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:56.180
actually do it.

01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.300
And I'd like it to be Linux-based.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:00.740
I'd like it to have a bash terminal.

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:02.460
But I really have no interest in a phone.

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:04.260
I really don't.

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:08.740
I would be more likely to go get a basic bitch, no feature

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:13.900
phone, and some flip phone with a week-long battery life,

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:18.460
and then just have a tablet and a laptop.

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.260
And I know that's not a huge market,

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:22.500
but I feel like there's probably a few people listening

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.940
nodding their head right now, probably going,

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:24.660
that's how I do it.

01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:28.420
I just do it with Android, or I just do it with iOS already.

01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:31.260
And I tried when I went to System76

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.260
for their Superfan event.

01:05:33.260 --> 01:05:37.180
I tried only bringing a tablet, and I

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:41.100
ended up having to use computers at System76.

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.340
It's interesting.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:47.460
My boss often turns up to work with only a tablet,

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:49.460
and will do everything just for the tablet.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.140
Won't even have a Bluetooth keyboard.

01:05:51.140 --> 01:05:54.020
He will just have a tablet and does everything,

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:57.620
from documents to joining us on Slack

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:01.500
to having meetings with people in Hangouts, everything.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.900
He just uses a tablet.

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:06.020
Must have some fast thumbs over there.

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:07.380
He dictates to us.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:08.300
He delegates.

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:11.860
Oh, OK.

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:12.700
We have minions.

01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:13.900
Maybe that could work too.

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:15.140
That's what I got to do, Wes.

01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.580
That's just what I got to do.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:18.580
I'll have somebody else use my Android phone.

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:19.860
I thought you were training Dylan

01:06:19.860 --> 01:06:21.100
to fill that role for you.

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:21.980
Right.

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.820
Yeah, I need Dylan following me around carrying my phone for me

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:26.700
and then relaying messages.

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.340
You know what?

01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:29.980
That's probably the solution I need.

01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:31.520
Well, while we're talking about phones,

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.780
why don't we take a break and thank

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.780
Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:38.460
You can go to linux.ting.com to take $25 off a device

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.260
or get $25 in service credit.

01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:41.940
Ting would work great for this solution

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.460
that we were just talking about, by the way,

01:06:43.460 --> 01:06:45.060
because you can just buy a SIM card.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.700
Sometimes they have crazy deals too.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.980
Right now, even when they're just like regular price,

01:06:48.980 --> 01:06:50.700
they're $9.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.020
And there's no contract.

01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:53.180
So why not?

01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.500
It's like you can buy it and then

01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:55.700
activate it when you need it.

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:58.740
So for example, we had an Android tablet

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:01.180
that had just been sitting around forever.

01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:02.500
And I had a SIM.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.060
And I just thought, you know what?

01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.460
We're going on a trip.

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:07.300
Why not pop it in there and have it?

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:07.980
Why not?

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:10.840
Then it's one less Wi-Fi situation

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.620
I have to worry about when I'm traveling.

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:14.740
Why not do that?

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:17.700
And then when I get home, I can log in and turn it off.

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.340
And then we have to talk to a human being.

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:21.700
You just pay for however much you talk, text, and data

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.380
you use with nationwide coverage.

01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:27.180
And they have CDMA and a GSM network and no contracts,

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:29.100
no other termination fees.

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:33.340
The average Ting bill is like $23 per phone per month.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:34.060
That's it.

01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:35.140
And they've got a great control panel.

01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:36.460
They've got a ton of devices.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:37.460
You can bring your own.

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:40.260
Or you can go get a device directly from them.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.820
They've got a bunch of the really good Moto phones, those

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:44.740
ones that are like a super great value

01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:47.780
and have pretty much a clean Android implementation

01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:50.460
with just a couple little actually kind of nice tweaks.

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.940
Those Moto phones, I think, don't get talked about enough.

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.840
And so Ting, though, Ting knows what's up.

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.740
So they've been expanding their lineup.

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:57.580
So go check that out.

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:00.540
If you go to linux.ting.com, they'll take $25 off.

01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:03.620
They're also giving away a Moto Z2 Play

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:08.300
with the attachable camera that basically turns it into a DSLR.

01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:11.200
And they're also giving away a Sony Alpha A6000.

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:13.120
I have details linked in the show notes

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.420
if you want to check that out.

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.940
Or just go to linux.ting.com and then visit their blog.

01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:20.420
They're doing a Ting Summer Giveaway.

01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:21.500
It's pretty sweet.

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.940
So big thank you to Ting for a long time support.

01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:27.620
Actually, you know what I just realized?

01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.420
And I don't know if I've ever mentioned it.

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.560
Ting has been such a big supporter

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.060
of the Unplugged program.

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.900
Ting became a sponsor before we ever

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:35.980
launched our first episode.

01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:36.540
They said, you know what?

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:37.580
We love what you guys do.

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.940
We love being on the Linux stuff.

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:40.980
We love the Linux audience because they're smart

01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:43.060
and they get the value of Ting.

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:46.420
Where they have to really educate average consumers that

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:48.380
just buy into the duopoly stuff all the time,

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.700
they really have to teach them.

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:52.500
That's a big part of their marketing effort.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:53.820
But with the Linux crowd, you guys

01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:55.740
understand what a text message is and data is.

01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:57.180
So it's a great audience.

01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:00.340
They're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, we'll sponsor.

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.220
Yeah, absolutely.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:02.820
We'll sponsor.

01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:05.020
So they've been a sponsor on the Unplugged program

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.060
from the very beginning.

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:07.180
And we really appreciate it.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:10.900
Go to linux.ting.com to keep them going and keep us going.

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.860
And also, a big thank you to DigitalOcean,

01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:16.140
do.co slash unplugged.

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:18.620
do.co slash unplugged is where you

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:22.100
go to get a $100 credit when you sign up with a new account.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.700
do.co slash unplugged.

01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.060
You've got to go there to get the $100 credit

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:27.620
and then try out DigitalOcean.

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:29.580
You can use it for 60 days with that credit.

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:32.260
They have industry-leading price to performance.

01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.820
They have machines that are killer.

01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:37.980
My favorite system has 4 gigs of RAM, two CPUs,

01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:40.220
80 gigabytes of space, 3 terabytes of transfer,

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:41.780
and it's $0.03 an hour.

01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:42.900
It's just crazy.

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:44.140
They got optimized droplets.

01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:46.600
It's what we're using for our PeerTube instance, which

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.900
is crushing it.

01:09:47.900 --> 01:09:50.340
Also, we've run a lot of our backend stuff

01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.660
up on DigitalOcean because they just have great uptime.

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:55.180
They have a 99.99% uptime.

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:56.340
That's fantastic.

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.380
They got Cloud Firewalls.

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.140
I was just seeing on Reddit some noob was having a hard time

01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.060
with his DO droplet.

01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:01.620
He's like, I don't understand.

01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:02.340
I'm getting this traffic here.

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:04.540
I'm like, go to the Cloud Firewall and just block it.

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:05.740
It just blocks it at the network level

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:07.040
before it even hits your droplet.

01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:07.860
It's sweet.

01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.540
They have monitoring and alerting baked in

01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:10.780
that you can turn on.

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:12.300
Great DNS management.

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.340
You point the name servers to DigitalOcean,

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.180
and then you can just start assigning subdomains

01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:16.980
to your droplets.

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.420
And I have a whole system.

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:21.340
I've got subdomains and domain names

01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:22.860
for my personal droplets.

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:25.160
Of course, I've got a system for the Jupyter broadcasting.

01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.940
Droplets, and they're crazy fast.

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:30.460
They got 40 gigabit connections coming into those hypervisors.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.340
Data centers all over the world, and then

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:33.940
every single instance, regardless

01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:37.340
of the $0.03 an hour or the one that's

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:45.180
like a monster with like 64 gigs of RAM, 32 dedicated CPU cores,

01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:48.500
9 terabytes of transfer, you know that one?

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.500
They're also all enterprise-grade SSDs,

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.700
from the $0.03 an hour up to that guy.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.980
In fact, you can even go in there

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:57.620
and do the, they have these new flexible droplets.

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.900
You can tweak and mix and match resources.

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:01.660
You can go crazy with the RAM.

01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:04.060
They have even more configurations than that.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:04.740
Let's see here.

01:11:04.740 --> 01:11:06.060
Do they list on the website?

01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.940
Yeah, so here's a droplet for you.

01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:10.740
196 gigabytes of RAM.

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:11.700
How about that one?

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:15.380
32 CPU cores.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.260
Oh my god.

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:17.540
Maybe that will run Gnome.

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.220
Yeah.

01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.780
Yeah, Mudder's going to repaint real quick on that one.

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:23.660
Oh boy, isn't that something?

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:26.820
So they've got a whole range of hardware.

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:31.060
And they've just recently launched tons of updates

01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:33.260
to the tutorial section.

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:34.860
I mean, for days and days now, they've

01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:36.060
been releasing new tutorials.

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:38.660
So there's tons of new docs, which you don't have

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:40.060
to be a customer to read it.

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:41.980
I don't know if Crazy Digital Ocean knows this,

01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:43.820
but they're giving this stuff away for free.

01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:50.180
And they just posted a great VPN setup guide using StrongSwan.

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:53.660
And StrongSwan is an IK2 VPN server

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:57.060
that gives you a whole UI to manage users and revoke keys.

01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:59.140
And it's slick.

01:11:59.140 --> 01:11:59.900
StrongSwan.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.700
And they have an introduction to setting up

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:05.500
StrongSwan on 18.04 and then getting your clients set up.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:06.300
They walk through.

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:08.580
It's a seven-step process.

01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:11.260
But by the end of it, you've configured the VPN client

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:14.300
on a Windows or Mac or phone and connected it

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:19.540
to your droplet running StrongSwan IPsec VPN.

01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:22.620
This is killer.

01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:23.940
I love their documentation.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.060
It's so well done.

01:12:25.060 --> 01:12:28.020
Everything Digital Ocean does has a bit of a design touch

01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:30.780
to it, from their dashboard to their marketing

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.900
to even the guides.

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.460
It's just so clean.

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.260
And they also release something every quarter

01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:36.760
called Digital Ocean Currents, where

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.180
they surveil their customers without them knowing.

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.100
No, actually, they just were sent out a survey

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:42.760
and say, hey, what programming languages are you using?

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.380
What desktop environment are you using?

01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:47.140
What server technologies are you using?

01:12:47.140 --> 01:12:49.740
And then they answer, and then Digital Ocean takes all

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:52.260
the results, collates them, and puts them in their currents.

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:52.900
And it's great.

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.700
And I covered it recently on Coda Radio,

01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:55.860
and you can find it on their website, too,

01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:58.860
if you're curious about trends and containers and programming

01:12:58.860 --> 01:13:01.780
languages and just sort of where the market is going.

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.100
Because Digital Ocean customers, again,

01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.020
are a little more cutting edge.

01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:08.580
So they are a good indicator audience.

01:13:08.580 --> 01:13:11.460
And that's why I really appreciate those currents.

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:15.620
And then last but not least, another from the beginning.

01:13:15.620 --> 01:13:18.660
Linux Academy has been a sponsor of Jupyter Broadcasting

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:21.940
since 2014.

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.140
That is a really long time in this business.

01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:28.220
I'm really proud of that, because it's a great fit.

01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:32.180
The Linux Academy goals and our audience

01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:34.940
are like a perfect lineup, because they

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:39.300
are so dedicated to the students, it's obnoxious.

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:41.600
So much of what they talk about around here, it's great.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.980
It really is great to hear it.

01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:44.900
It's one thing to see it online, but then it's

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:48.700
been a totally another thing to be here and be at that summit.

01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:51.900
The effort and the expense of flying all these people out

01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:55.460
and putting them up in the hotel room is enormous.

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.660
And the reason they're doing it is to keep a remote team working

01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:01.420
well and cohesive and help people build relationships,

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.940
which is massive to a functional setup like this,

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.620
where people are all remote.

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.380
They really invest in these people.

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:09.980
But what I've learned being down here,

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:11.980
and you've never asked me to tell you about this,

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.140
but it is the truth, is there is a ginormous staff

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:19.620
of real experts in this stuff.

01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.900
These people that are here, the Azure people

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:23.020
are from Microsoft.

01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:27.540
The OpenStack people are from Red Hat, on and on.

01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:31.300
The AWS folks are coming in from all over the place, really.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.460
But they've got people here from Amazon.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:34.620
And it's interesting.

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:37.560
It's a very competitive environment for the folks

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:42.420
that work here, because when you are really high up

01:14:42.420 --> 01:14:47.180
in those fields, your skill sets are in demand.

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:49.220
So that has been an interesting thing to watch, too.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:51.340
And so Linux Academy tries to treat their people really well

01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:53.940
here, because some of these course authors

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:55.660
are really in demand.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.260
And that is a massive investment they

01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.820
have made to keep these people happy,

01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.420
keep their team working together,

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:04.820
and keep them turning out content, which

01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:06.580
is a massive job.

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:09.620
These last two weeks, they've launched over 75 new courses

01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.900
and challenges and learning activities.

01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:12.980
And they're not done yet.

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:14.220
That's one of the reasons I'm still down here,

01:15:14.220 --> 01:15:16.620
is we're doing another little release this week.

01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:19.380
And then there's two more, which I don't know if I'll stay for,

01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:20.340
next week.

01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:26.940
Plus, they're doing a hardware giveaway of this Ansatel 1,

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:31.380
which is this monstrous red, like rocket red,

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:34.500
box that you can take cloud images and run them locally,

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:36.740
and then send them up to different cloud instances,

01:15:36.740 --> 01:15:38.060
like AWS and Digital Ocean.

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:41.340
It links it all up, and it's a super cool learning tool.

01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:42.700
And it's going to fit really well

01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:45.740
with a new feature the Linux Academy has in development

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:48.740
right now, that once it's done, we

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.860
will be obvious why this is such a cool box.

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.440
And so they're doing a giveaway on their live stream next week.

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.100
I may or may not be here for that one,

01:15:55.100 --> 01:15:58.220
but you can go to linuxacademy.com slash live

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:00.420
if you want to learn more about that.

01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:02.060
That is just a thing, man.

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:05.940
I tell you, that box is this really neat appliance idea

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:08.060
that I've seen different companies take a crack at.

01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:09.980
And the Ansatel 1, you can go look it up.

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:12.820
It's like a $700 box, but it's great for learning.

01:16:12.820 --> 01:16:14.180
It's just so awesome.

01:16:14.180 --> 01:16:19.660
Also, I don't know what Anthony's Twitter handle is.

01:16:19.660 --> 01:16:21.820
Off the top of my head, I'll go look it up for you.

01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:26.900
He's giving away exam vouchers on Twitter.

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:30.500
And that is, you don't have to be a Linux Academy subscriber

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:31.380
to get those.

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:33.940
He's just Anthony D. James on Twitter

01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:35.100
if you want to follow him.

01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:38.540
He's doing giveaways from time to time, Anthony D. James,

01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:40.460
at Anthony D. James on Twitter.

01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:45.340
And he's giving out LPIC exam vouchers and things like that.

01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:46.980
So also not a bad way.

01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:49.260
Because really, think about it.

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:51.260
You're not competing with thousands of people.

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:53.220
You're competing with a couple hundred at most,

01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:55.640
maybe 30, 40, 50 people, depending on when he does it.

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.140
So if that's something that would maybe be a break for you

01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.940
and really help you out, go follow him.

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:02.500
Because I think he's got like 40 of them to give away

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:03.180
or something.

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:03.660
He's got a lot.

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:04.740
I don't know how many he's going to give away on Twitter.

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:06.140
But he's just got a whole batch of them

01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:07.460
that he's going to be giving away.

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.460
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged is

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:12.700
where you go to learn more about them and support the show

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:13.980
and get a free seven-day trial.

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:16.500
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:20.540
And yeah, thank you, Wes, for posting that there in the IRC.

01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:22.180
That's a good deal.

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:24.100
Those are not cheap, those exam vouchers.

01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:25.620
So it's a pretty nice deal.

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:28.140
Yeah, that's awesome, especially if you're just getting started

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:29.940
or want to really come in back to the field

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:32.020
and want to really feel like you know what you're doing.

01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:33.220
That's a great way to start.

01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:34.820
So a couple of app picks.

01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:36.260
Everybody loves command line apps.

01:17:36.260 --> 01:17:39.100
So how about an RSS reader for the command line?

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:40.460
It's called NewsBoat.

01:17:40.460 --> 01:17:43.360
And it's a pretty snazzy text-based RSS reader.

01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:44.500
It's sleek.

01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.340
It also supports Atom feeds, of course.

01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:47.940
And it's meant to run in the console.

01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:52.860
And it is a fork of newsbateur, which

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:53.980
is how I used to pronounce it.

01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:55.500
So that's how I pronounce it now.

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:56.740
And it looks pretty nice.

01:17:56.740 --> 01:17:57.980
It's pretty straightforward.

01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:59.420
It's kind of what you'd expect.

01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:01.300
And it has a configuration file that's easy.

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:03.580
And it's in the Debian repo.

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:07.220
If you want to install it on vanilla 1804, it's NewsBoat.

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:10.060
So just apt install NewsBoat.

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:14.700
And you can read news articles on the command line.

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:18.900
Actually, not as ridiculous as it sounds.

01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.020
Actually, no.

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:21.780
I was going to say, I've kind of shied away

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.940
from RSS readers in recent months.

01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:24.820
Really?

01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:25.860
But really?

01:18:25.860 --> 01:18:27.820
I mean, I don't know that I would use it for everything.

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:30.440
But this could really be sort of useful,

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.980
especially I think I'm like, oh, yeah, I've got some tests running.

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:35.140
And I'm waiting on some output of some program.

01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:37.780
I'll just pop this open real quick, check on a couple things,

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:38.940
do some show research.

01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:39.860
Might be handy.

01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:42.300
Actually, it's also got an additional feature.

01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:43.540
It can download podcasts.

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.220
Oh, good catch.

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:46.020
Really?

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:46.780
Nice.

01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:47.460
Yeah.

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.300
Good catch.

01:18:49.300 --> 01:18:51.420
You know, where I really hit my power stroke

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:54.060
with automated messages from servers

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:55.900
was when I came up with different systems

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:57.160
to dump it all into RSS feeds.

01:18:57.160 --> 01:18:58.860
And I got them out of my inbox.

01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:02.140
You know, like cron jobs that have output or a backup report

01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:04.060
and stuff like that?

01:19:04.060 --> 01:19:06.540
Got them into different systems that

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:08.140
would convert them into an RSS feed

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:09.900
and then put them in an RSS reader

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:12.540
so I could just check on all of my cron job

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:16.140
reports and backup reports as part of my daily news routine.

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:17.820
And that was a next level hack I did.

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:18.860
I really liked that.

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:19.780
Oh, that's clever.

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:22.180
I imagine that would help you kind of see things that stood out

01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:23.880
as well, rather than having to sort through an inbox.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.240
You get like legitimate chains of related content.

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.160
I was trying to keep this to be a short episode,

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.340
but I got to side rail us here because you don't use RSS.

01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:34.500
You cast a pretty wide news net.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:38.060
Like when we do our link dump, you got a big list of links.

01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:40.860
I thought for sure you must be doing RSS to collect all that.

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:41.420
You know what?

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:42.380
Surprisingly not.

01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:44.460
I mean, it's not like I haven't ever done RSS.

01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:46.460
Just lately, I haven't been that happy with any

01:19:46.460 --> 01:19:47.460
of the particular readers.

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.760
So I've just kind of fallen off.

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.100
And I obviously have indexes and other lists

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.940
I keep of places to check.

01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:55.380
So it's sort of just a hacky manual system.

01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:58.460
It's really in need of some more automation.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.660
Well, to keep us on the tech space train,

01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:06.220
Joey over at OMG Ubuntu calls out Browse, I guess,

01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:06.940
is how you say it.

01:20:06.940 --> 01:20:12.660
Browse, B-R-O-W-S-H. And it is a modern tech space browser

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:14.500
built for the command line.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:18.620
And it's pretty great because unlike links,

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:21.440
it supports JavaScript.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:23.580
It supports WebGL content.

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:26.340
It supports photos.

01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:28.060
The only hard requirement is you do

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:30.860
have to have a version of Firefox on your system.

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:33.780
Browse uses Firefox to fetch the web pages

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:37.500
and then passes the necessary bits via a web extension

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:42.780
so it can then render it in low-fi glory in the terminal.

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:44.540
So I guess you just got to leave Firefox

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.200
for on somewhere, Wes, and then set this all up,

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.080
and you're good to go.

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:48.940
Have you seen the images it renders?

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:49.860
It's pretty rough.

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:51.380
It is pretty rough.

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:52.960
But one interesting thing I saw, too,

01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.060
is they have a way that you can actually

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:57.180
view it on the web as well.

01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:58.720
So you could almost just use it as a way

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.220
to take some sites that were way too complicated

01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:05.580
or full modern web and turn it into something a little older.

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:06.100
Yeah.

01:21:06.100 --> 01:21:07.100
Yeah, it's great.

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:08.300
I kind of want to do that.

01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.660
That's sort of a cool look.

01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:11.820
That's pretty awesome, though.

01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:12.860
I mean, I think that's probably we're

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:14.440
not going to be able to beat that for AppPix for the day.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.320
So we'll stop there.

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:16.460
But Browse.

01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:21.500
And you can get it at brow.sh, B-R-O-W-S-H.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:24.340
I will also say they have a call out here.

01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.340
It's early days for the project, so you're probably

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:28.040
going to find some pages that don't work.

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.540
But don't despair.

01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:31.540
I think if this is going to ever get really good,

01:21:31.540 --> 01:21:33.500
it's important for people to go submit URLs.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.960
They have a way to do that on their GitHub repo

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.660
so you can get better support for the sites

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:37.820
that you actually want to visit.

01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:38.420
Nice.

01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:39.840
I would say we could end it there,

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.500
but I do have to ask the question, what

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:44.820
happens when Linus quits?

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:47.660
This got on my mind because after Joe and I finished

01:21:47.660 --> 01:21:50.100
Linux Action News, where we covered Python's leader

01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:52.860
stepping down and sort of what led to that,

01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:54.580
Joe and I were talking off mic.

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:58.220
And afterwards, they're off recording and still on mic.

01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:02.140
What happens if Linus rage quits one day?

01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:05.260
I mean, you can tell the job is stressful at times.

01:22:05.260 --> 01:22:08.700
And you've got to figure he's going

01:22:08.700 --> 01:22:11.060
to get to a point where he's going to put his hands up and go

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:13.940
either very happily say, I'm done.

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:14.740
Thank you, everybody.

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:16.460
I've had a great time.

01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:18.420
I'm passing the torch.

01:22:18.420 --> 01:22:20.860
I wish you all the best.

01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:23.880
Or there could be a time where he tells everybody

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:27.060
to go F themselves, and he signs off the internet

01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:28.380
and never comes back.

01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:33.180
But either way, what happens when Linus retires?

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:38.580
And where does that role shift?

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:42.440
And is that something that we even need to worry about?

01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.940
These are all the questions that have been floating in my head.

01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:47.540
So let's break it down a little bit.

01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:49.200
Does anybody in the Mumber Room actually

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:52.140
know what the official handover process is for the Linux kernel

01:22:52.140 --> 01:22:55.580
when Linus moves on, when he retires?

01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:56.660
We're not saying he dies.

01:22:56.660 --> 01:22:57.460
He retires.

01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:59.980
Maybe he gets acquired.

01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:05.180
Yeah, Microsoft buys Linus out.

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:08.740
I mean, right now, he's employed by the Linux Foundation.

01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:13.060
So my assumption has been that the Linux Foundation would

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:15.180
sort of manage that.

01:23:15.180 --> 01:23:16.980
So I did a little research, because I didn't

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:18.420
know the answer to this.

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.980
So I did a little digging around.

01:23:20.980 --> 01:23:27.340
And what I found is a post by Linus on the mailing list

01:23:27.340 --> 01:23:28.100
forever ago.

01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:31.460
And he says, not everybody reads every post in the Linux kernel

01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:32.020
mailing list.

01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:34.500
In fact, nobody expects to have time left over

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:36.720
to actually do any real kernel work.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.660
We'll even read half of it, except for maybe Alan Cox.

01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:41.100
But he's actually not human.

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:44.500
But 1,000 gnomes working in underground caves

01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:46.660
are powering Alex Cox.

01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:49.260
None of the individual gnomes read all the postings either.

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:50.980
They just work together very well.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:53.060
So if there's one person he might pass the role to,

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:56.940
people speculate it could be Alan Cox.

01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:59.180
There's also been discussions, I found, online

01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:01.900
where there's a group of people that they would probably

01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:03.660
pass the torch to.

01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:07.860
It looks like someone had asked Linus at an event.

01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:10.180
And the way that Linus described,

01:24:10.180 --> 01:24:12.420
although there isn't a transcript of it, at the event,

01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:14.220
was that over time, he would start

01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:17.060
to make a slow transition to different people.

01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:19.780
So he would essentially break his role out.

01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:23.620
And then others would begin sort of filling those spots.

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.540
And then they would start vetting other people.

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:27.660
And it would just sort of spread out from there.

01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:29.180
In the end, he said the result would be better

01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:30.460
for Linux in the long term.

01:24:30.460 --> 01:24:33.500
Rather than having one person who gets overwhelmed

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:36.180
by vetting everything, it would be spread out

01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:39.860
into a process that could scale, which would probably

01:24:39.860 --> 01:24:41.580
be better for Linux in the long term.

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:45.620
So Linus himself didn't seem to be too worried about it.

01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:48.500
As long as there's the case that he doesn't get hit by a bus

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.460
and then we're left in a little more chaos,

01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:53.260
I imagine it'll be kind of like what Guido seems to have done,

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:56.580
and an announcement of retirement or whatever else,

01:24:56.580 --> 01:24:59.220
and then a slow fade as things are doled out.

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:01.720
And the community, I imagine, would naturally sort of step up

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:03.660
and some rules would be established.

01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:05.460
Maybe it starts off with one person doing most of it,

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:06.760
and that gets further delegated.

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:10.100
Maybe it's eight people that are all just taking it piecemeal.

01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:13.260
Now, it might be a good idea, as that gets closer,

01:25:13.260 --> 01:25:14.820
to have some more formalized stuff.

01:25:14.820 --> 01:25:16.540
I do really like the way, for instance,

01:25:16.540 --> 01:25:19.940
the FreeBSD project is managed and have

01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:22.300
an actual organization responsible for this.

01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:23.980
Maybe it'll go that way long term.

01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:25.560
It would be nice to have some maturity,

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.980
even if it's not really a problem

01:25:26.980 --> 01:25:28.940
that we expect to have right now.

01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:30.620
I have a question.

01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.140
On a day-to-day basis, I mean, this

01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:35.660
might be an obvious question, but what does Linus actually

01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:36.380
do?

01:25:36.380 --> 01:25:39.640
He did a recent interview where they asked him what he did,

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:42.740
and he said, my job is mostly very boring.

01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:46.540
And he says they're reading emails and processing

01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:48.460
pull requests and doing admin.

01:25:48.460 --> 01:25:51.020
So it's mostly admin.

01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:53.900
Yeah, exactly, and facilitating communications.

01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:58.700
My vote would be go to Greg KH.

01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:01.660
I've only had two opportunities ever to talk to the man,

01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:04.660
but really just really respect him.

01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:06.580
And I think he's really level-headed,

01:26:06.580 --> 01:26:08.580
and he really seems to stick with stuff.

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:10.240
So Greg KH would be high on my list.

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:11.580
Somebody better step in, though.

01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:12.900
I think we do need a leadership role.

01:26:12.900 --> 01:26:15.660
I feel like you do sort of need somebody to sometimes push

01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:16.280
things through.

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:19.300
And if it's not Greg or Alan Cox,

01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:21.140
you know it's going to be Lenard Pottering,

01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:22.580
and you know it's going to be Colonel D.

01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:23.540
And he'll announce a fork.

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.580
It'll be Colonel D. It'll be System D, Colonel D,

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.260
and Lenard will control the entire stack.

01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:31.700
Oh, finally, a unified stack of the future.

01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:32.620
Yeah, you know what?

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.380
Lenard, I love you.

01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:34.060
I'm just kidding.

01:26:34.060 --> 01:26:34.860
It would be great.

01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:36.780
It would probably be a good stack,

01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:39.780
and we'd finally, finally have a decent API.

01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:43.500
Go get more Mr. Popey over at the Ubuntu podcast.

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.740
He's over there doing his thing.

01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.700
A new episode is just around the corner.

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:49.260
Go get more Wes.

01:26:49.260 --> 01:26:52.660
He's on the TechSnap program at TechSnap.systems.

01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:54.700
Shout out to the Mumble Room for making it this week.

01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:55.820
Really appreciate you guys.

01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.500

and you'll get all the info.

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:05.000
Or just Google search Jupiter colony mumble setup,

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.220
and you'll find a guy.

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:07.780
It's absolutely magic.

01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:09.620

01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:20.060
See you next Tuesday.

01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:40.680
Bye!

01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:59.740
You know, the real question, Chris, is what happens when you, when you resign?

01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:00.740
That's the real question.

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.940
I'm going to, are you kidding?

01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:06.220
I'm going to be broadcasting until the day my mouth quits working.

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:07.660
I can't help myself.

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:11.500
I get antsy if I take a couple of days off.

01:28:11.500 --> 01:28:14.460
It's good for my sanity to keep going.

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:21.500
Unless, unless I could go live on a big piece of land, maybe a ranch somewhere, park the

01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:22.500
RV.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:23.500
Oh, ranch style.

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:25.700
And then just start a small colony there.

01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:44.860
And then I, and then I, and then I might be happy to.
