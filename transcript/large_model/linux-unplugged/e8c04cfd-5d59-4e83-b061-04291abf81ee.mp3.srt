1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
You're not going to believe this, but today's Boeing 747-400s still use floppy disks for

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,600
loading critical navigation databases.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,600
That's current stuff.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,560
Yeah, that eye-catching factoid, well, something like that, came from a DEFCON video where

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,820
some pentesters finally got a walkthrough of one of these 747s.

6
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,800
As you can imagine, Chris, most of the time, aircraft manufacturers are not so keen on

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,960
letting you mess up their planes.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,960
Hey, you know what?

9
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,240
If it works, Wes, it works.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:45,840
Sometimes a floppy disk, a sneaker net is the way to do the job.

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,840
Hello friends and welcome into episode 366 of your weekly Linux talk show.

12
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
My name is Chris.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,840
My name is Wes.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,520
Wes, I am really excited today.

15
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,940
We are really playing with something pretty fun.

16
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,940
We have...

17
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,940
I mean, besides floppy disks.

18
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,940
Right.

19
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:02,940
Yes, that was also fun.

20
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,880
We have a great show I'll tell you about in just a moment, but first I want to welcome

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,160
in Cheese, Drew, and Alex.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
Hello guys.

23
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Hello internet.

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
Hello.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Hello there.

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
Hello there.

27
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,360
Nice to have you all in here socially distanced with your new plexiglass separators.

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,260
I hope you like that gerbil style watering that Wes installed.

29
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,260
He thought of that.

30
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,260
It was really nice.

31
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,040
There's a little additive, but you won't find out about that till later.

32
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,760
And of course, as always, I have to say time appropriate greetings to our mumble room.

33
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
Hello virtual lug.

34
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Hello.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
Hello.

36
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Oh my goodness.

37
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:45,440
There is 34 people in there because we have a special episode today.

38
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:51,160
We are load testing something we found in the Jupiter broadcasting archives with matrix.

39
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,720
We already have it up and running and we're going to keep it running for a few days after

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,920
this episode comes out too at matrix.linuxunplugged.com and as we were getting ready to go on the

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,960
air everybody was getting it loaded up and set up and we're going to do some performance

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,740
testing and we'll tell you why this hardware is special in a little bit.

43
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,660
But before we get there, there is some community news I thought we should probably dig into.

44
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,640
Dan and Cassidy are here from the elementary project to help us get to some of that.

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
So hello gentlemen.

46
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Hello.

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Hello.

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
Hello.

49
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,760
Good to have you here.

50
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,440
Before we get to the big elementary OS news, let's round off a couple of quick stories

51
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,360
including the new KDE neon that has been rebased on Ubuntu 20.04.

52
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,880
Oh, a long time coming.

53
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,680
Yeah, I kind of forgot, you know, because plasma itself stays so current you don't really

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,640
think about the fact that the underneath stuff is getting a little old, but it was here and

55
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,400
it was quite the upgrade.

56
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,240
It took my machine a solid 45 minutes to just chew through everything.

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,240
It really did.

58
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,240
It was bad.

59
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,720
I wasn't going to make it before the show because of course I had to upgrade before

60
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,880
the show, but it did it.

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,160
It made the upgrade.

62
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,520
I did it through the graphical upgrade manager when it prompted me and I rebooted and other

63
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,260
than a new background at the login manager at SDDM, it pretty much exactly the same.

64
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,920
My auto start programs all started, my background stayed the same, all of the settings stayed

65
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:21,600
the same, my theme, everything is the same, except I think it feels slightly slower, Wes.

66
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,320
I think they might just be trolling you.

67
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:29,400
Maybe it's not a bad rig, you know, it's got a 12 core i7 in it and it's got 16 gigs of

68
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
RAM.

69
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,000
It's an older GTX 960 graphics card.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't know.

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Maybe, maybe they'll speed up over time.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,760
It just doesn't feel quite as smooth.

73
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,520
You know, I think you need to do more updates on my neon systems.

74
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,080
I find that there's like ups and downs, you know, as things change here and there, there'll

75
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,760
be a little regression and then it's fixed like a week later.

76
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,320
I think I already actually, I think this, this says there's already packages I need

77
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
to update actually.

78
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
They're rolling.

79
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
You better roll.

80
00:03:53,320 --> 00:04:00,680
I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore, but I am very impressed with how smooth it went.

81
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,520
Now I just have the freshest plasma on the system.

82
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,840
This is the last box I run neon and it's right here in the studio and it just has been running

83
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,520
for like two years now.

84
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,520
Just solid, really kind of a cool project.

85
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,560
So if you're a neon user, you haven't checked it out in a while, now's a great time.

86
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,080
Maybe a great time for a fresh install as well.

87
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,660
Not such a great time for Mozilla today.

88
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,880
We have some bad news.

89
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,960
Today they announced a significant restructuring of the Mozilla corporation.

90
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,600
They write on their blog, this will strengthen our ability to build and invest in products

91
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,080
and services that will give people alternatives to conventional big tech.

92
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,000
Sadly, the changes also include a significant reduction in our workforce by approximately

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,400
250 people, which I think works out to be about 25% of the staff gone.

94
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,680
Some of them were early engineers in the early days of the web.

95
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,300
Some of them were also from the security team.

96
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,640
It seems based on the developers that have been tweeting.

97
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,100
So if you are hiring right now, you might go check out some of these folks on Twitter

98
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,540
because they are well credentialed.

99
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,140
They continue to write, as I shared an internal message sent to our employees today, and this

100
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,440
blog post was written by, is it Mitchell Baker?

101
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,640
Is that who it is?

102
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,800
Look at me, Wes, with the almost remembering.

103
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
So Mitchell wrote this.

104
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,180
He says, I shared an internal message sent to our employees today.

105
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:28,400
Our pre-COVID plan for 2020 included a great deal of change already.

106
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,640
Our pre-COVID plan was no longer workable.

107
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,000
So going forward, we will be smaller.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,080
We'll also be organizing ourselves very differently, acting more quickly and nimbly.

109
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,640
We'll experiment more.

110
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,520
We'll adjust more quickly.

111
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,200
We'll join with allies outside of our organization more often and more effectively.

112
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,820
That does seem like taking what is a disadvantage and trying to turn it to your advantage.

113
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,600
So kudos to them there.

114
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,000
They have a focus and a new structure.

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,920
They're going to roll out a new focus on the product itself.

116
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:08,880
Mozilla must be a world-class modern multi-product internet organization, a new mindset, a new

117
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,400
focus on technology.

118
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,160
They say Mozilla is a technical powerhouse of the internet activist movement and must

119
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,360
stay that way.

120
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,460
A new focus on community, Mozilla must continue to be part of something larger than ourselves,

121
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,040
part of the group of people looking for a better internet.

122
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,480
And a new focus on economics.

123
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,960
I don't know how I respond to this.

124
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,120
I'm sad to see this news.

125
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,160
It's really unfortunate to see the position that Mozilla and Firefox are in now.

126
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,760
And it seems like it is just a slide that isn't stopping.

127
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,480
Is there a new steady state that we can hit here?

128
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,080
Because, I mean, they still do so much good.

129
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Firefox is great.

130
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,080
They've been a good force, independent force for keeping up web standards, making this

131
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,680
thing continue to not just be Google's world.

132
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Right.

133
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,280
I don't want that to end.

134
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
Yeah.

135
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,800
That's just as important, if not more important, than the web browser itself.

136
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,580
Which I think is why you're seeing them focus on that in this blog post.

137
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,480
But as the company becomes more diminished and the browser becomes more diminished, their

138
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,840
ability to affect that change is also diminished.

139
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,400
And so you can't really have one without the other.

140
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Oof.

141
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Oof.

142
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,040
I don't know.

143
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,200
I'd like to hear what other people think.

144
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Let me know.

145
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,380
LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact.

146
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,240
Maybe there is a positive side to this.

147
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,240
So it looks like the people that were let go are getting full base pay through December

148
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
31st, 2020.

149
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,120
There'll be some variations.

150
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,460
There will be individual bonuses for each one that will be paid out.

151
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:42,600
There's all kinds of details that are being posted online from the email from the CEO.

152
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,760
They'll also offer six months of outplacement services and a talent directory that people

153
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,440
can opt into.

154
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,840
Cobra benefits through the end of the year as well.

155
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,280
So it's not like they're just cut off completely.

156
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,920
It's a, you know, if you're going to lay off a whole group of people, it's a pretty gentle

157
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,960
way to lay them off, but it's still happening.

158
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Yeah.

159
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,520
It's a big change for all of these folks.

160
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
Yeah.

161
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,520
You know, my thoughts are with everyone who got laid off and I hope you do land on your

162
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,640
feet.

163
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,060
Send us an emails if you're looking for work and maybe we can try to pass that along.

164
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,820
See what we can do here.

165
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,480
And boy, best of luck to Mozilla, huh?

166
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Let's talk about something positive.

167
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
I gotta shake that off.

168
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Yes.

169
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Yes, please.

170
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:27,200
Let's talk about Elementary OS 6 and Cassidy and Dan are here to do just that.

171
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:36,400
Cassidy has a ginormous post over on blog.elementary.io and Cassidy, I want to start with something

172
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,080
that caught my attention and I'm not sure if I just haven't noticed this before, or

173
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,960
if you guys are doubling down on this language.

174
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,920
You write unlike many operating systems, especially in the open source desktop space, elementary

175
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,640
OS gets frequent feature updates between major versions.

176
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,720
This semi-rolling release cycle means elementary OS users get the latest features, fixes and

177
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,360
updates to their favorite operating system and apps very rapidly without having to wait

178
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,880
around for a new major release.

179
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:12,780
Rolling releases in there and I kind of feel like this is new positioning for the distribution.

180
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,360
It's sort of like maybe putting a label on something that's always sort of been the case,

181
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,840
but not really called that way before, or am I just misreading it, Cassidy?

182
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,040
No, you're right.

183
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,920
We started this a little bit with the previous release of elementary OS, but with elementary

184
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,540
OS 5 we've really doubled down on this sort of rolling monthly updates.

185
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,840
You always get the latest stuff from elementary ourselves, but also from our third party app

186
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,680
developers on App Center.

187
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,500
So you know, while we're built on a stable foundation of an LTS release, you're also

188
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,720
always getting updates to all of your core apps and new features and things.

189
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,640
We've used this language a little bit before, but I think we're being a little more vocal

190
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,640
about it because we've heard people misunderstand our release cycle when they say, you know,

191
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,000
elementary OS only comes out every couple of years.

192
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,360
It's like, well, we do have really, really frequent updates, so it's a little bit of

193
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
both there.

194
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
Yeah, I like it.

195
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,960
I think it's a good way of making it clear that even though there's a while between major

196
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,320
versions, you're still getting stuff and that's definitely been true this release.

197
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,560
I noticed though that the thrust of this post is really about elementary OS 6 and Dan, that's

198
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,560
not out yet.

199
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,960
So what's going on here?

200
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Is this related to the App Center for Everyone sprint?

201
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Yeah.

202
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,760
So remember way back when, before the event, we did that App Center for Everyone Indiegogo

203
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,040
campaign and one of the rewards we promised to backers was early access to elementary

204
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:46,160
OS 6 and we're finally at where it's not ready, it's not a beta, but it boots up and we've

205
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,720
got a lot of the things in place that are going to be major changes.

206
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,540
So we're kind of opening up for people who've backed us through Indiegogo and we've added

207
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,720
a GitHub sponsors tier so that people can support the development of elementary OS 6

208
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,920
before it's ready for public release and get access to all the cool stuff that we're working

209
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,840
on before anybody else gets to see it.

210
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,060
Well I happen to be one of those individuals and so my GitHub account was blessed with

211
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,840
access so I downloaded it this morning.

212
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,000
And if this is what you're calling a beta, I think this is what most distributions would

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,280
call a release.

214
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,240
It's looking really, really great.

215
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,680
I loved the entire experience because I did a fresh clean install from beginning to end.

216
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,320
I thought it was the smoothest setup I've done on a distribution yet.

217
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,080
Really nice, really sharp, love the new looks, love everything you're doing with the screens

218
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,040
that come up when you first log in.

219
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,720
So I think right there, $25 or whatever it was, whatever I contributed, I think money

220
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,920
well spent.

221
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,680
This is an interesting way long term to get people perhaps supporting the project too.

222
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,960
Would you consider doing something like this again for elementary OS 7?

223
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,040
Yeah, I think we're going to keep going with the early access model and it seems people

224
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,560
are responding positively to it.

225
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,360
And we have some more kind of experimental images that we want to put here too to get

226
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,240
some community feedback on before they're ready.

227
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,480
One of those things we're working on right now is images for Pinebook Pro.

228
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,960
So that's another incentive, you know, if you want early access backer and help us to

229
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,280
be able to get the power together to do some of these more experimental things.

230
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:25,480
That's that's I think where we're going with this who elementary OS on the Pinebook Pro

231
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,960
sounds really like a nice pairing, Cassidy, when I had a chance.

232
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
This is not a review.

233
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:37,160
I'm just my initial impressions were that a lot of work had been put into the selecting

234
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,440
the right style for the user interface.

235
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,320
But when you guys finally went dark mode, you really seem to have done it right.

236
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,280
Can you talk a little bit about that initial screen that people are going to see?

237
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,560
I think Dan actually designed that screen specifically.

238
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,880
But this is part of why it's considered a prerelease build and not even a beta yet.

239
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:59,440
We haven't fully decided what the scope of features for elementary OS 6 are or what the

240
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,680
scope is.

241
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,240
But the plan is to have at least the system components like the top panel and the dock

242
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,200
and the system settings app and like system dialogs that come up like authentication and

243
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,560
things follow a preference for a darker light style, depending on what the user has chosen.

244
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,040
That screen has to kind of communicate that this is for the system, not necessarily for

245
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:26,560
all of the apps, especially third party apps that aren't necessarily native to elementary

246
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
OS.

247
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,880
They might not be following this setting.

248
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,100
So it's been hard to kind of figure out where that line is and how to explain that to users

249
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:40,480
while also working on the free desktop side and trying to get something that's going to

250
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,400
be supported more widely in the ecosystem.

251
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Sure.

252
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,960
It is a great first start with not just dark mode, but some of the other other selections

253
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,280
that are that are in that screen.

254
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,880
So Dan, you created that, did you?

255
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,400
It's really I love it, Dan.

256
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,120
And I tell you what, when I select what I want it to be, it feels like it's the smoothest

257
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,680
transition to that theme that I've ever seen.

258
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,960
Like the whole thing is really a great operation.

259
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,040
I'm glad you like it.

260
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,420
But you know, it's going to get smoother, actually.

261
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,240
We have a branch for the window manager to do a little transition there so that all the

262
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,440
little animations will just line up real nicely.

263
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
I love it.

264
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
The extra smooth branch.

265
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
Yeah, that's great.

266
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
All right.

267
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,800
I don't want to talk too much about features since things aren't baked in yet.

268
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,600
But the blog post is definitely worth checking out Pinebook Pro images.

269
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,140
How serious are you guys about that, Dan?

270
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,320
We put a decent amount of development time into it so far and the experience is getting

271
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
better.

272
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,960
I think that it's something that we want to be able to provide.

273
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,600
But right now it's not quite ready yet.

274
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,960
We should maybe have some experimental images up on builds.elementary.io pretty soon.

275
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,960
We're getting ready for a little bit of a wider testing there.

276
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
That's great.

277
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:55,200
And my feeling is it'll probably be like less official than the main release.

278
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,320
Like I don't think we'll put a download on the main website and stuff.

279
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,100
Because they've said, you know, the Pinebook Pro is its market is Linux tinkerers and whatnot.

280
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,760
So maybe it's something we can provide.

281
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,920
But I don't know.

282
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,920
It's interesting running elementary OS on it with the performance right now.

283
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,720
It works better than I would have expected.

284
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
I'm running it right now.

285
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Really?

286
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
That's awesome.

287
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Same, yeah.

288
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
Yep.

289
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,200
I'm calling in from the Pinebook Pro elementary OS 6.

290
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
That's fantastic.

291
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:25,760
Does everyone on the team have a Pinebook Pro or is it just you guys right now?

292
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
How's that?

293
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,000
So far, I think three of us have a Pinebook Pro.

294
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,360
That's not bad.

295
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,180
So I guess my last question is, and the chat room noticed it too, so I wanted to get your

296
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,320
take on it.

297
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,000
Are we breaking email again, guys?

298
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Like what happened?

299
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,820
I thought Gary finally got in a good state.

300
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,800
And now it seems that you're throwing all that out and starting over with the back end

301
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,960
using Evolution.

302
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,420
You clearly have must have gone just crazy.

303
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,120
This is actually something we've been working on for a long time.

304
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:59,360
And Corentin Noel has been working upstream with Evolution and Camel for like the last

305
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,160
couple of years, like getting the library in a really good state.

306
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,780
And the kind of driving factors here, our Geary engine was originally just built for

307
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,520
IMAP only.

308
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,720
And there are other kinds of accounts that people keep asking us about, like Microsoft

309
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,680
Exchange accounts.

310
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:22,120
And Evolution has just had so much more engineering time put into it.

311
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,640
And it is so much more battle tested and widely used by other projects.

312
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,480
So if we can get it in a place where it's a better base for more types of productivity

313
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,180
suite clients to be using the Evolution libraries, then I think it's just a better opportunity

314
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,160
for us to all collaborate on like a really good back end together.

315
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,920
Yeah, no doubt about it.

316
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,920
And I really actually have enjoyed quite a bit using Evolution.

317
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,880
Once I got it all set up, the back end does seem to be the key piece, but the front end,

318
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,960
the Evolution client that people are familiar with, I'd say is actually the roughest part

319
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
of it.

320
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,440
And once you get it all set up, it's fine.

321
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,160
But it takes me a solid three days or so of, oh crap, I got to change that default.

322
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Oh crap.

323
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,320
Oh yeah, that's how we used to do this.

324
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,500
I got to change that.

325
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:11,880
So the idea of pairing what has become a really nice back end over the years with a lightweight,

326
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,840
simple front end of something like Geary could be like, I mean, I don't want to get too excited,

327
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,560
but it could finally get in that sweet spot of native email client with a competent back

328
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,200
end that integrates with the rest of the desktop environment and can connect with multiple

329
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,880
types of email back ends without having to be some crazy monster front end.

330
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,840
Just really excited about the potentials there.

331
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,120
I know it's a boring thing to get excited about, but I've got email problems.

332
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Yeah, you do.

333
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,880
Finally get you off those webmail clients.

334
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,720
I really like the direction Elementary OS 6 is going in, and I'm coming up with less

335
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,440
and less excuses not to just throw it on one of my machines as a daily driver.

336
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,880
Maybe as it gets closer, I just might do that.

337
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,160
Guys, thanks for coming on Update.

338
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,860
Is there anything else we need to touch on, anything else we want to let the peeps know

339
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,720
about before we move on?

340
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,040
It's always a great time to get involved, especially if you have early access and want

341
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
to jump in.

342
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:10,000
So elementary.io forward slash get dash involved and we'd love to have your help.

343
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,240
I encourage everyone to do so.

344
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,760
It's a project that just keeps seeming to go in the right direction.

345
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,160
It's great to have you guys on and get us up to date on stuff.

346
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,560
Appreciate you taking the time and you are welcome to hang out as we begin to punish

347
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:28,040
a box we have here in the studio, but before we get to that, we do have ourselves a touch

348
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,120
of housekeeping.

349
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,280
Just a piece here.

350
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,960
We have a lot going on that will be on the live calendar in the future.

351
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,760
So if you haven't grabbed it yet, now would be a good time to go over to Jupiter broadcasting

352
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,800
dot com slash calendar and you can actually just grab it on one of them.

353
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,800
I call feeds.

354
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
I don't know how it works.

355
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,260
You can integrate it into your calendar and boom, if things start showing up on that calendar

356
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:52,120
in the future, they just automatically show up on your calendar and you know about it.

357
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,280
I'm just saying it's something worth checking out.

358
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,520
Jupiter broadcasting dot com slash calendar.

359
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
That's a Chris Pro tip.

360
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
Yes.

361
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
I love those Chris Pro tips.

362
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,160
Also, I'd love to have you join us in the mumble room.

363
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
We've made it easier now.

364
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,240
If you go to Linux unplug dot com slash mumble, we have the quick info there, the full guide

365
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,200
still available if you need it, but it's just Linux unplug dot com slash mumble and you're

366
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
good.

367
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
You got it.

368
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
You're good to go.

369
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,200
You can join us on Sunday for the lub lug at noon Pacific and just hang out, chat with

370
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
everybody in there.

371
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,360
We've been getting into some great topics.

372
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,640
There's some really cool stuff people are working on project wise.

373
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,640
No kidding.

374
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,480
And then you're all set for Tuesday if you happen to have a Tuesday where you can join

375
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,480
us one day.

376
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
You know, you're all set to go.

377
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
It's really easy.

378
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,640
Once you get mumble set up, you know, just pop on in any time.

379
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,520
IRC is still the official chat of the show, even though we will be talking about matrix

380
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
today.

381
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,600
It's IRC is still the official chat and you can jump in at bit dot L Y slash Jupiter chat.

382
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,000
That's our IRC room.

383
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
For now.

384
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't know.

385
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
No, no, no.

386
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
We're not.

387
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What are you suggesting?

388
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Nothing.

389
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's all good.

390
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's all good.

391
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And that's basically the housekeeping.

392
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,440
Been keeping it short for the last couple of weeks.

393
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,120
So that way when we have a nice long one, I don't feel guilty.

394
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,620
They will never suspect it.

395
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,360
So we have a really fun project and we're hoping our live audience will help us production

396
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,260
test it a little bit today.

397
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,600
They're already doing so as we talk.

398
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,280
I'm looking down at their channel here on the mixer and I can see they're just chatting

399
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
away over there.

400
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:24,240
Wes, the little scoundrel, the rogue that he is, has set up a test matrix server that

401
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,720
we're going to leave up for a little bit after this show at matrix dot Linux on plug dot

402
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
com.

403
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,680
And we just put out the URL on the pre show today.

404
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,080
And it is, if you're not familiar, a decentralized chat system.

405
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,520
So on their website they have many definitions, but the one that I thought might work the

406
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,840
best and if you're not familiar, it's matrix is really a decentralized conversation store

407
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,480
rather than a messaging protocol.

408
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,800
When you send a message in matrix, it is replicated all over those servers who users are participating

409
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:03,840
in a given conversation, similarly to how commits are replicated between get repositories.

410
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:09,160
There's no single point of control over or or failure in matrix conversations which span

411
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,560
multiple servers.

412
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,040
The act of communication with someone else in matrix shares ownership of the conversation

413
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,960
equally with them.

414
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,360
Even if your server goes offline, the conversation can continue uninterrupted elsewhere until

415
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,840
it returns.

416
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,100
That's what's so fascinating about it I think because on one hand, right, you've just sort

417
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,200
of specified that you get an experience more like something like slack where you have this

418
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,280
built in message history.

419
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,240
It's not like IRC where you have to set up a separate bounce or other system to keep

420
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,400
track of all those messages because what has that history, but it's built with this much

421
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,120
different foundations.

422
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,100
That's with an aim to Federation extensibility and you know, privacy and encryption.

423
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,880
And it's also pretty famous for having this bridge capability where it can connect with

424
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,280
other services.

425
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:56,640
There is an unofficial matrix server that already is in existence for Jupiter broadcasting,

426
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,660
which is not related to what we're doing at all, but it exists and for a while we had

427
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,480
a bridge to our telegram channel and you can have a bridge to the IRC with varying degrees

428
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,480
of success.

429
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,680
It depends on, you know, a few factors, but that is an interesting aspect of it.

430
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:19,320
I know an individual who bridges every telegram chat, every IRC room, every SMS message, everything

431
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,320
in the matrix.

432
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,080
They bring all of their communications from every single chat platform out there in the

433
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,840
matrix that they use.

434
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,620
And that's an interesting, compelling way to bring it all together.

435
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,360
But what we were looking at using it is a way to test a kind of special machine that

436
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,680
Wes and I found in the JB archives, completely forgotten machine.

437
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:45,360
This is how I, I know that I've been doing this for a really long time.

438
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
Really long.

439
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,480
Is I have a machine from 11 years ago that we used to use in production that we took

440
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,280
out of production a few years ago, put out in the quote unquote studio garage server

441
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,280
room.

442
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
And you know, put out to pasture.

443
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,240
Kind of forgot about it.

444
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:08,600
Well just recently, oh, it's hot in the server garage, Wes, like a jungle.

445
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,600
It's time to do our arch due diligence and that means cook out here in the, in the server

446
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
garage.

447
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:22,400
Hey, look at this, this, look at this monster.

448
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,040
This is a little bit of Jupiter broadcasting history right here.

449
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,640
This is the, uh, this is the old streaming Mac pro that we used to use forever ago.

450
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,680
It's just sitting out here.

451
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,160
The wire cast machine.

452
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,160
Yeah.

453
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,160
Doing nothing.

454
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,840
What does it have in there?

455
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,360
I think it's got at least a six core Xeon.

456
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,480
Um, it's got an SSD.

457
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
It's got like four or five drives.

458
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,760
It might even have like 32 gigs of ECC Ram.

459
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,600
You know what we ought to do?

460
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
Put Linux on it.

461
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
Yeah.

462
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,240
I think first we got to clean it up and then we should put Linux on this thing.

463
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,560
See what it can do.

464
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:03,160
So this thing has kind of a special place in my heart because my, my history was I started

465
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,680
with for live broadcasting.

466
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,800
Granted, this was 2007, 2006 timeframe.

467
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
The early days.

468
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:15,180
I started with a hackintosh because the software I needed, of course there was no OBS.

469
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,840
The hackintosh worked for a while, but became pretty unreliable.

470
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:25,000
So I eventually hackintosh, never after it became a business with like sponsors and stuff,

471
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,920
I bought a Mac pro.

472
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,120
I got a low end.

473
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,640
It was a single processor Xeon six core with 16 gigs of Ram.

474
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,000
It's a 2009 Mac pro.

475
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,240
So it's like 11 year old machine now.

476
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,500
And I wasn't sure what the process to put Linux on this thing would be like.

477
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,400
And I also went on eBay and looked this thing, eh, you can get it for around somewhere low

478
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,880
price $200 high prices, $500 if you get it pretty loaded up.

479
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,600
I knew it would be bad, but after, after you left that evening, Wes, I, I opened it up.

480
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,280
I sent you a picture of it was, all right, well, of course it's Apple.

481
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:09,960
So they do everything differently and it looks like the panel comes off on the right side

482
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,960
of the case.

483
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Where's the latch.

484
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Okay.

485
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,960
Here's the latch.

486
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
Oh boy.

487
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:24,520
I'm going to have to take a picture of this.

488
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,720
This is going to need to be cleaned up.

489
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:33,160
So it's a, it's got a Radeon graphics card that was updated at some point in the future,

490
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,080
Sapphire graphics.

491
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:44,240
And it has one, two, three, it looks like three, no, yeah.

492
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:52,880
Over spinning rust, 10,000 RPM hard drives in it, a single Xeon six core and the RAM

493
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,080
banks that I can see are filled, but it's only, I think maybe 16 gigs of RAM.

494
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:06,040
I mean, that was a lot back in the day, but what it predominantly is comprised of is dust

495
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,280
bunnies like legit, gross, that's, this can't be good.

496
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm going to clean this up before we put this back in production or else just thermally

497
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,200
this thing's not going to be very happy.

498
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,360
So I know what my job is before I even get Ubuntu installed on this thing.

499
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,400
I just tweeted a picture of it at Chris Lass on Twitter.

500
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,120
I just put the, I just posted it.

501
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,300
It was pretty bad.

502
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,120
So it gave me a chance to use my new leaf blower.

503
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,800
So that was awesome.

504
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,600
And I sat down and I thought, all right, well this is going to be, this is going to be a

505
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,960
pain in the ass to get Linux on this thing.

506
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,460
Let's see what hoops I have to jump through.

507
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,480
So I go to, you know, get the Ubuntu ISO, I just go to Canonical's website, I get the

508
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,200
latest version, flash it to a thumb drive and put it in the USB port and the hold down

509
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:57,120
option when I power on the Mac Pro, didn't even bother going into Mac OS cause it's ancient

510
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
and it would just be complaining.

511
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,280
Oh come on, it'd be kind of entertaining, go spelunking around the old system.

512
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,000
I didn't delete all the data drives.

513
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,900
So some of the data is still there, so I might, but the OS, screw it.

514
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:14,520
So I hold down option, choose the Ubuntu 20.04 EFI, whatever it labeled it as, mis-correctly,

515
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,920
and booted it up.

516
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:21,600
And I forgot how pleasant the Ubuntu server install process is, the non-Gui.

517
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,360
It's nice and simple.

518
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,320
Immediately was just installing it like it was just any other PC, it's all the disks,

519
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,920
it repartitioned it just fine, it's, it's fine.

520
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,800
Like it, there was zero difference between installing it on a regular PC.

521
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Forgot that it was a Mac at all.

522
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,440
It was like, it's not a Mac.

523
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,720
And I mean, you were talking about how you could open it up and look inside.

524
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Yeah, that's true.

525
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
It is.

526
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,020
It's an, it's a Mac of a different era, but for $200, I'm like, geez, this isn't actually

527
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,840
all of a sudden, this is kind of becoming sort of a compelling home server.

528
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,020
And now the one I'd probably get to be closer to like $400 or, or maybe I'd buy a base one

529
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:59,500
if I didn't have one and I'd consider throwing some disks and RAM in it because this thing

530
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,180
is close to silent.

531
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,800
It's not silent, but it's close to silent.

532
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,560
It's got four disk bays in it.

533
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,320
It can take a ton of RAM.

534
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,600
You can get used processors off eBay and upgrade them to dual proc machines.

535
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,640
Some of them with Xeon CPUs, ECC RAM, it actually makes for a decent server platform.

536
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,640
Right.

537
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,400
I mean, it was designed as a serious, you know, serious machine back in the day.

538
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
It's kind of silly.

539
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Am I silly, Alex?

540
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
What do you think?

541
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
What's the power draw?

542
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,700
I actually haven't tested it.

543
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,700
I'm not sure.

544
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:33,520
I'm sure it's, I'm sure it's probably somewhere close to my super micro, but probably not

545
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,240
as much.

546
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,440
And that is absolutely a factor.

547
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,040
I would not, it's really, it's really kind of a fun experiment to see what Linux is like

548
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,520
on an 11 year old Mac that is now running Ubuntu 20.04 because what's notable about

549
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,880
this is Apple no longer releases Mac OS for this hardware.

550
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,360
You cannot put Campa Catalina on there.

551
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,280
I mean you can, but not officially.

552
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
Right.

553
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,280
Yeah.

554
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:04,400
You got a little hacky hack, but 20.04 goes on this thing like it's any old PC and it

555
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:10,160
will be supported for five years and something tells me if this machine is still running,

556
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,640
it would probably upgrade to the next release too.

557
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
Right.

558
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,000
And I'm kind of impressed with the amount of life that has been breathed back into this.

559
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I mean you worked on it.

560
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
It feels very responsive.

561
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah.

562
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
It totally does.

563
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I wouldn't have known anything at all.

564
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's impressive.

565
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I don't remember it feeling that fast on their Mac OS.

566
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
No.

567
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,600
It doesn't, I don't, it doesn't stand out and it is nice to see that you can still get

568
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,720
real value out of something that works just fine because the machine, it's built like

569
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,800
a tank with Xeons and ECC and essentially a server style motherboard.

570
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,680
So it was nice to be able to breathe that life into it.

571
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,760
So does it have like optical drives?

572
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Yeah.

573
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
Two of them.

574
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
Whoa.

575
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
I know.

576
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:51,000
So right now it's running Matrix and what we have done is we have forwarded outside

577
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,400
connections to this machine running here in the studio locally with Matrix and MongoDB

578
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:01,640
running on this box supplying chat services.

579
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,760
And do we have a rough count of how many people we have connected right now?

580
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Let me see.

581
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,160
We got 42 people.

582
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
42 people.

583
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
Yeah.

584
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,160
So everybody try to get on there.

585
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:14,460
Matrix.linuxunplug.com.

586
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,280
And I'm going to switch over from the Mumble chat over to the Matrix chat.

587
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,540
So I'll switch back for the post-show, but just so you know Mumble, you'll be muted for

588
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,480
a bit and I'll be unmuting the Matrix chat.

589
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
We'll see how this does.

590
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,760
Hold on to your ears.

591
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,440
This is an interesting, this is an interesting little thing they do in Matrix is they essentially

592
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:35,280
outsource this video chat functionality to Jitsi and then just embed it right there in

593
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
the Matrix chat.

594
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,280
All right.

595
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,760
Caller, turn down your radio.

596
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,760
All right.

597
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,000
So we'll bring in the Matrix chat, Wes.

598
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,880
I'm a little, I'm a little nervous.

599
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,880
Are you ready?

600
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,600
There's only one way to find out.

601
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
All right.

602
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Matrix chat.

603
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Are you there?

604
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
Hello Matrix chat.

605
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Hello.

606
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Hello.

607
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
Hello.

608
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Jitsi on Matrix.

609
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,600
Whoa.

610
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Hey.

611
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
That's better than I expected.

612
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Welcome to the Matrix.

613
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,240
Welcome to the Matrix, everybody.

614
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,400
So let's go see how the old server load's doing here.

615
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,160
Gonna go over on the old net data here.

616
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,440
Oh, four, four-ish percent on the CPU.

617
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,200
It's hardly doing anything.

618
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,280
It's only using 16% of its 16 gigs of RAM.

619
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Yeah.

620
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,360
It hops up now and again, you know, it gets a little busier, but really it's not breaking

621
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,360
a sweat.

622
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,320
No, this is great because this gives us an idea of like how powerful of a VPS would we

623
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:33,240
need if we wanted to deploy Matrix for our community and we wanted to host it ourselves.

624
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,700
And I was thinking maybe one of the higher end, more expensive VPSs, but this is kind

625
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,720
of showing me we could probably go mid-range to even lower end.

626
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,720
Yeah, I think so.

627
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,820
It's worth a shot anyway.

628
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,320
That's kind of fun.

629
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,320
It's a great little chat.

630
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,880
So element chat is pretty nice.

631
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,280
I'd say it's not as feature rich as Slack or Discord, but it's definitely more capable

632
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,200
and feature rich than say Telegram.

633
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,600
You know, actually I'm kind of impressed.

634
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,360
And if you listen to some of the people behind the project, I think that was a key observation

635
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,920
that, you know, some of these other protocols, XMPP, SIP, there's just not like a premier

636
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:10,720
client that gets the focus and all the attention and, you know, gets the most number of features

637
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,120
because there's a ton of other clients that you can use with Matrix, which is awesome.

638
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,820
But there is also a default somewhere you can be, you know, maybe not default, but something

639
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,520
like that that you can be pointed to, that you point new users to, and it creates a,

640
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,760
you know, a little more of a network effect just right there.

641
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,840
I see something about widgets.

642
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,280
Does anybody know what they are?

643
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,360
So you have like Jitsi is a widget that is now embedded in the chat, which is pretty

644
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
cool.

645
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,960
And they have all the other stuff that you would come to expect, like stickers, voice

646
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,280
calls, file attachments, image embeds, syntax highlighting for your little code snippets.

647
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Thank you.

648
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
Yeah.

649
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:48,600
By default out of the box, it's sort of just like a decent Slack competitor, but it seems

650
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,300
to be that these widgets and these bridges that you can connect and then something we

651
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:58,720
haven't even touched on, the federated aspect of Matrix, which is truly unique.

652
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,280
And I'm kind of getting excited about it.

653
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,280
The more I talk about it.

654
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,660
There's a twinkle in your eye.

655
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,660
It's pretty neat.

656
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:12,280
So what I see on my screen, for those of you listening at home, is a IRC style chat room,

657
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,620
but at the top of the chat room is an embedded video chat with all the controls that you'd

658
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,320
come to expect.

659
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,640
And it's kind of nice because you get both the text chat and you get the video chat.

660
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,600
You could pop the video chat out with some basically zero setup.

661
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,920
I mean, I just basically I said, like, add this to the to the chat room and start a video

662
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,360
call and away it went.

663
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,840
And I'm not even part of it anymore.

664
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,760
This is pretty compelling.

665
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,760
If I were starting today and had no chat platforms, you know, we didn't have nearly 2000 people

666
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,480
in Telegram and IRC and all the other places, this would be my go to by default.

667
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,520
I'm trying to reconnoiter what I'm going to do about our overall communications platforms

668
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:55,060
around the end of summer and fall is kind of what I've been planning to do.

669
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,240
And I've wanted to kind of see how Noah's Adventures and Matrix have gone.

670
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,440
I wanted to see how other projects are trying out Matrix.

671
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,240
You'll be hearing more about soon, too, and see how they kind of go and see what happens

672
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
with Telegram.

673
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,920
You know, just sort of been taking it all in.

674
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,020
But this is the first go here to run this on this old box.

675
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:17,760
This old Mac running Linux, which feels like a brand new machine.

676
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,220
And it immediately with free software and not immediately took some work, but with very

677
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,520
like reasonable amount of effort.

678
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,240
We have a really powerful, encrypted, decentralized chat system now.

679
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
Right.

680
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
No kidding.

681
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,600
You don't have to go pay for a slack plan or worry about all of that.

682
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
And yeah, it is.

683
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,200
It has encryption built in and it's really easy to control.

684
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,880
There's all kinds of notification settings.

685
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,840
I found the, you know, they have native clients as well as a bunch of other, you know, Flutter

686
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
and React Native.

687
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,160
But their iOS client is, you know, just in Swift and Objective C.

688
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,720
And it's in Kotlin for Android.

689
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,040
So there's been a lot of work put into this and the web client also very impressive.

690
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
It is.

691
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,020
And you could see how, because it's all open source, it is getting integrated into everything.

692
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:02,120
You know, you could use Pidgin if you'd like now, which is still around and still kicking

693
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,120
by the way.

694
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,120
Pidgin's still rocking.

695
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,980
The old chat program is still keeping it fresh.

696
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
There's one other aspect.

697
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,780
You touched on notifications, which does seem to be pretty granular in its controls, even

698
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,360
to like what types of thing notify you and all of that.

699
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:21,320
But something that really impressed me is when somebody sends you a DM for the first

700
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:27,380
time, it comes up with a prompt and says, would you like to accept and start this conversation?

701
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,720
Would you like to ignore?

702
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,460
Would you like to block?

703
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:37,040
And those three options are so fantastic because I end up getting a lot of PMs on Telegram

704
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,060
and IRC and I try to read like most of them, but then kind of like 20, 30 minutes into

705
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,640
like reading PMs, I kind of like, I got to move on.

706
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,420
If I could just say, no, not today, right there, right when somebody sends me something,

707
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,640
because sometimes they're a little weird, it would change my game for how I communicate.

708
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,900
And the idea that I could have the matrix chat client and I could pull in Telegram,

709
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:03,860
I could pull in IRC, and then I could manage the notifications in one place using one app

710
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:08,080
on all these different platforms, one app to check, assuming the bridge stuff all works

711
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,280
pretty well, it seems pretty possible that this could be done and it could create a new

712
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:17,720
communications place for our community that could connect easily with other communities

713
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,680
that already exist in the federation.

714
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,060
Yeah, that part is really neat is it, it is just so open.

715
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,060
You can bridge it to stuff.

716
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:29,000
The federation concept that's baked in, I think says a lot about the, you know, the

717
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,340
level of thought and design and skill of the people putting this work in.

718
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,640
The other thing is like the chat that I was having with Drew, our DM that we were having

719
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,080
back and forth, that's encrypted, which is really cool.

720
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,320
And when you sign up at another machine, you can either use your key to authorize yourself

721
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,160
or you can authorize yourself from another machine.

722
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,640
But then that has a matching process you have to go through to verify that you're accepting

723
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,560
the login and it's kind of neat.

724
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,560
It's a system that feels fairly robust and fairly modern for security.

725
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,560
Yeah, you know, not everything is encrypted.

726
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,340
You can change some of the defaults of when you're using the end-to-end encryption.

727
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:07,160
And of course there are always some caveats with that, but I've been pretty impressed

728
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:11,120
with just the system to manage it, to have that built in and available, and to have some

729
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,820
of the modern UI features.

730
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,520
Because of course with security, it's always that trade-off, you know, if it's too hard

731
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,440
to use, people just aren't going to use it.

732
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,980
And it's nice to see them striking a smart balance with some of the same tech that things

733
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,360
like Signal use.

734
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,500
We could be running this with the load this thing's putting on this old Mac here.

735
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,120
This old Mac running Linux is not even breaking a sweat.

736
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,420
I'm looking at it right now.

737
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,440
It's a little higher because people are trying to put a load on it.

738
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,760
It's spiking between 8 and 13 percent CPU.

739
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,280
The used RAM still hasn't even cracked 17 percent.

740
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:50,080
And we're basically using a megabit, yeah, we're hanging around a megabit for traffic.

741
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,080
That's awesome.

742
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
We could have put this on a Pi, you know?

743
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,080
Uh-oh.

744
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,080
I think we might now.

745
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:00,120
No, I think if we were to deploy this in production, we'd put it up on a VPS, don't you think?

746
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,680
Yeah, just so it's always available.

747
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,680
Yeah.

748
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,680
Oh, oh, oh.

749
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
12 percent.

750
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,680
12 percent CPU usage.

751
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,120
That's, uh, that's not much.

752
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:13,160
It just so happened to coincide with my discovery of the stickers function.

753
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,120
Ah, yes, yes.

754
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,400
I didn't need to blow this thing out.

755
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,560
I didn't need to take the old blower and clean it up.

756
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,560
It would have been fine.

757
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,560
There's no thermal issues here at all.

758
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,240
The neat thing about Matrix from my mind, one of them too, is that it's this like modern

759
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,400
HTTP based interface for pretty much everything, you know?

760
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,560
So like in the old days you had like XMPP or if you are doing things like SIP.

761
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:39,580
But everything, you know, all these webhooks, all these integrations with existing services,

762
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,920
everything is just REST like APIs and HTTP.

763
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,920
So it seems like it should be a lot of fun to start playing with some of the APIs here

764
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
too, you know?

765
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,900
Like moving a JBOT like thing over, probably not that difficult or all kinds of clever

766
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,840
integrations to send things or receive updates from wherever you like.

767
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,420
This might seem like an obvious question, but you can attach files, presumably that

768
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:03,200
uses local storage on the Matrix instance.

769
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
Something to watch out for.

770
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,640
Yeah, I believe they have some settings too to, you know, limit the number of attachments

771
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,000
that might be allowed or the size of them.

772
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,680
Although I set this up last night, so I don't know what the defaults are.

773
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,200
Yeah, we kind of were like, you know what, we really wanted to try this.

774
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Let's just do it.

775
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,800
Let's just do it.

776
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,200
There was a question by Noah in the chat room.

777
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,120
He says, the voice chat running on the device or is it cloud based?

778
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:31,600
It I believe is using WebRTC's peer-to-peer solution once the conversation is initiated

779
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:38,680
because earlier today, Wes and I got in a Matrix Jitsi video chat and while we were

780
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,440
in the video chat, Wes restarted the Matrix server and our video chat was uninterrupted

781
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,000
and then it just reconnected, the chat room just reconnected when the server came back

782
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,400
up and we continued chatting while the server was being rebooted.

783
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Not a blip.

784
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,560
So it seems to be peer-to-peer based on that, which is pretty nice because if you think

785
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,400
about it in a video latency situation, why waste the time routing through a central server

786
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,600
when you can go directly to the other participant?

787
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,800
It's just the most efficient way to do video chat.

788
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,720
I don't know if there's some Jitsi server on the back end handling signaling.

789
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,320
I believe that signaling is being handled by the Matrix server, but I'm not positive.

790
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:18,200
That would be something we'd play around with because we could possibly use that.

791
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,680
Jitsi's audio is getting pretty decent and the latency is pretty good when it's peer-to-peer.

792
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,280
I wonder if we would have the controls.

793
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,240
We might want something to investigate.

794
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:30,080
And I know that there's a bunch of work that's coming to the Matrix mobile clients as well.

795
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,600
They're getting better and better.

796
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,360
That's an area I haven't really explored much yet.

797
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,480
But server-side, our setup is pretty basic.

798
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,280
It's an Ubuntu 20.04 system.

799
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,600
And then is MongoDB in a container as well?

800
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
Because I know-

801
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Postgres, not Mongo.

802
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,000
Oh, I could have sworn I saw MongoDB on there.

803
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Is that for something else?

804
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
MongoDB is installed.

805
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,280
It must just be for something else.

806
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,280
That's latency.

807
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
It's right there.

808
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
I'm pulling metrics on it right now.

809
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,640
Did you install that?

810
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,660
I did install a different chat program for something else.

811
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:03,080
So it may have pulled that in as a dependency and I just didn't realize it.

812
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
It was a snap.

813
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,760
So I'm not sure exactly how that works.

814
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,320
So everything's in a container then?

815
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
All in one or multiple?

816
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,240
We've got one container for the Postgres database and then one for Synapse.

817
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:17,040
It's a Python program so you can just run it if you have Python dependencies installed,

818
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,160
pip, that sort of thing.

819
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,000
You can do it that way too.

820
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,320
And I believe that Debian has packages.

821
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,680
There's probably packages all over the place at this point.

822
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:26,200
The container you used, is that from the project itself?

823
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,760
Yeah, they publish containers and then they've got an example contributed Docker compose

824
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,760
file available.

825
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,960
They've got some guides for getting things going with Docker.

826
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,040
The first tricky bit is once you've got everything up and running, it actually won't start until

827
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:43,780
you've configured your homeserver.yaml to configure the setup.

828
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,320
But if you follow the docs, which we'll have linked in the show notes, there's a command

829
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,040
to generate your starting file, then go tweak that to whatever settings you need, restart

830
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,160
the containers and away you go.

831
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,160
Yeah, the chat room outed me.

832
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,200
It was rocket chat I was playing with.

833
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,560
I tried out rocket chat because it's one of the options when you're installing 2004 at

834
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,960
the post install screen.

835
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
Notice that.

836
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,960
Yeah.

837
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:07,000
They also have sabnzb on there and a Minecraft server.

838
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
They have a couple of things on there.

839
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,680
So I thought, oh, let's try out the chat.

840
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,280
I never really did much with it, but I guess it's still running.

841
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:18,560
Anyways, if you would like to play on this box, if you want to jump on this old Mac Pro

842
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:23,800
running Linux that is matrixed up right now, the easiest way to join it would be to grab

843
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,720
the element chat app and change server to matrix.linuxunplug.com and just create a burner

844
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,800
account because in a week or two, maybe by the next episode, we're just going to nuke

845
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,800
this box.

846
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,800
It was just a fun experiment.

847
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,520
I don't know what the hell we're going to do with it now.

848
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:40,240
It's like, I don't need another server.

849
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:46,940
Well, I guess I could always use another server, but we'll use it for something.

850
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,960
But if we ever get serious about matrix, we'll put it up on a production box somewhere and

851
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,720
do a proper install with proper backups and all of that.

852
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,480
Anyways, if you want to play with it, it's matrix.linuxunplug.com and it's element chat

853
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,480
for the chat app.

854
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,480
Yeah.

855
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Let us know.

856
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,480
We can install stuff.

857
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,480
Maybe we should play with some bridges.

858
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,480
Just mess with it while it's here.

859
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,480
Then we'll tear it all down.

860
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,480
Yes, I would love to do that.

861
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,160
That's a great, unless we mess something up, I'd love to just get an idea of what works

862
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,640
and doesn't work with the bridges and stuff.

863
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:14,280
It's a good time to experiment and let us know what you think.

864
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,960
You know, I would be curious how that Mac would handle the same torture test that you

865
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,640
put the Rock Pro 64 through with the ASCII Star Wars.

866
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
Yeah.

867
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,320
We ended up with like 30,000 connections or something like that to that Rock Pro.

868
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,440
Think you could do it before the music's done?

869
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,480
I'll give you a head start if you want to SSH it right now, then we'll see if it's-

870
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,200
I got to go find that container again.

871
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,720
Yeah, that's true.

872
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,880
I'll plug this then.

873
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:42,920
We're not abusing systems every week, but we're often doing something fun on the live

874
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:43,920
stream.

875
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,000
There's a lot more than just what makes it in the recording, so if you can, we'd love

876
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,760
to have you join us live over jblive.tv.

877
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,200
We do it every Tuesday at noon Pacific.

878
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,080
See you next week.

879
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,600
Same bat time, same bat station.

880
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,360
Now the timer has officially started, Westpain.

881
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,840
Will you get it up and running before the music ends?

882
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:09,000
Almost certainly not, but join our temporary matrix chat to find out what happens.

883
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Nice.

884
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Nice.

885
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,680
You can also get the show on the Twitters, that's at Linux Unplugged.

886
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,000
The network is at Jupiter Signal, I'm at Chris Lass, he's at Westpain.

887
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,360
Links to everything we've talked about, including that elementary OS news, at linuxunplugged.com

888
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,120
slash 366.

889
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:52,680
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's program, and we'll see you next Tuesday!

890
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:11,800
Uh oh, time's running out, Wes.

891
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,920
I suppose if the music were to keep going, then technically you'd still be...

892
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:18,920
That is correct, yeah.

893
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:19,920
One more time, DJ.

894
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:20,920
All right, Westpain.

895
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,920
That's some good thinking.

896
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,560
You know, what's tricky about this is if it was just getting the container up and going,

897
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,560
no big deal.

898
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,180
You know, that's a Docker pull away.

899
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:37,780
The problem is, because we're trying to not expose our public IP address, there is some

900
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:44,400
backend network plumbing that has to occur to actually make it possible for you to connect.

901
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,960
So there is that additional barrier besides just getting the right container.

902
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:50,960
How are we doing, Wes?

903
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:51,960
Progressing!

904
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:52,960
Progressing!

905
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,960
Uh oh, uh oh.

906
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,960
I don't think he's going to make it.

907
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,680
I don't think it's going to happen.

908
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,680
You can do it, Wes.

909
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,120
There's only like 30 seconds left on this loop, and then you're out.

910
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,920
Anybody want to take odds?

911
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,320
Jeez, you got odds on if Wes is going to pull this off or not?

912
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,320
I'd give him five to one.

913
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,760
Oh, dude, Wes is definitely going to pull this off.

914
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,760
It's like what Wes does.

915
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,760
I don't know.

916
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,080
He doesn't have a confident look.

917
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:16,880
That's mostly because this laptop is dying.

918
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,880
Oh no!

919
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,080
It just brought out a battery, too.

920
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,280
Boy, the drama just got amped up even more.

921
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,520
That calls for a different background.

922
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,520
Oh, serious, serious money.

923
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,520
Yeah.

924
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,880
It does not help that the connection to this is going very slowly.

925
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:33,880
Oh yeah?

926
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:36,040
It's touch and go here.

927
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,520
I don't think we're going to make it.

928
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,680
Well, the container's running.

929
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,520
What sort of technology are you using to hide your public IP?

930
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:45,840
Some sort of VPN or dynamic DNS?

931
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,040
He's behind seven proxies, kiddo.

932
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,160
Yeah, we got early Starlink access.

933
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,840
I look at Matrix as being like an open source version of Discord.

934
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:57,840
It does all the things.

935
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:58,840
Yeah.

936
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,840
Yeah, that's true, too.

937
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:04,480
I think a lot of people will compare it to Discord, but one of the things we talked about

938
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,480
in the pre-show as well, that Discord has a huge advantage of user accessibility because,

939
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,040
well, we were setting it up before the show and-

940
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,040
It was rocket.

941
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:19,440
Yeah, because in Discord, you can just click a button and then you have a server, right?

942
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,440
It's now set up.

943
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,280
And then you can just click a button and then you have a link you can send to people.

944
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:31,440
So if that was a bit easier and a bit more streamlined, I think that would help the whole

945
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,600
thing along a bit.

946
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:39,160
But in its current state, it's almost like you're basically, you have to be a sys admin

947
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,400
to know what you're doing, basically.

948
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,280
You just have to mess around with domain names and stuff like that.

949
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,160
Oh no, Wes.

950
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,160
Here it is.

951
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,320
It's the final countdown.

952
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,200
This is for all the money.

953
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,440
Can we get the network connected?

954
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,960
Can we get the container up?

955
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,960
Well, we'll see.

956
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,480
DNF is taking its sweet time right now.

957
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,640
Oh no.

958
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,060
There was some Fedora usage.

959
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:04,140
We did happen to deploy a little Fedora in the mix here to make all of this work.

960
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:08,480
That may end up biting Wes as DNF tries to make the right decisions.

961
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,440
Wes Payne runs out of time.

962
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,440
Oh no.

963
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,440
Oh no.

964
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,000
Ah, sorry, Wes.
