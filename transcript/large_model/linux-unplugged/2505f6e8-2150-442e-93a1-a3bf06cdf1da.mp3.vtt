00:00.000 --> 00:02.040
There's a lot of news today in the show.

00:02.040 --> 00:06.840
But this one, I'm just still reading the room.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.800
Microsoft is said to be in discussions

00:08.800 --> 00:14.440
to buy Discord for over $10 billion.

00:14.440 --> 00:16.840
And you can see the advantage for Microsoft.

00:16.840 --> 00:19.560
They could immediately get a very relevant chat platform.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.740
There's potential integrations with their Xbox chat platform

00:22.740 --> 00:23.880
there.

00:23.880 --> 00:25.800
And they'd probably be willing to architect

00:25.800 --> 00:27.880
in a way that makes surveillance entirely possible,

00:27.880 --> 00:28.880
like they did for Skype.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.660
So it's just a win for regulators.

00:30.660 --> 00:32.120
It's a win for corporations.

00:32.120 --> 00:34.200
It's a win for the Discord founders.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.600
It doesn't feel like a win for the users, though.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.880
And I wonder if this is going to be like a Matrix sale,

00:38.880 --> 00:39.960
essentially.

00:39.960 --> 00:41.480
Everybody check out Matrix.

00:41.480 --> 00:42.720
It's over here, and it's great.

00:42.720 --> 00:43.240
What?

00:43.240 --> 00:45.920
You don't think they'll open source it?

00:45.920 --> 00:47.080
No, I don't.

00:47.080 --> 00:47.580
I don't.

00:47.580 --> 00:57.920
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

00:57.920 --> 00:58.840
My name is Chris.

00:58.840 --> 00:59.960
My name is Wes.

00:59.960 --> 01:03.400
Hello, Wes, and yes, I am smelling what you're cooking,

01:03.400 --> 01:06.000
but I'm just not sure about a crock pie in the studio.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.520
Oh, you'll see later, buddy.

01:08.520 --> 01:09.720
We'll see about that.

01:09.720 --> 01:12.360
And I want to thank A Cloud Guru for sponsoring this episode.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.640
It is brought to you by A Cloud Guru.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.640
They are the leader in learning for the cloud,

01:15.640 --> 01:17.280
Linux, and other modern tech skills.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.640
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs.

01:19.640 --> 01:23.720
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

01:23.720 --> 01:27.180
Well, on today's episode, we're just kind of having fun,

01:27.180 --> 01:28.920
because we're getting close to 400,

01:28.920 --> 01:32.320
and we wanted to share one of our favorite WireGuard-powered

01:32.320 --> 01:36.000
tricks to get around your ISP and get any system you

01:36.000 --> 01:38.920
have behind a net, a public IP, and accessible

01:38.920 --> 01:40.080
from the internet.

01:40.080 --> 01:44.600
We do this often, so that way the chat room can abuse a box

01:44.600 --> 01:46.720
that we have on our LAN.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.520
So we've set up a hot box on Linode,

01:48.520 --> 01:50.400
and we'll walk you through our favorite way

01:50.400 --> 01:51.560
of accomplishing this trick.

01:51.560 --> 01:53.440
It's pretty straightforward.

01:53.440 --> 01:56.540
And we'll also chat with a new business that's

01:56.540 --> 01:58.460
built on top of WireGuard and Linux that's

01:58.460 --> 02:01.240
trying to make this even easier for you.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.900
Plus, we have a bunch of community news.

02:02.900 --> 02:03.840
We've got feedback.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.800
We've got probably some pics if we've got time.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.680
But more importantly, we have our esteemed room

02:09.680 --> 02:10.960
of internet experts.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.000
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.080
Hello, Virtual Lug.

02:14.080 --> 02:14.580
Hello.

02:14.580 --> 02:15.080
Hello, Chris.

02:15.080 --> 02:15.580
Hello.

02:15.580 --> 02:16.080
Hello.

02:16.080 --> 02:16.580
Hello.

02:16.580 --> 02:17.320
Namaste.

02:17.320 --> 02:20.480
A special hello to Dan the Rabbit in there

02:20.480 --> 02:21.440
from Elementary OS.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.080
Hello, Dan.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.160
Nice to see you.

02:23.160 --> 02:24.400
Hey, how's it going?

02:24.400 --> 02:26.920
Also, Dalton Durst from Ubuntu Touch Project

02:26.920 --> 02:27.800
is in there as well.

02:27.800 --> 02:28.440
Hello, Dalton.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.120
Cha-cha.

02:29.120 --> 02:29.960
Hello.

02:29.960 --> 02:30.680
Good to have you.

02:30.680 --> 02:31.760
Of course, lots of friends.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.120
We have lots of friends that we always have,

02:33.120 --> 02:34.420
returning friends, too, in here.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.880
So Brent, it's good to see you've been a little bit,

02:36.880 --> 02:37.080
too.

02:37.080 --> 02:37.880
Hope you're well.

02:37.880 --> 02:38.560
I'm good.

02:38.560 --> 02:39.120
I'm good.

02:39.120 --> 02:39.920
Thanks for having me.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.440
And of course, thank you to everyone

02:41.440 --> 02:42.360
who makes it all the time.

02:42.360 --> 02:44.160
We've got 17 people in there in total.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.200
We have some in the quiet listening and most everybody

02:46.200 --> 02:47.000
in the on-air room.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.520
That's one of the things you can use our Mumble Room for

02:49.520 --> 02:53.920
is just a live, low latency, very, very low latency,

02:53.920 --> 02:56.580
high quality audio stream if you just want a live stream using

02:56.580 --> 02:57.160
free software.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.960
And then the whole stack's free because we're

02:58.960 --> 03:01.360
doing it on Linux using free software

03:01.360 --> 03:03.240
and you'd be listening on free software.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.600
So that's a cool way to listen to a podcast

03:05.600 --> 03:07.160
about free software.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.040
But we really actually have a lot to get to,

03:09.040 --> 03:10.360
so I should stop fooling around.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.920
And there is some breaking news this week.

03:12.920 --> 03:16.480
This is CNN breaking news.

03:16.480 --> 03:20.200
By the time we come on the air, it

03:20.200 --> 03:23.360
is becoming more and more known that Richard Stallman is back

03:23.360 --> 03:25.420
at the Free Software Foundation on the board.

03:25.420 --> 03:27.120
He's not running it like the president,

03:27.120 --> 03:29.240
but he is on the board.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.400
And Stallman, as we have talked about on the show before,

03:32.400 --> 03:36.540
he is a hard man to like, as Lawrence Lessig put it.

03:36.540 --> 03:37.440
He's driven.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.440
He's often impatient.

03:38.440 --> 03:41.460
His anger can flare at friends as easily it does foes.

03:41.460 --> 03:43.760
And he is uncompromising.

03:43.760 --> 03:45.280
And he is persistent.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.440
And he is patient.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.280
That is something else about Richard Stallman

03:48.280 --> 03:53.080
is he is willing to wait for a long time.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.840
And so this week at a live event,

03:55.840 --> 03:58.360
he announced that he was back.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.640
First, I have an announcement to make.

04:01.640 --> 04:06.240
I'm now on the Free Software Foundation board of directors

04:06.240 --> 04:07.680
once again.

04:07.680 --> 04:12.320
We were working on a video to announce this with,

04:12.320 --> 04:14.800
but that turned out to be difficult.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.560
We didn't have experience doing that sort of thing,

04:18.560 --> 04:20.600
so it didn't get finished.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.360
But here's the announcement.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.680
Some of you will be happy at this,

04:25.680 --> 04:27.720
and some might be disappointed.

04:27.720 --> 04:29.200
But who knows?

04:29.200 --> 04:32.700
In any case, that's how it is.

04:32.700 --> 04:37.040
And I'm not planning to resign a second time.

04:37.040 --> 04:37.960
It was a while ago.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.240
It was before the pandemic.

04:39.240 --> 04:43.080
It was September 2019, just a few months after the world had

04:43.080 --> 04:46.360
learned about the horrific sex trafficking operation run

04:46.360 --> 04:49.880
by the influential billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.360
Revelation after revelation had come out

04:52.360 --> 04:54.680
about powerful people and influence,

04:54.680 --> 04:58.640
and MIT got wrapped up in all of that.

04:58.640 --> 05:04.040
Epstein had donated $850,000 to MIT's Media Lab.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.960
He had visited the campus many times,

05:05.960 --> 05:08.380
and of course, he had associated with several professors

05:08.380 --> 05:09.360
and administrators there.

05:09.360 --> 05:14.240
Now, RMS wasn't one of them, but an associate of Stallman's,

05:14.240 --> 05:18.040
Marvin Minsky, who was an AI pioneer at MIT

05:18.040 --> 05:22.560
and passed away in 2016, was involved with Epstein,

05:22.560 --> 05:25.560
and allegedly in some very serious ways.

05:25.560 --> 05:28.600
When that information became public in 2019,

05:28.600 --> 05:29.880
it created quite an upset.

05:29.880 --> 05:35.080
In response to that upset, protests were planned at MIT.

05:35.080 --> 05:38.480
The organization of those protests was done over email,

05:38.480 --> 05:41.920
and it was sent out to several email lists.

05:41.920 --> 05:46.160
Richard Stallman was on one of those lists,

05:46.160 --> 05:48.560
as you would imagine, since he had affiliations with MIT,

05:48.560 --> 05:51.120
and he replied all.

05:51.120 --> 05:54.640
And in a very typical Stallman fashion,

05:54.640 --> 05:58.760
he took issue with how words were being used, specifically

05:58.760 --> 06:03.640
the term sexual assault. And in a very insensitive

06:03.640 --> 06:06.680
to the moment kind of way, went on a whole diatribe

06:06.680 --> 06:10.160
and rant about the use of the term sexual assault.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.720
That email thread made it into the hands of an MIT alumni,

06:12.720 --> 06:14.720
who then forwarded that email to reporters.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.160
But really, the reporters didn't do much with it.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.160
So she then turned to Medium, and she

06:19.160 --> 06:22.880
penned a post entitled, Remove Richard Stallman and Everyone

06:22.880 --> 06:24.640
Else Horrible in Tech.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.560
That post did get traction, specifically on social media,

06:27.560 --> 06:29.920
and groups began digging into Stallman's past who were not

06:29.920 --> 06:32.320
familiar with Richard Stallman.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.520
They began unearthing lots of objectionable content

06:35.520 --> 06:38.240
that you can find on his personal blog.

06:38.240 --> 06:41.240
From there, with the connection to Epstein and the content

06:41.240 --> 06:44.000
on his blog, things escalated very quickly,

06:44.000 --> 06:46.440
and regular media outlets started

06:46.440 --> 06:47.600
reporting on the incident.

06:47.600 --> 06:51.520
The pressure grew on Richard Stallman and the FSF very fast.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.880
So Stallman resigned from MIT and the Free Software

06:53.880 --> 06:56.680
Foundation, which he founded in 1985,

06:56.680 --> 07:01.560
a week after he sent that reply all.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.440
And it's been since September 2019

07:03.440 --> 07:06.680
that he sort of laid low.

07:06.680 --> 07:08.680
Did I make a prediction that he'd be back, Wes?

07:08.680 --> 07:11.080
Was it this year that I predicted, or was it last year?

07:11.080 --> 07:12.840
Yeah, I think you did.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.360
We'll have to check the archives after the show.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.760
But I don't know that any of us expected him really

07:17.760 --> 07:21.680
to be gone forever, at least in all capacities.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.960
Did you expect to be back on the board?

07:23.960 --> 07:25.360
That I'm not sure about.

07:25.360 --> 07:29.040
Yeah, it seems like this was supposed to be a splash,

07:29.040 --> 07:31.400
but they kind of bamboozled the announcement video.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.400
And so they just kind of casually

07:33.400 --> 07:35.360
set it in a low-attended live stream.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.360
Is it possible there's hidden in here

07:37.360 --> 07:40.440
is sort of a diss on free software video editors,

07:40.440 --> 07:43.600
and that's why it was so hard to put that together?

07:43.600 --> 07:44.560
Yeah.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.960
This, for the FSF, is a key moment.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.200
And there will be some that decide that they no longer feel

07:52.200 --> 07:54.360
represented by the FSF.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.680
And you may see some other organizations stand up.

07:56.680 --> 08:00.040
I mean, it's been around since 85, so it has quite a history.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.640
But that has to be, I think, in a sense,

08:02.640 --> 08:05.600
it's going to be a social forking that's going to happen.

08:05.600 --> 08:08.600
Yeah, I mean, it seems like we're sort of evaluating here.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.000
It's not really clear how this happened.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.840
Yes, he's now listed on their website,

08:11.840 --> 08:13.840
but there wasn't a lot of clear, at least at first,

08:13.840 --> 08:15.640
sort of announcements around these changes.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.120
And the way he says it in that video is sort of like,

08:18.120 --> 08:20.840
you get the idea that there's some force of will being here.

08:20.840 --> 08:22.600
He seemed to want to be back.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.520
That wasn't said in a way that sounded like, well,

08:24.520 --> 08:26.080
after discussing it with all the parties,

08:26.080 --> 08:28.500
we've determined this is what's best for the Free Software

08:28.500 --> 08:31.080
Foundation and the advocacy for free software.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.280
And that's where it's tricky.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.240
It's like, OK, we want to support free software.

08:34.240 --> 08:36.040
We want to support these ideas.

08:36.040 --> 08:38.240
But what does the Free Software Foundation do,

08:38.240 --> 08:39.680
and who do they associate with?

08:39.680 --> 08:41.640
What are their parties, and how do they advocate,

08:41.640 --> 08:43.320
and does that match our goals?

08:43.320 --> 08:45.560
And you kind of have to suspect and wonder

08:45.560 --> 08:47.560
if this wasn't the plan all along.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.480
You know, lay low, wait for the temperature to drop on this,

08:50.480 --> 08:52.560
and then when we feel like it's safe to do so,

08:52.560 --> 08:54.000
we'll bring you back to the board.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.280
Perhaps.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.240
I mean, how else do you get somebody as radical

08:57.240 --> 08:58.560
as Richard Stallman to step aside

08:58.560 --> 09:01.600
without some kind of, perhaps, compromise like that?

09:01.600 --> 09:04.920
Regardless, he's back, and he has a renewed focus

09:04.920 --> 09:06.780
on the problem of web apps.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.720
And it seems the pandemic has made

09:08.720 --> 09:13.000
him think more about this than he has in the past.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.020
There used to be a few of these, but there are lots of them

09:16.020 --> 09:16.520
now.

09:16.520 --> 09:19.240
Government websites are inaccessible.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.760
For instance, the House of Representatives website,

09:22.760 --> 09:27.600
without running non-free JavaScript code,

09:27.600 --> 09:30.720
you can't see a page, any page.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.800
The WhiteHouse.gov interface doesn't

09:33.800 --> 09:36.000
allow you to send a message.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.600
Various Massachusetts websites don't work.

09:39.600 --> 09:44.440
The websites to get vaccinated for COVID-19,

09:44.440 --> 09:46.840
something that you should definitely do,

09:46.840 --> 09:51.280
don't work without running non-free JavaScript code.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.920
Fortunately, you can make appointments in some places

09:54.920 --> 09:57.840
by phone, and that's what I did.

09:57.840 --> 10:00.440
And I listen to this, and I think, boy,

10:00.440 --> 10:01.880
this is a tough position.

10:01.880 --> 10:06.080
If the bar is even all JavaScript has to be open

10:06.080 --> 10:10.000
source, which understandably would be for him,

10:10.000 --> 10:13.400
and I look at the direction and trend line things are going,

10:13.400 --> 10:17.140
I don't think he has any influence in this.

10:17.140 --> 10:19.640
I think his influence has waned.

10:19.640 --> 10:23.440
He says we have to move away from web apps entirely.

10:23.440 --> 10:29.040
I've been talking about web services and their web apps.

10:29.040 --> 10:32.320
Well, one bad thing about them is how they depend

10:32.320 --> 10:35.600
on running non-free software on your computer

10:35.600 --> 10:39.360
and send it to you, and you have to know to stop it.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.520
But they do other bad things, too.

10:41.520 --> 10:47.280
For instance, web apps frequently spy on users,

10:47.280 --> 10:54.160
mislead users, can sabotage users.

10:54.160 --> 10:58.440
And so we need to move away from web apps.

10:58.440 --> 11:01.680
If you depend on a web app, you're

11:01.680 --> 11:06.080
depending on something that some organization can

11:06.080 --> 11:10.440
change on you at any time.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.640
It can sabotage it totally.

11:12.640 --> 11:17.280
It can impose new conditions on you, anything at all.

11:17.280 --> 11:20.640
So I call them online disservices,

11:20.640 --> 11:26.720
because what they do to you is not, in my opinion, a service.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.800
He's got a joke in there.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.080
Pithy as always.

11:29.080 --> 11:29.840
Yeah.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.320
Doesn't it feel like, Wes, especially

11:31.320 --> 11:33.720
after the work from home, school from home

11:33.720 --> 11:37.320
year that we just had, that we are further away

11:37.320 --> 11:38.160
from this than ever?

11:38.160 --> 11:41.240
Web apps are more dominant and in use than ever right now.

11:41.240 --> 11:41.920
Yeah.

11:41.920 --> 11:46.200
And as ever, he's not wrong in spirit,

11:46.200 --> 11:48.640
but it's just so far away from what the norm is.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.200
And I think from pushing any of the compromises

11:51.200 --> 11:53.120
that we're actually likely to see successful,

11:53.120 --> 11:55.200
we need to think more about privacy and data

11:55.200 --> 11:56.520
sovereignty and ownership.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.440
And OK, maybe I do need to pay some proprietary service

11:59.440 --> 12:01.200
over the network to do a job for me,

12:01.200 --> 12:03.680
but how can I make sure that that's reasonably in my favor?

12:03.680 --> 12:06.200
I'm not going to get to the point probably ever of being

12:06.200 --> 12:08.480
able to dictate what someone I exchange data with over

12:08.480 --> 12:10.240
the network runs on their side.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.560
That's just part of the internet and the web, right?

12:12.560 --> 12:13.720
We can't enforce that.

12:13.720 --> 12:16.160
But if we can set up some better frameworks,

12:16.160 --> 12:18.760
and it just doesn't feel like that's where his head is,

12:18.760 --> 12:20.760
I mean, maybe we'll see if there's some interesting things.

12:20.760 --> 12:22.320
He's certainly contributed a lot,

12:22.320 --> 12:25.760
and I'm not proposing we erase Richard Stallman in any way.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.680
It just doesn't seem like he's connected enough

12:27.680 --> 12:30.600
to what's going on in actual popular culture

12:30.600 --> 12:33.080
to be an effective advocate right now.

12:33.080 --> 12:33.600
Right.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.960
Manimek, there's a message here that is worth listening to,

12:36.960 --> 12:39.640
but it's like we need a spokesperson or maybe

12:39.640 --> 12:43.240
a group of spokespeople that are not as polarizing as RMS.

12:43.240 --> 12:48.000
Yeah, I totally agree with what Wes just said.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.960
And still, I think we need, even though his positions might

12:50.960 --> 12:54.200
be a little bit extreme, we need some people like him

12:54.200 --> 12:55.840
in the Linux new community.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.120
We need this little talk in the background

12:58.120 --> 13:01.760
that tells us, yeah, have a point on open source

13:01.760 --> 13:05.080
and try to use software that is open source.

13:05.080 --> 13:09.080
So I think he has his place in our community.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.760
And we've all thought about this, about web apps.

13:11.760 --> 13:14.040
Here I am on my full free software system,

13:14.040 --> 13:17.240
and I'm connecting to a proprietary web app.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.560
And I guess my comfort level with this

13:20.560 --> 13:22.080
has always been as free as possible.

13:22.080 --> 13:24.720
PyCrash points out you could GPL the JavaScript.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.120
I mean, you could.

13:26.120 --> 13:26.960
So that's an option.

13:26.960 --> 13:30.640
But I live in a kind of a more reality-based situation

13:30.640 --> 13:34.160
where I kind of feel like where I want to really focus

13:34.160 --> 13:38.640
on free software is the core of my OS, what makes my computer

13:38.640 --> 13:42.900
boot and function, how I access the hardware on my system.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.560
I like that to be free.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.920
Then I really like my user land to be as free as possible,

13:46.920 --> 13:50.460
my desktop environment, my mail client, my web browser.

13:50.460 --> 13:53.440
I all have preferences to use free software there.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.040
Then there's like another layer, which

13:55.040 --> 13:59.280
is like the nice-to-havities that I don't think

13:59.280 --> 14:01.480
would destroy the computing experience if I couldn't

14:01.480 --> 14:03.560
launch Slack or Steam.

14:03.560 --> 14:06.640
And it'd be nice if they were open source,

14:06.640 --> 14:10.800
but I want them to run on that free software stack, number

14:10.800 --> 14:11.800
one.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.180
And so the lower you go in the stack,

14:14.180 --> 14:16.480
the more important in my mind it is to be free software.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.760
And for some reason, that means websites

14:18.760 --> 14:21.280
are kind of like at the top of that stack.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.680
They're kind of like the furthest removed from me.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.840
And I somehow have just gotten used to the fact

14:26.840 --> 14:29.400
that these damn websites will just change on me.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.760
And that's something he goes into more in his talk,

14:31.760 --> 14:33.920
that these websites will just change.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.280
The UI will read change, and you can't go back

14:36.280 --> 14:39.520
to a previous version like you can with physical software.

14:39.520 --> 14:43.860
But that's also just sort of the trend line of development.

14:43.860 --> 14:46.320
And in some ways, it's a positive.

14:46.320 --> 14:48.920
And it's just not a black and white issue.

14:48.920 --> 14:52.920
And I think where RMS loses touch with the rest of us

14:52.920 --> 14:56.400
these days is that he cannot connect

14:56.400 --> 14:58.720
with that position at all.

14:58.720 --> 15:02.320
And while you do need somebody who tugs at these ideals,

15:02.320 --> 15:04.600
you have to do it in a way that doesn't seem so extreme

15:04.600 --> 15:08.200
that it's unable to be processed.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.480
And so I don't necessarily, I can't really

15:10.480 --> 15:14.160
see this being a net benefit for the Free Software Foundation.

15:14.160 --> 15:18.360
But time will tell, really.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.080
We will see.

15:19.080 --> 15:21.560
It's one of those stories where we can only just say,

15:21.560 --> 15:24.080
we'll see what happens, sort of like the first time

15:24.080 --> 15:25.600
back in September.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.620
Well, let's move on, Wes.

15:26.620 --> 15:27.780
Let's talk about something that's

15:27.780 --> 15:30.320
coming a little bit down the road, something a little more

15:30.320 --> 15:32.240
entertaining and exciting, perhaps something

15:32.240 --> 15:34.120
you'll want to catch yourselves.

15:34.120 --> 15:36.120
It's the Elementary Developer Weekend.

15:36.120 --> 15:39.080
And Dan's here to tell us a little bit about it.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.400
Dan, welcome back to the show.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.400
Hey, how's it going?

15:41.400 --> 15:42.560
You know, pretty good, Dan.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.520
You know, there's a lot going on these days.

15:44.520 --> 15:48.640
But I'm feeling like it's time to talk about something else.

15:48.640 --> 15:55.040
And you apparently wanted to have more work to do, Dan.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.200
You know, I wake up every day, and I'm

15:57.200 --> 15:59.280
like, I don't have enough things to do.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.240
What more can I pile onto my plate?

16:01.240 --> 16:03.400
Because if I'm not completely exhausted,

16:03.400 --> 16:04.700
there's something else I could do.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.200
Right, of course.

16:06.200 --> 16:09.040
So you have the Developer Elementary Weekend

16:09.040 --> 16:10.400
that you are announcing.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.560
It's the very first of its kind.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.320
And it feels like perhaps something

16:15.320 --> 16:19.040
that in the past would have been considered as an in-person

16:19.040 --> 16:19.540
event.

16:19.540 --> 16:22.320
But with the current COVID situation,

16:22.320 --> 16:24.440
it's a great opportunity to try something virtual

16:24.440 --> 16:25.960
and see how it works, I imagine.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.020
Yeah, absolutely.

16:27.020 --> 16:30.600
And this is something we've been thinking about for a long time.

16:30.600 --> 16:33.400
And we've always envisioned it as an in-person event.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.720
But in-person events are really expensive.

16:36.720 --> 16:38.760
And so there was kind of, like you said,

16:38.760 --> 16:40.640
this opportunity to go, huh, well,

16:40.640 --> 16:42.800
maybe we can try it online first and see what happens.

16:42.800 --> 16:43.560
Yeah.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.400
So what's the idea here?

16:44.400 --> 16:45.940
It looks like there's a call for papers.

16:45.940 --> 16:49.680
It's going now until April 20, and looking for ideas and talks.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.560
What kind of stuff are you guys looking for?

16:51.560 --> 16:53.400
Yeah, so kind of like the whole thing

16:53.400 --> 16:56.840
is that we've been to a lot of different open source software

16:56.840 --> 16:57.620
conferences.

16:57.620 --> 17:00.920
And there's kind of like two big things.

17:00.920 --> 17:04.480
There's either events that are really inclusive

17:04.480 --> 17:07.720
and for everybody, but aren't necessarily technical,

17:07.720 --> 17:09.800
or they're more like expo focused.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.960
And then there's events that are very technical,

17:12.960 --> 17:15.600
but they're usually like you see a lot of the same people there.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.800
And they're people that are kind of already insiders

17:17.800 --> 17:19.500
in the free software community.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.960
And they're usually the people that

17:20.960 --> 17:22.960
are making the platforms themselves,

17:22.960 --> 17:25.680
like GNOME developers, and KDE developers, and stuff

17:25.680 --> 17:26.680
like that.

17:26.680 --> 17:28.480
So we want to really create an event that's

17:28.480 --> 17:30.480
about app developers that are people that

17:30.480 --> 17:33.840
aren't necessarily on the inside in these communities,

17:33.840 --> 17:36.440
but that it's also a really technical event.

17:36.440 --> 17:40.720
So we're asking for people to either submit ideas of things

17:40.720 --> 17:42.800
they would like to see, or to submit talks

17:42.800 --> 17:44.360
that they would like to give that

17:44.360 --> 17:47.580
are focused around development and building applications.

17:47.580 --> 17:50.580
And we want to create this really educational space where

17:50.580 --> 17:53.920
we can help people be the best app developers they can be.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.040
And that could lead to some great Linux desktop apps

17:57.040 --> 17:57.760
one day.

17:57.760 --> 18:01.560
So the website to check it out is edw.elementary.io.

18:01.560 --> 18:03.760
And of course, we'll have a link in the show notes

18:03.760 --> 18:06.520
where you can suggest an idea or submit a talk.

18:06.520 --> 18:10.400
And rumor has it, perhaps, your humble host here

18:10.400 --> 18:12.260
may be involved to some regard.

18:12.260 --> 18:14.680
I don't know if we've really sorted out how much we'll

18:14.680 --> 18:15.680
be on air or not.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.880
But if nothing else, we're going to be here pushing buttons

18:17.880 --> 18:19.000
to make it all happen.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I like that it looks like submitting a talk

18:21.000 --> 18:22.480
is done through GitHub.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.280
This feels very open source.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.640
Yeah, good idea, Dan.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.700
Yeah, we've really been trying to stretch out

18:27.700 --> 18:29.480
the new discussions feature in GitHub

18:29.480 --> 18:31.120
and thought this was a really cool way

18:31.120 --> 18:33.880
to do it because you can vote on subjects too.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.000
And since it's a developer-focused thing,

18:37.000 --> 18:38.500
people don't have to create an account

18:38.500 --> 18:40.440
in some special presentation software.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.240
They probably already have a GitHub account.

18:42.240 --> 18:44.320
So we're trying to go where the developers are at.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.080
Clever.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.840
And I like that you've thought a lot about the format as well.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.920
I know that's something that you and I talked a bit about off

18:49.920 --> 18:55.360
air, but how to do it where the presentations are, well,

18:55.360 --> 18:59.040
quite frankly, presentable and enjoyable to watch

18:59.040 --> 19:01.400
and easy to understand and still have

19:01.400 --> 19:03.840
the optional component of interacting

19:03.840 --> 19:05.360
live with people and all of that.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.860
So I think you guys have got a clever idea of how

19:07.860 --> 19:10.960
to formulate it there that has taken a lot of the lessons

19:10.960 --> 19:13.840
learned from the virtual events we've seen over 2020

19:13.840 --> 19:16.120
and brought a lot of the best ideas together.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.160
Yeah, I really hope so.

19:17.160 --> 19:21.540
I mean, this is our first event, so not going down in flames

19:21.540 --> 19:24.560
would be awesome, but also being able to do something really

19:24.560 --> 19:27.860
useful and fun for the community would be cool.

19:27.860 --> 19:30.400
I just want one day to just have the,

19:30.400 --> 19:32.280
I want this to be successful so that one day we're

19:32.280 --> 19:33.600
doing this in person.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.120
We're drinking beers.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.840
We're hanging out again.

19:36.840 --> 19:38.960
It's like a full nerd event.

19:38.960 --> 19:40.880
And so this is the first step, I think.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.700
Yeah, and I think that's the best part about creating

19:43.700 --> 19:46.840
these kind of conferences is like hallway conversations

19:46.840 --> 19:49.840
and going out afterwards and really

19:49.840 --> 19:51.760
that community and camaraderie and friendship.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.140
So hopefully we can springboard from this

19:54.140 --> 19:56.600
into a much larger in-person event.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.240
Absolutely.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.160
Well, Dan, thanks for joining us and telling us about it.

20:00.160 --> 20:02.480
Yeah, thank you very much for giving me a space to.

20:02.480 --> 20:05.960
And also here today on the show is Dalton from Ubuntu Touch,

20:05.960 --> 20:09.080
and they just had a new release, OTA 16.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.360
And Dalton joined us on Linux Action News

20:11.360 --> 20:14.800
to go into some of the details and nitty gritties

20:14.800 --> 20:16.340
about the release.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.480
And it's looking like it's running pretty sharp

20:18.480 --> 20:19.600
on the 3.8 Dalton.

20:19.600 --> 20:20.640
Oh, you got it installed?

20:20.640 --> 20:25.160
No, no, but I wouldn't YouTube spelunking.

20:25.160 --> 20:28.040
So it turns out it's not Wes that has the 3.8,

20:28.040 --> 20:30.500
so I wasn't able to take his phone and flash it.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.680
Man, you got me so excited there.

20:32.680 --> 20:34.560
And dang it, you still took my phone.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.560
Yeah, well, I just wanted to wipe it.

20:36.560 --> 20:37.400
There's reasons.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.820
Let's just put it that way.

20:38.820 --> 20:43.080
Also really cool that we are almost at the four-year mark

20:43.080 --> 20:45.440
since this became an independent project.

20:45.440 --> 20:49.040
Yeah, it's kind of crazy to think that.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.280
April 5, 2021 is our four-year anniversary.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.680
Man, does it feel like it's been four years,

20:54.680 --> 20:56.080
or does it feel like it's been 10?

20:56.080 --> 20:57.680
Both.

20:57.680 --> 21:00.280
It's like having a kid, yeah.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.320
It's interesting, because I know you guys have

21:02.320 --> 21:03.520
been really super committed.

21:03.520 --> 21:08.400
It feels like it's just been a four-year push, really.

21:08.400 --> 21:12.080
But it kind of feels like it's coming together.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.160
I mean, of course, there's a transition to 2004

21:14.160 --> 21:15.520
on the horizon, but right now, it

21:15.520 --> 21:16.640
looks like it's getting pretty solid.

21:16.640 --> 21:17.600
The Pixel's out there.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.140
The Vala phone's out there.

21:19.140 --> 21:20.720
The 3a is a great phone.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.040
A new Samsung phone just got support.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.120
I mean, it's kind of all coming together right now.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.400
It really does feel like that.

21:26.400 --> 21:30.640
It just feels like we're in a really good, decent place

21:30.640 --> 21:33.480
to work on the project and do things

21:33.480 --> 21:35.800
that we think are fun in addition to things

21:35.800 --> 21:37.760
that move the needle forward.

21:37.760 --> 21:39.100
Well, you know, Dalton, something

21:39.100 --> 21:41.820
we didn't touch on in the Linux action news chat

21:41.820 --> 21:43.760
that maybe we should touch on here

21:43.760 --> 21:47.840
is I didn't realize that in their effort at Vala phone

21:47.840 --> 21:52.880
to support Ubuntu Touch, they have set up at least some people

21:52.880 --> 21:55.760
in their offices that are supporting Ubuntu Touch

21:55.760 --> 21:56.440
directly.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.720
They're developing and working on Ubuntu Touch

21:59.720 --> 22:02.120
now and getting paid by Vala, right?

22:02.120 --> 22:03.040
That's correct.

22:03.040 --> 22:03.640
Yes.

22:03.640 --> 22:04.760
That seems like a big development.

22:04.760 --> 22:07.640
Can you give me an idea of how long you expect that to be

22:07.640 --> 22:10.280
and how big of an impact you expect that to make?

22:10.280 --> 22:13.040
Ooh, how much can I say about?

22:13.040 --> 22:15.200
Yeah, I understand it could be kind of tricky.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.320
So what you are comfortable sharing is fine.

22:17.320 --> 22:20.880
I feel like it's a long-term investment for them.

22:20.880 --> 22:26.000
They feel like this is important to their platform as Vala

22:26.000 --> 22:29.920
and to mobile use cases in general.

22:29.920 --> 22:32.880
There is some other cool stuff coming up

22:32.880 --> 22:35.880
that I don't know when it's going to come to fruition

22:35.880 --> 22:39.280
and especially not in full light.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.700
But I can just say it's really cool,

22:41.700 --> 22:43.640
and I can't wait to talk about it.

22:43.640 --> 22:45.120
And it'll probably be more reason

22:45.120 --> 22:48.060
why they would need staff to support the OS,

22:48.060 --> 22:48.800
I would imagine.

22:48.800 --> 22:49.720
Yeah.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.240
Yeah, OK, interesting.

22:51.240 --> 22:52.620
That's really exciting, man.

22:52.620 --> 22:54.200
I'm getting kind of like to the point

22:54.200 --> 22:56.240
where I'm feeling kind of ashamed that I'm not running it

22:56.240 --> 22:57.120
on a device currently.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.160
Like that's the state it's gotten to.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.560
It's like, oh, this is something I

23:00.560 --> 23:03.760
need to start checking in on now.

23:03.760 --> 23:05.760
Should I wait until the transition to 2004,

23:05.760 --> 23:07.080
or should I just go for it?

23:07.080 --> 23:09.840
I'd say just go for it.

23:09.840 --> 23:10.600
Good answer.

23:10.600 --> 23:11.760
Very good answer.

23:11.760 --> 23:14.120
Well, Dalton, thanks for coming by and updating us.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.320
Thanks for bringing me in.

23:15.320 --> 23:16.720
It was good to chat with you.

23:16.720 --> 23:17.480
Go check it out.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.520
OTA 16 just came out last week.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.560
And we will have a link to that in the show notes.

23:21.560 --> 23:25.080
And more details about the release in this week's Linux

23:25.080 --> 23:26.400
Action News.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.880
Now, something that we don't have details about yet,

23:28.880 --> 23:32.040
but I just want to let you know that if you are running

23:32.040 --> 23:33.700
the security updates for any of the boxes,

23:33.700 --> 23:37.200
if you're responsible for that, the OpenSSL project

23:37.200 --> 23:39.860
is bracing us for a big update.

23:39.860 --> 23:42.760
They are announcing an announcement.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.360
And they're telling us that there

23:44.360 --> 23:49.120
will be a new release of OpenSSL on Thursday the 25th of March

23:49.120 --> 23:50.560
2021.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.200
And they're even giving us a time range

23:52.200 --> 23:55.200
between 1,300 and 1,700 UTC.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.720
It's a security fix for a high severity issue.

23:58.720 --> 24:00.400
You just don't see this very often, Wes.

24:00.400 --> 24:00.880
No.

24:00.880 --> 24:03.760
I guess we know exactly where our sysadmin friends are

24:03.760 --> 24:04.420
going to be.

24:04.420 --> 24:04.920
Yep.

24:04.920 --> 24:07.280
Maybe it's a good time to rob them.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.640
Wow.

24:08.640 --> 24:09.440
Wow.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.260
Yeah, because you know this is going to be really public,

24:11.260 --> 24:11.560
right?

24:11.560 --> 24:14.320
So this is one that people are really getting to jump on.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.800
Yeah, we're going to try to get full coverage, a full breakdown

24:16.800 --> 24:19.140
in Sunday's land, because we should have all

24:19.140 --> 24:21.400
of the information by the time we're recording Linux Action

24:21.400 --> 24:21.560
News.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.020
We just don't know much right now.

24:23.020 --> 24:24.480
We could speculate, but that just

24:24.480 --> 24:26.040
wouldn't do anyone any good.

24:26.040 --> 24:26.800
So we won't.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.520
Linode.com slash unplugged.

24:31.520 --> 24:35.120
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards your new account

24:35.120 --> 24:37.000
and go there to support the show.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.320
$100 means you can really try it out.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.400
You can do a lot.

24:40.400 --> 24:42.340
Linode is our cloud server provider.

24:42.340 --> 24:46.720
And what we're about to tell you about just in a few moments

24:46.720 --> 24:48.440
was done on Linode.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.480
We always use Linode for these experiments,

24:50.480 --> 24:52.720
because it's super quick to spin up a system.

24:52.720 --> 24:53.960
It's really easy.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.480
It's also really easy to clone them and back them up

24:56.480 --> 24:58.000
and take snapshots.

24:58.000 --> 25:01.520
And so within minutes, we'll get something up and running,

25:01.520 --> 25:03.200
and we can take a risk.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.880
We can take a risk of breaking something

25:04.880 --> 25:06.280
that might destroy the networking,

25:06.280 --> 25:08.000
and then we can't connect to it, because it's really easy

25:08.000 --> 25:09.440
just to revert back.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.840
So that kind of flexibility makes

25:10.840 --> 25:13.200
it super easy for Wes and I to prototype ideas

25:13.200 --> 25:16.340
for infrastructure, but also for show segments.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.760
And I know that that would translate for your projects

25:18.760 --> 25:19.280
as well.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.440
And so I think that's something worth just using the $100

25:21.440 --> 25:22.800
credit for right there.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.280
But personally, one of the things

25:24.280 --> 25:26.760
that I really like about Linode as a longtime Linux fan,

25:26.760 --> 25:27.840
don't know if you knew that, but I've

25:27.840 --> 25:29.360
liked Linux for a little while.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.580
They really support just about all the Linuxes,

25:31.580 --> 25:33.080
and even some of the ones you might not

25:33.080 --> 25:34.120
want to run in the cloud.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.160
But you got your reasons.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.480
Even the Sooses, even the Sooses.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.360
Actually, of course, the Sooses are up there.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.280
They have a bunch of distributions they support.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.480
I like that a lot.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.800
But there's other features we play more with now

25:45.800 --> 25:48.120
than I expected.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.760
I'm always constantly finding new ways

25:49.760 --> 25:52.720
to use object storage for back end storage for things that,

25:52.720 --> 25:55.160
especially things that are shared between systems,

25:55.160 --> 25:58.080
or when we need to send a segment to a sponsor

25:58.080 --> 26:00.520
or an interviewee, we're using object storage for that now

26:00.520 --> 26:02.100
too, because a lot of times, they're

26:02.100 --> 26:04.560
bigger than what a lot of email server attachments support.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.400
And so we just use the Linode command line tool

26:06.400 --> 26:07.960
to pop it up on the object storage

26:07.960 --> 26:10.080
and generate a public link.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.280
It's fantastic.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.360
It really is nice to just find ways to integrate it

26:13.360 --> 26:15.920
into your workflow, because these tools are really good.

26:15.920 --> 26:17.580
Some of the stuff we're about to talk about,

26:17.580 --> 26:19.920
you could achieve with Linode's Cloud Firewall.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.360
They started in 2003, and so they've

26:22.360 --> 26:26.040
had time to really focus on how to do this right.

26:26.040 --> 26:28.040
They haven't gone off and tried to create

26:28.040 --> 26:30.000
every single different service under the sun

26:30.000 --> 26:31.300
and do all this different stuff.

26:31.300 --> 26:34.380
They've really focused in on what they're good at.

26:34.380 --> 26:36.880
And over the years, they've built something really awesome.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.320
In 2016, they took over control of their networking

26:39.320 --> 26:41.200
and became their own ISP.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.920
On some of their dedicated CPU rigs,

26:43.920 --> 26:46.540
they have some really high-end AMD Epic CPUs

26:46.540 --> 26:47.920
that are just crazy fast.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.620
They have great disk I.O. They have fantastic network

26:50.620 --> 26:52.280
connections, 40 gigabit connections

26:52.280 --> 26:53.640
coming into the hypervisor.

26:53.640 --> 26:55.840
They're dedicated to offering the best virtualized cloud

26:55.840 --> 26:56.320
computing.

26:56.320 --> 26:58.760
If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.

26:58.760 --> 26:59.840
But go try it yourself.

26:59.840 --> 27:02.320
I mean, $100 really means you can actually try it.

27:02.320 --> 27:05.320
So go over there and give it a go and support the show.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.280
Linode.com slash unplugged.

27:07.280 --> 27:12.880
We have some potential news for the Linux kernel.

27:12.880 --> 27:16.440
And it's pretty exciting, Wes, because it involves

27:16.440 --> 27:18.120
one of our favorite technologies.

27:18.120 --> 27:18.880
Uh-oh.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.520
I think I know what's coming next.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.160
Initial support for the Rust language

27:31.160 --> 27:35.440
has landed in Linux Next, which I assume you all are probably

27:35.440 --> 27:36.920
just running it already.

27:36.920 --> 27:39.640
But for a long time now, Linux kernel developers

27:39.640 --> 27:43.040
have pondered the prospects of allowing the Rust language

27:43.040 --> 27:48.040
to be used in kernel device drivers, kernel device

27:48.040 --> 27:50.640
drivers, which could be a particular area of interest

27:50.640 --> 27:54.720
for Rust and could potentially bring some of Rust's

27:54.720 --> 27:58.520
best features like safety and performance to device drivers.

27:58.520 --> 28:02.600
So announced just recently on the Rust for Linux mailing list

28:02.600 --> 28:06.720
was word of initial Rust support hitting Linux Next.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.120
Although, the announcement was quick to note

28:09.120 --> 28:12.120
that this does not mean we'll make it into mainline,

28:12.120 --> 28:13.000
of course.

28:13.000 --> 28:17.120
But it's a nice step to make things as smooth as possible.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.840
Of course, another issue with all this

28:18.840 --> 28:22.240
is support is obviously conditional on having

28:22.240 --> 28:23.840
a Rust compiler on the system that you're

28:23.840 --> 28:24.760
building the kernel on.

28:24.760 --> 28:25.520
That's a good point.

28:25.520 --> 28:26.880
But really, if you think about it,

28:26.880 --> 28:29.800
that's kind of a good place to start for this kind of thing.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.280
Because you're going to have less platforms you're building

28:32.280 --> 28:33.440
40 ways with device drivers.

28:33.440 --> 28:36.160
They target fewer platforms to begin with.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.640
So it kind of seems like there would be a lot of benefits

28:38.640 --> 28:40.720
to drivers in Rust as well.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.560
And it's not an area that's going to really break anything

28:43.560 --> 28:44.160
major.

28:44.160 --> 28:44.440
Right.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.920
You're not like rewriting the whole kernel.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.360
You're just saying, hey, I've got a new device.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.960
This was going to be new code anyway.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.720
Or maybe it's some old code that was never very good.

28:51.720 --> 28:53.560
Let's see what it looks like in Rust.

28:53.560 --> 28:57.240
While Rust is now in Linux Next, we should be clear.

28:57.240 --> 28:59.560
It's not yet known if it's actually

28:59.560 --> 29:00.840
going to get into mainline.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.000
That depends on some stuff.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.240
How does Linux Next bake?

29:03.240 --> 29:04.560
Could stay in there for a while.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.240
Could end up never getting merged.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.920
But it's a step in the right direction.

29:08.920 --> 29:11.400
And it seems like some of the kernel leaders, including

29:11.400 --> 29:13.080
Linus, have some thoughts.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.040
Yeah, that's true.

29:14.040 --> 29:17.320
Greg KH has chimed in on the matter.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.960
They all kind of have an air of skepticism,

29:19.960 --> 29:22.320
as they probably should, regarding this issue,

29:22.320 --> 29:24.720
I would imagine.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.280
They've talked about this.

29:26.280 --> 29:29.160
But they've kind of looked at it as, OK, we can give it a go.

29:29.160 --> 29:33.200
Linus Torvalds says, personally, I'm in no way pushing for Rust.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.000
But I'm open to considering it.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.840
The promised advantages of avoiding some safety pitfalls

29:37.840 --> 29:39.080
seem good.

29:39.080 --> 29:43.360
But I also know that a lot of times, some of these promises

29:43.360 --> 29:45.560
don't pan out.

29:45.560 --> 29:46.720
Isn't that true?

29:46.720 --> 29:50.280
The part that I like in this is just sort of getting support

29:50.280 --> 29:53.200
for this, people not saying no, and letting people

29:53.200 --> 29:56.280
hack on what that initial implementation looks like.

29:56.280 --> 29:58.680
How does this play with the existing methods and data

29:58.680 --> 30:00.680
structures that exist in the kernel?

30:00.680 --> 30:03.440
Can people figure out some of that low-level integration

30:03.440 --> 30:04.960
work, so that down the road, maybe we

30:04.960 --> 30:07.400
can benefit from the pool of people that already know Rust

30:07.400 --> 30:08.880
and want to contribute a device driver,

30:08.880 --> 30:10.880
but really didn't want to do it in C?

30:10.880 --> 30:12.520
There you go, Wes.

30:12.520 --> 30:14.480
We knew eventually it would make its way.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.040
Will it ever actually ship?

30:16.040 --> 30:16.760
We will see.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.040
But Rust is invading the kernel.

30:19.040 --> 30:31.800
All right, let's tidy it up a little bit around here.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.560
I want to let you know to keep an ear out

30:33.560 --> 30:37.760
for episode 401 of your Linux talk show.

30:37.760 --> 30:39.680
401, I chat with someone who ended up

30:39.680 --> 30:43.920
building a Linux-powered bus to automate, to build, all of it.

30:43.920 --> 30:45.000
He didn't know any of it.

30:45.000 --> 30:45.720
He didn't know Linux.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.120
He had to learn it all from scratch

30:47.120 --> 30:48.560
at each step of the way.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.440
And I sit down for a chat with him, and we discuss that.

30:51.440 --> 30:54.360
And that is coming in episode 401,

30:54.360 --> 30:58.000
which means we're taking 401 off.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.240
Well, we're not taking it off.

30:59.240 --> 31:01.440
But we won't be live, because it'll be prerecorded.

31:01.440 --> 31:02.240
You know how that makes sense?

31:02.240 --> 31:03.840
So if you're subscribed, you're going to get it.

31:03.840 --> 31:04.960
Probably don't even need to mention it.

31:04.960 --> 31:06.760
But I wanted to let you know that if you do

31:06.760 --> 31:08.280
like to join us live on the 13th,

31:08.280 --> 31:10.040
we will not be live as a result. But then

31:10.040 --> 31:12.840
we'll be back to our regular bat time after that.

31:12.840 --> 31:15.280
All of this is just easy to keep track of in our Telegram

31:15.280 --> 31:18.320
group at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

31:18.320 --> 31:19.480
So you can join that.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.600
Maybe if you were going to join live,

31:21.600 --> 31:23.560
use that time to figure out your mumble setup

31:23.560 --> 31:24.880
if you haven't done that already.

31:24.880 --> 31:25.360
Yep.

31:25.360 --> 31:27.880
We have that link at linuxunplug.com.

31:27.880 --> 31:30.680
This Sunday as we record, so coming up really soon,

31:30.680 --> 31:33.520
I want to encourage you to join the LepLug.

31:33.520 --> 31:37.200
Minimek, you have some details about a great Lug session

31:37.200 --> 31:38.280
coming up this Sunday.

31:38.280 --> 31:38.800
Yeah.

31:38.800 --> 31:41.080
What I can say, LepLug is going strong.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.920
And we will have another recording next Sunday.

31:43.920 --> 31:45.680
And there will be the presentation of a tool

31:45.680 --> 31:47.640
called Meerschaum.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.680
So if you have seen the movie National Treasure,

31:49.680 --> 31:51.960
you know what a Meerschaum pipe is.

31:51.960 --> 31:54.480
So now I could try to tell you about that project.

31:54.480 --> 31:58.080
But we have the developer of the tool right here in Mumble.

31:58.080 --> 32:02.240
So Bennett, tell us what you will be talking about.

32:02.240 --> 32:03.280
Thanks, Minimek.

32:03.280 --> 32:06.640
And hey to all you sysadmins and Linux lovers out there.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.720
So in the next LepLug this Sunday on March 28th,

32:09.720 --> 32:12.880
check jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar to get

32:12.880 --> 32:14.320
the time in your time zone.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.520
I will be presenting a passion project of mine

32:16.520 --> 32:18.000
called Meerschaum.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.400
Meerschaum is an open source data management system

32:20.400 --> 32:22.040
which makes getting your time series

32:22.040 --> 32:26.040
data onto a dashboard as quick and easy as possible.

32:26.040 --> 32:28.280
I'm always looking for feedback and user testing.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.280
So if you'd like to help out, please

32:30.280 --> 32:31.800
join us in the next LepLug.

32:31.800 --> 32:33.320
You can read more about Meerschaum

32:33.320 --> 32:36.920
at meerschaum.io or mrsm.io.

32:36.920 --> 32:38.840
I hope to see you all next Sunday.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.720
That's going to be great.

32:40.720 --> 32:44.360
Like you said, the dates and time are on the calendar.

32:44.360 --> 32:47.920
There's also a LepLug channel on our matrix

32:47.920 --> 32:50.120
if you want to jump in there and start chatting.

32:50.120 --> 32:52.760
All of the info, the mumble info, the matrix info,

32:52.760 --> 32:54.200
it's all linuxunplug.com.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.000
Just make it easy.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.480
You just go over there, and you'll find it all.

32:57.480 --> 33:02.520
And with that, that's all the tidying we have for this week.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.920
So we wanted to share our favorite network trick with you

33:05.920 --> 33:06.520
this week.

33:06.520 --> 33:10.880
It's something that we've done in various iterations

33:10.880 --> 33:14.000
over the last year to let the chat room come in live

33:14.000 --> 33:15.600
and abuse a machine we have on our land.

33:15.600 --> 33:19.080
I mean, obviously, I don't want to expose the studio's

33:19.080 --> 33:22.440
public IP, but I want to give people an IP to connect to

33:22.440 --> 33:24.880
so they can interact with what we're doing.

33:24.880 --> 33:26.760
Some of you may also have a desire

33:26.760 --> 33:28.560
to self-host something at home.

33:28.560 --> 33:32.360
But perhaps your ISP blocks ports, or maybe like me,

33:32.360 --> 33:37.840
you're behind some kind of crazy carrier-grade net.

33:37.840 --> 33:40.560
There are ways to get around it.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.960
And one way to get around it is a new service

33:42.960 --> 33:45.040
that's launched called Hoppy.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.520
And this is a way to do what we're about to tell you about,

33:47.520 --> 33:50.600
but just do it real easy through their service.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.080
And it's also one of the reasons that Wes and I have been

33:53.080 --> 33:57.240
so keen to follow WireGuard, because we knew since we saw

33:57.240 --> 34:00.320
the announcement that when it landed in Linux distributions

34:00.320 --> 34:02.720
and made it into the kernel, it was

34:02.720 --> 34:05.240
going to enable all kinds of network connectivity

34:05.240 --> 34:07.640
fun, trickery, and solutions that we hadn't really

34:07.640 --> 34:10.680
seen before, and make some older solutions that are still

34:10.680 --> 34:13.280
viable, but make them seem a little obsolete.

34:13.280 --> 34:15.960
And Hoppy is a good example of this.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.560
Hoppy.network has created a business built

34:18.560 --> 34:21.840
around WireGuard and Linux.

34:21.840 --> 34:24.120
It's a service that lets you get a public IP on a machine

34:24.120 --> 34:27.440
behind an ad, which is a big win for us self-hosters.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.920
And I chatted with both the co-founders this morning

34:29.920 --> 34:32.280
to get an idea of how it all works.

34:32.280 --> 34:33.480
I chatted with Yoon.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.720
My name is Yoon, or Yoon Sik Park.

34:35.720 --> 34:39.360
And I am the co-founder of Hoppy Network.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.280
And his other co-founder, Logan.

34:41.280 --> 34:44.800
My name is Logan Collins, and I am a co-founder at Hoppy

34:44.800 --> 34:45.520
Network.

34:45.520 --> 34:49.000
And I asked them to give us the elevator pitch on what Hoppy is

34:49.000 --> 34:51.120
so you guys could understand the value.

34:51.120 --> 34:57.320
Hoppy is how you can lease a public IP address

34:57.320 --> 35:00.040
and attach it to any device that you want.

35:00.040 --> 35:03.200
It's a way of making a device public to the world

35:03.200 --> 35:06.000
and bypassing any kind of inconvenient networking

35:06.000 --> 35:08.520
situations that you might have.

35:08.520 --> 35:12.680
It's a way of enabling you to self-host your own services

35:12.680 --> 35:14.360
and take back a little bit of control

35:14.360 --> 35:17.080
in the digital landscape that's been changing

35:17.080 --> 35:18.440
over the last couple of years.

35:18.440 --> 35:19.480
I like this idea.

35:19.480 --> 35:22.120
I knew why Wes and I wanted to accomplish something like this.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.120
So I asked them what was their motivation.

35:24.120 --> 35:26.920
It kind of arose out of my self-hosting journey.

35:26.920 --> 35:31.560
I was trying to decrease my reliance on iCloud specifically,

35:31.560 --> 35:33.280
trying to self-host everything.

35:33.280 --> 35:37.000
And the biggest roadblock was self-hosting a mail server.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.320
And the reason is most ports are unblocked at home

35:40.320 --> 35:43.560
except for SMTP or port 25.

35:43.560 --> 35:45.840
And that's because this port specifically

35:45.840 --> 35:47.600
is used to spam others.

35:47.600 --> 35:50.560
And a lot of ISPs want to block that.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.480
There wasn't a way I could really get around that

35:52.480 --> 35:56.400
without putting my server into the cloud again.

35:56.400 --> 36:01.640
And I thought, is there a way to get a IP address and unblock

36:01.640 --> 36:03.720
ports within my own home?

36:03.720 --> 36:06.200
And I was looking into different VPN services

36:06.200 --> 36:07.560
that could accomplish that.

36:07.560 --> 36:09.560
And there wasn't really anything like that.

36:09.560 --> 36:14.240
And I spent a few months learning about networking.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.920
And what I came up with was a prototype

36:16.920 --> 36:20.080
of Hoppy Network that would actually accomplish that.

36:20.080 --> 36:22.280
And like you probably are right now,

36:22.280 --> 36:25.080
I was wondering, how does it work?

36:25.080 --> 36:28.640
Each one of our servers, they use BGP

36:28.640 --> 36:34.360
to get access to an IPv4 block as well as an IPv6 block.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.840
But I'll just simplify it for now.

36:36.840 --> 36:39.560
And that's slash 24 cents split up

36:39.560 --> 36:41.440
across the different WireGuard clients.

36:41.440 --> 36:47.000
So in our routing tables, we have each IP address routed

36:47.000 --> 36:48.600
to the WireGuard interface.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.840
So as long as you have that WireGuard interface connected

36:51.840 --> 36:55.840
to us, we'll try to forward that IPv4

36:55.840 --> 36:58.240
address over that interface.

36:58.240 --> 37:02.720
And once your client receives that packet,

37:02.720 --> 37:04.640
as long as your client is configured properly

37:04.640 --> 37:08.520
to assign that IPv4 address to its own interface,

37:08.520 --> 37:11.440
then it'll just accept IPv4 addresses

37:11.440 --> 37:14.840
as if it was like a native system interface.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.000
To use an analogy that is horrible,

37:17.000 --> 37:20.560
but I still love using it, you can imagine these WireGuard

37:20.560 --> 37:23.000
tunnels between our server and yours

37:23.000 --> 37:25.520
as a giant ethernet cable that is just,

37:25.520 --> 37:29.040
it's like you plugged in a new cable into your F0 port

37:29.040 --> 37:32.880
or whatever, and you got assigned this public IP

37:32.880 --> 37:34.000
to that network interface.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.720
As far as your machine is concerned,

37:35.720 --> 37:39.320
you have this public IP address, and we don't exist.

37:39.320 --> 37:42.280
All the ports are open because the traffic for that IP

37:42.280 --> 37:43.840
is coming directly to you.

37:43.840 --> 37:45.760
So obviously, my next question was, well,

37:45.760 --> 37:50.160
what about security, monitoring, those kinds of issues?

37:50.160 --> 37:53.000
First of all, nobody can man in the middle of you

37:53.000 --> 37:55.720
because the connected WireGuard is fully encrypted.

37:55.720 --> 37:59.960
Between us and you, the traffic is encrypted,

37:59.960 --> 38:02.360
nobody can view it, it's really great.

38:02.360 --> 38:06.520
Between us and whatever client is connecting to you,

38:06.520 --> 38:10.800
your IP is public, you should be using SSL or something.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.840
We're not looking, we don't care what you're doing.

38:12.840 --> 38:15.160
And we have a really good privacy policy,

38:15.160 --> 38:19.040
it's less than a page long, anybody can read it,

38:19.040 --> 38:20.880
it's something we adhere to.

38:20.880 --> 38:24.320
I think Logan's saying there's not much we can do

38:24.320 --> 38:27.520
other than promise that we won't spy.

38:27.520 --> 38:29.960
And after we had wrapped up and I was saying goodbye to them,

38:29.960 --> 38:34.440
they gave me another insight that wasn't prompted,

38:34.440 --> 38:35.840
but it was just something that came up

38:35.840 --> 38:37.440
while we were saying our goodbyes.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.640
And I thought it showed that their hearts really were

38:39.640 --> 38:41.280
in the right place with this project.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.480
It's new, but I think their goals

38:44.480 --> 38:46.360
align with what we'd like to see.

38:46.360 --> 38:49.360
We hope that this service encourages people

38:49.360 --> 38:53.440
to self-host more, it also encourages IPv6 adoption

38:53.440 --> 38:56.720
because you get like a slash 56 as well.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.840
Pretty much we want to make the internet a better place.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.040
Yeah, and that's about it.

39:00.040 --> 39:02.520
So cheers to them, thanks for coming on guys this morning

39:02.520 --> 39:03.640
and chatting with me about it.

39:03.640 --> 39:06.000
You can find it at hoppy.network.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.600
And they've created a business around

39:07.600 --> 39:10.240
making it really simple for you to get around NAT

39:10.240 --> 39:11.440
using WireGuard.

39:11.440 --> 39:13.120
You just connect to their WireGuard instance

39:13.120 --> 39:13.960
they have hosted.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.840
Now, of course, you could do this yourself too.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.920
And so that's what Wes and I want to talk about today

39:18.920 --> 39:23.560
is while we found Hoppy during kind of investigating

39:23.560 --> 39:25.960
different ways to improve our solution for the studio,

39:25.960 --> 39:28.840
we thought, you know, there's probably reasons

39:28.840 --> 39:31.120
we could do this ourselves and would want to do this

39:31.120 --> 39:33.080
for ourself and pondered how we could get around

39:33.080 --> 39:35.840
my extreme double carrier grade mutant NAT

39:35.840 --> 39:38.680
that I have at home and take advantage of that as well.

39:38.680 --> 39:43.000
That thing, I mean, we've had to try a lot of solutions

39:43.000 --> 39:45.680
and I think it's safe to say that your home networking

39:45.680 --> 39:47.840
is not exactly simple at this point.

39:47.840 --> 39:52.280
No, no, it's even crazier now that I aggregate two carriers.

39:52.280 --> 39:55.040
Okay, yeah, let's put that aside just for a second here

39:55.040 --> 39:57.840
because regardless, there are a lot of ways

39:57.840 --> 39:59.040
to solve this problem.

39:59.040 --> 40:01.240
Probably a lot that the audience is definitely

40:01.240 --> 40:02.160
already familiar with, right?

40:02.160 --> 40:04.160
You've got things like SSH forwarding,

40:04.160 --> 40:05.120
that's super resilient.

40:05.120 --> 40:07.160
You can do all kinds of fun tunneling,

40:07.160 --> 40:08.320
take local ports and forward them,

40:08.320 --> 40:11.040
take remote parts and forward them, all kinds of stuff.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.840
Maybe you use a service like ngrok,

40:12.840 --> 40:15.760
which I suppose focused perhaps more on developers

40:15.760 --> 40:17.960
exposing HTTP services on the web

40:17.960 --> 40:21.880
but does the same kind of NAT busting and NAT traversal

40:21.880 --> 40:23.000
and forwarding you and putting you

40:23.000 --> 40:26.200
on the public interface and proxying to you.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.560
That's also another approach, right?

40:27.560 --> 40:30.280
Like you could just use a VPN like WireGuard

40:30.280 --> 40:33.080
and then a reverse proxy setup on your cloud host

40:33.080 --> 40:35.960
like nginx or traffic if you've already got multiple sites

40:35.960 --> 40:37.760
or you're just familiar with how those work

40:37.760 --> 40:41.480
or you want it to do TLS termination for you anyway.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.840
But of course, this is Linux Unplugged.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.400
We started things off using WireGuard.

40:47.720 --> 40:48.560
We do love it.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.960
And part of why we love it is because it's like,

40:50.960 --> 40:53.600
it's just so integrated into Linux at this point, right?

40:53.600 --> 40:56.040
Especially now that it's merged into the kernel,

40:56.040 --> 40:57.800
it just makes it easy to play

40:57.800 --> 40:59.560
in whatever complicated networking setup

40:59.560 --> 41:01.880
you might already have like Chris

41:01.880 --> 41:04.280
or if you just wanna play with whatever tools are integrated

41:04.280 --> 41:06.680
that come installed on your Linux OS.

41:06.680 --> 41:07.800
Once you've got WireGuard,

41:07.800 --> 41:10.920
all the normal sort of IP and Linux networking tricks

41:10.920 --> 41:13.920
that you might have, those work just fine

41:13.920 --> 41:16.440
including what was maybe our first approach to this

41:16.440 --> 41:19.360
which is just forwarding ports with IP tables

41:19.360 --> 41:20.920
over that WireGuard connection.

41:20.920 --> 41:23.600
Yeah, and you know, it's not bad.

41:23.600 --> 41:25.120
We use that setup for a bit

41:25.120 --> 41:28.720
and this might be the one I would recommend for most people

41:28.720 --> 41:31.080
because it essentially becomes a cloud firewall.

41:31.080 --> 41:36.080
You allow certain ports like in our case, 80 and 443

41:36.120 --> 41:37.720
and only those ports.

41:37.720 --> 41:40.000
And so you're not sending every bot

41:40.000 --> 41:42.080
that wants to come knock on your SSH port

41:42.080 --> 41:44.440
over your connection to your home machine.

41:44.440 --> 41:48.320
You're blocking it there at the VPS level using IP tables.

41:48.320 --> 41:51.200
And so this is neat because you set up IP tables

41:51.200 --> 41:53.360
to forward those things down the WireGuard connection.

41:53.360 --> 41:55.480
It's a pretty simple straightforward connection.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.160
It can be done with literally

41:57.160 --> 42:00.120
just a couple of lines of IP tables rules.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.360
I mean, very simple.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.240
Yeah, I mean, I think our sort of proof of concept

42:03.240 --> 42:06.080
was two commands and that was it once WireGuard was set up.

42:06.080 --> 42:08.960
Yeah, and then you're just sending those two approved ports

42:08.960 --> 42:10.240
back to the machine,

42:10.240 --> 42:12.960
which I think is probably the ideal solution.

42:12.960 --> 42:15.920
But what if you wanted the entire machine,

42:15.920 --> 42:17.680
like maybe you wanted to expose a firewall

42:17.680 --> 42:19.480
that had a WireGuard connection on it

42:19.480 --> 42:21.920
and you wanted to then manage it at that firewall level.

42:21.920 --> 42:23.720
Right, or, you know, in this case, it's sort of,

42:23.720 --> 42:26.560
it's much like the just running a proxy on the box.

42:26.560 --> 42:28.280
You kind of have to manage both boxes, right?

42:28.280 --> 42:30.240
Like when you add a new service on your backend,

42:30.240 --> 42:31.920
you got to go tell the front end about it too

42:31.920 --> 42:33.120
and make sure that that's all working,

42:33.120 --> 42:35.120
it gets properly forwarded and allowed,

42:35.120 --> 42:38.480
which as you say, that can definitely be a good thing.

42:38.480 --> 42:40.840
And you should take security seriously.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.400
But sometimes you just want to say, you know,

42:42.400 --> 42:44.320
maybe you're not on a network where you could forward ports

42:44.320 --> 42:45.560
so you don't have full control.

42:45.560 --> 42:47.760
And you really just, as you're testing something out,

42:47.760 --> 42:50.280
you want to expose this machine, put it in the DMZ,

42:50.280 --> 42:52.880
get it right out there on the internet.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.760
And yeah, with WireGuard, you can do that too.

42:55.760 --> 42:59.400
Yeah, in fact, we have done just that.

42:59.400 --> 43:02.560
In your browsers right now, you can do it after the fact

43:02.560 --> 43:07.560
or while you're listening live, go to WireGuard.club.

43:07.560 --> 43:08.800
I should make sure this is still up.

43:08.800 --> 43:11.640
WireGuard.club in your web browser.

43:11.640 --> 43:15.440
And what you will get is a beautiful,

43:15.440 --> 43:17.520
extremely intricate website

43:17.520 --> 43:20.400
that I spent hours building just for you

43:20.400 --> 43:23.600
that is actually running on a VM on the machine

43:23.600 --> 43:26.160
I have right in front of me in the studio right now.

43:26.160 --> 43:28.000
I didn't know you knew web design.

43:28.000 --> 43:28.840
Look at that, right?

43:28.840 --> 43:30.320
It's pro work right there.

43:30.320 --> 43:32.480
Your connection will hop through a Linode,

43:32.480 --> 43:35.160
running WireGuard back to a VM on my machine.

43:35.160 --> 43:37.920
So the VM has the WireGuard client active,

43:37.920 --> 43:39.280
connected to the Linode,

43:39.280 --> 43:41.240
which is then routing all of the traffic down here.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.800
So how the heck did we do this, Wes?

43:43.800 --> 43:46.680
Oh boy, well, yeah, definitely WireGuard is involved.

43:46.680 --> 43:48.720
And so we were just talking about sort of the,

43:48.720 --> 43:50.520
maybe traditional port forwarding approach.

43:50.520 --> 43:51.800
And in that style,

43:51.800 --> 43:53.560
you basically just set up your WireGuard tunnel

43:53.560 --> 43:56.240
and you've assigned sort of private IPS behind there, right?

43:56.240 --> 43:58.080
So you can talk between them.

43:58.080 --> 43:59.480
And if you're just on local host there

43:59.480 --> 44:03.320
on your box in the cloud, your Linode, your VPS,

44:03.320 --> 44:05.280
you can go hit that private service.

44:06.160 --> 44:09.960
But you need iptables to both forward the ports on

44:09.960 --> 44:11.760
so that things from the internet can get there.

44:11.760 --> 44:14.080
But also because the whole WireGuard system,

44:14.080 --> 44:17.120
that's using private IPv4 addresses,

44:17.120 --> 44:19.120
you also have to introduce NAT.

44:19.120 --> 44:21.840
And sometimes you just don't want that.

44:21.840 --> 44:22.800
I mean, it works fine.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.560
Linux kernel is great at doing that.

44:24.560 --> 44:26.160
And iptables has no problems.

44:26.160 --> 44:29.600
It's easy to do and many people have done it.

44:29.600 --> 44:30.880
It's just not quite as flexible.

44:30.880 --> 44:31.720
Maybe you're trying to do

44:31.720 --> 44:33.520
a complicated WebRTC audio setup

44:33.520 --> 44:37.000
and you just don't want more levels of NAT involved.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.880
It turns out WireGuard makes this super easy.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.720
What we did on Linode in this case

44:41.720 --> 44:44.840
was get a second IP address and assign that to our Linode.

44:44.840 --> 44:48.560
They make that easy and tons of hosting providers do too.

44:48.560 --> 44:50.680
You just gotta get yourself a second IP address.

44:50.680 --> 44:53.440
You need one still to keep the host accessible.

44:53.440 --> 44:55.360
But that second one,

44:55.360 --> 44:57.480
much like you just assigned whatever arbitrary,

44:57.480 --> 45:02.480
say 10.200.200.1 address to your WireGuard network,

45:02.600 --> 45:05.480
to whatever machine you're connecting to on the backend,

45:05.480 --> 45:08.320
you can just put the public IP address there.

45:08.320 --> 45:10.240
And if you're using something like wg-quick,

45:10.240 --> 45:11.600
we'll have a link in the show notes

45:11.600 --> 45:13.480
that has sort of an example setup.

45:13.480 --> 45:15.040
That example is using IPv6,

45:15.040 --> 45:19.040
but works just the same for IPv4 pretty much in this case.

45:19.040 --> 45:20.600
And WireGuard figures that out.

45:20.600 --> 45:22.160
So on the backend side,

45:22.160 --> 45:24.520
the system running right at Chris's fingertips,

45:24.520 --> 45:26.960
right there in the studio, we just told it,

45:26.960 --> 45:29.200
hey, this is your IP address for WireGuard.

45:29.200 --> 45:31.320
This is gonna be the public IP address.

45:31.320 --> 45:34.520
And then on the server in the front end running in the cloud,

45:34.520 --> 45:35.760
you say the same thing like, hey,

45:35.760 --> 45:38.400
here's this WireGuard peer that's gonna connect to you.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.880
Here's the IP address that it's allowed to send from.

45:40.880 --> 45:42.680
And oh yeah, hey, in the reverse direction,

45:42.680 --> 45:45.080
we're just gonna send everything.

45:45.080 --> 45:47.760
So not only can you access all the ports

45:47.760 --> 45:49.920
on that hosting machine, but the hosting machine,

45:49.920 --> 45:52.080
all of its traffic is going at that IP address too.

45:52.080 --> 45:55.240
So on that machine, it really just feels like

45:55.240 --> 45:57.640
this is your new public IPv4 address

45:57.640 --> 45:59.280
right out there on the internet.

45:59.280 --> 46:00.680
That's exactly what it seems like.

46:00.680 --> 46:05.000
It's so slick and it's wherever you connect as a client from.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.080
You just established the WireGuard VPN

46:07.080 --> 46:08.400
and you could be mobile.

46:08.400 --> 46:10.640
You could be at a coffee shop, you could be at home,

46:10.640 --> 46:12.700
you could be wherever you connect from,

46:12.700 --> 46:14.040
it'll just send the traffic there.

46:14.040 --> 46:17.080
So it's really slick because I realized very quickly

46:17.080 --> 46:19.120
that this is kind of handy on my laptop

46:19.120 --> 46:21.180
because I could just turn it on briefly,

46:21.180 --> 46:23.600
send you the IP from wherever I was at

46:23.600 --> 46:25.560
and you could connect to my laptop

46:25.560 --> 46:27.240
that I was sitting at at that moment.

46:27.240 --> 46:28.080
And then when we were done,

46:28.080 --> 46:30.880
I could just disconnect WireGuard and it goes away.

46:30.880 --> 46:33.080
And that was super useful, but I also thought,

46:33.080 --> 46:36.240
boy, this could be handy for just home systems

46:36.240 --> 46:37.640
that I wanna turn on from time to time

46:37.640 --> 46:39.360
and get them exposed to the internet.

46:39.360 --> 46:42.120
I might prefer the style where you use IP tables

46:42.120 --> 46:44.040
to just forward certain ports,

46:44.040 --> 46:46.260
but routing all of the traffic has the advantage

46:46.260 --> 46:48.940
of just, it's like it's a node on the internet

46:48.940 --> 46:51.040
and then you manage it with whatever firewall you want.

46:51.040 --> 46:51.880
Exactly.

46:51.880 --> 46:54.280
I mean, how many times do you end up spinning up a VPS

46:54.280 --> 46:55.760
just because you know, like, okay,

46:55.760 --> 46:56.960
this isn't behind any of my stuff.

46:56.960 --> 46:59.560
I don't have to futz with this weird router UI

46:59.560 --> 47:00.420
or play with any of that.

47:00.420 --> 47:02.000
Like it's just gonna be on the internet.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.200
What I run there will be public.

47:03.200 --> 47:04.600
I don't have to think about it beyond that,

47:04.600 --> 47:06.680
which can be good or can be bad.

47:06.680 --> 47:10.240
And I should say, this is sort of how people view NAT

47:10.240 --> 47:13.000
is a sort of kind of firewall

47:13.000 --> 47:13.840
just because you have to do

47:13.840 --> 47:15.720
that network address translation step

47:15.720 --> 47:18.320
to actually get traffic to go both ways.

47:18.320 --> 47:19.280
All you really need to do

47:19.280 --> 47:20.960
if you want to have that same sort of stuff

47:20.960 --> 47:23.040
is just not forward everything by default,

47:23.040 --> 47:25.580
set up a deny by default firewall.

47:25.580 --> 47:28.360
We're using a Fedora 33 box in this case on the Linode.

47:28.360 --> 47:30.800
So you've got firewall D there or UFW,

47:30.800 --> 47:33.160
or in this case, actually, I disabled firewall D,

47:33.160 --> 47:35.320
gotta tell you that, and installed Firehole,

47:35.320 --> 47:37.240
which I just kind of like to use anyway,

47:37.240 --> 47:38.280
wrote up a quick config.

47:38.280 --> 47:39.120
I sent it to you, Chris.

47:39.120 --> 47:40.440
I mean, it's really, I don't know,

47:40.440 --> 47:42.120
20 lines long at most, right?

47:42.120 --> 47:42.960
Yeah.

47:42.960 --> 47:44.400
And you just say like, these are the services I want.

47:44.400 --> 47:45.360
You can allow all ports.

47:45.360 --> 47:47.000
You could block specific ports.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.200
Or in this case, we took the secure route,

47:49.200 --> 47:51.320
pretty much blocked everything except the services

47:51.320 --> 47:52.400
we knew we were running.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.160
Now, it does mean you still have to do that,

47:54.160 --> 47:56.320
but I think what's nice about this approach

47:56.320 --> 47:57.520
is you get the flexibility.

47:57.520 --> 47:58.880
You can forward everything if you want,

47:58.880 --> 48:00.880
or you can lock it down a bit more.

48:00.880 --> 48:04.660
Or if you didn't want to mess with IP tables at all,

48:04.660 --> 48:06.000
you could use like the cloud firewall

48:06.000 --> 48:08.060
that's probably built into whatever VPS provider

48:08.060 --> 48:09.820
you're doing, like we could do on Linode.

48:09.820 --> 48:10.800
Yeah, there's so many options.

48:10.800 --> 48:12.720
And then ultimately, the even simpler route

48:12.720 --> 48:14.680
would be something like hoppy.network,

48:14.680 --> 48:15.720
where you just sign up,

48:15.720 --> 48:17.840
I think they're using Stripe for the billing or something,

48:17.840 --> 48:21.440
and then you provision a box after you pick.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.680
They have like an $8 a month and an $11 a month.

48:23.680 --> 48:25.200
And it's like the difference between one terabyte

48:25.200 --> 48:26.780
or two terabyte of transfer.

48:26.780 --> 48:28.780
I signed up a little bit just to try it out.

48:28.780 --> 48:30.840
And what you have to do as an end user

48:30.840 --> 48:33.040
is download a WireGuard comp,

48:33.040 --> 48:36.780
and then just do a WG quick up the name of that comp,

48:36.780 --> 48:39.460
if you put it in Etsy WireGuard, and you're connected.

48:39.460 --> 48:41.320
So it's really just a matter of starting

48:41.320 --> 48:43.240
the WireGuard client and connecting

48:43.240 --> 48:44.780
if you want to use Hoppy.

48:44.780 --> 48:46.920
But the VPS side of stuff,

48:46.920 --> 48:48.260
like what we built up on Linode

48:48.260 --> 48:50.680
with IP tables and WireGuard,

48:50.680 --> 48:52.660
it's good entry level stuff.

48:52.660 --> 48:54.100
If you've been looking for a reason

48:54.100 --> 48:55.720
to learn a little bit about networking

48:55.720 --> 48:59.580
and a little bit about different firewall options on Linux,

48:59.580 --> 49:01.700
and you want to do something that could also mean

49:01.700 --> 49:04.000
maybe you could access a home system from time to time,

49:04.000 --> 49:05.280
this is a really nice setup.

49:05.280 --> 49:07.480
And of course, we got you hooked up

49:07.480 --> 49:08.620
with links in the show notes,

49:08.620 --> 49:10.160
where you can go through some of the steps

49:10.160 --> 49:11.060
and figure out how to do this.

49:11.060 --> 49:12.520
And you can always go check out Hoppy

49:12.520 --> 49:13.480
and see how they're doing it,

49:13.480 --> 49:15.240
and get an idea and a feel for it,

49:15.240 --> 49:16.760
and then go build this yourself,

49:16.760 --> 49:18.720
because even if you really have never done

49:18.720 --> 49:20.620
any of this before,

49:20.620 --> 49:24.320
with a few hours of work and reading,

49:24.320 --> 49:25.760
you could have this set up

49:25.760 --> 49:28.100
and get it running yourself.

49:28.100 --> 49:30.900
I think it's a fun way for us to expose the system,

49:30.900 --> 49:32.400
and I'm looking at the resources right now.

49:32.400 --> 49:35.320
It's actually, I got to say,

49:36.560 --> 49:40.840
I'm running in KVM, Vert Manager,

49:40.840 --> 49:42.920
and it does a good job of distributing the load.

49:42.920 --> 49:45.480
My memory usage is going up quite a bit right now

49:45.480 --> 49:48.280
on the system at WireGuard.club,

49:48.280 --> 49:50.680
but the CPU load's getting spread out pretty good.

49:50.680 --> 49:51.520
Yeah, maybe we should talk,

49:51.520 --> 49:53.120
I mean, all right, we were harping on

49:53.120 --> 49:55.680
about the cool aspects of the Linux networking stack,

49:55.680 --> 49:57.700
which we should, because it's awesome.

49:57.700 --> 50:00.060
But you're also running the Linux-powered virtual machine,

50:00.060 --> 50:01.980
and you're even running a kind of interesting

50:01.980 --> 50:03.920
Linux distribution inside that virtual machine

50:03.920 --> 50:05.000
to power the website.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.200
Yeah, this was an opportunity for us

50:06.200 --> 50:08.120
to play again with Turnkey Linux,

50:08.120 --> 50:11.040
which I wanted just a quick VM that ran WordPress.

50:11.040 --> 50:13.120
I didn't want to spend many hours building a website.

50:13.120 --> 50:15.000
I was joking earlier, obviously.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.800
And so we grabbed the Turnkey WordPress installation,

50:17.800 --> 50:19.880
and it really is a pretty good experience.

50:19.880 --> 50:22.720
It didn't take any fuss to get it up and running,

50:22.720 --> 50:25.680
and it had a decent WordPress site ready to go.

50:25.680 --> 50:27.200
It has integration with Let's Encrypt,

50:27.200 --> 50:29.860
if you want to go that route, makes that really simple.

50:29.860 --> 50:30.700
I was impressed.

50:30.700 --> 50:33.400
It'd been a while since I'd visited Turnkey Linux land.

50:33.400 --> 50:35.200
And what's also great, Wes,

50:35.200 --> 50:36.940
is none of this is really new hardware.

50:36.940 --> 50:38.980
These are like 2017 machines,

50:38.980 --> 50:40.960
and we've got a couple hundred people

50:40.960 --> 50:42.040
knocking on the door right now,

50:42.040 --> 50:43.080
and it's doing a pretty good job.

50:43.080 --> 50:45.320
Man, I'm still using the machine

50:45.320 --> 50:47.760
to read the show notes and whatnot.

50:47.760 --> 50:49.320
Yeah, that was gonna be my main concern.

50:49.320 --> 50:50.360
Gonna break the show.

50:50.360 --> 50:52.960
Yeah, I know, because this one, it really matters.

50:53.920 --> 50:54.920
This one, it really does.

50:54.920 --> 50:56.440
But man, this is a lot of fun.

50:56.440 --> 50:57.360
It's one of our favorite things

50:57.360 --> 50:58.600
to do with WireGuard right now,

50:58.600 --> 51:00.960
and we'll have links to that in the show notes.

51:00.960 --> 51:03.500
And we'd love to hear how you do these kinds of things,

51:03.500 --> 51:05.600
because there's lots of ways to solve this problem,

51:05.600 --> 51:07.280
and probably some of them are pretty interesting.

51:07.280 --> 51:09.920
Linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

51:09.920 --> 51:14.120
Unpluggedcore.com, if you'd like to become

51:14.120 --> 51:16.840
a member of this show, support the show.

51:16.840 --> 51:18.520
Not only does it keep the show independent

51:18.520 --> 51:19.880
and keep us going,

51:19.880 --> 51:21.760
and helps us cover the cost of production,

51:21.760 --> 51:24.820
but as a thank you, you get a couple of perks.

51:24.820 --> 51:26.120
You get two different feeds.

51:26.120 --> 51:28.280
Well, you could really listen to both,

51:28.280 --> 51:30.400
but then you'd probably have time for nothing else.

51:30.400 --> 51:31.240
So I don't recommend it.

51:31.240 --> 51:34.440
So you must choose between door one and door two.

51:34.440 --> 51:37.420
Door one is a limited ad version of the show.

51:37.420 --> 51:40.200
Same full production, just no ads.

51:40.200 --> 51:44.600
Door two is the full live stream feed,

51:44.600 --> 51:46.600
which I have no idea what condition it's gonna be in today,

51:46.600 --> 51:50.080
because OBS crashed on us, it was a mess.

51:50.080 --> 51:53.040
So I have no idea, but it's everything, it's raw.

51:53.040 --> 51:55.940
It's like every time my mouth didn't work today,

51:55.940 --> 51:58.880
or when Wes dropped an F-bomb, it's in there.

51:58.880 --> 52:00.200
It sure is.

52:00.200 --> 52:03.520
The topics we talk about before and after the show

52:03.520 --> 52:05.120
that don't make it into the recording at all,

52:05.120 --> 52:07.400
because we hit stop, and then everybody opens up

52:07.400 --> 52:09.960
and talks about everything, that's in there too.

52:09.960 --> 52:11.780
We got you, suckers, ha!

52:12.740 --> 52:13.840
Well, for the most part.

52:13.840 --> 52:16.580
I suppose, you know, there's really no real replacement

52:16.580 --> 52:19.240
for really being here live, let's be honest.

52:19.240 --> 52:20.440
But that's what's in feed two,

52:20.440 --> 52:22.040
is like as much as we can pack in there.

52:22.040 --> 52:23.440
It's a whole show, pre and post show.

52:23.440 --> 52:25.720
It's basically a whole extra show that never gets released,

52:25.720 --> 52:27.760
because a lot of it's tech and Linux and open source topics

52:27.760 --> 52:29.280
that we're talking about.

52:29.280 --> 52:31.840
And sometimes that stuff actually does become a topic too

52:31.840 --> 52:32.660
in the show.

52:32.660 --> 52:35.000
So it's a way to feel like you've been here,

52:35.000 --> 52:36.560
like you experienced the whole thing.

52:36.560 --> 52:38.120
So that's feed number two.

52:38.120 --> 52:40.880
And all of that, door one, door two,

52:40.880 --> 52:43.880
is at unpluggedcore.com,

52:43.880 --> 52:45.740
and you can become an Unplugged Core contributor.

52:45.740 --> 52:48.040
And thank you to our members who support the show.

52:48.040 --> 52:51.840
What do you say we do a pick, Wes?

52:51.840 --> 52:53.320
Ooh, it's been a while.

52:53.320 --> 52:55.560
Yeah, it's been a week, maybe two?

52:55.560 --> 52:56.680
Don't know.

52:56.680 --> 53:00.080
But it's been a while since we've had on theme picks

53:00.080 --> 53:02.140
that match what we talked about in the show,

53:02.140 --> 53:03.300
that's for sure.

53:03.300 --> 53:05.920
And DSNET is one of them.

53:05.920 --> 53:09.080
And Wes, I have a feeling it's WireGuard related.

53:09.080 --> 53:10.680
Oh, yes it is.

53:10.680 --> 53:13.000
DSNET is a simple configuration tool

53:13.000 --> 53:16.520
to manage a centralized WireGuard VPN.

53:16.520 --> 53:19.540
Think WG Quick, but quicker.

53:19.540 --> 53:21.860
And really the context here is,

53:21.860 --> 53:23.200
all right, so the box we were testing,

53:23.200 --> 53:26.040
that was running on KVM on one of the studio machines.

53:26.040 --> 53:27.080
While I was setting things up

53:27.080 --> 53:29.040
and playing around last night,

53:29.040 --> 53:30.400
going in and setting up Let's Encrypt,

53:30.400 --> 53:31.920
even though I didn't realize that turnkey

53:31.920 --> 53:32.800
already had to integrate it.

53:32.800 --> 53:35.200
So I hacked it on additionally, dang it.

53:35.200 --> 53:37.080
But I did that over a VPN connection,

53:37.080 --> 53:40.880
a WireGuard VPN connection from my house, right?

53:40.880 --> 53:41.720
And how do we manage that?

53:41.720 --> 53:43.920
We've got multiple people with access to the studio,

53:43.920 --> 53:46.240
remote setups, Chris, you just lose your keys all the time

53:46.240 --> 53:47.340
and constantly have to add new ones

53:47.340 --> 53:49.880
when you buy a new laptop to play with.

53:49.880 --> 53:52.240
We're currently using Subspace for that,

53:52.240 --> 53:54.600
which is a neat, gooey, web gooey project

53:54.600 --> 53:57.960
that we talked about, I think, last summer or so.

53:57.960 --> 53:59.520
Unfortunately, it doesn't really seem

53:59.520 --> 54:01.640
to have been updated since then.

54:01.640 --> 54:02.760
And it was a little more than we needed.

54:02.760 --> 54:05.600
It had its own custom database and going in

54:05.600 --> 54:07.800
and working around some of the lack of features

54:07.800 --> 54:09.240
meant I had to go into the container,

54:09.240 --> 54:11.440
restart things, disable it, really customize it

54:11.440 --> 54:13.080
more than I was looking for.

54:13.080 --> 54:15.900
And we're not managing a whole organization,

54:15.900 --> 54:17.960
but we do have a centralized WireGuard VPN.

54:17.960 --> 54:20.960
And we do want a way to record a name and description

54:20.960 --> 54:23.200
about every peer we're allowing

54:23.200 --> 54:25.380
and a way to add peers as fast as possible.

54:25.380 --> 54:27.520
For one of us sets up a new machine,

54:27.520 --> 54:28.920
we just want to be able to go in there,

54:28.920 --> 54:30.520
add it real quick, give the key out

54:30.520 --> 54:33.040
to whoever's being added and be done with it.

54:33.040 --> 54:34.720
And that's where DSNet comes in.

54:34.720 --> 54:35.560
Yeah, it's slick.

54:35.560 --> 54:37.600
I think we're gonna switch to this.

54:37.600 --> 54:39.080
I think it's what we're gonna use, don't you think?

54:39.080 --> 54:40.000
Yeah, I think so.

54:40.000 --> 54:41.400
I mean, I've only just tried it out a little bit.

54:41.400 --> 54:43.800
We'll have to try it in practice for real

54:43.800 --> 54:46.320
and see if it holds up after adding a couple folks

54:46.320 --> 54:48.600
or redoing, modifying keys.

54:48.600 --> 54:50.080
That's my main concern.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.600
But it's kind of just enough.

54:51.600 --> 54:52.440
It's simple.

54:52.440 --> 54:53.440
It doesn't have a gooey.

54:53.440 --> 54:54.600
It doesn't try to reinvent things.

54:54.600 --> 54:56.480
It's just a nice little shell interface

54:56.480 --> 54:57.600
that you can run on the command line

54:57.600 --> 54:58.880
and get your stuff done.

54:58.880 --> 55:02.160
And we have a spot of feedback this week.

55:02.160 --> 55:04.080
This one's a special one because the author

55:04.080 --> 55:05.560
is in the mumble room.

55:05.560 --> 55:07.920
But Wes, why don't you read the highlights of it

55:07.920 --> 55:11.040
and then we'll engage with Bennett.

55:11.040 --> 55:11.880
Sure.

55:11.880 --> 55:12.960
Bennett wrote in to us,

55:12.960 --> 55:16.320
hi, Chris, Wes, and the LUP crew.

55:16.320 --> 55:19.520
I just ran across this on the Linux subreddit.

55:19.520 --> 55:22.360
This engineer has been building a modular ecosystem

55:22.360 --> 55:24.360
for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module

55:24.360 --> 55:26.360
over the last several months.

55:26.360 --> 55:29.320
And it's nothing short of magic.

55:29.320 --> 55:32.400
Think phone blocks, Project Aura for the Raspberry Pi.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.360
I'm talking hot swappable blocks for cameras,

55:34.360 --> 55:38.320
ethernet speakers, and even things like GPS and LoRa.

55:38.320 --> 55:39.240
And here's a demo video

55:39.240 --> 55:41.400
which we'll have linked in the show note.

55:41.400 --> 55:45.080
The project's homepage is pocket.ai.

55:45.080 --> 55:48.680
Now, I know how much Chris loves his pies.

55:48.680 --> 55:52.280
So I thought it'd be a good pick for the show.

55:52.280 --> 55:53.600
Regards, Bennett.

55:53.600 --> 55:56.520
And boy, Bennett, were you right.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.040
Yeah, Bennett, thanks for writing

55:58.040 --> 56:00.720
and thanks for joining us in the LUP blog this week.

56:00.720 --> 56:01.560
Now, what do you think?

56:01.560 --> 56:03.160
Is it real?

56:03.160 --> 56:05.480
I feel like we've had this promise so many times.

56:05.480 --> 56:07.000
So I just came across it yesterday

56:07.000 --> 56:11.560
and to me it seemed like the holy grail of mobile computing.

56:11.560 --> 56:13.720
Google couldn't accomplish this with Project Aura.

56:13.720 --> 56:15.840
Phone blocks seemed like a pipe dream.

56:15.840 --> 56:18.960
And yet this single developer

56:18.960 --> 56:21.280
casually put up this video on the subreddit.

56:21.280 --> 56:23.760
And as I was watching it,

56:23.760 --> 56:25.880
the amount of disbelief kept rising

56:25.880 --> 56:29.440
as he kept showing more and more crazy modules.

56:29.440 --> 56:33.000
Yeah, it seems like there's a real big community

56:33.000 --> 56:35.760
of builders and makers

56:35.760 --> 56:39.000
that are using the Raspberry Pi 4 compute module

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
to build out even more fancier systems.

56:42.000 --> 56:43.600
On this week's episode of Self-Hosted,

56:43.600 --> 56:44.720
which by the way,

56:44.720 --> 56:47.640
if anything we talked about today interested you at all,

56:47.640 --> 56:49.080
check out selfhosted.show.

56:49.080 --> 56:50.720
But on this week's episode of Self-Hosted,

56:50.720 --> 56:55.600
we interview a YouTuber who set up 16 SATA disks

56:55.600 --> 56:57.400
to a Raspberry Pi compute module.

56:57.400 --> 56:59.120
16 SATA disks.

56:59.120 --> 57:01.400
It's all kinds of stuff they're building around that.

57:01.400 --> 57:04.480
And I wonder if maybe it takes something

57:04.480 --> 57:07.480
like a popular platform like the Raspberry Pi

57:07.480 --> 57:10.720
to make the modules a actual sustainable business

57:10.720 --> 57:12.120
because there has to be enough users

57:12.120 --> 57:13.160
that could actually buy them

57:13.160 --> 57:15.560
to make manufacturing them viable.

57:15.560 --> 57:19.640
And it looks like on the post that I sent in the email,

57:19.640 --> 57:20.760
so many people were interested

57:20.760 --> 57:24.040
and it seems like the developer might be selling test kits

57:24.040 --> 57:25.000
in the coming months.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.400
Now, hardware, hmm, that changes things.

57:27.400 --> 57:29.560
Yeah, that would be interesting to see.

57:29.560 --> 57:32.960
So that is at pocket.ai, right?

57:32.960 --> 57:35.400
P-O-C-K-I-T.ai.

57:35.400 --> 57:36.840
We will put a link to that in the show notes.

57:36.840 --> 57:39.000
It does look really cool.

57:39.000 --> 57:42.440
I can't help but have my really big skeptical pants on

57:42.440 --> 57:44.040
for this kind of stuff these days.

57:44.040 --> 57:46.120
But boy, would I love to see it.

57:46.120 --> 57:47.520
Boy, would I love to.

57:47.520 --> 57:48.880
That would be great.

57:48.880 --> 57:50.560
Well, Bennett, thanks for sending that in.

57:50.560 --> 57:52.400
If you'd like to give us an email here on the show,

57:52.400 --> 57:53.240
something for us to read,

57:53.240 --> 57:56.560
something to make, that I can make Wes read, at least.

57:56.560 --> 57:58.160
At least one email so I can make Wes read it

57:58.160 --> 58:00.920
at linuxonplug.com slash contact.

58:00.920 --> 58:03.160
I don't know, Wes.

58:03.160 --> 58:05.080
I don't know, I guess I just felt like trolling, I guess.

58:05.080 --> 58:07.480
I mean, I need a challenge, I acknowledge that.

58:07.480 --> 58:11.680
All right, well, if anything we talked about today

58:11.680 --> 58:13.920
interested you, like I said, check out the self-hosted show.

58:13.920 --> 58:17.000
We talk about this stuff every other week.

58:17.000 --> 58:17.920
If you do the Twitter thing,

58:17.920 --> 58:20.280
you can follow this show at Linux Unplugged.

58:20.280 --> 58:21.960
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

58:21.960 --> 58:25.520
And there is an entire network of fantastic podcasts,

58:25.520 --> 58:29.440
which can be found at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

58:29.440 --> 58:30.960
And if you're interested in the updates

58:30.960 --> 58:31.920
for the Ubuntu Touch Project,

58:31.920 --> 58:33.800
be sure to check out Linux Action News.

58:33.800 --> 58:37.360
And of course, we'll have the open SSL news in there as well.

58:37.360 --> 58:38.560
As of for this year's show,

58:38.560 --> 58:40.640
we'll be back at the same bat time.

58:40.640 --> 58:41.920
See you next week.

58:41.920 --> 58:44.560
Same bat time, same bat station.

58:44.560 --> 58:48.480
Oh yes, because the Linux does roll on.

58:48.480 --> 58:49.880
Make it a whole Linux Tuesday.

58:49.880 --> 58:54.080
Join us live, 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

58:54.080 --> 58:55.600
Links to everything we talked about today,

58:55.600 --> 58:59.720
how to contact us, the mumble room, the matrix info,

58:59.720 --> 59:03.600
how to even subscribe, all of it, all of it.

59:03.600 --> 59:05.720
It's at linuxunplugged.com.

59:05.720 --> 59:07.240
What a great idea.

59:07.240 --> 59:09.760
A website, Linux Unplugged, it doesn't have to be an app.

59:09.760 --> 59:11.480
It could be a website.

59:11.480 --> 59:13.400
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

59:13.400 --> 59:15.080
of the Unplugged program.

59:15.080 --> 59:17.360
And we will see you right back here.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.360
Not on Sunday, not on Monday.

59:19.360 --> 59:20.880
Nope, not Thursday.

59:20.880 --> 59:21.760
You guessed it.

59:21.760 --> 59:23.720
We'll see you back here next Tuesday.

59:25.360 --> 59:26.200
Hey.

59:26.200 --> 59:50.320
Hey.

59:50.320 --> 01:00:05.360
All right, there was some bot shenanigans, so go to JBtitles.com and let's figure this

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360
out.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.360
Let's title this thing.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.480
Someone didn't start the show.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:09.960
I don't know who that could have been.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.440
Some sort of shenanigans.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.440
JBot!

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.600
Happy Gnome 40 week, everybody.

01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:18.280
By the time most people are listening to this, I think if all things go as planned, Gnome

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.600
Shell 40 will have landed.

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:22.200
Of course, most people won't get in their distro yet for a bit.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.600
But there is a Fedora 34 beta out too, right?

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.600
Yep.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:31.880
I already approved it to land for this evening's update sync for Fedora 34.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:37.360
So if you've installed the Fedora 34 beta ISO and then do an update from Gnome software

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.360
or using DNF, you will get it.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:40.360
You hear that, Chris?

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:54.520
Switch the studio tonight.
