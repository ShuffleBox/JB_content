1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
Yes, I'm still using Gnome.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,120
Yes, but I've made decisions.

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,360
Look at the, listen to the tone in that.

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,920
I know, well it's because they're right and they know it's going to probably crash on

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,760
me during this show and I should know better by now, but the thing is I've been stuck in

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,080
Indecision Valley for so long and now I've come out the other side and I feel like I've

7
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,360
seen the light and I've gotten a cold drink of water.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,040
Now I just have to reload all my systems.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:39,880
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 203 for June 27th, 2017.

10
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,400
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that screens are covered in fingerprints.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
My name is Chris.

12
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,400
My name is Wes.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
Hello, Wes.

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,440
Yes, we have a touch screen powered machine.

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,800
It's not powered by the touch screen, but it has a touch screen.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Yeah, that's right.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
It's important that it does.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Yeah.

19
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,760
We'll be talking about this massive Dell Precision 5720 Linux rig.

20
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,760
What?

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,680
I'm going to say right now, not getting into performance or other things, but in terms

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,220
of build quality, just probably one of the finest built machines running Linux on the

23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:10,220
market today.

24
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,440
So we'll give you a review of that Xeon monster in a little bit, but before that, Wes, before

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,320
that, we've got quite a bit of community news and updates to get into.

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,480
An old friend is coming back from the dead.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,320
It's not quite dead yet, and you're not going to believe what Mir might be used for next.

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,720
We'll give a plug for some upcoming open source events, a couple of new desktop application

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,760
launches that look really, really good.

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,780
Mozilla's $2 million bounty that, actually, I think a lot of folks in the audience could

31
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,780
probably get.

32
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,960
I think so, yeah.

33
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,920
So we'll tell you about their kind of cool idea, a big problem that the Debian project

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,920
has come across.

35
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,920
Uh-oh.

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Yeah.

37
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Yeah.

38
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,360
So we've got like all kinds of good stuff in here, Wes.

39
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,760
It's been a very fruitful week for open source.

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,480
So before we can get into any of that, we have to stop right here at the top of the

41
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,660
show and bring in our virtual lug.

42
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,600
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

43
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Greetings.

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,600
Hello everybody.

45
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,960
Well, look at that.

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,220
We managed to get a pretty good turnout.

47
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,220
You guys are the best.

48
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,220
That's pretty nice.

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,120
Hey guys, it's really good to see you all, and I want to probably start with the most

50
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,960
newsworthy story, because in some ways, Linux is ahead of the rest.

51
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,840
But we'll get to that in just a second.

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,340
Intel has a bug, and it's in their Skylake and Kaby Lake processors.

53
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,480
It's related to hyper-threading.

54
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,560
So if you have hyper-threading turned on, an unfixed Skylake and Kaby Lake processor

55
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,680
could, in some situations, dangerously misbehave when hyper-threading is enabled.

56
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,780
If you disable hyper-threading immediately, you're safe.

57
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:49,080
So this is on Debian's mailing list, is an advisory about processor and microcode defects

58
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,560
recently identified on Intel Skylake and Intel Kaby Lake processors with hyper-threading

59
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
enabled.

60
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,620
The defect, when triggered, causes unpredictable system behavior.

61
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,060
It could cause errors such as application and system misbehavior, data corruption, and

62
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,060
even data loss.

63
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,400
It was brought to the attention of the Debian project that this defect is known to directly

64
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,460
affect some Debian stable users, thus the Debian advisory.

65
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,920
Now what do you know about this story?

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,920
It's interesting.

67
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,120
You don't hear about these that often, at least not ones that are really big news like

68
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,160
this or that are public outcries.

69
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:30,660
The problem is that under complex microarchitectural conditions, short loops of less than 64 instructions

70
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,560
that use AH, BH, CH, or DH registers, as well as their corresponding wider register, e.g.,

71
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,560
AX, EIX, or AX for AH, may cause unpredictable system behavior.

72
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,640
Yeah, obviously this isn't a Debian issue.

73
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,560
This is an Intel microcode issue.

74
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,100
So you know that proprietary Intel microcode that when you install Ubuntu and you go to

75
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:56,580
additional drivers and it has this little checkbox where you can install the microcode?

76
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,880
This is the kind of stuff that is, this is what the microcode is responsible for, and

77
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,340
this is the kind of stuff that if you get new versions of the microcode, you get a patch.

78
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,960
Also on Linux, like in the case of Debian here, for Debian they already have Intel microcode

79
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,040
packages that are patched for Untable, for Unstable, they have them for testing, they

80
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,520
have them for Debian 9, Debian 8 backports.

81
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,800
So they've already fixed it in Debian and they're probably fixing it, I would imagine,

82
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,080
in other distros too like Ubuntu, but you have to be installing this proprietary microcode

83
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,760
package to get this.

84
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,740
So this is one of the things your microcode, that weird crazy package does, and kind of

85
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,120
related to all of this, you found this project, or at least this post this week, about trying

86
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,080
to build a system where the Intel microcode could get uploaded directly from the Linux

87
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:50,080
kernel to the processor and sort of eliminate the need for initramfs to do this.

88
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,160
So Linux is maybe going to have a simpler way to update this stuff in the future via

89
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
directly the kernel.

90
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Hey, that might be handy.

91
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,720
It could be, yeah, because depending on how you're trying to build a system, you know,

92
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,920
if you're trying to build it, basically, the goal here, the end goal they're trying to

93
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,760
get to is a system that you can boot, a Linux system you can boot without any initramfs.

94
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:17,400
I mean, really, initramfs, as handy as they are, and they are very fun, handy, useful,

95
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,880
it's kind of a hack, you know.

96
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,520
This microcode stuff, though, this flaw at the kernel level stuff, it's spooky because

97
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,560
it means you're hooked on the sauce.

98
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,960
You're hooked on the Intel microcode sauce if you want to get this fixed.

99
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,880
And it's like, if you don't, well, okay, but in some conditions, you might trigger a crash.

100
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,240
But you're already hooked on Intel-dependent software in the first place, like your whole

101
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,720
BIOS spring-up process, all of your EFI services and things that run, you're already dependent

102
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,440
on and really do need to be updated as well.

103
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,400
And in most cases, machine vendors will release new BIOSes, and those contain microcodes.

104
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,680
So if you get the newest BIOS for your machine, it's very likely that you could get the microcode

105
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,240
that fixes this issue, like you're going to get the thing that you can load in Linux after

106
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,240
the fact.

107
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,720
But not all vendors do update their BIOSes, some of them let the language.

108
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,920
So it's nice to do it in Linux because you know that you're going to get the microcode

109
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
update applied.

110
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,280
Otherwise, you're looking through change logs for each hardware iteration thing that you

111
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
have.

112
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
So William, you're completely right.

113
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,100
And two things that jump out at me, though, is number one, like you said, not all vendors

114
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:21,400
distribute BIOS images because sometimes their upstream ODM agreement doesn't permit them

115
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,320
to redistribute BIOS updates.

116
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,420
So there's that problem.

117
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:28,720
But secondly, it seems to me the goal should always be to try to move away from things

118
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:36,680
like requirements of microcode or uploading from Linux or like anything that's sort of

119
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
non-transparent.

120
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,560
Well, but if you don't have microcode, then you live with the defects the processor shipped

121
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,560
in.

122
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
And this would be one of those defects.

123
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,440
This is what they didn't see this edge case when they built the processor and shipped

124
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
the initial microcode.

125
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,840
So the microcode fix that you get now distributed with your Linux distro fixes this issue, which

126
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
you would just never fix otherwise.

127
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
That's what I said.

128
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,280
And I mean, it really highlights that like, you know, we're at that boundary of hardware

129
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
and software.

130
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,480
We're hooked on the good stuff.

131
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,040
It's becoming more complicated.

132
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,280
Like this is some weird L1 cache behavior with two different lengths of instruction

133
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,360
or register modifying instructions.

134
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,360
So William, do you have a kind of an idea of like how likely someone would be to actually

135
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
trigger this?

136
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,280
My understanding is you're probably not going to find it in your typical workflow.

137
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Yeah.

138
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
It seems like if it took this long to come up.

139
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,880
There's no generation that results in those instructions all fitting in the L1 cache and

140
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,560
performing the behavior that results in triggering the bug.

141
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,040
It sounds like this bug was maybe first found in the OCaml community and they kind of reported

142
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
it.

143
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,040
Yeah.

144
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
It sounded like, yeah.

145
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,280
So I think it also kind of highlights, there's just a lot we don't know about what's going

146
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
on at the hardware layer.

147
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,440
You know, it's like we're already running all this microcode.

148
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
You don't know what it is.

149
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,960
It's not very inspectable or suitable in any way.

150
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,480
And then you have this kind of, I mean, you can go look on Hacker News and stuff, but

151
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
the thread for this.

152
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,680
There's a lot of people talking about, you know, questionable practices by hardware

153
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,400
vendors around acknowledging hardware defects and how you do that because we don't have

154
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,720
the same kind of tools we've come to expect in the open source software world for identifying

155
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,320
and fixing these kinds of problems.

156
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,240
But at least Intel does seem to publish the errata.

157
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,040
Like I think there's a thing, there should be an errata listing for each of these generations

158
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
of chips.

159
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,520
So like for all the Skylake and Kaby Lake platforms, they have the errata published

160
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,520
for these things.

161
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,760
So you can go look up your chip and look at the errata and this will be in there.

162
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Yeah.

163
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,720
I mean, as the chips are becoming more complex, the errata is becoming much larger.

164
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,840
So you're going to see a bunch more of these issues show up because chips are just becoming

165
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
increasingly more complex and hard to validate.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I got to be honest.

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,640
I really thought when I went back in the day when hyper-threading first was announced as

168
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,360
a thing, I thought, well, that sounds like a damn hack.

169
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,920
And you know, we really haven't really had much fallout from it.

170
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,200
I mean, it's not the best thing ever, but it's kind of funny.

171
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,800
So I guess one immediate fix would be to just go turn off hyper-threading in your bios.

172
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,840
So old school skeptical admin Chris was like, yeah, just turn hyper-threading off.

173
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
Just it's fine.

174
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,040
What's funny is it's only this implementation in Skylake onward that's broken, it's not

175
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
the older implementations.

176
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Right.

177
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Yeah, right.

178
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
Skylake and Kaby Lake, they're the chips that...

179
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:08,720
And I guess that would mean that the chips came after Skylake and Kaby Lake maybe also

180
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
have different types of hyper-threading?

181
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,560
My understanding is it's some caching behavior, I think, of the micro-instructions and that

182
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,200
interacted with hyper-threading in such a way that you got this effect where you have

183
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,960
multiple logical streams happening simultaneously and some kind of corruption happening.

184
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Whoops.

185
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
So interesting.

186
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Yeah, it's hard.

187
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,800
It's a system that's hard to do integration testing on because as you add these features

188
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,940
that seem like they gain you performance, they can interact in just really unsuspecting

189
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,440
ways with other features you added before.

190
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,360
But the sort of cherry on top for Linux users is it looks like a fix, I would imagine for

191
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,800
both, I guess Max too, but I saw, I read somewhere that Microsoft won't have a fix for quite

192
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
a bit coming down.

193
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,120
My understanding was Microsoft already released the microcode update at least for the Skylake

194
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,120
chips.

195
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
I don't know about the Kaby Lake microcode.

196
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Okay, that was...

197
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
Because what I was reading is it looked like it would be included in...

198
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
But I have read it was in the April rollup.

199
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
Oh, no.

200
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,120
So what I was reading would be...

201
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
But that may only be for Windows 10.

202
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Ah, okay.

203
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,960
So what I was reading would be included as an update after summer.

204
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
But I don't know.

205
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,240
So I really didn't follow that closely because I couldn't really care.

206
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,720
But what I thought was, boy, what an interesting contrast though that I could have seen a time

207
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,160
where Linux would be maybe just completely SOL or totally, totally out of luck on something

208
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
like this.

209
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,040
Yeah, the Linux kernel has had the updating support for years, I want to say at least

210
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
five years.

211
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,560
Intel's been in there working with the Linux kernel community for years now.

212
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,000
It's just a matter of actually having the proprietary package and then deal it, depending

213
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,600
on your distro, whether you have the update functionality because you may choose to go

214
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,880
with Libre only stuff, in which case you're not going to update the microcode.

215
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,880
Exactly.

216
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,760
So just disable hyperthreading, I guess.

217
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Or don't worry about it.

218
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
Or update your microcode.

219
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,360
Yeah, back up, back up often and see if there's another way to update the microcode.

220
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,360
Yeah.

221
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
See, the thing is that...

222
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,960
So, William, maybe you can clear this up because what my understanding was is the microcode

223
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,920
with this fix has to be uploaded at every boot.

224
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,680
You can't write it to this processor.

225
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
That is correct.

226
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,840
The microcode has...

227
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,840
There's a ROM on the processor that contains the microcode shipped from the factory.

228
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,680
But the microcode updates you apply are applied at runtime every time they're not persisted

229
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
on the chip.

230
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Yeah.

231
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
So how do you...

232
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,500
And I think that's actually kind of a good thing because if you uploaded a bad microcode,

233
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
you could break your chip.

234
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Sure.

235
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,080
But if it comes from the factory working, you know it's going to continue working.

236
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,120
So if you update the microcode and it broke, you can just reboot and do it again.

237
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
So how does the...

238
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
That is the nice thing about this process.

239
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,800
How does a Triskel user do this, handle this problem?

240
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,080
The Triskel user could update their BIOS since they're probably...

241
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,860
Maybe they're using a proprietary BIOS.

242
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,960
If they're not, then maybe, I don't know, they're just screwed.

243
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,360
They have to accept that they need some binary to be loaded onto the CPU.

244
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,400
Stop running that horrible closed source x86 platform.

245
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Yeah.

246
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:47,280
But yeah, if you're on Skylake or newer, I think you're basically stuck with proprietary

247
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,360
code that runs at boot so you can do the microcode update.

248
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,280
You're just going to have to deal with yet another proprietary process.

249
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,200
So it looks like it hasn't been released for Windows yet, but I'm sure they'll get updates

250
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,600
out eventually.

251
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
You sound so confident.

252
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Yeah.

253
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,160
Now, how about this for a story?

254
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
You guys ready for this?

255
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,360
Now, I'm going to ask you something before I get through this whole thing.

256
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,440
Please stick with me on this, okay?

257
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,080
But it's not dead yet.

258
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:20,680
Mir may live on as a Wayland compositor for the Mate desktop.

259
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,680
Say that again?

260
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,680
Just one more time.

261
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
One more time.

262
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Mir.

263
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,680
Yeah.

264
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,280
Canonical's display server project, which was going to ship as the default in Ubuntu

265
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:37,960
13.10, which is very optimistic, is actually, despite what people believe, still under active

266
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,600
development, I've been watching, it's still getting commits.

267
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,120
And so this week, friend of the show, Martin Wimpress, suggested that Mate developers could

268
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,640
be talking to Mir developers about how Mir might be used as a Wayland compositor.

269
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
And I believe, yeah.

270
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
Yeah, here it is.

271
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,640
I have it.

272
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:58,400
He posted a shot on the Google Plus stream somewhere.

273
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
I'm not sure.

274
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,400
I can't remember where it was.

275
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
He was on one of those places.

276
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,720
And you could see a whiteboard of how they were kind of conceptualizing this thing out.

277
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,780
So here's the kind of the important thing to take away.

278
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,280
Remember that Wayland itself isn't a display server.

279
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,920
It's a protocol that handles the communication between a compositor, like Mudder, or Weston,

280
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
or KWin.

281
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,120
A thing that actually spits things to the screen.

282
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Right.

283
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,440
And its clients, like the applications and the windows and stuff like that.

284
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:32,880
So Mate doesn't necessarily have something that speaks the Wayland protocol.

285
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,600
So they would have to build that in to the Mate back end.

286
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,800
And so Wimpy points out that migrating to Wayland is something that the Mate desktop

287
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,800
is going to have to do.

288
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Right.

289
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
That's just something that's going to have to happen at some point.

290
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
That ship has sailed.

291
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,160
And they could add Wayland support to Marco.

292
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,160
But it'd be a huge undertaking.

293
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,440
They could switch to Mudder.

294
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,480
But Gnome Shell, I've covered some of my concerns with Mudder recently.

295
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,320
I mean, that has a lot of caveats as well, as Joey points out on OMG Ubuntu.

296
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,800
So using Mir as the Wayland compositor.

297
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,000
So they're going to teach Mir to speak Wayland.

298
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,480
Mir will act as like a set of APIs that developers can write to, that then we'll be able to understand

299
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,720
and can speak the way to speak Wayland.

300
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,200
It'll be the Wayland compositor.

301
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,100
And Wimpy says that, yeah, it's a chunk of work.

302
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:31,520
But it's less work than rewriting Marco or switching over to, say, Mudder.

303
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,440
It's like it's probably-

304
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,400
Even without explicit Wayland support.

305
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,640
Mir is closer to what they want than something like Mudder or Kaywin.

306
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,040
Now I'm going to take this a step further.

307
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,800
And I think this is where this should go.

308
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,600
I think this should go across every distribution.

309
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,720
This should not be an Ubuntu-only thing.

310
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,280
This should be how almost every desktop environment on Linux speaks Wayland, with the exception

311
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:01,420
of the really big boys and girls like Kaywin and your Mudders out there, who already are

312
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,840
working on this and already have pretty solid support and have very special use cases.

313
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,120
But here's the reality.

314
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,500
Without something like Mir that does a standard API that everybody can write to, without something

315
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,280
like Mir, every single Tom, Dick, and Harry desktop environment is going to have to create

316
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,480
their own Wayland compositor.

317
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,240
And it's going to be this patchwork of features and support that's going to fragment the Linux

318
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,800
desktop in a way that we've never even considered fragmentation before.

319
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,760
We think of fragmentation as package managers or library versions or system D or no system

320
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:45,040
D. But true fragmentation will be copy and paste, highlights, screenshot capabilities,

321
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,880
remote desktop capabilities, support of communicating between X applications and Wayland applications

322
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:57,160
could be different depending on which desktop environment you're using, depending on which

323
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,620
Linux you're running on top of, depending on which version of Linux you're running on

324
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,620
top of.

325
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,200
It is going to be a layer on top of layer on top of layer fragmentation.

326
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,000
If each one of these Tom, Dick, and Harry desktop environments have to go out and figure

327
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,120
out their own way to communicate with Wayland and not to mention all the stuff still new.

328
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,840
So not only is it going to be rough because it's brand new code, but it's going to be

329
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,440
rough because all of these amateur projects are creating their own implementation from

330
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,440
scratch.

331
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,560
It's devastating in terms of usability.

332
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:34,580
So to have something that is well developed in a company that is familiar with the problem

333
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,960
set that is trying to solve it for their own desktop interests that can create a common

334
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:44,040
API that desktop environments could just adopt across all Linux could save us from what is

335
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,440
going to be years of fragmentation hell.

336
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,340
Or it's just going to raise the bar.

337
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:56,600
It's going to raise the bar way too high for entry for desktop projects because now you

338
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
don't get X.

339
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
You don't get the X server.

340
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,920
So you've got to write all that stuff on your own.

341
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,280
You've got to do all of that legwork now to get your desktop environment up and running

342
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,760
on a Wayland powered Linux desktop or you've got to fork somebody else's open source project.

343
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,860
And that is a way bigger bar of entry than it used to be.

344
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,920
So we are in a sense locking the Linux desktop to the establishment projects that have the

345
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:26,160
resources, the know-how, the technical understanding of how to build a display compositor and

346
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,200
we are limited to those projects that are going to be able to do something that's actually

347
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,580
usable on desktop unless we have something like this that multiple communities and multiple

348
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,600
distributions and multiple desktop environments are all working towards.

349
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,040
At least that's how I see it.

350
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,120
And it's one of the things that concerns me about the future of desktop Linux the most

351
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,760
and it's something we're barely talking about.

352
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,200
So it sounds like to me you're calling kind of for like a bog standard display server

353
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
for Wayland.

354
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:55,720
I'm calling for like a common API set where you know this version of the API has these

355
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
capabilities.

356
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
I can take screenshots.

357
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
I have copy and paste.

358
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Well there you go.

359
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,240
So that's the thing and I wish this article had talked more about that is because like

360
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,240
it's not that Wayland doesn't have those issues that they're different levels of abstraction

361
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,600
and you have different capabilities, right?

362
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,200
So it doesn't provide those things.

363
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,720
Well and right and different projects are at different points of progress in implementing

364
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
those features.

365
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Right.

366
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:21,320
So just because so just because the KWin display compositor is now making it possible to take

367
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,200
screenshots doesn't mean that Mudder can do it.

368
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,160
And so you could you could literally have a reality where you can have some basic desktop

369
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,920
functionality not work simply because that project hasn't gotten around to making that

370
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
work yet on Wayland.

371
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,920
Right.

372
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,520
So this would almost be like a like a desktop API where something especially like you know

373
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:43,080
for Monte or things like that like this reminds me in some ways of Vulkan and you know we're

374
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,180
like we have this newer layer where we give more power right so like if you are a big

375
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,960
project you want to be able to implement those things because you're like well X does this

376
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,240
terribly I'm always gonna get screen tearing and all these problems let me fix that in

377
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:57,200
KWin and we're gonna get it right and we're gonna have buttery smooth super great compositing

378
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,080
but as you're saying a lot of pressure is like well I just wanted to make a cool tiling

379
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,920
window manager that did things a little differently.

380
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,880
Is XFCE gonna adopt KWin?

381
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,880
Not likely.

382
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
Yes.

383
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,240
So what you're saying is like well if you can surrender some of that control we need

384
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,480
something that can be that middle layer so that you can be like hey I just want to take

385
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,240
a screenshot I don't care how you do it go talk to Wayland for me help me a little bit

386
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,800
with those middle layers I don't need to deviate from that.

387
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,520
You still have to build some of the hooks and support into your desktop environment but

388
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,380
this is what you write to and if you write to this version of the API you will get these

389
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,380
things.

390
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,220
And I imagine like I think the other thing I'd like to see more of is the comparison

391
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,720
to Mudder because I understand the concerns like it's not I don't but I think that it

392
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,640
would be good to have those spelled out and I think part of it may be too like that like

393
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,860
Gnome the Gnome project doesn't really think of Mudder as that as the thing that you're

394
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,280
describing you know whereas Mirror kind of doesn't have a home as much anymore or it's

395
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,280
right you know the state of transition so maybe this is something it really could excel

396
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,280
at.

397
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,960
Yeah and why toss out good code and if it can be open sourced and you know I would love

398
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,120
to also know what the situation is with the CLA when it comes to Mirror and if it could

399
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
you know.

400
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
That's a good question.

401
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,120
You know would it have to be moved off of Launchpad and put up on GitHub really to get

402
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,440
real community involvement.

403
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,920
These are all questions you'd have to ask and maybe we'll get somebody on here and they

404
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,660
can answer some of those questions but I think interesting though.

405
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,320
Yeah I think the concept is worth considering and if you hear the name Mirror getting kicked

406
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,920
around again in community forums and discussion places I'd say don't don't don't dismiss it

407
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,000
out of hand give it some consideration because there's a real problem here that we're going

408
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,160
to be facing and this could be solving the problem before we even start to struggle with

409
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,160
it.

410
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,480
Not that we can't engineer our way out of it once we're there but it would it be amazing

411
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,760
if we just hit the ground running with the solution.

412
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
That would be amazing.

413
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,960
What a what a concept.

414
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,960
This is so neat this solves some problems I had just this weekend Eternal Terminal.

415
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,780
Wes found this and it's a remote terminal for the busy and impatient.

416
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:50,240
It combines like some of the aspects of MOSH which is the popular terminal we've talked

417
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,320
about before Auto SSH and SSH.

418
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,640
The whole idea here is that it'll reconnect without interrupting the session and it uses

419
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,960
some fancy TCP to do it too Wes.

420
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,920
I was looking at it that's kind of part of its secret sauce is as the they kind of break

421
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:10,120
it all down in the how it works section but they say the eternal TCP is a layer between

422
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:16,760
the application and the Unix TCP sockets that make the sockets robust to TCP disconnects

423
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,360
including roaming and connection failure and they go into why that's actually particularly

424
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,880
hard thing to do and how they came up with a reader and a writer and.

425
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,920
Yeah I think this is really interesting and it kind of I've liked MOSH but there are they

426
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,880
talk about them here a lot you know it's like the MOSH does have some limitations especially

427
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,000
how you know MOSH only tries to communicate the current state of the screen.

428
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,840
It doesn't it's not it's very different than how we traditionally have had these kinds

429
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,120
of connections and this is seems like it's you know it doesn't have quite all the capabilities

430
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,680
it has some different drawbacks and limitations but if you're just tired of you know my internet

431
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,600
went out or you know just be able to go from one network to another and then having that

432
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:58,600
SSH connection reestablished come back up and you don't lose your place.

433
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
That's awesome.

434
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,480
I mean again I think that it's you know if you can use screen or Tmux then maybe you

435
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,900
don't have this problem as much and it's not that big of a deal but it can be a layer of

436
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,920
convenience and I think it's really good software engineering to try.

437
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:17,000
So it's something I'll definitely try out because this weekend I had a multi-day benchmark

438
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,920
running in an SSH session and it was over the gigabit LAN so I was like this is good

439
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,160
this is solid I mean these never these sessions I have running for days they never.

440
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,120
Yeah it died and of course the the whole the whole thing just died.

441
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,480
Bummer I thought and then you linked this to me I was like oh I could have used that

442
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,480
just a few hours ago.

443
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
Where were you earlier?

444
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,200
I want to give a quick shout out to odd camp 17 which is coming up very soon you can find

445
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:45,520
out more at oddcamp.org Saturday August 19th and Sunday August 20th 2017 in Caltonbury

446
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,080
I think that's how you say it right?

447
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,080
Canterbury?

448
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
Something like that.

449
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,320
In the UK which looks like a lot of fun doesn't it yeah if you're over on the better spoken

450
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
side of the pond.

451
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,800
We're flying over right?

452
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,080
I wish man I wish also a tip of the hat to Entraware for being like a platinum sponsor

453
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,420
over there which is really cool to see them stepping up the community support and odd

454
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:11,080
camp is an unconference celebrating free culture free and open source software hardware hacking

455
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,880
digital rights all the things we love talking about on this show so you can find out more

456
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:23,880
at oddcamp.org and again August 19th and the 20th that's awesome and then next week very

457
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,480
soon our virtual log some of you become an actual log you're gonna come here to the studio

458
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,560
you know we have this thing set to 12 that's probably pretty good that's probably pretty

459
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,040
good and you and you and Dan are doing a double of the text nap so we could even go long yeah

460
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,980
we can totally go long cool so yeah next week is the is the barbecue here at the studio

461
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,320
to celebrate episode 200 I'm excited me too I'm not gonna eat for the whole next week

462
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:55,120
I'm thinking like okay I better get an extra tank of propane gonna bring over maybe a charcoal

463
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,660
barbecue gotta make sure the sous vide machine is prepared I guess we gotta think about sides

464
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,080
too cuz I feel like I've only thought about which is not that that's bad that's the important

465
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,960
part but Hadeen is thinking about making like an ambrosia salad so that could be one side

466
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,200
but yeah we need like beans and stuff we got a couple of chairs in here I figured we'll

467
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,240
have the mumble room a couple chairs that people come in here we'll chat it'll be good

468
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,320
it'll be a lot of fun meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting to sign up if you can make it

469
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,240
next week I don't know how we're gonna stream I still haven't figured that out I'm like

470
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,640
just gonna take that right up to the red line and then figure that out the last minute I

471
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,600
guess in true JB style originally I was gonna vlog the whole thing and then just do a big

472
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,000
release but then it's not fun I know but then I'll live the in all of the material we put

473
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,160
publicly it said well live stream and I'm like oh shit okay well we're live streaming

474
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,080
it then we're doing a live meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting if you can make it and

475
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,600
the meetup will be here at the studio so hopefully you know it's right up just a would you say

476
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:57,160
Wes how many minutes up around noon or say around 11 on a Tuesday is it from Seattle

477
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,480
it's a drive you probably make semi-frequently so yeah it's probably like depending on traffic

478
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,400
like 45 minutes 40 minutes plan for like a 45 50 minute drive to make it up here from

479
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,680
Seattle yeah from the Seattle area that's but it's it's a nice drive it's worth it is

480
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,000
just the burbs of Seattle are we in the burbs getting that way you know when you live in

481
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,440
the burbs you don't really consider is it because like outside of the cities the suburbs

482
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,640
right you know you don't think of it as the burbs and you live in the burbs yeah I guess

483
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,160
I mean you might be like you could think of Everett as a Seattle suburb and then yeah

484
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,600
like a suburb of Everett no no no I reject that I was gonna skip over that middle section

485
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,520
here's the thing to like when I travel and people say where you from say Seattle yeah

486
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,560
you say yeah that's what everybody knows yeah it doesn't like and when you're like to you

487
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,960
know you know even like even 500 miles away when you're like 2,000 miles away or 3000

488
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,680
but even like 500 miles away like it like the nuance of the difference between Seattle

489
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:55,080
anywhere else is totally is lost so yeah all right well let's take a moment and let's thank

490
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,720
Ting for sponsoring this episode of the unplugged program go to linux.ting.com not only is that

491
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,360
a powerful URL that you want in your history but it's also the way to support the show

492
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,820
and get $25 off a Ting device they got a lot of great devices that you can buy directly

493
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:15,120
from Ting no contract no other termination fee no weird quote-unquote agreements hate

494
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,960
those you can also just bring a device and then get a Ting service credit now I did that

495
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,740
that's how I got started with Ting I was like I'm gonna be a little skeptical and dip my

496
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:26,880
toe in here a dip my toe in the water I brought a device so I got $25 service credit and that

497
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,360
thing lasted me more than my first month and I realized oh man something shifted here because

498
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,200
you're just paying for what you use your minutes your messages and your megabytes and that's

499
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,800
it it's just six dollars for a line so if you use say 15 text messages you just pay

500
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,060
for the 15 that you have to use instead of like having to pay for like a plan that gives

501
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:50,680
you 800 texts just in case you use this it's all kind of silly it's all kind of arbitrary

502
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,360
it's all just really a scam and Ting is here to make mobile simple and make sense that's

503
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,120
why there's no contracts you pay for what you use they have nationwide coverage you're

504
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,380
in control with their awesome dashboard they have tons of nice devices and a CDMA network

505
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,840
and a GSM network which means not only is that a ton of devices you can bring but that

506
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,560
gives you flexibility down the road too when you're traveling I use that all the time I

507
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,880
bring a CDMA phone with me and I bring a GSM either hotspot or phone with me to one or

508
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,720
the other so I can always have good network signal wherever I'm going because it's just

509
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,400
different areas they different companies different have different agreements with different cities

510
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,120
and you just never know you're looking to move or something and you don't want to change

511
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:33,480
carriers like that's the last thing you want yeah yeah yeah when I when when we did the

512
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,160
shows back at the house I had CDMA coverage there that was really great when we moved

513
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,320
here I got just a slightly still great coverage on CDMA but I got just faster data on the

514
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,460
GSM network I switched to the GSM you don't have to do you don't have new accounts there's

515
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,000
no canceling or sign up you just and it's one of those things where you never have to

516
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,760
think about it if you're if you're not like a like a geek if you are a geeky you know

517
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,840
what those things are it's great that you have that flexibility check them out go to

518
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,800
linux.ting.com and save a little money support the show and get started with a better way

519
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:07,720
to do mobile linux.ting.com linux.ting.com thanks to ting for sponsoring the unplugged

520
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,560
program one of my favorite open source desktop applications admittedly because I have the

521
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:18,600
cutest kids on the entire planet hashtag bias digicam has a new update digicam 5.6 and this

522
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:23,240
is the thing here that I was I always wanted this because when I want to share my photos

523
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,800
like oh look at this really cute thing my kids did because they're the cutest kids in

524
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,580
the entire world I think I mentioned that but I didn't really want to like throw up

525
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,460
a whole gallery on google photos and share it with family or what other photo sharing

526
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,720
services are there flicker still the thing I don't know it's weird and it's like well

527
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,840
what am I what am I really what do you know why so this is a problem that is now solved

528
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,340
in digicam 5.6 which is what I really I wanted to call out this feature it's a new html gallery

529
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:50,720
tool that lets you quickly generate a web gallery from a set of albums or you know just

530
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,360
a couple of photos and then they get immediately uploaded online you can show them to friends

531
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,360
and family and then there's also a tool built in there they'll take a slideshow and just

532
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,120
create a video that you can share so instead of trying to figure out wow yeah so instead

533
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:05,760
of having to figure out how to do the slideshow thing it'll which this is a common question

534
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,080
my family has so this is this is gonna be my go-to answer now is just use this digicam

535
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,760
program it'll you know you build the slideshow and it will generate a video for you you just

536
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,160
email me your mp4 and we'll all be fine you know my aunts and stuff are gonna be putting

537
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,720
that up on facebook the moment that feature yeah and then for us geeks you're gonna love

538
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,360
this digicam 5.6 comes with improvements for database backends and support for mysql databases

539
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,440
so not only sqlites hey you got a real database yeah we're almost real i mean it's you know

540
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,480
when you got a lot of photos or what i was i and i think somebody told me that their

541
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,360
setup was like this once is a shared freaking mysql database between your machines yeah

542
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,220
there you go right you just have one put the photos like on an nfs mount you put the database

543
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:52,200
on a mysql server you throw you need the high availability digicam because you need to edit

544
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,880
at any time well to tell you the truth this problem yeah right i hate having like some

545
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,080
of my photos on one machine that's one of the things google photos it was really appealing

546
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,120
is i could just put them google photos could be the canonical master source but i want

547
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,880
the actual files on my file system and so digicam sort of that nice middle layer because

548
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,280
when i want the photo experience digicam is there but i know in the back end they're on

549
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,680
the file system throw it on a nas shared mysql database if i had an afternoon man i'd i would

550
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,120
seriously consider it i also love that the html expert like you were talking about that

551
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,720
is neat so like you could just go throw that on s3 or whatever or digital oceans new object

552
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,520
storage and then just go run a website that way huh you know the other thing too i'll

553
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,160
just mention i know for the paranoid this is not your top feature but for those of us

554
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,640
that leave the gps coordinate taggings on for the phones that support it they've brought

555
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,080
back the feature to show like where your photos are taken on a map stuff oh neat yeah always

556
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,960
fun with the kids it's always fun let's talk about this particular one in a mumble room

557
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,360
if anybody wants to jump in on this story in fact i'd like to actually maybe we'll toss

558
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,800
some of this to the mumble room because i'd like to hear their ideas on how they would

559
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:58,760
do this so prepare your minds because mozilla wants to give you two million dollars upfront

560
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,120
right like they'll just give it to me and then maybe i give them deliver no uh damn

561
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:07,920
no the two million dollars do they need my p-mail address yes or your bitcoin address

562
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:12,040
maybe i'm not sure chris it's all about ethereum these days come on i know that's what everybody

563
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:18,520
tells me uh except for i can't i can't i can't get into that uh so this is uh really it's

564
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,080
a prize to decentralize the web and they're looking for people to apply today mozilla

565
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:27,400
and the national science foundation are oh okay it's also the national science foundation

566
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,920
are offering a two million dollar prize for big ideas that decentralizes the web and they're

567
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,080
accepting applications right now uh so to give you a little idea of kind of what they're

568
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,800
looking for they want something that would work off the quote unquote grid when disasters

569
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:46,080
like earthquakes and hurricane strikes so keep this in mind mumble room communication

570
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,860
networks they say are going to be critical infrastructure and they want vital messaging

571
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,040
and mapping services to work after disaster uh the applicants will be expected to design

572
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:59,280
both the means to access wireless network i.e the hardware and the applications provided

573
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:05,120
on top of that network i.e software and project projects should be portable and easy to power

574
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:12,000
and simple to access what do you think sweetly what would you start with i was thinking like

575
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,200
some sort of mesh network and that like maybe okay you got to give me hardware and the software

576
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,960
you'd use to do it because it's part of the challenge so what would it be like phone based

577
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,480
would it be laptop based because you got to have something powerful enough to route the

578
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:31,760
traffic if the network gets busy probably maybe something server based in that it would

579
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,420
have to maybe go a little bit high end and that because you got to have something powerful

580
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:45,200
enough to handle the load and that not having an unintended uh ddos right yeah exactly that's

581
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,000
what i was like a tech man if you say a ham radio has already figured out some of this

582
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,400
mr tech man go uh all right fine but i mean i think i mean that's a good that's a good

583
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,400
point if i can speak for mr jimmy yeah um just that for some of these things if you

584
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,480
don't need high bandwidth then that might be a legitimate thing because in emergency

585
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:07,280
scenarios yeah you know you might just need like hey over here or we need food or whatever

586
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:11,680
it high bandwidth you would you would definitely need high bandwidth all right bash basheru

587
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,600
is what what is it bash flu ru bashful robot oh bad robot man i get for looking across

588
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,320
the room uh distance versus cost hit me with it well because if you think about it you

589
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:28,240
need to look at traditional carriers they they don't reach everywhere uh based on you

590
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,760
know last mile fiber or even you know that's why they're jumping on like a lot of the satellite

591
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,560
or the uh point-to-point wireless uh in canada here i mean you we have good transit across

592
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,800
the nation but you get us into the last mile and we're we're hooped like you just can't

593
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,840
get it and no one wants to pay for it uh there's like an s ton of dark fiber between vancouver

594
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,840
and seattle that's been sitting there from when uh what was it 365 was in there and no

595
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,560
one wants to buy it because it's too expensive yeah huh uh i guess that kind of is sort of

596
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,400
maybe in line with your thinking producer michael satellites uh yeah there's a there's

597
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:12,200
a project being done that allows anybody to contribute it uses open street maps and gps

598
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,640
to share data through like without any kind of actual like data service so you just need

599
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:22,520
to be able to access the gps so what's being done is anybody can go into the service sign

600
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,160
up for the project and you can spend anywhere between five to 30 minutes and they have like

601
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:32,360
these tasks that you can take data information that's been provided on the local level of

602
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:38,240
of like reporters and stuff and you can go in and change and manipulate the map data

603
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,720
so that people in emergency situations would get a notification really quick interesting

604
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:49,520
that would be so okay that kind of gives me an idea so what about well i got i think i

605
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,400
know how i would do it i think i i think i know how to do carry your pigeons maybe dude

606
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:58,720
maybe hey let's talk about it do you have an idea like how you would do this like to

607
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,920
me like at least i mean there's two kind of challenges here right there's the off the

608
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:09,680
grid and the smart community networks one and to me like thinking about it it depends

609
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,080
on what disasters are other things we're talking about here but it kind of seems like a software

610
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,160
problem like we've already seen some chat apps or other things on mobile that will work

611
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,240
without internet to do like nfc chat or wi-fi ad hoc chats so really to me it seems like

612
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,960
the the problem is that we don't have a lot of um schemas or specs or things around how

613
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,640
to share okay sure you have like a windows home group or something but realistically

614
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,120
there's not a lot of great ways to interact so like you know like you lose your internet

615
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,040
connection for the whole neighborhood but you need to share resources you're already

616
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,160
connected if there's still power between your is if you're on the same is like we could

617
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:45,720
have a lan but there's no there's no tools software or management would it be amazing

618
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:51,800
if like this if you could have a so uh devices that mesh network even when there's no internet

619
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,800
and say you had a wikipedia app and your phone had um the article's cache that i wanted i

620
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,480
could retrieve them from your like if some if you had if the software was smart enough

621
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,800
to not only announce what local data you had but if it was also smart enough to know that

622
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,800
the privilege level this is public information that's important like i have no way to offer

623
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,040
a service to my neighbors even though maybe we're all on the same isp the coax is connected

624
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,880
there's a switch that connects us all there's just not standards like it's like a proxy

625
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,320
server for everything in a over okay so here's where i was going with this is i think it's

626
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,440
also a software problem because i don't think you would do just one particular fix like

627
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,000
one of the things they mentioned in here is uh here's an example they said a backpack

628
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,080
containing a hard drive computer battery and a wi-fi router the router provides access

629
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,640
via wi-fi network to resources on the hard drive like maps and messaging applications

630
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,320
like doing a data drop off or here's a drop off but now you need a way to know that data

631
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,280
is there and you can access it so i think it is a software problem and then the other

632
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,040
thing i was thinking is why why have one why only have one approach here why why only one

633
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:01,880
thing why why just satellites why why just air balloons why not a like full spectrum

634
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,500
in some areas it's a raspberry pi stuck in the corner somewhere at someone else's place

635
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,580
they've got an x86 rig in their garage that's been sitting there providing a resharing networking

636
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,620
now for a year somewhere else it's something built into a television because it's a high-end

637
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:19,960
television and this is a common wireless chipset that's now been created at another place it's

638
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,240
somebody's phone that's just helping fill in a bit of a gap and in another area it's

639
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,400
a dgi drone that somebody strapped a raspberry pi to the bottom of but it's getting connection

640
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:33,040
and sharing signal and if the network exists the software is smart enough to make the access

641
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,560
happen if the connect however the connection is being provided if it's anything from a

642
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:44,360
dgi drone to a x86 rig in a garage like whatever is sharing the connectivity that doesn't matter

643
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:47,880
you make that irrelevant so that way that could be just hodgepodge because that's gonna

644
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,040
be geographical to there's gonna be some areas that are that are poor that can only afford

645
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:57,160
certain things that have hectic wiring and power and there's some areas and more connections

646
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:02,120
will be a part of this yeah yeah exactly so you know it reminds me of our conversation

647
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,920
with Michael Hall last week and endless OS and you combine what they're doing with offline

648
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,660
things like recipes and Wikipedia and reference material and books and you combine it with

649
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:20,080
something like this Mozilla challenge I wonder I just I'm fascinated by the whole idea especially

650
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,980
when you use things like the lens of the net neutrality debate like say say we go to some

651
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,160
dystopian future with net neutrality and corporate lockdown of the internet and the geeks had

652
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,840
to save the world how would they do it what we say you had to rebuild the new network

653
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,520
how would we do it we'd have to use the tools we have and it would be our phones our raspberry

654
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,320
pies I mean like we're kicked off YouTube we can't live stream anymore and that's the

655
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:45,020
only way you get videos I got selfies to post yeah right so join us over on the new internet

656
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,560
where you just take your tin can and piece of string and you tie it to your neighbor's

657
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,120
house and it's you know you watch JP it's cool but I think we could come up with something

658
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:59,080
so here's what I'm saying go to the Mozilla blog read more about it win the two million

659
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:04,000
dollars and then kick back a couple hundred bucks to JP for for hooking you speaking of

660
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,320
Mozilla they launched a new podcast this week I wonder if they have it up on their website

661
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,900
with their IRL podcast with Veronica Belmont you hear about this no yeah she's got a new

662
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,800
show working for Mozilla see this is why you got to listen to the ask Noah show you got

663
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:24,440
to listen because of Veronica Belmont joined Noah July our Noah July on ask Noah episode

664
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:30,720
14 Belmont IRL look at that yeah and Noah talked to her about her projects the upcoming

665
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,200
show the IRL podcast and all kinds of good stuff and they had a little Linux chat in

666
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,920
there too Veronica Belmont is as a class act and so it was a good interview on super exciting

667
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,120
yeah I think the new show launches today so how about that how about that I'll be curious

668
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,400
to see where that goes because I've liked her on thing I mean I've been listening to

669
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,120
Veronica Belmont since buzz out loud so I've liked her on all that stuff so I would I would

670
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,800
imagine she'd probably put together a pretty decent show oh yeah episode 1 is now out on

671
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,600
their IRL podcast dot org there you go oh you did listen to it yesterday Bash what'd

672
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:09,320
you think it wasn't bad it had a very produced feel to it kind of almost scripted but they

673
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,720
went heavy with the editing on it for sure yeah that's kind of a new thing you know shows

674
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,560
where we sit around here and just don't don't edit out when people don't answer and hitting

675
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,600
the microphone that's a that's a we are a dying breed we are legacy yeah we are legacy

676
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,840
podcast we don't need season chapter markers and podcast apps and all these I mean it's

677
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,720
just it's a straight brah mp3 feed sometimes we're an hour long sometimes we're an hour

678
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:39,160
and a half it's a real train wreck it's a real train wreck it is a hashtag disastrous

679
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:46,160
hashtag need data that's got to get that got to get that data well speaking of data West

680
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,480
oh DigitalOcean's got data for days go over to DigitalOcean.com and sign up and use our

681
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,240
promo code Linux Unplugged and get a $10 credit you heard Wes mention earlier they're introducing

682
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:03,040
object storage they have they have block storage which is okay for me I'm gonna be honest when

683
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,720
I when they introduced block storage I was good I was like this is all I need this is

684
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:10,760
what I done but the beauty to object storage is then you can build your applications in

685
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,800
a way that can scale for days and this is probably honestly if I was starting out today

686
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,240
how I would do things as well so it's pretty brilliant that DigitalOcean is launching this

687
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,560
and if you sign up for early access you can get a terabyte to play around with until like

688
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,200
October what yeah that's nice so DigitalOcean is a really simple and straightforward way

689
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,440
to spin up a nice rig on their infrastructure in seconds you they call them droplets I call

690
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:36,040
them fast Linux rigs they got SSDs for all of the different types of machines they have

691
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:43,000
lightning fast networking they have a beautiful UI to manage it and a simple API with tons

692
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,800
of pre-built command line utilities that really that's really what matters about the API is

693
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,760
the open source community has really embraced it something else that's really cool is they

694
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,640
have load balancing as a service they have monitoring and alerting and they have hourly

695
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:59,120
pricing available so you can get a 2 gig system with a two core processor 40 gigabyte SSD

696
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:06,680
of disk and three pair three terabytes terabytes of transfer for three cents an hour DigitalOcean

697
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:12,000
I tell you what go over there sign up use our promo code do unplugged get a $10 credit

698
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,160
and mess around they got data centers all over the world and you can even run free I

699
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,520
say fast Linux rigs but you can even run the good old free BSD what DigitalOcean.com use

700
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:28,600
our promo code do unplugged and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the unplugged

701
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:37,440
program so I I I am up for interruption at any point mumble as I go through the Dell

702
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,560
machine I have here so please feel free if you have any questions to stop me and I'll

703
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:47,240
answer them I had a I had a chance Dell I I guess I should probably back up so Dell

704
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:51,320
sent me a couple of weeks ago I've been running this machine for a few weeks the Dell Precision

705
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:58,440
5720 it's an all-in-one and this one came with Ubuntu 1604 and this was probably one

706
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,520
of the hardest machines I've ever reviewed I feel like it's getting hard because how

707
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,160
do you review a machine like this this is this is a it's a system it has Intel Xeon

708
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:16,600
E3 1275 processor so it's quad core with hyper threading this one had 3.8 gigahertz clock

709
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,800
which turbo boost up to 4.2 gigahertz with 8 megabyte cache you can put three drives

710
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:29,160
this one had a PCIe m.2 drive and a I think I was spinning terabyte drive in it I mean

711
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,800
it's just it's super fast and so you almost know immediately if you need a machine like

712
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,800
this or not like I don't really need to tell you if you need a Xeon system with 64 gigs

713
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,920
or up to 128 gigs but this one had 64 gigs of ECC RAM like you know that you know that

714
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,000
you know immediately if that's too much system for you so then I was trying to figure out

715
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,140
okay well so who are these people and what what are the workloads specific to the Linux

716
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:55,880
desktop for a system kind of like this and I kind of broke it down into a few different

717
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:02,000
areas definitely for a high-end photo management station and photo workflow like DigiCam this

718
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,840
thing looks like it would be super fast disk I oh so if you have large megapixel photos

719
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:12,800
from your DSLR high-resolution super vibrant screen tells been killing it with those screens

720
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,080
lately I also did some video editing on it Linux itself is not super great at 4k playback

721
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:23,800
right now but if you get hardware accelerated video decoding it works fine I did it and

722
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:29,180
this machine is a great one for it but I think probably the other area that this thing would

723
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:35,600
stomp would be software development I ran a series of open benchmark org benchmarks

724
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:40,680
on this rig and what's really if you if you're curious about any of this stuff check out

725
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,120
the pharaonic test suite it is really it's really a great piece of open source software

726
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:51,680
we've talked about it before on the show but goodness goodness or as commie says lordy

727
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,720
lordy lordy is this thing not great so first of all it simulates all kinds of workloads

728
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,900
and installs the actual packages on your machine from your distros repository and then goes

729
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,160
through and executes different workloads documents at all uploads it open benchmark allows you

730
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,280
to compare it to other similar system allows people to compare their system to yours it

731
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,800
is very very useful and so some of the benchmarks that I ran on it specifically to software

732
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,300
development were some of the most impressive wow so one of the highlights is I was able

733
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:24,560
to build Linux kernel 4.9 in under two minutes on the system now that would be a so there

734
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,000
would be a way you could just a quick takeaway from this review if you're curious how fast

735
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,920
the system is compared to yours go get kernel 4.9 source code on your system and build it

736
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:37,400
and time that and that give you kind of a baseline in some sense of how fast just phenomenal

737
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,880
how fast the system is this also means that if you're you have to use a custom kernel

738
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,640
you can't complain about it well and I just try to mention I just I just it uses the stock

739
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,420
kernel I just mentioned that as a benchmark because it if you can build it just gives

740
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,560
you a perspective you're building your own projects how fast they might totally this

741
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:57,240
comparison to the Linux kernel and I thought that was I thought that was just sort of an

742
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:00,940
interesting perspective but I have a link in the show notes where you can actually run

743
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:06,600
the comparison benchmark so you can click this link you give it the the address to the

744
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:10,840
phronics test suite and it runs the exact benchmark I ran and it gives you the comparison

745
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:16,760
result yes I have that in there so I spent I spent about a week using it to edit photos

746
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:22,300
and video and I found it to be pretty exceptional at that and so I'd say that whole that whole

747
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:27,160
sort of like high-end media production workload this thing's obviously great for anything

748
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,520
that has a lot of disk I owe this thing's pretty great for and if you're if you're clever

749
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,340
enough to monkey around with your system codecs or you're brave enough might be a better way

750
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:39,880
to put it because it's really it's maybe it could be a stability issue I I really say

751
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,720
you got to be you got to be willing to mess around with your codecs but you can get great

752
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:46,320
4k video editing if you're just working with 1080 video this thing's gonna it's gonna slide

753
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,400
yeah it's gonna slam it it I worked with this thing it even under heavy load it never felt

754
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,440
really bogged down at all it was it does seem like it would appeal for the you know creatives

755
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,160
or professionals who are just trying to get things done cuz you don't I mean like it's

756
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,720
all it's an all-in-one type unit so you just put it on your desk you plug it in and then

757
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,800
all right you got a computer now yeah let's talk about that is there really so if you're

758
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,280
getting a system this powerful who wants a system that's this powerful that's also an

759
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,800
all-in-one that was one of the other things I was trying to I was trying to figure that

760
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,960
out because to me at first it wasn't obvious but having used it for a little bit I can

761
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,400
tell you it's it's pretty low hassle and I think that's probably its biggest appeal if

762
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,600
you use the Bluetooth mouse and keyboard it comes with you and you use Wi-Fi you have

763
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,720
one cord coming out the back that's pretty nice and it's it's very clean it's very simple

764
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,600
the speakers are incredibly we'll talk about more of those in a little bit it's it's that

765
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:38,000
all is really nice where it gets kind of where it gets kind of interesting is if you combine

766
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,080
it with the touchscreen option because the whole thing folds down right sort of like

767
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:48,440
a surface studio but this is way more powerful than a surface studio and that is actually

768
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,760
kind of a useful feature for certain types of work especially for certain types of video

769
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:58,960
editing so I liked I could I started to use it more I was like I could kind of see this

770
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:04,360
machine is powerful enough I feel like this machine spec'd as this was which is about

771
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:11,120
$3,600 which is still like half the price of the iMac Pro would probably last you ten

772
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:17,960
years you have USB-C up the wazoo on the back of this thing you have Thunderbolt 3 the back

773
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,400
is removable the back is completely you you do two screws you do pull you remove two screws

774
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,680
and the whole back of the thing comes off and you have access to all of the hard drives

775
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,680
you have access to the memory I don't know about the CPUs I don't I believe they're there

776
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,640
they are socketed but I don't know if you'd actually want to upgrade them and I don't

777
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:41,780
know if that would void the warranty either but so it's it's much more sustainable than

778
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,280
an iMac because it's nothing's really soldered you can get access to all of that stuff pretty

779
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,480
quickly the screen is going to you mean where there's not going to be better screens really

780
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:54,680
for there will be but it's gonna be a great screen for a long time yep it's it is fast

781
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:02,600
enough with you know 64 gigabytes of ECC RAM 1.5 terabytes of super fast storage it the

782
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,720
all-in-one aspect of it kind of makes more sense now than I think it used to because

783
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:11,280
you're not really going to be super hard pressed to upgrade this thing that's where I thought

784
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,720
about it as like from like the business or small business or design company or something

785
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,680
like you could just buy that for an employee they're new you don't have to think about

786
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,520
anything else the keyboard mouse done mm-hmm speakers exactly that when I put myself in

787
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,640
the small business mindset and I thought oh yeah this could be a machine that you buy

788
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,560
an employee don't have to have IT staff who can set it up and network and all of that

789
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,160
yeah and you could you can buy the same one for your folks that run Ubuntu or Red Hat

790
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,720
and you could buy the same one for your folks around Windows 10 yeah totally and so that's

791
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:42,440
sort of an advantage that Dell has oh I don't know that was that's actually that's a good

792
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:49,400
question I I'm not sure you know I I use Katie and live in my testing and I I find it to

793
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:55,200
be usable if you use proxy media with high resolution stuff and I I put out a vlog that's

794
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,400
more of a real quick look at this that's more visual heavy because this is a very pretty

795
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,840
machine and I it is and I showed off some of my example work that I edited under this

796
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:06,160
machine in the vlog I have it embedded in the show notes which is sort of a more of

797
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,020
a quick take and my impressions of it and I thought that also be a good a good chance

798
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:15,240
to show off some of the work you can do with the machine so that's sort of the that's sort

799
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,840
of the my my oh I went through I had to go through several levels of realizations and

800
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,680
the one was there is a workload for this even if it's not high resolution video editing

801
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,760
there's still several really good workloads for this machine and software development

802
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:33,400
being one that I think is probably high on that list and then then I had to kind of wrap

803
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,200
my head around the hall all-in-one aspect of it like why would you want this as an all-in-one

804
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:41,000
versus like like a little mini tower under your desk or something connected to like a

805
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,080
5k screen I had to like I had to bridge that and it it wasn't until I sort of put myself

806
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,320
in a small business like well this machine is fast enough I buy this for myself for an

807
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,280
employee as a business this could easily be three four five six seven machine your machine

808
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,220
and then it started to make a little more sense because it's also it's also just a very

809
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:02,360
portable in a sense it's heavy but you can you can move between deaths it's not like

810
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,320
it you don't have to move a whole bunch of a whole bunch of extra stuff it it's a I don't

811
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,720
know it's it's kind of more appealing to me than it used to be and they they make it with

812
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:14,000
this really heavy base that sits on the desk so that way you can move the screen around

813
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,880
I was watching that and that's that seems nice like it doesn't it doesn't move around

814
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,400
doesn't rock or tilt so it means it's a little awkward to carry but you're not moving around

815
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,460
a lot right yeah so there so there's sort of the the first part of it I suppose the

816
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:30,900
second part of it would be sort of the thermals and the noise stuff because I had an opportunity

817
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:37,240
to punish them this machine and when it was very hot out it's very hot in the JB lab when

818
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:43,160
I when I did this test so it was probably 90 degrees in the room only a small piece

819
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:51,800
of the case melted it was it's fine yeah yeah what what Intel CPUs are running it's got

820
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:55,240
you depending on what now this is of course you can you can get with a range but the one

821
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:01,760
that I have is the Xeon E3 1275 so you have a huge range of CPUs yeah well they also essentially

822
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,200
have something similar this in the XPS line which is I you can do which then you can even

823
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:10,760
get with i7 or i5 so you have the XPS line of the all-in-one and then you have the precision

824
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,800
line and this is the precision line which is the workstation grade enterprise grade

825
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,980
line so that's why you have ECC and Xeons but it looks like the on the site they still

826
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:25,480
offer the the yep i5s and i7s if you want if you don't need the Xeons so I and I think

827
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,440
if you do that I think I might be wrong I think like starting price is like seventeen

828
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:31,660
and eighteen hundred dollars yeah sixteen ninety nine yeah maybe I'm shopping for one

829
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,920
right now as we're doing this so that is even more remarkable when you compare it to the

830
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,640
iMac Pro it's obviously not competitive really but you have a starting range of seventeen

831
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,920
hundred dollars and then you can configure upwards from there my favorite part here is

832
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,080
you know all right well it shows like windows for me I can upgrade to Red Hat Enterprise

833
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:55,080
for seventy more dollars that makes it look like a premium option well you get the Red

834
00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:00,920
Hat support so in a sense it is a premium option yeah yeah I I found it to be I found

835
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,960
it to be fun because I I was like okay well how the hell am I gonna break this machine

836
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:11,200
like what do you throw at a computer like this with that much RAM and and and and CPU

837
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,120
so that's what I tried to do so over the weekend I really punished the hell out of this thing

838
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,520
I put it in a 90 degree room not intentionally but that's how it worked out didn't have any

839
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:23,560
other rooms and yeah well it was hot too it was a hot weekend Sunday especially oh yeah

840
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:26,760
that was when I was really that was a hot day oh my god not really but we're from the

841
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:32,880
Pacific Northwest so our conception of hot is not that it's like a hundred and it's moist

842
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,200
AF I'll just say that I'll just say that it's moist AF but this thing also yeah so the so

843
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,840
the back's removable where you can upgrade the components but then just IO wise you have

844
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:46,480
display port out you have HDMI out you have Ethernet gigabit Ethernet I think it's got

845
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:53,800
three USB C ports on the thing plus USB a plus SD card reader on the side so it's got

846
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,540
tons of connectivity including connectivity for external graphics down the road this one

847
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:05,720
came with the AMD workstation graphics eight gigs of video RAM he's yeah yeah so I was

848
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:12,280
whoof it was it was even rendering all day yeah so I got another question architect was

849
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:18,320
saying in chat that it has a base amount that where's that located because yeah I think

850
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:23,240
I think this would be awesome if you had a base amount on the back of the screen so you

851
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:27,560
have no base and it's like you could have a floating arm on your desktop and it's like

852
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:31,680
you have no people will be going hey where's your computer and it's just the screen so

853
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,640
I think you have two options actually I think so I think the stand comes off but that takes

854
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:41,240
some trickery and I believe it on the bottom of the stand to the heavy part the plate there's

855
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:45,640
a base amount capability too so you I think you have two options with the sucker to mount

856
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:50,400
it which is pretty nice yeah because it would actually go really well on the wall I mean

857
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,740
a killer killer system for something like that and like especially like a doctor's office

858
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:59,180
where you wanted to be fast and reliable alright so let's talk about let's talk about thermals

859
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:02,960
let's talk about the speakers and all that stuff but because we got to we got to prepare

860
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:08,000
our we got to prepare ourselves let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy Linux Academy

873
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:11,160
thing I thought for sure that with Xeon processors and PCIe storage which often runs hot I thought

874
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:16,120
for sure once I really started pushing it I would hear it make quite a bit of noise

875
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:22,020
and I'd seen in I think it was swamp Swampy's review that he posted recently somebody else

876
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:26,960
posted a review just the other day while I was finishing up mine and complained about

877
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,160
some fan noise so I expected to hear quite a bit of fan noise and I think maybe depending

878
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,060
on what you're pushing the machine you might get different results but when I was pushing

879
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:42,040
the CPU super heavy and really working that doing things like builds and crypto benchmarks

880
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:47,240
almost inaudible in a 90 degree room which really really surprised me when I started

881
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:50,640
pushing the GPU more and more I could hear a different type of cooling kick and I don't

882
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,360
know if it's just one fan in the system or if there's multiple fans I didn't take the

883
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,000
back off to look to see how they're cooling it but I could definitely hear a bit more

884
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:04,520
of an increase in odd in sound but I actually tried to record a little bit of the machine

885
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:09,720
noise to give you a sample and the and the room the lab that I was in just the ambient

886
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,800
noise of the room was louder than the machine noise even when I was pushing the GPU so it

887
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:19,160
wasn't it wasn't too bad I think probably the thing that I'm the most mixed on and of

888
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,440
course I don't think Dell's gonna like to hear this but the thing that I'm the most

889
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:29,280
mixed on with this machine is the speakers they they some people have complained they

890
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,540
don't look good I actually think in person they look fine they're not very noticeable

891
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:36,560
I've so in like some photography of the machine I've I've I've lit it so that way you could

892
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,900
see where the speakers were at and there's three speakers along the front three like

893
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:45,600
a soundbar essentially and then in the base of the machine there's a sub so it's essentially

894
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:52,440
a seven speaker system and to say Dell is proud of this would be an understatement while

895
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:57,600
we were at Dell they made sure to demo it to us and told us about the Grammy award-winning

896
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:03,440
tuning and then when they sent this machine to me they included a literature that went

897
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,800
on for quite a bit about how advanced the sound system is in this and it's interesting

898
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,400
to see how companies like there's aspects of their products are extremely proud of and

899
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,160
the sound system was definitely one of them so I feel like anything negative I say about

900
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,840
this is gonna be disappointing but I have to tell you the truth and the truth of it

901
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:28,840
is for mids and they're great anything in mids like any music or a voice that's got

902
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,360
a dialogue listen to some podcasts while I'm working on this no problem yeah or you know

903
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:37,760
anything with guitar or cymbals or anything mids is gonna sound fantastic Spanish guitar

904
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,480
podcast Chris obviously I feel like the highs began to distort a little bit at the high

905
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:48,320
end just a little bit but here's why I say I feel like because what it really is is these

906
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:56,920
speakers brutal brutally handle bad audio like they just are brutal with it like I guess

907
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,540
here's a comparison I'm trying to make because I'm trying it's hard to like because we're

908
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,160
coursework I can't like play a sample because we're re-encoding this audio so like it's

909
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,660
really hard for me to to describe this problem to you but take out take take this sort of

910
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:13,400
analogy if you will if you if you ever had a high-definition television that you got

911
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:17,500
you brought it home you hooked it up and you plugged in your standard definition signal

912
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,200
to it and all of a sudden standard definition television with look which looked just fine

913
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:28,240
on your 22 inch CRT looks like total ass on you know that is how bad encoded audio sounds

914
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:34,240
on these speakers to my ears to my ears YouTube videos like a 480p YouTube video or even

915
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:40,720
a 720p YouTube video I can hear compression artifacts much more clearly with these speakers

916
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:46,740
than I could hear them say on a standard set of very nice monitor desktop speakers and

917
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:51,120
I think it's because these things accentuate highs and mids in a way that expose compression

918
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:55,180
artifacts that if you if you know what to hear you will hear it constantly with these

919
00:59:55,180 --> 01:00:00,840
speakers because it turns out the internet is full of bad audio now if you have good

920
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:07,280
and I did a little AB comparison I took mp3 tracks and I took wave tracks and I played

921
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:13,320
them side to side and noticeably even with mp3s I could hear improved audio I perceptibly

922
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:17,120
could notice the audio sounded better with these speakers like they if you give them

923
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:21,340
more material to work with they do more and if you give them a compressed file there's

924
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:25,020
just less for these speakers to work with and so they produce less and it's not that

925
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:31,760
it doesn't sound good it's that once you hear these speakers sound great everything else

926
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,200
sounds like shit right and so then you want everything to be uncompressed or to be flack

927
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:41,260
and you don't want to watch any YouTube video under 1080p and Spotify has to go out the

928
01:00:41,260 --> 01:00:46,460
window and like it's really just it's an interesting problem to have and also then combine that

929
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:50,420
with the fact that the lows are pretty weak like there's not a lot of bass it's got a

930
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:54,860
built-in sub but I mean they're only so big right so how do you right now for most people

931
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,980
they probably don't need a lot of boom in their in their desktop audio and if you're

932
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,820
doing content editing or creation on this machine these speakers are great if you're

933
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:06,780
doing podcast editing speakers are great if you're you know doing dialogue and stuff

934
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:10,420
like that they're great you're playing games even if you don't want a lot of bass I think

935
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:14,100
they're really great if you're watching a lot of YouTube if you're listening to a lot

936
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:18,500
of compressed audio it sort of drove me crazy a little wow so that was my sort of like it

937
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:22,100
was this really weird torn issue on the speakers because yeah I acknowledge they're great and

938
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:25,260
I can tell Dell's very proud of them. It's almost like a like studio monitor type thing

939
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:29,060
you know it's like unless you've got a they won't compensate for your bad audio they don't

940
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,140
bass boost they don't do anything you know it's like you'll just hear if it's good it

941
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:37,340
sounds great if not then hmm. So the way I looked at it's like well okay so when when

942
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:41,060
I have that problem I could wear headphones which I might be more inclined to do anyways

943
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:45,560
and then when I want built-in audio I have great audio available to me if my source is

944
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,020
good right but it is kind of awkward because like if you're an audio engineer then you're

945
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:53,900
gonna have headphones or very nice speakers anyway so you probably won't use those. Yep

946
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,380
yep yeah yeah that is interesting you're right about that it might make to me they almost

947
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:03,140
make more sense in the XPS line which is more consumer focused and yes to answer the question

948
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,980
it does have a headphone port so it's right there on the side too. If you look at the

949
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,740
shot I have up on the video there's the SD card reader there and then right below it

950
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:13,540
is the headphone. You're totally right though that like in person also I that bass is heavy

951
01:02:13,540 --> 01:02:16,580
I was just I was just playing with it and you're totally right like the fingerprints

952
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:21,460
do show up but you're right like it's it's like a bezel on you know screens that don't

953
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,540
have great bezel but you just you're looking at the screen you don't notice the speakers

954
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:28,540
at all they don't take away. They stand out more in the in when I lit the face so you

955
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:33,880
can see the features but it has a very infinity pool feel to the front of it and that's one

956
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,780
of the things that's neat is because you combine it on this floating hinge and then it has

957
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:43,460
the black infinity pool front so when the screen is off it just looks like this it's

958
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:49,420
just this infinite black hole sitting on your table and your soul sinks right in it's fine

959
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:55,340
and then when you turn it on it's it's one of the best screens you'll see I think for

960
01:02:55,340 --> 01:03:03,020
a long time and so it goes from this deep black infinity pool to this vibrant 4k screen

961
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:05,900
that almost goes all the way out here's a shot where I tried to demonstrate where you

962
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,900
can see the edges almost goes all the way out to the edge of the screen Dell's getting

963
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:14,400
really good with these things yeah they are and it just makes it totally pop and it everybody

964
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:18,700
that saw it commented on how how good it looks visually and so it's sort of hard to capture

965
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:23,100
that and then you combine it with the great IO and the super fast performance then you

966
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:28,380
have Dell support that you get with it I honestly you were right about the production quality

967
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:35,220
like the build quality of the thing yeah it's solid yeah it's I I I'm really impressed it's

968
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:39,820
like when they decide to do it they really decide to do it it's it's so solid like I've

969
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:44,980
carried this thing around now for weeks moving it between my place and the studio doing different

970
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:50,280
tests on it on hikes clearly I did and I mean I'm telling you having moved this thing around

971
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:54,700
it is even though that whole back panel comes off it is super solidly built which makes

972
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:58,140
me really happy even like I feel like there are like we've talked about the caveats about

973
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,500
like maybe this isn't for you you don't have a purpose it you being the audience member

974
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,800
or whatever but the fact that they can make something like this I'm excited to see this

975
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:14,180
trickle down or be this kind of approach in other product lines I honestly feel like if

976
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:19,420
I'm being honest I'm enough of a gearhead that this would be a machine for me like I

977
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:25,400
don't I guess I can't always justify Xeons and workstation graphics and ECC RAM but I

978
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:30,100
also I also know that I like my system to be extremely stable I also know that I want

979
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:34,060
my business investments to last a long time I actually I don't think it's that big of

980
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:37,880
a jump for somebody like me this would be a really I think this is a really great route

981
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:43,700
to go now and it because it doesn't start at $5,000 it now that Apple see Apple set

982
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:48,140
the entry price for the iMac at $5,000 wow so the fact that this thing spec'd pretty

983
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:53,820
nice as it is it's $3,600 well now it feels like a deal you know like thanks Apple you

984
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:57,940
just sold Dell's machine for me because that one yeah it's it's very nice so I thought

985
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:02,740
it was shockingly quiet very low fan noise even after multi-day benchmarks and the sound

986
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:07,740
system for the most part is really great and if you have invested in a good audio like

987
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:11,460
a good music collection you're gonna enjoy the shit out of these speakers I took this

988
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:15,820
thing I took it out in the lab and took it out there because like I it was too loud to

989
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:20,540
play in here it's too loud I have clips of me I tried to come up with a way to demonstrate

990
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:24,740
how it sounds but how do you really if you don't have the speakers if you go you don't

991
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:26,820
have the speakers to play it back you don't know what it sounds like you have to have

992
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:33,940
better speakers or you know at minimum I'm the same I do have b-roll of of me playing

993
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:37,900
music really loud on this thing and then trying to shout over it to demonstrate how loud it

994
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:42,260
is which I don't know if maybe the patrons want that I might wave file that you upload

995
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:46,900
somewhere I have I have video of it let me try to shout over this machine like this will

996
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:52,220
demonstrate it and then I got back to editing I'm like that is stupid as hell I'm not putting

997
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:58,300
that in the show that's a dumb idea but they're pretty impressive so anyways it's it's a really

998
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:04,220
nice rig it's also got a 1080p front-facing camera I think is that right yeah so I can

999
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:09,540
video chat my grandkids and actually a decent multi-array mic too so it's not not too bad

1000
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:16,360
it's the precision 5720 if if you'd like to get your hands on one and also if I've peaked

1001
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:20,660
your interest a little bit check out my review I posted it's a vlog 46 it's up at Jupiter

1002
01:06:20,660 --> 01:06:25,660
broadcasting.com right now I call it in the vlog the Linux powered iMac pro killer it's

1003
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:30,380
very click baity but the reason the reason why I did it is I want to I just want to get

1004
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:34,700
the word out there like this is not a paid review Dell denied there was no exchange of

1005
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:40,400
goods for me to do this review I'm just extremely excited by the idea of a really well-built

1006
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:46,220
all-in-one computer that really kicks ass performance wise and less than half the cost

1007
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:52,380
of the iMac Pro and you can buy it from them today Linux on it right now right now and

1008
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:57,800
the iMac Pro is not even available till December so I actually think it's like it just underscores

1009
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:02,660
how late to the game Apple is with the iMac Pro and so much of the market that they used

1010
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:07,260
to address with a device like this is being addressed by this machine really if you don't

1011
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:11,980
need Final Cut in motion yeah or Xcode and then we've talked a lot about how much like

1012
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:15,500
the developer story on Windows has gotten a lot better with the Linux subsystem and

1013
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:18,820
all of that like you could buy one of these I put Windows 10 on it and then run Linux

1014
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:23,100
subsystem and that's very enterprise friendly yeah I think it's a very competitive machine

1015
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:28,140
so I put I titled the vlog Linux powered iMac Pro killer not to be click baity so much as

1016
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:32,460
to just sort of set the conversation is hey there is already competition out here today

1017
01:07:32,460 --> 01:07:37,360
and it runs Linux and I think that's a different that's a different state than things years

1018
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,220
ago a machine like this that devastated something Apple released would have been would have

1019
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:44,740
been a Windows machine that would have been the big headline it's a Windows this Windows

1020
01:07:44,740 --> 01:07:49,020
seven workstation just destroys the latest Apple machine right no now it's an Ubuntu

1021
01:07:49,020 --> 01:07:53,500
machine and yeah I'll put the compare I'll put a couple of comparison benchmarks in the

1022
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,780
show notes if you want to compare it to your own machine just to kind of see what kind

1023
01:07:56,780 --> 01:08:00,540
of Delta you'd have if you did an upgrade like this it's just early days I'm messing

1024
01:08:00,540 --> 01:08:03,620
around this open benchmark stuff so if you like it leave me some feedback and give me

1025
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:09,820
suggestions of which benchmarks I should run it's not about coming up with stats and benchmark

1026
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:13,740
numbers that we can sit here and look at charts that's what for onyx is for what I really

1027
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:17,620
want to do with these is just give you some value so you can have comparisons to your

1028
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:21,820
own computer so you can actually walk away from a review like this and have an idea of

1029
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:25,060
what kind of difference it would make for your system if you were to upgrade so it's

1030
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:28,860
not really you know I'm not I'm not like some big some big benchmark guy all of a sudden

1031
01:08:28,860 --> 01:08:32,100
I just think it's a great way for the audience to sort of have a comparison to their own

1032
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:35,700
thing you know it gives you something to make it more relevant you can yeah you know I would

1033
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:40,140
love to get I would love to get people's feedback on that on what kinds they use and what they'd

1034
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:44,260
like to see from us so yeah check it out if you were curious more go google the Dell Precision

1035
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:50,380
5720 with Ubuntu they have it on the developer site and check out the vlog too.

1036
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:54,380
Mr. West what else should we mention before we get out of here today because we you know

1037
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:57,340
I mean we got some apparently people are already arriving at the studio for the barbecue.

1038
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,340
Did you hear that doorbell?

1039
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,340
They are early I think but that's fine.

1040
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:00,340
Barbecue's not till next week.

1041
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:05,340
Yeah come back or unless you have burgers now.

1042
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:10,660
Any other questions or thoughts about the Dell rig before we wrap up for the day?

1043
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,860
Do you think your kids would use it if you put it in front of them?

1044
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:15,380
Oh yeah for sure absolutely.

1045
01:09:15,380 --> 01:09:16,380
If I put my back on it.

1046
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:17,380
It's almost too nice for the kids.

1047
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:21,060
Yeah I would go more for an XPS line it would make you know if I guess if you had the extra

1048
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:25,620
money it's but I if you're just buying a family machine I might consider the XPS line I don't

1049
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:31,700
know I for me I've always found precision lines to be very very reliable systems there's

1050
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:34,980
like that I've always been a fan of the business class systems and I'm willing to pay just

1051
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:38,820
a bit more for business class if you know it'll last you right yeah yeah yeah yeah

1052
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,220
I don't know it's a good question.

1053
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,700
All right Mr. West where should people find you throughout the week?

1054
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:47,740
You can find me at Westpac or on the TechSnap program that's right hey just stay tuned we'll

1055
01:09:47,740 --> 01:09:52,420
be live with that right now yeah yeah that's coming up next on the jblive.tv stream if

1056
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:56,240
you show up on a Tuesday you can hang out our mumble room hang out in our chat room

1057
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:01,620
and then stick around kick back and wind down with Dan and West on the TechSnap program

1058
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:05,220
go check out the latest episode of Ask Noah for his interview with Veronica Belmont check

1059
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:09,900
out the vlog for a quick video tour of the Dell system I just got done yammering on about

1060
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:15,420
nice and I hope I hope you'll be able to tune in or join us next week for the barbecue

1061
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:20,260
wow that might be a fun show to make it live if you can I guess okay everybody thanks for

1062
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:48,900
joining us and we'll see you right back here next Tuesday for episode 204!

1063
01:10:50,900 --> 01:11:18,900
Now it is our duty to title this thing JBtitles.com I'll be curious to see if anybody actually

1064
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,900
takes me up on that open benchmark thing because I brought it up in the vlog too and I haven't

1065
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:25,060
really gotten very much traction I think people don't actually want to take the time to do

1066
01:11:25,060 --> 01:11:28,500
it unless they're really serious about making maybe we need to make it a little more competitive

1067
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:33,220
you know like hey guys think you can beat Chris's sweet open benchmark I was what I

1068
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:36,820
was now I'm thinking about that is like a server I can go run this on and shame you

1069
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:46,500
or that should be a challenge like here run open benchmark yeah yeah I thought about doing

1070
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:51,140
that in the vlog I just never really executed on it it didn't cross my mind really quick

1071
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:56,220
that's what a lot of people do benchmarks for there's probably like a whole subset of

1072
01:11:56,220 --> 01:12:03,380
the PC market or enthusiast PC market that runs 3d mark and other benchmark tools to

1073
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:09,780
do that and go okay this is like the best score with this crazy system how high can

1074
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:14,460
you get and things like that so we've got the Dell review and I think also the fact

1075
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:19,900
that mirror could save desktop Linux so whichever no just kidding I don't know it could go nowhere

1076
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:26,060
yeah that's true who knows who knows I'd like to find out more about that I know I thought

1077
01:12:26,060 --> 01:12:30,620
the sway guy was working on something like that too yes I was trying to rack my mind

1078
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:34,100
for the word sway I could not remember during the show I need to try that maybe I'll switch

1079
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,980
since you're gonna switch away from now maybe I'll try sway for a while just see if I can

1080
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:44,260
get by with it and that'd be fun yeah let's do that I think it's wasted effort he's such

1081
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:52,140
a cynic don't listen to him mates Wayland miracle oh my god that is some fucking maneuver

1082
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:58,580
in every guy tell you what that Dell looks nice I got burn with the dub rod he says yeah

1083
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:03,460
yeah yeah yeah hybrid graphics with Radeon and guess what I can't use it because no 1604

1084
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:08,780
driver and hybrid graphics is rough man hybrid graphics it's rough yeah now that's probably

1085
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:12,260
not gonna happen with their new developer line of machines I would bet you know you'd

1086
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:18,060
hope not yeah that you know the we have the original Sputnik in production we have an

1087
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:42,980
XPS from like two models ago and they've all been pretty solid
