1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,360
It is our last episode for a bit from the studio,

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,040
for a long bit, actually.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,120
I wonder how that's going to be.

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,280
And it's kind of perfect because Brent's here.

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,040
Hello, Brent.

6
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,920
Well, hi.

7
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,480
And he made us brunch.

8
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,520
He sure did.

9
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,280
Oops.

10
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,240
It was great.

11
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,480
We had, what is it, like an egg?

12
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,280
Is it a frittata?

13
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,040
Is that what it's called?

14
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,200
You know, I typically like to make a frittata here,

15
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,920
but I was on the hurries.

16
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,640
So it's a modified frittata.

17
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,480
And now maybe it's like a Nelly frittata.

18
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,840
Well, see, you keep that nice cast iron pan and the cover

19
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,000
that goes with it here for me.

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,680
So I just kind of created a micro oven in the cast iron,

21
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,080
and it did all right.

22
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,880
Nice.

23
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,720
And then he also utilized the new air fryer

24
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,720
to make some fried potato sides for us.

25
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,000
Already a convert.

26
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,080
That's the first time I use that thing,

27
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,680
and I must say I'm impressed.

28
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,760
I realize this is why there's kind of like in JB,

29
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,680
inside JB, there's kind of like resource contention over Brent.

30
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,200
Like when Brent's coming to the studio, Alex telegrams me,

31
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,440
like, oh, you got Brent time?

32
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,160
That's no fair.

33
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,360
I want Brent time.

34
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,480
This is why.

35
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,960
Because he's in there cooking breakfast and stuff

36
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,600
for everybody.

37
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,720
He brings snacks.

38
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,560
He does.

39
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,600
He brings snacks.

40
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,880
Guys, guys, you can check.

41
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,840
You can check.

42
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:19,160
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

43
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,000
My name is Chris.

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,720
My name is Wes.

45
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,920
Hello, Wes.

46
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,520
Hello.

47
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,680
Are you full and satisfied?

48
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,720
Not quite, but I've got the beer at the ready.

49
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,200
He did also bring beer, too, which we did not mention.

50
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,840
I know how to win hearts.

51
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,600
You do.

52
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,000
This episode is brought to you by a Cloud Guru, the leader

53
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
in learning for Cloud, Linux, and other modern tech skills.

54
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,960
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs,

55
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,720
get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

56
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,320
Well, today on the show, we're going

57
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,760
to tell you how to run every single Linux distribution,

58
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,400
well, nearly, at once.

59
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,120
And I'm not talking about VMs.

60
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm not talking about containers.

61
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,400
I'm talking native on one box simultaneously.

62
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,800
You pick the host distro, and then you hijack it.

63
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,320
And we'll chat with the developer of this mind-boggling

64
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,400
tool.

65
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Plus, we got the community news.

66
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,880
We got some feedback.

67
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,040
But first, we have to say time-appropriate greetings

68
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,920
to our virtual lug.

69
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,040
Hello, Mumble Room.

70
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,540
Hello.

71
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,040
Greetings.

72
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,540
Hello, Wes.

73
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,040
Hello, Wes.

74
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,540
Namaskaram.

75
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,640
Hello, Brent.

76
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,020
We are at full power today.

77
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,760
We have 27 of them in there.

78
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,020
We have some in the on-air and some in the quiet listening,

79
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,280
and it's awesome.

80
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,620
And the Mumble Room is going to be the trickiest piece

81
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,520
while we're on the road.

82
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,720
So I'm glad everybody made it for this one, at least.

83
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,780
Oh, but yeah.

84
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,000
So Brent got in last night.

85
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,760
Sure did.

86
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,720
After a day of travel for you, and what

87
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,080
felt like a day of commuting for me to get down to the airport.

88
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,920
And so Brent is joining us here in Seattle.

89
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,040
And then he's going to board Lady Joops tonight,

90
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,400
probably think, or tomorrow morning, but probably tonight.

91
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,400
And then we head out tomorrow morning.

92
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,720
Me, Brent, Hadia, my three kids, and the dog,

93
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,040
all in Lady Joops.

94
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,120
It's like a little land cruise you've got going here.

95
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,240
Yeah, it's a land yacht, but it's going to.

96
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,880
Are you crazy, Brent?

97
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
Are you just crazy?

98
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,700
I think I am, but I'm strangely OK with it.

99
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,440
OK.

100
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Yeah, we are going to have a chase vehicle, as they call it.

101
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,320
So Brent will often probably be in the chase vehicle.

102
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,400
And then I imagine what will end up happening

103
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,720
is Brent and I will essentially become co-drivers.

104
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,620
So there'll be times where he'll have eyes on something

105
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,080
I don't have eyes on, and we're going to have two-way radios.

106
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,440
Oh, that's just adorable.

107
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,200
Hey there, Brent, you know?

108
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,040
Good, Chris.

109
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,360
I think you're going to need some cute radio nicknames too,

110
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,680
right?

111
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,240
Call signs?

112
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,680
Yeah, OK.

113
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,200
Maybe he could be Brunch.

114
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,960
Seems appropriate.

115
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah.

116
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,080
And so something that Hadia and I do

117
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,680
is sometimes if I need to get over,

118
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,000
she can move over earlier and kind of create

119
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,040
a hole in traffic for me.

120
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,880
Name and presence.

121
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,720
Yeah, exactly.

122
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,260
Or sometimes scoot ahead and check out

123
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,040
a gas station or a rest stop and that kind of thing.

124
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,160
And it also gives you a chance to have your own space,

125
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,040
listen to something or make phone calls or whatever.

126
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,600
Do business while you're going down the road, as one does.

127
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,880
You've got your own podcast playlist, I'm sure.

128
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,280
But on top of that, Brent's going

129
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,480
to be working with me to record content during the trip,

130
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,320
including chats with team members and information

131
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,680
and just anecdotes from the trip and all that stuff.

132
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,280
So we could see some fresh brunches for everybody.

133
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,080
Oh, now that is exciting.

134
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,360
So pretty excited about that.

135
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,640
And totally feel unprepared.

136
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,760
I don't have any of the production gear packed yet.

137
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,520
Because I didn't want to break anything down

138
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,360
until we're done with the show.

139
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,280
We need it here, yeah.

140
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,320
I've taken a couple of things out of the studio early,

141
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,480
like my mute pedal and a couple of cables and stuff.

142
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,320
But it's funny, too.

143
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,200
I mean, it's not like you haven't been preparing.

144
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,240
You've been thinking about this.

145
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,640
You've been churning through it for, I mean,

146
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,680
months now at this point.

147
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,360
Yeah.

148
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,600
And you remember last week, we had a server lockup.

149
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,440
And it locked up twice in one morning.

150
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,520
It was looking real bad.

151
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,200
It was just after a Pacific Northwest heat wave.

152
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,440
And I was literally going into panic mode.

153
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,640
Because this server is a critical component

154
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,040
of production.

155
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,640
Because I need to get in and administer the mixer.

156
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,520
And I do that via a WireGuard tunnel that

157
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,800
comes in through that server.

158
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,600
So if I didn't get access to the next cloud instance on there,

159
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,480
if I couldn't get access to the media that's stored on there,

160
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,960
if I couldn't get access to the archive, if one thing,

161
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,440
I need WireGuard, I need to get access to the mixer

162
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,600
so I can control the studio.

163
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,560
And that's a critical role that server fulfills.

164
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,800
And it's designed around that, right?

165
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,680
It's our big ZFS-powered redundant server.

166
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,520
No, it turns out.

167
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,600
It was locking up.

168
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,840
It was locking up.

169
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,920
And so Wes and I were racking our brains.

170
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,120
Like, nothing has changed.

171
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,880
So we were thinking maybe it's hardware failure.

172
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,040
Because in the absence of software change,

173
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,160
you start to suspect something changed in hardware.

174
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,400
And it's an older used machine as we put it through its paces.

175
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,960
It's literally sitting in an oven.

176
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,800
I mean, sometimes it gets so hot out there

177
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
you could slow cook pork ribs.

178
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,120
It's bad.

179
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,040
So we thought that must be what it is.

180
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,160
Then it dawned on us, like, I don't know,

181
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,120
maybe after the show.

182
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,600
I can't remember when we thought about it.

183
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,640
But we thought, you know, there is one change.

184
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,360
And I don't know if this is what it is.

185
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,200
But the one change we made is I reinstalled NetData,

186
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,480
a really handy tool that we recommended before.

187
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,680
And I installed the LM Sensors package.

188
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,080
And those are the only two changes I made.

189
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,940
But maybe something is there.

190
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,920
So I did a systemctl disable NetData, turned it off,

191
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,000
and stopped it.

192
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,720
And ever since I did that, it's been solid.

193
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,200
The system hasn't locked up once.

194
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,120
And it's still gotten hot a few times.

195
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,840
The other thing I've done, I've started setting up fans

196
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,220
to vent the garage into the house.

197
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,720
It heats up the rest of the house.

198
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,480
But then I have a series of fans that kind of push it out

199
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,140
the back door.

200
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,840
And so it means the downstairs gets warmer.

201
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,120
But the garage area drops like 10, 15 degrees.

202
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,760
It's a significant improvement.

203
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,120
I like this sort of readjusting the entire climate

204
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,360
control of the studio for that poor little server.

205
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,640
And then what we've done is we've

206
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,560
sealed off the actual studio, the production

207
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,080
part of the studio where we record.

208
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,400
And we've installed an air conditioner there

209
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,120
to climate control the specific studio.

210
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,560
Now, if you're interested, we are selling very sketchy colo.

211
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,240
So don't worry.

212
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,320
Discount rates.

213
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,920
Great prices.

214
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,320
Average uptime.

215
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,280
Great prices, OK uptime.

216
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,440
Jupiter garage hosting.

217
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,120
I love it.

218
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,200
So hopefully, everything's going to be OK.

219
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,660
And it'll last through the road trip.

220
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,160
I haven't touched it since because I

221
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,120
don't want to introduce any state change at all.

222
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,540
I mean, we'd like to eventually be

223
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,680
able to try re-enabling net data, for instance.

224
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,760
We want to validate this.

225
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,800
Not right now.

226
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
So my thought is when we get back,

227
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,560
I'll probably flip net data back on and see if we get lockups.

228
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,880
I'm hopeful that everything will be fine.

229
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,040
And that's just one less thing to worry about right now.

230
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,600
And if it doesn't, I should be able to tuck and roll fairly

231
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,920
easily into spinning everything up that's essential,

232
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,660
with the exception of the mixer.

233
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,120
It's still tricky because it's on the physical land here

234
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,720
at the studio.

235
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,200
And I need a way to remotely connect

236
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,640
while I'm on the road.

237
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,260
And the solution I have now is so perfect.

238
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,240
And so I don't know.

239
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,160
Maybe in a pinch, we could set up another system in here

240
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,360
and act as a wire guard system or something.

241
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,680
Yeah, we'll get some back doors going.

242
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,920
The one thing we have going for us is Wes flies out later.

243
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,960
So you'll be here a little bit after I'm gone.

244
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,640
There will be a critical window still.

245
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,360
But if it fails before then, we've got some time.

246
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,100
Yeah, so that's hopefully it.

247
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,280
The meetups are coming soon.

248
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,080
The first meetup will be in Salt Lake City on August 7th.

249
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,480
And the second meetup will be in Denver on August 20th.

250
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,920
The Denver one, we'll have our friends from Lidnode there.

251
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,600
Linux gamer Garnet will be there.

252
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,560
We'll be giving away some raspberry pies.

253
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,200
They're going to be giving away some big, like,

254
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,640
big dollar amount Linode credits.

255
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,760
They're going to have all kinds of stuff they're doing there.

256
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,200
And we're also going to have drinks and snacks.

257
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,700
And so it's going to be a big meetup.

258
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,200
And we're also going to bring on board for the Salt Lake City

259
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,520
meetup.

260
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,580
We're going to have swag on board

261
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,880
to give out to folks that make it to the Salt Lake City

262
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,960
meetup as well.

263
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,720
So hopefully that all goes smoothly.

264
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,560
But what do you say?

265
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,300
Maybe we should do a little community news.

266
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,600
Yeah, we better get through it.

267
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,480
We've covered some of the possible downsides

268
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,160
to the Linux ecosystem with the Steam Deck,

269
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,080
specifically around focusing more on Proton development

270
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,520
to less on Linux native games.

271
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,440
But there's clear positives as well.

272
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,840
And I thought maybe we'd focus on those today.

273
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,960
So along with some of the optimizations

274
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,120
that you're going to see just throughout the Linux stack

275
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,400
with the Steam Deck, the one we wanted to talk about

276
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,200
is AMD's work.

277
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,520
They've been working with Valve on CPU frequency and power

278
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,480
scaling improvements to enhance the Steam Play gaming

279
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,600
experience on the modern AMD platforms that

280
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,800
are in our laptops, desktops, and also the Steam Deck.

281
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,400
Yeah.

282
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,680
Now, historically, AMD hasn't really

283
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,420
worked on the Linux CPU frequency scaling stuff,

284
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,320
especially in the kernel as much as Intel has.

285
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,480
And actually, that kind of goes for other areas of power

286
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
management as well.

287
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,800
But going by a recent job posting and now some patches,

288
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,860
it seems AMD is ramping up efforts

289
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,480
in those areas, including some specific stuff

290
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,360
around the scheduler.

291
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,960
And we know how important that is.

292
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,640
Yeah.

293
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,840
I was looking.

294
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,220
I couldn't find the job postings anymore.

295
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,880
But Michael Larble over at Feronix

296
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,480
kind of implied that it might be like multiple job postings

297
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,080
that AMD had to work on this stuff.

298
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,000
Now, AMD and Valve are working together

299
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,860
to improve the performance and power efficiency

300
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,080
for modern AMD platforms running on Proton.

301
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,960
They've also spearheaded the ACPI CPU frequency driver.

302
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,680
The focus on Proton still remains.

303
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,320
That's interesting, but I kind of, I mean, we'll see.

304
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,080
We're going to hear more about this at XDC.

305
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,920
It seems AMD will be presenting some information.

306
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,680
And it's quite possible that some of this

307
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
is based around some effort that we've already

308
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,760
seen for a previously proposed driver.

309
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,040
We'll see, something that AMD actually suggested back in 2019.

310
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,440
Michael Larble is on it like a bonnet over at Feronix,

311
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,120
though, so keep checking over there for more information.

312
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,800
And also related to just like Steam Deck, perhaps the hype

313
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,680
bubble, it seems like it's driving a few more people

314
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,880
into Linux gaming than we've seen recently.

315
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
Liam over at Gaming on Linux reports

316
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,320
that Linux has seen a bit of a surge right now.

317
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,440
And it's flirting with that 1% user share on Steam.

318
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,880
Say it ain't so.

319
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,640
Yeah.

320
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,720
If we do the math here, take the number of monthly active users

321
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,600
Steam says, 120 million, that would give us

322
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,080
like 1,204,000 monthly active Linux users on Steam.

323
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,960
1.2 mil monthly?

324
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,480
That's a real demographic.

325
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,040
It is.

326
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,640
I mean, 1% seems really small.

327
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,560
But then you consider like everyone

328
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,280
uses Steam who plays games at all, so wow.

329
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,560
And why is it surging right now?

330
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,400
What's changed?

331
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,560
It's the Deck, right?

332
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,040
It's got to be the news of the Deck.

333
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,320
And maybe people are like, well, Valve's

334
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,420
taking it this seriously.

335
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,200
Maybe I should look at it again.

336
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,160
I mean, I admit it got me to reopen up Steam again

337
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,680
and poke around a little bit.

338
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,000
I will say just casually, it does

339
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
seem that there's some general acceptance among the Linux

340
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,760
curious folks that maybe just they're not

341
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,360
running Linux on the desktop, but they use it for work

342
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
or whatever.

343
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,320
I've noticed more of them hearing about Proton

344
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,960
and hearing good experience reports.

345
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,000
So I wonder, too, if there's just a sort of slow build of,

346
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,760
Proton's just been good for a while now.

347
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:38,400
And getting better.

348
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,560
And it's getting better.

349
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,640
One question I have is, do you think

350
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,840
this is any different than when they first

351
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,700
sort of jumped all in on Linux?

352
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,240
It sounds familiar to me.

353
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,400
Maybe a few years ago, they kind of did the same thing.

354
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,020
With the Deck, you mean how is it different?

355
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,540
Yeah.

356
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,400
I think this time, the Deck is an accumulation

357
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,700
of all of their mistakes that they wish they would have done

358
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,800
a little bit differently and kind of all in on this one.

359
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,760
In fact, the Steam Controller itself,

360
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,760
the original Steam Controller, initially

361
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,000
started with a screen in it.

362
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,920
And then Valve transitioned everything

363
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,200
to touchpads over time.

364
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,520
Don't call it a Dreamcast.

365
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,360
Yeah.

366
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,320
And they've kind of been working through this.

367
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,120
Like the sound system in the Deck

368
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,360
is basically an upgraded version of what's

369
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,560
in the Index that they've already been making.

370
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,680
And so that kind of stuff, I think,

371
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,560
at each kind of phase, since they announced Steam Machines,

372
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,880
they've learned lessons there.

373
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,280
And for better or for worse, I think

374
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,960
that's also what's driving them to push Proton so much,

375
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,400
part of that whole thing.

376
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,320
And I just saw a Hacker News conversation thread today

377
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,920
that was, I think it's great.

378
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,700
And this guy had all of these reasons

379
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,120
for why he thinks it's great that Valve is pushing Proton,

380
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,680
and that should be the go-forward strategy forever

381
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,720
and all this kind of stuff.

382
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,000
And I don't know about that.

383
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,120
But I sit here, and I look at this, and I see it as,

384
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,400
it's a real multispectral issue.

385
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,020
And part of it, to your question, Brent,

386
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,080
is even if this sort of is not much different

387
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,520
than their original announcement and kind of peters out,

388
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,080
the interim enhancements that we're getting, like with AMD

389
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,160
contributing to the CPU scaling code

390
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,560
and the intermediate stacks for the video drivers

391
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,320
and the audio stuff is getting so much work and improvement

392
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,480
to prepare for this that we've kind of already benefited.

393
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,000
Yeah.

394
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,120
It seems like they've learned a lot since the whole Steam

395
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,660
Machine thing.

396
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,660
Not only is it more focused in the hardware sense,

397
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,160
we are seeing some specific improvements coming in, right?

398
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,300
But also, they've just had this experience

399
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,640
of working with various contractors

400
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,980
on wine and Proton improvements and getting more stuff targeted

401
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,960
towards the kernel.

402
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,060
So it seems like they're just leaving

403
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,600
a lot of good stuff in their wake, whatever they're doing.

404
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,360
Mm-hmm.

405
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,780
And for me, Linux has never been a really big gaming platform,

406
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,640
because I've kind of decided that Linux is,

407
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,200
when I want to play on my computer,

408
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,760
I play with Linux or a desktop environment,

409
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,680
but something in that stack.

410
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,120
And when I want to play a video game, I play on my Switch.

411
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,160
And I hope that the Deck might replace the Switch for that,

412
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,600
where then I'm still on Linux, and I'm still

413
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,160
playing the games I've already bought,

414
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,960
and I could move to the PC.

415
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,400
And the other thing that's so exciting about that is,

416
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,960
I could be on the Deck, and the kids could be on a PC,

417
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,720
or they could be on the Deck, and I can be on a PC,

418
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,000
and we can all play together.

419
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,460
I think that's going to be something

420
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,420
that the other consoles don't offer right now,

421
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,800
and that is going to be a huge selling point to me.

422
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,880
We'll see where it goes.

423
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,840
As a dad, I like it a lot.

424
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,960
As a gamer myself, I think, I don't know.

425
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,400
Because for me, the Switch offers the Nintendo franchise

426
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,000
games, like Mario, like Zelda, like Metroid.

427
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,640
And that's always going to be a draw to me.

428
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,200
Does that just show your age, Chris?

429
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,480
Yeah, maybe.

430
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,920
Maybe.

431
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,600
Let's talk about ingenuity.

432
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,920
What an amazing accomplishment.

433
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,640
You guys remember the Linux Copter on Mars?

434
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,840
How could we forget?

435
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,600
Oh, man, has it been something to watch this thing go.

436
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,060
And in a brand new video, which we'll

437
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,760
have linked in the show notes, you

438
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,680
can see ingenuity make its highest and most complex flight

439
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,000
to date.

440
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,720
And they're now taken into an area that sounds treacherous.

441
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,520
It's called Raised Ridges.

442
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,680
Watch out, little copter.

443
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,400
Now, during this trip, which is its 10th flight on Mars,

444
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:07,120
ingenuity covered a distance of 310 feet, or 95 meters,

445
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,440
for you metric folk.

446
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,720
So we're doing a record altitude for it of 40 feet, or 12 meters

447
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,220
high.

448
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,100
Remember, that's in the crazy thin atmosphere over there.

449
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,440
Combined with the distance it's traveled throughout all

450
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,280
of its prior flights, ingenuity has now

451
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,680
flown for more than a mile, arbitrary milestone maybe.

452
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,040
But I mean, that's some serious performance.

453
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,720
It's amazing.

454
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,480
It was originally designed to only perform four flights.

455
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,560
So we're talking 10 flights now?

456
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,440
This has been since April, too.

457
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,560
Not only is that just an incredible accomplishment

458
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,280
on its own, but it has essentially

459
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,380
submitted this type of Linux-powered device

460
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,440
as a go-to, must-have secondary piece of equipment

461
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,520
when exploring another planet.

462
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,440
What?

463
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,360
Can we just soak that in for a second?

464
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,200
From, like, we've never done this before.

465
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,700
We're not sure if it's going to work

466
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,960
or if it's up to the task to, no, we need these.

467
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,200
We need to bring these along.

468
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,700
Right.

469
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,920
And it's when we're exploring other planets.

470
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,640
It's the stability of Linux that really makes it appropriate.

471
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,600
It's crazy, man.

472
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,880
It is so, so crazy.

473
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,560
I am so excited to watch the development of this thing.

474
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,440
And it's going to continue on, too.

475
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:08,880
Yeah, right?

476
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
I mean, it's not done yet.

477
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,560
As we've seen, I think JPL and NASA

478
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,360
have a pretty good record of getting

479
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,520
all they can out of our little adventure buddies

480
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,560
over on the Red Planet.

481
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,440
Ha, ha, ha.

482
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,360
Linode.com slash unplugged.

483
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,400
Go there to get $100 in credit for 60 days on your new account

484
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,160
and you support the show.

485
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,120
Linode is our hosting provider for everything

486
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,780
we've built in the last couple of years.

487
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:35,080
Since we went independent, we've built everything on Linode.

488
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,140
The infrastructure is solid, it's flexible,

489
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,320
and of course, it performs.

490
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,360
And you can focus on your project,

491
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,080
not on your infrastructure issues.

492
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
And you get 11 data centers to choose from all

493
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,800
around the world, and every service level

494
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:49,780
is backed by the best customer support in the business.

495
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,960
And they've been around since 2003,

496
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,480
which means they've been doing this now for 18 years.

497
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,560
And every step of the way, they've

498
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,480
had to kind of innovate and stay competitive

499
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,960
and watch out for different players to come in the market

500
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,400
and offer different packages and different dashboards.

501
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,440
Linode's got all of that.

502
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,720
And they've really honed in something special.

503
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,040
You know, a few months ago, I set up a $5 Linode.

504
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,880
And I just use it for simple passing data

505
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,200
between home and the studio.

506
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,800
It's like an intermediary that adds just additional bandwidth.

507
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,960
And then once I had it going, I was like, well, gosh,

508
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,400
you know, I could set up an SSH jump post on that.

509
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,640
Oh, you know, I could put some quick documentation up there

510
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,720
that I could SSH into and read real quick.

511
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,040
Oh, hey, you know what would be nice

512
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,680
is if I put a status page up there that

513
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,200
could check on the connections remotely that I could go,

514
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,640
oh, you know what else I could do?

515
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,680
And from on and on and on.

516
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,080
And it's all just on a $5 Linode.

517
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,360
It's so impressive.

518
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,120
You really can just kind of push it beyond what you'd expect.

519
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,040
And the value is there because they're always

520
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,280
investing in the hardware.

521
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,320
And they're 30% to 50% cheaper than some of the big hyperscalers

522
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,040
out there.

523
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,980
And I could sit here and tell you about this all day long.

524
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,820
But you really got to go see it for yourself.

525
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,400
And this $100, it's really going to let you test it.

526
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,920
So head over to linode.com slash unplugged.

527
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,840
Get $100 for your new account.

528
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,560
Try this stuff out.

529
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,240
Build something.

530
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,360
Learn something.

531
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,720
And support the show.

532
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,400
You know, we are just almost to one year

533
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,040
since we've gone independent.

534
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,720
Just a few of us sitting here working our hearts out

535
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,000
to make content.

536
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,920
And the reason we can do this and the reason why

537
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,520
we can take this as seriously as we do

538
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,440
and invest the energy and effort we do

539
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,040
is because people out there take advantage of our sponsor offers

540
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,000
and let them know that it's worth their money.

541
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,160
It's worth our sponsors' time.

542
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,800
They get value out of our shows.

543
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,220
And it's such a nice system because they're

544
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,440
offering you something great.

545
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,480
I mean, I enthusiastically endorse Linode.

546
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,560
I have zero reservations about that.

547
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,640
And $100 is real value.

548
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,160
Like, they're meeting you there with $100.

549
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,800
So go try it out and support the show.

550
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,560
Linode.com slash unplugged.

551
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,160
So we teased this earlier, but it is true.

552
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,240
You can actually run every Linux distro at once.

553
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,680
Now, this is something that we've been taking a pass at.

554
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,320
No kidding.

555
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,720
I mean, it's a little bit of a dream, right?

556
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,520
You love Arch.

557
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,060
You want all the stuff in the AUR,

558
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,880
but sometimes it just doesn't make sense for that system.

559
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,200
Yeah, and honestly, we thought maybe we

560
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,720
could solve this with Toolbox, that great, handy Fedora tool.

561
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,320
And it got me part of the way there.

562
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,280
I will admit, it got me part of the way there.

563
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,360
But it wasn't all that I wanted.

564
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,320
I wanted something that was truly like multiple distro

565
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,440
package managers.

566
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,880
I didn't really want something that

567
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,640
was in a VM that wasn't on my local system.

568
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,480
That's just it, right?

569
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,840
Sometimes you really do want that.

570
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,440
It's just you're using this application

571
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,080
for a specific use case or only at certain times or something.

572
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,360
Or it's just you don't want it as part of your system.

573
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,120
You want to play with it and try it out.

574
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,920
Toolbox really does work with containers of all kinds.

575
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,680
But you're right.

576
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,160
If you're setting up a battle station,

577
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,000
you're going to be using this, maybe a video editor,

578
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
or you need something in the background, a tool

579
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,600
that your distro doesn't have.

580
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,440
You're going to be always fighting that you've

581
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,680
containerized it when you want it to be integrated.

582
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,760
And then once you've figured all of this out,

583
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,960
you don't want to create some shit storm problem

584
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,680
that you have to manage all the time that is just spewing

585
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,000
crap all over your box and making things break left

586
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,560
and right.

587
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,600
You don't want that either.

588
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:56,960
Oh, right.

589
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
I had to compile it this way with a custom patch

590
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,660
to get it to work.

591
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,320
And how did I do that again?

592
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,400
Yeah, it's just you could see how you could really

593
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,160
crap up a box quick, right?

594
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,380
And it really is the case that there is a type of solution

595
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,040
here that is quintessentially free software.

596
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,560
And we, seven years ago, chatted with Paradigm, the developer

597
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,960
of Bedrock Linux, which is a meta Linux distribution which

598
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,640
allows users to mix and match components

599
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,160
from other distributions, typically incompatible

600
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,080
distributions.

601
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,960
Bedrock integrates all of these components

602
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,240
into one largely cohesive system.

603
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,680
So you could have a Debian stable host distribution

604
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:41,280
with an Arch kernel or other packages from the Arch repo.

605
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,000
In my case, I set up a Fedora 34 workstation,

606
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,080
and then I hijacked that into a Bedrock install.

607
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,840
Nice.

608
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,240
So because I thought that'd make for a pretty decent base.

609
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,520
But this is why I say it's quintessentially free software

610
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,880
is Paradigm has been working on this now for about just

611
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,720
over 10 years.

612
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,880
Seven years we talked to Paradigm.

613
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,320
And I thought, is Bedrock gone?

614
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:01,840
Is it dead?

615
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,960
Is it still alive?

616
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,040
It's just such an unfortunate but common story, right?

617
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,200
Someone has a great idea, but it just never takes off,

618
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,540
or they move on with their life.

619
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,960
It was a passion project, and things change.

620
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,320
But that decade is a long time.

621
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,760
Yeah, especially for something that is ambitious as this,

622
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,280
when the Linux ecosystem moves as fast as it does,

623
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,120
when there's the number of distributions out there

624
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,720
that there are.

625
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,040
Right.

626
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,260
I mean, not to diminish any projects,

627
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,080
but this isn't just a respin of a distro

628
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,160
with some customizations or a different DE, right?

629
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,720
This is a meta distribution.

630
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,480
Yeah, you pick the distro you start with,

631
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,040
and then you convert it into this.

632
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,480
And it's incredible.

633
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,960
So what we wanted to do was call up Paradigm

634
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,360
and check in on how he's doing and how the project is going.

635
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,800
Paradigm, welcome back to the show.

636
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,160
It's been seven years since we chatted last.

637
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,360
I'm happy to be back.

638
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,840
So long, in fact, that I didn't recall our conversation

639
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,280
until you embarrassingly reminded me,

640
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,880
and then it all came flooding back.

641
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,640
So thank you for making it.

642
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,000
And I think this marks like nine years or so

643
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,920
that you've officially been making, creating,

644
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
running Bedrock.

645
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,800
The first public release was nine years ago,

646
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,720
but there was definitely some preliminary work,

647
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,680
maybe two or three years before that.

648
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,040
So yeah, it's been a while.

649
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,520
Yeah, and along with all of that,

650
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,680
I see you in the IRC room answering questions often.

651
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,000
We talked a lot back in the day about this concept

652
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,920
and about taking up disk space and how

653
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,280
there was multiple libraries sometimes and all of that.

654
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,880
And I look back at this conversation now,

655
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,680
and I go, it's so funny because it

656
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,520
feels like Flatpak and Snap sort of just settled

657
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,480
that conversation.

658
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,600
And I wonder, where do you see Bedrock fitting in now,

659
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,080
all these years later, when there are things like Flatpak

660
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:39,960
and Snaps out there?

661
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,200
Do you feel like there's a shift for Bedrock,

662
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,240
or does Bedrock's core mission continue?

663
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,600
I'd say Bedrock's core mission still continues.

664
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,360
Things like Flatpak and Snap do solve a problem

665
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,920
that Bedrock could have helped with before they came around.

666
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,160
But they don't completely overlap with Bedrock,

667
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,080
since they're kind of a lot of independent things

668
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,920
that you still need Bedrock for if you're interested in them.

669
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,840
So they end up being largely orthogonal.

670
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,840
Right, I had a fun experience hijacking a Fedora 34

671
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,920
install and creating a Bedrock install out of it.

672
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,720
And then on top of that, I layered

673
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,120
on Alpine and Void Linux.

674
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,400
And pretty soon, it just became its own hybrid monster

675
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,760
in the greatest way possible.

676
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,000
I could pick and choose which packages from which distro

677
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,080
I want, and I had all of the package managers

678
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,800
all of a sudden.

679
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,040
So I'm curious now, like nine years or so,

680
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,000
at least since we chatted seven years,

681
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,760
what problems are you solving now

682
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,400
that you weren't solving back when we first chatted?

683
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,880
I think when we first chatted, one

684
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,520
of the limitations you brought up,

685
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,360
which was very correct at the time,

686
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,880
was Bedrock was pretty rough to install.

687
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,600
It was comparable to something like OneX from Scratch.

688
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,000
Did even Bedrock get features from other distros?

689
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,280
Not just packages, but anything in the abstract.

690
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,120
This includes things like the installation process.

691
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,200
And so at the time, the installer

692
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,680
was kind of a placeholder until I

693
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,080
figured out how to get an installer from another distro.

694
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,320
And as you mentioned, it's pretty easy now.

695
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,000
You got Fedoras without thinking about it too much.

696
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,320
So that's definitely one thing that I did not

697
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,720
have solved seven years ago that I do today.

698
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,080
I also recall during our chat that we were really

699
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,560
consternating over what you were going to do about systemd

700
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,240
and just init systems in general.

701
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,360
Oh, yes.

702
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,160
At the time, for the same reason,

703
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,880
Bedrock had a placeholder in it until I

704
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,120
figured out how to get inits from other distros.

705
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,600
And today, you can get almost every major init.

706
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,080
I think, in fact, we're probably going to get S6, maybe

707
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,440
the latest one I'm working on getting to work.

708
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,040
And it'll probably work here in the next point update.

709
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,480
But yeah, systemd, OpenRC, runits, even upstart,

710
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,840
I'd still test against old ISOs.

711
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,280
And that works as well.

712
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,200
Wow, that's impressive.

713
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,760
I mean, what's the process like of onboarding a new init

714
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,560
system?

715
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,840
I kind of solved most of the work

716
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,800
in a very generalized fashion.

717
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,800
Bedrock has a menu when you put the system kind

718
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,840
of like after the bootloader menu where you pick your OS

719
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,680
and kernel.

720
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,720
Bedrock adds an init selection menu to select your init

721
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,360
and does some generalized bootstrap work there.

722
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,680
And then for each specific init, there's

723
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,280
often quirks I have to go work on.

724
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,000
So for example, for systemd, I had

725
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,720
to make some unit files to go change things after it started.

726
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,600
But that's generally how it goes.

727
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,440
Well, obviously, the goal here with Bedrock

728
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,880
is getting a lot of nice abilities, features,

729
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,760
superpowers, you might say, from all the various Linux

730
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,440
distributions that you have support for.

731
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,840
But when you do that, are there some downsides

732
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,720
of hijacking your system?

733
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,200
The predominant one is complexity.

734
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,760
A Bedrock system is fundamentally more complex

735
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,160
than a traditional distro, largely because it

736
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,040
has all the complexity of traditional distros

737
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,200
with Bedrock on top and possibly multiple distros,

738
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,480
or normally multiple.

739
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,560
And so as long as things are working, it's fine.

740
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,640
But as soon as something goes wrong,

741
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,240
it's a lot more effort to debug.

742
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,560
You thought just having to figure out

743
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,880
the problems with one package manager was a problem.

744
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,960
Well, add a few more.

745
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,480
Yes.

746
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,440
Well, I do remember when we were chatting last time,

747
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,640
you had a goal of a meta package manager that would, in theory,

748
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,640
run updates and whatnot across all of the various package

749
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,920
managers you might have installed on a Bedrock system.

750
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,120
How does that work on?

751
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,560
Happily, that's available.

752
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,720
It works great today.

753
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,880
We call it the Package Manager Manager.

754
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,840
I think that was just like a shorthand for it, just

755
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,680
a placeholder name when I first came up with it,

756
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,560
and that ended up sticking.

757
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,040
You can use it for the obvious use

758
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,080
case of upgrading the whole system.

759
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,640
But there's also, I found, some workflows on Bedrock

760
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,520
that need to take multiple package managers into consideration

761
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,200
that you might not think about if you're not on Bedrock.

762
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,680
For example, if I want a specific package,

763
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,040
I might want to check if one distro has it.

764
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,840
If it doesn't, then check if another does.

765
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,720
If that doesn't, check if a third does.

766
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,080
And just install whatever the first one has.

767
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,200
And so PMM can do that pretty trivially.

768
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,320
So for a concrete example, actually, I

769
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,360
use S-Cron as my preferred cron program.

770
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,840
And Void Linux is the only distro

771
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,480
I knew of that actually provides it.

772
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,080
And I figured that out by typing PMM install S-Cron,

773
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,760
and I did that.

774
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,440
Void was mostly low on my priority list.

775
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,640
I had to skim quite a few.

776
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,920
Wow, interesting.

777
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,640
Is it recommended to use PMM, or is it still

778
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,160
fine to just use the individual ones

779
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,800
and you won't really miss out on much?

780
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,120
You're welcome to use individual commands if you want.

781
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,000
But after using Bedrock for a while

782
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,520
and you find enough kind of cross-package manager

783
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,840
operations that you want to do, it

784
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,520
starts becoming more pleasant.

785
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,120
An additional feature of PMM I should mention while we're on

786
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,440
that I'm somewhat proud of.

787
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,360
Since the idea behind Bedrock is to get features

788
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,440
from other distros, I wanted to see

789
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,000
if I can get the package manager user interface

790
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,440
from other distros as well.

791
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,520
Because I know people have a lot of muscle memory

792
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,280
for how to use one package manager.

793
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,400
I found some people who need a Bedrock will type things

794
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,480
like pacman install or apt-s just from confusing their muscle

795
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,320
memory there.

796
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,160
And so you can configure PMM to mimic the user interface

797
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,120
of different distros.

798
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,400
Whatever muscle memory you have, it can continue with.

799
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,320
And you can use that across all the distros on your system.

800
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,920
Well, it's that kind of polish that

801
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,320
makes me think we should also make

802
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,640
sure we hit more on that interactive tutorial.

803
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,400
I know Chris and I both tried it, and just, wow.

804
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,640
I mean, it was really useful.

805
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,240
It was fun.

806
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,320
It was easy.

807
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,440
And it just felt like it was quite polished.

808
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,120
And I'm curious, what's the story there?

809
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,880
How did that come about, and how does it all work?

810
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,440
The story there, it starts with difficulty expressing

811
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,840
what Bedrock is to other people.

812
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,720
People don't like to read dry documentation.

813
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,920
And it's difficult to summarize within people's own attention

814
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,080
span everything needed for Bedrock.

815
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,620
So someone else came up with the idea,

816
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,520
so I can't take it full credit, of an interactive tutorial,

817
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,160
hoping that the interactive nature will

818
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,960
help keep it more engaging and help things sink in more.

819
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,920
First try was just, essentially, documentation

820
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,960
in a terminal, which didn't work too well.

821
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,640
I started adding some scripting to it,

822
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,600
so it'll detect your environment and see

823
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,800
what you're doing interactively to kind of actually force

824
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,760
you to run the commands.

825
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,480
And I found that made a big difference.

826
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,120
Yeah, that really stood out to me.

827
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:54,760
It felt like it wasn't just a static thing,

828
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:57,720
but the tutorial actually asks you to cat some files,

829
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,400
to use T to pipe stuff around.

830
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,800
And not only does it actually show you the output in a way

831
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,880
that you get to feel like, oh, I see that.

832
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,960
That's actually on my system.

833
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,520
I don't just have to trust the man page,

834
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,960
but it also just meant that it felt a little bit

835
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,720
like a video game.

836
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,960
Yeah, it requires you to complete the task

837
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,680
before you can move forward in some cases.

838
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,800
Yeah.

839
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,800
So I have a couple of questions about the future.

840
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,120
On the top of mind of listeners last time

841
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,040
was, what about graphical apps?

842
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,080
And I'm curious how the transition to Wayland

843
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,800
affects Bedrock and the state of graphical applications

844
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,960
using, say, Bedrock.

845
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,440
Like, in my case, I have a Fedora 34 hijack system.

846
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,780
And perhaps I wanted to load Arch on there or something

847
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,480
and pull something in from one of those repositories.

848
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,240
Could I successfully get a Wayland application

849
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:38,960
working that way?

850
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,640
In fact, I did zero effort for Wayland.

851
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,040
It just worked with the kind of infrastructure we had.

852
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:44,560
Wow.

853
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,840
That's why that became a thing.

854
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,280
So yeah, that should be fine.

855
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,520
That's great.

856
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,360
And then I had another looking forward kind of question

857
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,240
is, with everything we see with container technology,

858
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,560
cgroups and namespaces and just stuff that's

859
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,320
just built into Linux now, do you ever look at that

860
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,480
and think, maybe there's a future there for Bedrock

861
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,520
to take advantage of some of that tech?

862
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,720
People ask that a lot.

863
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,680
But I strongly disagree.

864
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,280
The issue there is all of those are

865
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,600
designed around segregating things and keeping them

866
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,560
separate, whereas the whole point of Bedrock

867
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,920
is the opposite, is to make everything work together.

868
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,800
So I've tried to do my due diligence

869
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,240
to understand those technologies and to experiment with it

870
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,860
and to see something.

871
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,520
But I really couldn't actually find anything

872
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,640
with anything on those lines that

873
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,040
would be useful for Bedrock.

874
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,120
I like that answer.

875
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,800
I think I completely agree.

876
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,440
It's like, this is what Bedrock's mission is,

877
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,480
is to really kind of create one meta Linux distribution.

878
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,440
And by separating it off into containers,

879
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,320
it sort of would defeat the purpose of what

880
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,400
you're trying to accomplish with.

881
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,360
But I did see the question come in quite a bit,

882
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,920
so I did want to get it out there.

883
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,360
And then the last question, I know

884
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,960
it's one that you get a lot, Paradigm,

885
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,520
is where do you get off calling this thing a meta distribution?

886
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,360
So if you define a Linux distribution

887
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,680
as a project that distributes a Linux-based operating system,

888
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,800
called a distro for short, there are

889
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,280
a number of things that kind of fit in the broader distro space

890
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,680
that aren't really distros.

891
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,400
They don't fit that definition.

892
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,960
What they tend to do is distribute some means

893
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,200
that you can use to get a Linux-based operating system,

894
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,120
even if they don't distribute the operating system itself.

895
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,760
Gentoo is a good example here, where

896
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,360
it distributes kind of like a framework

897
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,040
to build your own distro.

898
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,480
In fact, I didn't coin the term meta distribution.

899
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,960
I found that on Gentoo's website.

900
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,080
Another good example is Linux from Scratch,

901
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,800
where they just distribute documentation.

902
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,000
They don't even distribute any tooling

903
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,680
to help you build your own Linux-based operating system.

904
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,440
And so Bedrock kind of fits that pattern, where we're not

905
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,240
actually distributing the operating system.

906
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,960
We're distributing tooling to kind of build one yourself.

907
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,520
Just unlike those other projects,

908
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,120
we're letting you use the packages and parts

909
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,680
of other distros to do that.

910
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,040
Very good.

911
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,200
We'll keep up the good work.

912
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,280
You have remained dedicated to this project for years.

913
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,880
And even today, before we got on the horn here,

914
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,960
you were in your IRC room answering questions.

915
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,000
And people aren't even all that polite always,

916
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
which they should be.

917
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,080
But sometimes, they're a little frustrated,

918
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,160
and you're still in there.

919
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,200
That's really impressive.

920
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,360
So keep up the great work.

921
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,520
And I think now, with how simple it is to get going and hijack

922
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,360
an existing install, this is probably

923
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,920
going to be one of my go-to tools.

924
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,040
So thanks for all the great work, Paradigm.

925
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,320
You're very welcome, and I'm happy to hear it.

926
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,800
And what might be the most impressive thing about Bedrock

927
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,400
is it doesn't feel like a hacky solution.

928
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,720
No, it really doesn't.

929
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,040
I mean, I do all kinds of weird stuff

930
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,840
I shouldn't with containers, and VMs, and mounting stuff

931
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,680
places.

932
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,960
It did not feel like that.

933
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,840
I mean, a lot of it's wrapped up in the burl on our Bedrock

934
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,360
Linux.

935
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,240
I don't know what you would call it.

936
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,000
BRL is like the little command line tool

937
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,520
to actually manage everything.

938
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,560
And that's where you can see the delicate balance Bedrock has

939
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,320
to strike between keeping things kind of isolated off

940
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,680
on their own so that you can have an Arch system over here

941
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,440
in the corner, but also making sure

942
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,560
that Arch's package manager doesn't step

943
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,040
on Debian's package manager.

944
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,760
But if you're using a Debian tool,

945
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,840
well, you might want to know about the themes, or the fonts,

946
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,120
or be able to access the newest version of JQ

947
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,080
that you installed over in Arch world.

948
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,440
And that takes a lot to get right

949
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,520
and to make it feel actually useful.

950
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:08,360
Do you think we'll see this propagated a little bit more

951
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,080
generally into some other distributions in the future?

952
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,960
I know maybe it seems early now, but.

953
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,920
I mean, it's been around for a while, though.

954
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,880
And it hasn't really, you've seen solutions

955
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,560
that kind of solve the problem Bedrock solves

956
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,320
in their own sort of focused way.

957
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,400
And I don't think it's really appealing to some distro makers.

958
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,680
I don't think they want to own the whole thing, I think.

959
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,800
It really does feel like there's definitely

960
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,840
some shared spirit with things like Nix, I think.

961
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,280
But Bedrock strikes me as something

962
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,520
that has a somewhat limited audience, not in a bad way,

963
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,880
but it's like a power user feature, right?

964
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,680
It's made for us folks who love having a Linux system, who

965
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,880
want to play with it, or who just, you know,

966
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,040
I'm not someone who installs Ubuntu,

967
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,440
doesn't configure it, and just runs.

968
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,760
That's great that we can do that.

969
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
If you want something custom and really

970
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,480
to be able to make your Linux desktop super useful,

971
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,920
Bedrock seems like a tool for you.

972
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,760
And it does seem like it's attempting

973
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,960
to solve a fundamental compromise you often

974
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,600
have to make.

975
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,440
Maybe you prefer distro X, but it

976
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,480
doesn't have everything in its package repository

977
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,200
that another distribution has.

978
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,480
And you're kind of being offered a way to mix and match that.

979
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,400
And I think the trickiest thing about adopting Bedrock

980
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,560
is it has its own vernacular.

981
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,240
You know, you have these stratas,

982
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,640
which are kind of really like a collection of files

983
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:24,440
and processes.

984
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,520
And you have like these different languages,

985
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,640
different terms for things that you have to learn.

986
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,960
And so that is probably the biggest learning curve,

987
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,640
is not managing it, not even setting it up,

988
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,600
because it has a really fantastic tutorial.

989
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,200
So the biggest learning curve is just

990
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,560
learning what the different terms mean.

991
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,900
And there's four or five key terms

992
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,020
you really have to figure out.

993
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,480
And you know, I think that's fair,

994
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,360
because Bedrock's doing stuff that no one else is doing,

995
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:45,860
right?

996
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,480
I mean, it's one of the first meta distributions

997
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,360
out there in this sense, at least.

998
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,520
And so you've got to come up with some new names.

999
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,040
Yep, yep, absolutely.

1000
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,400
And Paradigm, right now, I just checked during the chat.

1001
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,800
He's in his chat room over there right now,

1002
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,680
answering questions and chatting with people.

1003
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,320
So he's on Librarian Chat.

1004
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,880
And it's just pound bedrock or hashtag.

1005
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,160
I will say, I think Bedrock's going to stick around

1006
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,120
on at least some of my systems.

1007
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,640
The hijacking went pretty smoothly.

1008
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,840
I didn't feel a big, I wasn't worried about that.

1009
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,680
And at least maybe start with a couple of workstations

1010
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,080
that aren't in the critical path.

1011
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,300
But if I can just get all the AUR stuff,

1012
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,760
but still have it easy to install,

1013
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,040
you know, random devs I might need for work.

1014
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,500
Yeah, this could be the final piece

1015
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,800
that makes something like Fedora 34 stick for me,

1016
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,000
or CentOS Stream 9 in the future.

1017
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,240
Think about just, even if we just did CentOS Stream 9

1018
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,640
in the studio, and just a handful, a couple of packages

1019
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,440
that weren't available to us in CentOS's repo,

1020
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,840
or in Flatpak, or something, we could use Bedrock.

1021
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,560
And we could close that gap and use it in audio production.

1022
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,960
I mean, it has serious potential.

1023
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,380
And if you don't go crazy with it,

1024
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,800
I don't see why it wouldn't be sustainable.

1025
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,600
So yeah, it's a tool that we're definitely

1026
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,440
going to be using for a long time.

1027
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,160
Sorry, Paradigm.

1028
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:59,620
You might just see us in your IRC room more often pretty soon.

1029
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,440
I wanted to mention we have stickers

1030
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,420
for all of the active shows now.

1031
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:04,880
And how cool is this?

1032
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,280
Based on popular demand.

1033
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,800
I get to say that, because it's true.

1034
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,320
People love the stickers.

1035
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,680
You know, it was me being a dummy, really.

1036
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,080
I drug my feet at first, because it

1037
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,520
felt like it was a low effort thing

1038
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,600
to do to take the vector art for the MP3 albums

1039
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,840
and turn that into a sticker.

1040
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,360
I'm like, I can do better than that.

1041
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,160
It's not a custom new design or anything.

1042
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,960
Right.

1043
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,480
I didn't commission somebody to create.

1044
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,200
It's like, I can't do that.

1045
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,000
And then when Self-Hosted 50 landed, I realized, wait a minute.

1046
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,840
That's 50 releases of this album art.

1047
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,160
It's actually kind of awesome to have that as a sticker.

1048
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,740
And then because I have it as a vector,

1049
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,520
we can do cool high resolution, different sizes.

1050
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,120
So I busted out sticker artwork for all the active shows now.

1051
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,680
I realized that was the way to go.

1052
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,840
And they're awesome.

1053
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,240
I think it's actually perfect.

1054
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,800
And so they're all up at jupytergarage.com,

1055
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,280
as well as some new exclusive merch

1056
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,240
to celebrate Self-Hosted 50.

1057
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,280
And as always, our core contributors get a discount.

1058
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,520
So check the limited ad feed or live show

1059
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,800
feed for a note from me on your promo code.

1060
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,880
Or you can just go to the members download area

1061
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,640
and get the note.

1062
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,440
So you can use the promo code and take some money off

1063
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,260
when you go over to jupytergarage.com

1064
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,600
and get them stickers.

1065
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,320
I think they turned out great.

1066
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,200
And one of the stickers, there's a special plea

1067
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,520
from Wes Payne in there.

1068
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,640
But I won't say which one.

1069
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,480
You'll just have to go check the stickers and find out.

1070
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,120
I have been kidnapped.

1071
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,960
All right.

1072
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,880
All right, and with that, let's do a little bit of feedback.

1073
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,080
You want to take this one?

1074
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,480
Roxodus from Linux server IO writes in,

1075
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,360
just listen to LUP 4.16.

1076
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:39,160
And I'd like to clarify some things regarding web top.

1077
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,080
First, I just want to say that you brought up

1078
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,700
an interesting use case.

1079
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,160
And that's awesome.

1080
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,440
So hey, look at us continuing to abuse software.

1081
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,200
That's right.

1082
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,240
That's our thing.

1083
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,000
Regarding flavors, we also have fedora variants, nice,

1084
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,160
with mostly the same VMs.

1085
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,680
Arch may also be in the works.

1086
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,360
Oh.

1087
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,160
That would be killer.

1088
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,780
That would.

1089
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,000
Either one would be great.

1090
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,440
You remember web top is that project from Linux server

1091
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,900
that lets you run a Linux desktop in a container.

1092
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,560
You connect to it remotely with your web browser.

1093
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,360
Yeah, exactly.

1094
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,040
And we had a lot of fun playing with it.

1095
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,440
But did definitely have some questions

1096
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,760
because it's a lot of components that are all integrated

1097
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,240
together.

1098
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,640
And one thing we were wondering was, well, Chris,

1099
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,920
you noticed that default user was named ABC.

1100
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,120
And I don't think you love that.

1101
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,920
You just want it to be called Chris, I assume.

1102
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,680
Yeah.

1103
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,640
Well, as for ABC, unfortunately, at the moment,

1104
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,640
it's fairly relied on as it's kind of the only constant they

1105
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,440
have when trying to manage permissions in there.

1106
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,980
And I will say, they're doing good work here,

1107
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,140
as Linux server always does, to try to make things secure,

1108
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,680
not just leave it a big old security hole.

1109
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,360
So I get that you probably want to set some user permissions.

1110
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,560
What they're doing is really tricky.

1111
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,120
And that is the compromise you have to make.

1112
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,840
And so that's why I think my thought was put it

1113
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,920
behind WireGuard or put it behind a VPN.

1114
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,560
Don't just put it right out on the net.

1115
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,920
Yeah, definitely a consideration you

1116
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,800
want to make when running software like this.

1117
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,760
And just a moment to say thank you to our friends

1118
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
at a Cloud Guru.

1119
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,920
They have a SystemD management course for Linux.

1120
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,960
This course is designed to give you a deep dive

1121
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:01,800
into the topic of SystemD, the most widely used service

1122
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,120
management scheme in Linux out there.

1123
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:07,280
The course is really just going to help you demystify SystemD

1124
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,080
and go beyond just kind of muddling through it

1125
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,120
and getting things done to actually understanding

1126
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,000
how all the different components work together,

1127
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,640
how to configure, manage, and monitor and troubleshoot

1128
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,440
SystemD.

1129
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,840
We'll have a link in the show notes for this course,

1130
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,360
or you can go to cloudguru.com.

1131
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:25,640
Well, let's do a little bit of housekeeping around here.

1132
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,720
It has gotten awfully filthy, probably Brent's fault.

1133
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,160
Hey, now.

1134
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,160
I want to mention you can join the conversation

1135
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,640
and check in with the team over on our Telegram channel.

1136
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,280
That's at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash

1137
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,280
telegram, and we are always looking for your feedback,

1138
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,040
your ideas, suggestions, anything you

1139
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,000
want to send us for the show linuxunplugged.com slash

1140
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,920
contact.

1141
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,480
Our meetups, which include the Denver and Salt Lake City

1142
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,240
meetups, are at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash

1143
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,280
meetup.

1144
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,320
And we do have the LoveLog I want to mention.

1145
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,480
And Minimac, it sounds like there's

1146
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,800
a lot going on these days.

1147
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah, thank you, Chris.

1148
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,440
So all I can tell you that the LoveLog community is doing fine

1149
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,200
every Sunday on Mumble, and it's really great to see

1150
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,280
a lot of people from all over the world.

1151
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,800
I can tell you, we have new listeners or new participants

1152
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,040
joining us from the Philippines and Australia.

1153
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,920
And you have to imagine, for them, it's early in the morning.

1154
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:20,160
So it's also nice, by the way, to see Wes, Poppy, or you

1155
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,920
from time to time.

1156
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,120
So thank you all.

1157
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:26,200
The cool thing is in LoveLog, everything can happen.

1158
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,680
Like last Sunday, we had an online tutorial

1159
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,560
for user kernel on his PinePhone.

1160
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,360
And that ended up in a git commit for the J package

1161
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,720
on Manjaro.

1162
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,160
But as Colonel is here, he can talk about this story, Colonel.

1163
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,480
Yeah, so I've been playing with the PinePhone

1164
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,880
with the Manjaro base image with Plasma Mobile on top.

1165
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,480
And I wanted to install something

1166
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,240
that wasn't in the Manjaro ARM repos, which then, of course,

1167
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,760
means AUR.

1168
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:59,560
Yay is the default arch helper installed for Manjaro ARM.

1169
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,560
However, when you install it, it didn't

1170
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,960
install the development packages,

1171
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,280
which is required for AUR.

1172
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,760
Well, one of the maintainers for the Manjaro ARM repo

1173
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,200
was there in LoveLog, and he made that a dependency.

1174
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,640
And now, when you install Yay, it automatically

1175
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,600
installs that.

1176
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,080
Well, that sounds fascinating.

1177
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,320
Sounds like if you tune in at LoveLog on Sundays,

1178
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,280
there always could be some geeky stuff going down.

1179
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,080
We have the time at jupitabroadcasting.com

1180
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:30,800
slash calendar, and the mumble info at linuxunplug.com

1181
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,560
slash mumble.

1182
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,600
So as I hit the road, I will be tracking my trip

1183
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,920
at colonytracker.live, and I invite you to follow me there.

1184
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,840
And if you are on the road in my area,

1185
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,600
if you're in that neck of the woods,

1186
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,600
we're going to have a link that you can click on

1187
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,560
at colonytracker.live to start a meetup with me,

1188
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:51,400
a little micro meetup, even if it's just you.

1189
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,240
You want to hang out?

1190
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,840
Maybe we'll talk about Linux.

1191
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,360
I don't know.

1192
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,440
Micro meetup?

1193
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,200
Do you have any preferred micro meetup location types?

1194
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,840
Easy to accommodate a large vehicle.

1195
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,480
So I created this form for people

1196
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,040
to fill out so I can kind of like try

1197
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,360
to suss that information out.

1198
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,120
So that way we have like a landing spot for dupes.

1199
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,440
Chris also doesn't mind proximity to chicken wings.

1200
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,200
No, that's true.

1201
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,240
And then what I'll do is I'll send Brent in to suss him out,

1202
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,680
you know, like he'll head in first.

1203
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,560
I'm really looking for lakeside or even rivers will do.

1204
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,080
Sure, yeah.

1205
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,960
Anywhere that's got drinks would be nice too.

1206
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,920
Why not?

1207
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,640
Mr. Payne, we have a last minute pic coming into the show.

1208
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,600
I'm being told by the control room

1209
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,560
that this could be really useful for people that

1210
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,200
maybe have duplicate images.

1211
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,080
Yes, indeed.

1212
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,080
I thought we might have something visual inspired

1213
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,880
since we've got photographer Brent in the house over here.

1214
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,880
OK, so it's pretty easy.

1215
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,760
There's lots of great Linux command line tools out there,

1216
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,080
or not command line even, to go filter duplicates

1217
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,920
if it's just the same hash of the file.

1218
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,720
That makes sense.

1219
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,000
It's pretty easy to go find an actual duplicate.

1220
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,300
But what if you are someone doing a lot of visual things?

1221
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,120
Maybe, honestly, this comes up for me

1222
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,680
because I'm using Photopea and downloading a bunch of copies

1223
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,800
where I've made modifications.

1224
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,480
Or just recently, I was making a GIF to embarrass a friend.

1225
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,240
And so I had a whole bunch of similar files.

1226
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,480
I didn't need all of them, right?

1227
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,880
But they weren't exactly the same.

1228
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,440
They were saved different times, exported

1229
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,600
different JPEG resolutions or something.

1230
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,480
That is where image dupes come in,

1231
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,560
because it can find near duplicate images

1232
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,800
based on a perceptual hash.

1233
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,000
So it uses Python and some machine learning type

1234
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,760
algorithms to try to give a score perceptually

1235
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,800
based on what the image looks like,

1236
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,400
not just the bits in the file.

1237
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,800
Boy, it gives a whole new meaning to perceptual hash,

1238
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,920
doesn't it?

1239
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,200
Wow, that's awesome.

1240
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,440
We'll have a link to that in the show notes.

1241
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,320
I could see that.

1242
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,520
Could be really useful just to run over my library.

1243
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,320
I wonder if we would find slight crop variations and stuff.

1244
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,120
That's a good question.

1245
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:38,880
We'll just have to try.

1246
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,740
We'll have to try and find out.

1247
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:42,280
Yeah, it was a late last minute addition to the show.

1248
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,820
And we thought that'd be a good one

1249
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,640
to mention, because like Wes said,

1250
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,120
that photographer guy is here.

1251
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,840
Hey, you know what, though?

1252
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,400
Even though we're on the road, the show

1253
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:50,560
is still going to be live.

1254
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,160
Somehow, I suspect, you can always

1255
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,440
follow at Linux Unplugged or at Jupyter Signal

1256
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,360
to get live information, or go to the calendar page

1257
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,400
at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1258
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,800
In fact, the entire slate of shows is going to continue on.

1259
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,720
We're going to attempt to produce all of them

1260
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,720
from the road, I say, with some trepidation.

1261
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,800
And you, dear audience, get to find out how

1262
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,320
that goes right along with us.

1263
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:11,820
Yeah.

1264
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1265
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,040
Linux Action News episode 200 just landed this week.

1266
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,400
It sure did, didn't it?

1267
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,320
And this was a fun one, because through a series of rabbit

1268
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,760
holes that Wes and I found ourselves

1269
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,920
going into researching news items,

1270
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,840
we came into this story about how big hyperscaler companies

1271
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:32,560
are building and loading and buying out

1272
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,160
international cable links.

1273
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,880
And the scale of it is unbelievable.

1274
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,680
Just hundreds of terabits of information

1275
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,480
flowing per second.

1276
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:39,980
Yeah.

1277
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:43,560
And so we report on what we found in Linux Action News 200.

1278
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,280
So if you haven't heard that one yet,

1279
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,120
it's a great time to jump in on LAN or send it to a friend.

1280
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,600
That's linuxactionnews.com slash 200.

1281
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,500
Brent, thank you for joining us for a special episode.

1282
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,320
Are you ready to get crammed into Lady Joops?

1283
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,920
Well, I like small spaces, so I think we'll be OK.

1284
00:44:58,920 --> 00:44:59,960
But who knows?

1285
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,580
We're going to have to see how it goes.

1286
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,040
You're already helping me organize, though.

1287
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,240
Brent has me like every piece of production equipment

1288
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:05,880
that's got to go.

1289
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,200
It goes right now on the coffee table in the studio.

1290
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,400
Everything that's got to go goes on the table.

1291
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,200
At least once an hour since I've landed here,

1292
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,520
we've noticed like, oh, we've got to remember to bring this.

1293
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,120
Oh, we've got to remember to bring this.

1294
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,160
Let's put this on the table.

1295
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,280
If it's not plugged in right now and making this show happen,

1296
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,240
then it's on the table.

1297
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,960
That's pretty much it.

1298
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,360
Then we will be live on Tuesday at noon Pacific, 3 PM Eastern,

1299
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,080
over at jblive.tv.

1300
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,360
See you next week.

1301
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,760
Same bad time, same bad station.

1302
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,720
And links to everything we talked about today,

1303
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:37,360
that's over at linuxunplugged.com slash 417.

1304
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,760
Dah!

1305
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,360
That's my.com.

1306
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,560
That's how I say.com now.

1307
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,600
It's kind of pirate-like.

1308
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:43,640
It's very efficient.

1309
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,160
Yeah, I think as I get older, I want

1310
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,080
to go more towards the pirate direction, just in general.

1311
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,800
Less prospector, more pirate now?

1312
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,680
Yeah, yeah.

1313
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,080
I've done the prospector thing.

1314
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,120
I think pirate's where it's at.

1315
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,280
Next step, peg leg.

1316
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,000
Yarr!

1317
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,080
Thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode

1318
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:01,600
of the Unplugged program.

1319
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,680
We'd love to hear from you, linuxunplugged.com slash

1320
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,200
contact.

1321
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,000
But either that or not, even if you don't go there,

1322
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,280
if you just listen, you know what?

1323
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,520
We appreciate it.

1324
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,360
We appreciate it.

1325
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,520
We'll see you next Tuesday!

1326
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,520
Thanks so much for tuning in.

1327
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,600
Yes, it is hammer time.

1328
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,240
Feels actually like dance time.

1329
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,960
I see all of us grooving in the studio here.

1330
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:50,440
We are.

1331
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,600
Doesn't matter how many times we hear it,

1332
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,040
we still groove to it.

1333
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,480
So how have I have how the mighty have fallen?

1334
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,160
I have gone from the guy that could record four or five

1335
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,480
beers tasties in a row, to I have one Canadian six

1336
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,600
and a half ABV, and I can barely get through the outro.

1337
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,400
It's that Canadian water they brew with it.

1338
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,400
Is that what it is?

1339
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:07,920
Jeez.

1340
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,280
Fresh from the Canadian Rockies.

1341
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,800
Tell you what, it is actually.

1342
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,360
Oh, man, we're going to be going over the Rockies.

1343
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:12,920
I know.

1344
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,160
It seemed appropriate.

1345
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,480
And the damn Cascades.

1346
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,560
No, Chris, you know what?

1347
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,480
It's because you're not used to hanging out with people

1348
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,600
anymore, and it tired you out.

1349
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,840
And it's hot.

1350
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,840
During the interview, we had the air conditioner

1351
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,920
going, but it's like you get like five minutes of reprieve,

1352
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,400
and then it's hot again.

1353
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,760
Hot studio, cold beer.

1354
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,640
And it's only going to get worse because I'm

1355
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,760
driving into the heat.

1356
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:44,520
So it's only going to get worse.
