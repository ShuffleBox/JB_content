WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
We came across a little tool called Sokae, which we will have linked in the show notes,

00:04.480 --> 00:09.040
that looks at your bash history, goes through everything you've been doing on your box,

00:09.040 --> 00:14.240
and generates a pie chart or a bar graph, whatever you like, you have some options,

00:14.240 --> 00:16.480
of your most frequently used commands.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.920
And we thought, this probably reveals a lot about how we use our boxes.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.520
So we're going to run it on our systems here.

00:21.520 --> 00:23.360
We'll have a link to it if you want to try it on yours.

00:23.360 --> 00:27.520
And we're going to reveal our top used commands on our Linux systems.

00:27.520 --> 00:28.800
Do you want to go first, Wes?

00:28.800 --> 00:33.440
Yeah, okay, you can definitely tell that I'm just using the terminal as a file manager,

00:33.440 --> 00:38.400
because my top three are ls, cd, vim, and then followed by cat.

00:38.400 --> 00:42.640
After that, though, there's git and docker-compose, so it gets a little more interesting.

00:42.640 --> 00:46.320
Oh, man, mine are so embarrassing compared to yours.

00:47.360 --> 00:51.040
Okay, all right, well, you can definitely tell I'm into my arch,

00:51.040 --> 00:55.680
because my number one command by like a lot is yay, the package manager.

00:55.680 --> 00:59.120
Well, you have to run it like what, six, 10 times a day to be sure?

00:59.120 --> 00:59.760
You got it.

00:59.760 --> 01:03.200
And then YouTube DL, which is what I use for clips, and then SSH,

01:04.240 --> 01:06.640
which is just me logging into everything else.

01:06.640 --> 01:07.840
This is embarrassing.

01:15.840 --> 01:18.400
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

01:18.400 --> 01:19.360
My name is Chris.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.400
My name is Wes.

01:20.400 --> 01:21.200
Hello, Wes.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.160
I like the tactical gear, color matched and everything.

01:24.160 --> 01:28.320
This episode is brought to you by the all new aCloud Guru, the leader in learning for the cloud,

01:28.320 --> 01:29.600
Linux and other modern tech skills.

01:29.600 --> 01:33.440
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs, get certified, get hired, get learning

01:33.440 --> 01:36.000
at aCloudGuru.com.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.120
Well, coming up on this week's episode, it's our worst idea yet.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.200
I don't know what we're thinking.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.720
We thought we'd have some fun, I guess.

01:44.720 --> 01:50.400
We're going to hand out the login info to one of our servers to our chat room.

01:50.400 --> 01:54.720
And then whoever owns the box first gets a prize.

01:54.720 --> 01:57.760
We're going to have more details later on in the show.

01:57.760 --> 02:01.600
We're going to call it the unplugged hacker games just because we're having fun as we

02:01.600 --> 02:03.280
approach episode 400.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.360
So we have the hacker games coming up.

02:05.360 --> 02:10.400
We have some community news to get into, including how the heck does archive.org actually

02:11.040 --> 02:15.040
run and manage to archive the entire internet and some feedback.

02:15.040 --> 02:20.800
But before we get to any of that, I have one line of duty that I must carry out before

02:20.800 --> 02:23.120
we proceed any further.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.600
And that is to say time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

02:25.600 --> 02:26.800
Hello, Virtual Lug.

02:26.800 --> 02:31.120
Well, nice to have you all in there.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.640
So I wanted to get into something before we get into the news, and that is just maybe

02:38.640 --> 02:43.920
a call out, a request to the audience, perhaps, as we approach episode 400.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.360
Stay a while and listen.

02:46.080 --> 02:50.400
If you know us, you know that we like to do something to celebrate the milestones like

02:50.400 --> 02:50.800
400.

02:50.800 --> 02:55.040
We don't do it all the time, but every now and then we like to get we like to have some

02:55.040 --> 02:55.760
fun.

02:55.760 --> 02:58.960
And we thought, what could be some ways that we could really enjoy ourselves leading up

02:58.960 --> 03:00.480
to episode 400?

03:01.040 --> 03:05.760
And there's one topic that Wes and I have always wanted to do on the show.

03:06.880 --> 03:12.320
We've talked about it 100 different times, but we've never really found the right partner

03:12.320 --> 03:15.600
to work with, if you will, quote unquote, using that term loosely.

03:16.240 --> 03:21.360
But we've always wanted to do an episode on Linux and brewing beer.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.640
We'd really love to go hands on, if possible.

03:24.640 --> 03:30.000
We'd love to make some episode 400 beer that we drink later on at some point and use

03:30.000 --> 03:31.920
Linux to make it happen.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.560
It's not required that we go hands on, but it sure would be fun.

03:35.200 --> 03:38.080
And we're looking for somebody who's actively brewing beer.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.360
I mean, I've heard from people who have brewed beer, but we're looking for somebody who's

03:41.360 --> 03:42.800
actually doing it right now.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.400
Maybe even has a brewery.

03:44.400 --> 03:44.960
Maybe not.

03:46.080 --> 03:50.240
But somebody we could engage with, learn from, and then maybe share their story on the show.

03:50.240 --> 03:54.560
And if we could end up with episode 400 series beer, too, boy, that'd be a lot of fun.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.080
So we got we got five weeks.

03:56.080 --> 04:00.960
May not be impossible if you or someone you know is actively brewing beer and uses Linux

04:00.960 --> 04:01.840
to make it possible.

04:01.840 --> 04:07.280
Get in touch with us at linuxunplug.com contact or hit us up on Telegram or Twitter.

04:07.280 --> 04:11.760
Or, Wes, I should also mention, if anybody knows how the hell to use the brewery, that

04:11.760 --> 04:14.240
that automated brewing machine, also let us know.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.520
Oh, the brewery.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.600
Yeah, we have it sitting out in the garage.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.280
Technically runs Android, which is kind of Linux.

04:21.280 --> 04:22.640
I've heard that's Linux.

04:22.640 --> 04:24.160
Yeah, it's kind of Linux, right?

04:24.160 --> 04:24.960
Kind of.

04:24.960 --> 04:30.400
So anyways, let us know linuxunplug.com contact or Telegram or the Twitters would be fine

04:30.400 --> 04:31.200
as well.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.640
But looking ahead at something that's also coming just a few weeks out, that's GNOME

04:34.640 --> 04:40.400
Shell 40 and one of the things they're launching in GNOME Shell is fully realized gesture support.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.960
And I thought maybe we'd just zoom in on this one feature for this episode with the gesture

04:44.960 --> 04:49.760
support in 40, you can manage running apps, you can change your workspace, you can bring

04:49.760 --> 04:50.480
up the overview.

04:50.480 --> 04:55.120
It's they've taken the gesture support that GNOME Shell has had for a while and they've

04:55.120 --> 04:57.600
really rounded it out and completed it.

04:57.600 --> 05:03.120
And assuming you're all into that kind of thing, which a lot of people are, there is

05:03.120 --> 05:04.800
one major problem.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.960
It does not work on X11.

05:09.600 --> 05:14.640
There are technical reasons, but it is a reminder of why X11 just needs to go.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.560
Get that out of here.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.760
Get it out of here.

05:17.760 --> 05:22.400
But one clever developer figured out a way to bring these touch gestures to the X11 version

05:22.400 --> 05:27.760
of GNOME Shell and it really opens up the desktop to a quick and efficient way to navigate

05:27.760 --> 05:28.320
the UI.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.080
And so I've decided as I'm kind of prepping my space right now.

05:32.080 --> 05:36.800
I am I am making way for GNOME Shell 40 because I have been a plasma head for a while and

05:36.800 --> 05:39.200
I want to switch over to Shell 40 when it lands.

05:40.080 --> 05:45.520
So what I have done is I have dusted off and I'm charging it right now an old Apple Magic

05:45.520 --> 05:48.400
trackpad because I guess these work pretty well now.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.080
Oh, look at you.

05:50.080 --> 05:50.640
I know, right?

05:51.200 --> 05:54.240
I'm thinking I'm going to do to I'm going to do the two mouse setup.

05:54.240 --> 05:58.320
I'm going to have a regular mouse on my right and then I'll have my trackpad on my left.

05:58.320 --> 06:02.640
It's a setup I've used in the past for video editing and also kind of helps with RSI because

06:02.640 --> 06:08.400
I use my right hand less this way and I can manipulate the UI with my left hand and I can

06:08.400 --> 06:10.000
click and point with my right hand.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.840
So you kind of get the best of both worlds.

06:12.560 --> 06:15.520
How well that Apple Magic trackpad is supported.

06:15.520 --> 06:18.480
That's what I'm kind of wondering if anybody in the Mumble room has tried these before

06:18.480 --> 06:19.440
with Linux.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.120
Yes, I have indeed.

06:21.120 --> 06:23.840
So the trackpad one works pretty well.

06:23.840 --> 06:24.480
Number one.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.200
OK, yeah, I've done pretty well.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.520
What about the new Magic trackpad two?

06:29.520 --> 06:31.040
I haven't tried it yet.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.480
Yeah, but the one works well.

06:32.480 --> 06:35.760
The only thing I have from time to time, it does not auto connect.

06:35.760 --> 06:38.800
So you will have to manually connect it via Bluetooth.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.320
So I was thinking I do wired.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.120
I was thinking because I did read that some people get it working with Bluetooth but get

06:43.120 --> 06:46.960
disconnect issues, but it seems to work 100 percent of the time wired.

06:46.960 --> 06:47.680
I'm fine with that.

06:47.680 --> 06:48.560
This is a desktop.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.880
So that's, you know, and this is I just want to try this out.

06:52.880 --> 06:58.080
And I've recently realized that I am very much a desktop guy.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.680
I really like desktops.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.280
And so I thought about it.

07:01.280 --> 07:05.440
It's like, well, maybe I could just do a few things to take what I like about the laptop

07:05.440 --> 07:08.400
experience and bring it to the desktop and make it even better.

07:08.400 --> 07:12.320
So now I have like a full desktop keyboard and mouse, but I also will have the trackpad

07:12.320 --> 07:13.120
gestures and all of that.

07:13.120 --> 07:16.400
Does that mean you're going to buy like a really bad webcam to add on there, too?

07:18.240 --> 07:18.560
Nice.

07:18.560 --> 07:23.840
I have like a Logitech C920 hooked up, but it is starting to feel old, but they really

07:23.840 --> 07:25.360
haven't surpassed it much.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.480
But you know what I mean, Wes?

07:26.480 --> 07:29.440
Like I'm preparing the way, like I'm getting myself all set up.

07:29.440 --> 07:32.720
I got my monitors arranged the way I'm going to want them for GNOME Shell.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.600
Getting myself ready.

07:33.600 --> 07:34.720
My body is prepared.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.240
My workspace is prepared.

07:36.240 --> 07:39.040
I don't know if this is like a I mean, obviously, there's a lot of really good stuff.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.360
It seems like GNOME 40 has a lot of nice things.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.920
But does this speak a little bit to the GNOME, you know, riding the edge of GNOME experience

07:45.920 --> 07:51.280
that either have to be upset by it or like you're doing, choose to really embrace it

07:51.280 --> 07:52.240
and plan ahead?

07:52.240 --> 07:56.240
Yeah, I'm wondering, Carl, if your thoughts have evolved at all on the horizontal workspace

07:56.240 --> 08:00.640
layout and some of the recent things that the GNOME project like Alan Day made a post

08:00.640 --> 08:03.600
saying where they're they're going to commit to multi monitor support and they're going

08:03.600 --> 08:05.120
to continue to work on that.

08:05.120 --> 08:09.040
Have you have your thoughts on GNOME 40 and and if you're going to stick with the more

08:09.040 --> 08:11.200
traditional layout stuff, is that evolved at all?

08:11.200 --> 08:13.600
I haven't read through all of the updates yet.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.200
I'm still a little skeptical.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.320
I mean, I know they're going to try and work towards it and they're they're listening to

08:18.320 --> 08:19.440
the feedback, at least.

08:19.440 --> 08:21.600
I'll definitely give it a shot when it comes out.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.600
But we time will tell if it's something I can actually get used to or not with the different

08:25.600 --> 08:26.640
different things.

08:26.640 --> 08:31.040
What I've noticed is that every time I bring up, you know, the spatial relationship of

08:31.040 --> 08:36.160
the desktop, they like that they're focusing on the spatial relationship between elements

08:36.160 --> 08:40.320
on the desktop, like the app drawer and the workspace switcher.

08:40.320 --> 08:44.560
But I've been more focused on the spatial relationship between different workspaces.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.960
And those aren't the same thing.

08:46.960 --> 08:47.960
Hello, Poby.

08:47.960 --> 08:48.960
Good to see you.

08:48.960 --> 08:53.440
I don't think I've gotten your take on the GNOME 40 shell changes.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.160
We've been chatting about them on the show, kind of preparing ourselves for it.

08:56.160 --> 08:59.840
I was just talking about how I'm setting up a rig to get ready for it and I'm going to

08:59.840 --> 09:02.480
jump in and try out the new layouts.

09:02.480 --> 09:03.720
What are your takes on it?

09:03.720 --> 09:09.260
Is this is this the time when the Linux desktop is passing you by or are you on board to try

09:09.260 --> 09:11.280
out the new the new changes?

09:11.280 --> 09:16.800
Well, I'm on Ubuntu, so it's a bit difficult to try it out unless I nuke and pave and go

09:16.800 --> 09:19.120
with some other distro right now.

09:19.120 --> 09:20.320
What are your thoughts on that?

09:20.320 --> 09:23.400
So I could give it a go on one of my other machines.

09:23.400 --> 09:28.800
But what I don't think that will help me because what I really need to do is play with it

09:28.800 --> 09:33.200
on my primary machine where I have multiple monitors.

09:33.200 --> 09:40.320
Because like Carl, you know, I need to feel what it feels like using it on a daily basis.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.240
And I'm not there yet because I need to use this as a functioning machine.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.520
I can't really use pre-release software on this right now.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.520
Yep.

09:46.520 --> 09:50.920
I thought about doing the pre-release thing myself, been tempted a couple of times.

09:50.920 --> 09:54.960
We did load it up at one point to just kind of get an idea of what was coming so we could

09:54.960 --> 09:55.960
talk about it.

09:55.960 --> 10:00.840
But I didn't want to I didn't really want to base my whole opinion on it yet.

10:00.840 --> 10:07.000
Well, kind of in this same realm, talking about this this hardware, believe it or not,

10:07.000 --> 10:12.720
in kind of a fixing the barn doors after the cow comes home, traditional open source style,

10:12.720 --> 10:18.840
the Apple Touch Bar on MacBooks may actually see at least a glimmer of hope of getting

10:18.840 --> 10:21.520
upstreamed in 2021.

10:21.520 --> 10:27.160
It's actually happening that that that little touch bar, even though I think now it's rumored

10:27.160 --> 10:32.160
it's going away, we may have at least some basic functionality soon.

10:32.160 --> 10:38.280
Released out on Saturday by independent developer Ronald Sklar was the latest reverse engineered

10:38.280 --> 10:43.520
open source driver code that gets the touch bar and the Apple light sensor support working

10:43.520 --> 10:47.320
for MacBook Pro 13 inch 14 inch and 15 inch models.

10:47.320 --> 10:51.440
Yeah, light support light sensor support is particularly interesting because that's part

10:51.440 --> 10:55.820
of the solution that macOS uses to adjust the screen brightness.

10:55.820 --> 11:01.000
Now the Apple iBridge that T one security trip driver is also needed for interfacing

11:01.000 --> 11:05.600
with the eyesight web camera and the light sensor and the fingerprint sensor.

11:05.600 --> 11:10.040
At the moment, the Linux driver coverage is focused on the touch bar and the light sensor.

11:10.040 --> 11:15.760
Yeah, so no webcam and no touch ID.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.200
But the driver is coming along.

11:18.200 --> 11:25.680
And while it's a slow pace, it means that people who are transitioning to preserving

11:25.680 --> 11:29.920
or archiving these machines or rebuilding and repurposing these machines are going to

11:29.920 --> 11:30.920
have support.

11:30.920 --> 11:35.000
And that I think is kind of nice because as these are sort of probably being taken out

11:35.000 --> 11:39.600
of production with the M one over time now, and it won't be all at once, Linux will be

11:39.600 --> 11:43.320
ready to support the systems that want to stay around and stay relevant.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.800
That's I love seeing that kind of thing.

11:44.800 --> 11:50.120
And unfortunately, that seems to be about where our MacBook support is shining best

11:50.120 --> 11:51.400
these days.

11:51.400 --> 11:55.400
Not so bad, though, really, you know, because if you buy a Mac, you're buying a Mac to run

11:55.400 --> 11:57.240
macOS.

11:57.240 --> 12:01.700
But if you're buying a used Mac, it's really nice to be able to run Linux on it.

12:01.700 --> 12:02.700
It's not an ideal situation.

12:02.700 --> 12:07.280
Obviously, it'd be great if hell, it'd be great if Apple upstream drivers for heck's

12:07.280 --> 12:08.760
sake, Wes.

12:08.760 --> 12:13.800
But you know, as far as a number two, being able to run these machines years after Apple

12:13.800 --> 12:19.640
abandoned them, I think is hugely not only useful from just like an economic standpoint,

12:19.640 --> 12:21.480
but also just from preventing environmental waste.

12:21.480 --> 12:25.640
Now, it'd be very, very entertaining to me if there was somehow a touch bar revolution

12:25.640 --> 12:33.880
on the Linux side of things after the Apple ecosystem wasn't so fond.

12:33.880 --> 12:40.280
Linode.com slash unplugged go there to get a $100 for 60 days on a new account.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.080
That's, that's really remarkable.

12:42.080 --> 12:46.280
$100 in credit will really let you try out Linode and see what it can do.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.720
That's what's great is that kind of shows some confidence by Linode.

12:49.720 --> 12:53.600
And one of the things I think is great about Linode is all of the distributions they support

12:53.600 --> 12:59.080
in a, in a moment, we're going to open up one of our boxes for the chat room to log

12:59.080 --> 13:00.080
into.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.960
And we're confident that we'll have the performance necessary to actually make that possible

13:03.960 --> 13:10.120
because every machine has super fast SSDs, 40 gigabit connections to the internet, and

13:10.120 --> 13:14.120
one of 11 choice data center locations to choose from.

13:14.120 --> 13:20.000
And one of the great things about Linode beyond just the fact that I trust them with our infrastructure

13:20.000 --> 13:22.080
is I trust where they're going long term.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.080
They're independently owned.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.880
They have been since 2003.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.900
That's a big deal if you're going to rely on them for your business or for even your

13:28.900 --> 13:30.640
personal stuff.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.520
And they've really honed in what they do well.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.820
They focused on it and they make it just right.

13:35.820 --> 13:36.820
They do it right.

13:36.820 --> 13:40.000
They do the best virtualized Linux computing out there.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.200
You can try it too and see it, see it for yourself, see how them being in this game

13:44.200 --> 13:49.800
for so long has given them a certain head over everyone else.

13:49.800 --> 13:54.960
Get out at linode.com slash unplugged and get that $100, 60 day credit.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.960
They're independently owned and they're founded on a love for Linux.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.440
And I love that about them.

13:59.440 --> 14:00.960
And we run a ton of our infrastructure on there.

14:00.960 --> 14:05.320
So I can recommend if you need to build a website or set up a backend for a chat system

14:05.320 --> 14:09.560
or maybe run a real time chat app like mumble, Linode is going to work for you.

14:09.560 --> 14:15.040
But even a static website might be the way to go, maybe for a blog or maybe for a resume.

14:15.040 --> 14:21.360
I will toss a link in our show notes at linux unplugged dot com slash 395 to a really well

14:21.360 --> 14:27.040
done write up in the Linode documentation area on choosing the right static website

14:27.040 --> 14:32.040
for you and kind of the pros and cons, the theme options for the different ones and then

14:32.040 --> 14:36.640
a comparison of things like Jekyll and Hugo and well a bunch of other ones and then how

14:36.640 --> 14:41.100
to use them so you can get an idea of what the flavor would be managing it and what front

14:41.100 --> 14:43.760
ends they have to even manage them if they have them.

14:43.760 --> 14:48.760
It's all just kind of outlined for you beautifully and then of course like one click to get these

14:48.760 --> 14:53.720
things going on Linode and with our hundred dollar credit you could try each one of them.

14:53.720 --> 14:54.720
Why not?

14:54.720 --> 14:58.440
I actually one of the first ways I started using Linode and one of the ways I knew I

14:58.440 --> 15:03.160
was going to be using Linode for a long time was I tried out every different combination

15:03.160 --> 15:07.320
of WordPress just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom on Linode tested each one of them, built

15:07.320 --> 15:08.480
each one of them up.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.600
Not only was it a great way to refresh myself on how to use WordPress because it had been

15:11.600 --> 15:18.200
a while but I really got a sense of what performed the best for me and I just kept that Linode.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.200
It was great.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.200
You can do the same thing.

15:20.200 --> 15:25.120
Go to linode.com slash unplugged get that $100 60-day credit and of course support the

15:25.120 --> 15:28.500
show.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.400
We all love archive.org.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.700
It's one of the greatest resources on the internet and it's the home of the internet

15:33.700 --> 15:35.300
way back machine.

15:35.300 --> 15:39.160
It's also a content distribution network of sorts.

15:39.160 --> 15:43.900
You got to imagine it is quite the infrastructure and you've probably imagined if you didn't

15:43.900 --> 15:47.960
know it's running Linux you would be correct on both counts.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.200
I mean don't all the best things run Linux?

15:50.200 --> 15:51.200
It's true.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.200
That's true.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.520
Jonah Edwards is the infrastructure manager at archive.org.

15:55.520 --> 16:00.960
He joined in the fall of 2016 and this is in his bio quote escaping from the world of

16:00.960 --> 16:07.680
online attention optimization to the peace and safety of a techno utopia librarianship

16:07.680 --> 16:14.880
which is incredible and he gave a presentation to the internet archive staff about the infrastructure

16:14.880 --> 16:19.600
you know just to kind of tell the employees how things work and like the awesome people

16:19.600 --> 16:24.040
they are they made the whole thing public and Wes and I watched it and we grabbed a

16:24.040 --> 16:29.000
couple of moments to just kind of tell you how they use Linux and how the archive.org

16:29.000 --> 16:30.360
actually works.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.800
So why don't we do this?

16:31.800 --> 16:34.520
Let's start with an introduction from Jonah himself.

16:34.520 --> 16:38.400
Hey everybody for those of you who don't know me or I haven't had the pleasure of meeting

16:38.400 --> 16:39.400
yet.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.400
My name is Jonah Edwards.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.240
I run the core infrastructure team here at the Internet Archive.

16:43.240 --> 16:48.160
Yeah and you probably suspected but may not have known that they run all of their own

16:48.160 --> 16:49.160
infrastructure.

16:49.160 --> 16:50.800
There is no cloud.

16:50.800 --> 16:51.960
So there's no cloud.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.180
It's just someone else's computer.

16:54.180 --> 16:58.360
Most of us have probably heard this sentiment in some form or another but here at the Internet

16:58.360 --> 17:01.000
Archive that's really really there's no cloud.

17:01.000 --> 17:05.720
It's just our computers in our buildings run by our people.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.880
And he gives us a rundown of what those computers are.

17:08.880 --> 17:13.360
We have around 750 operational servers right now.

17:13.360 --> 17:16.120
We run these things way longer than anyone else does.

17:16.120 --> 17:18.520
The oldest systems in our fleet are from back in 2012.

17:18.520 --> 17:23.320
More than a thousand VMs across the fleet which is probably what those of you who interface

17:23.320 --> 17:26.080
with us directly mostly interface with.

17:26.080 --> 17:32.100
Tens of thousands of storage devices from high performance NVMe flash, SSDs, the spinning

17:32.100 --> 17:37.480
disks underlying the operating systems on the servers, and over 20,000 spinning disks

17:37.480 --> 17:43.400
in paired storage which is the redundant storage layer underlying the Internet Archive's corpus

17:43.400 --> 17:47.720
totaling nearly 200 petabytes of raw storage capacity in the Internet Archive.

17:47.720 --> 17:48.720
200 petabytes.

17:48.720 --> 17:51.440
I mean I knew it'd be a lot.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.600
I knew it'd be a lot.

17:52.600 --> 17:58.080
But you can imagine the growth rate too is a hell of a thing just to even manage.

17:58.080 --> 18:04.880
We're currently growing the Internet Archive by over a quarter of its size per year.

18:04.880 --> 18:05.880
Per year Wes?

18:05.880 --> 18:06.880
Per year?

18:06.880 --> 18:07.880
What?

18:07.880 --> 18:11.400
Imagine what that's like to manage from like a server standpoint, a disk standpoint, a

18:11.400 --> 18:13.200
network standpoint.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.760
And they've recently seen a large jump in traffic in general.

18:16.760 --> 18:25.200
We've had a huge explosion in outbound traffic over the last year with the pandemic, lockdown.

18:25.200 --> 18:31.080
You can see there in March and April of 2020 how we really flatlined just because demand

18:31.080 --> 18:35.800
increased so quickly and so dramatically much faster than we anticipated.

18:35.800 --> 18:36.800
Yeah.

18:36.800 --> 18:43.220
So the pandemic and people at home led to increased use of Archive.org which is interesting

18:43.220 --> 18:48.800
because it led to a big decrease in actual library use but the Archive.org Internet library

18:48.800 --> 18:49.800
saw a huge uptick.

18:49.800 --> 18:50.800
Yeah.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.320
Well it's the safest library out there.

18:52.320 --> 18:53.640
That's true.

18:53.640 --> 18:55.760
And no mask required.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.640
Then he gave us a bit of an overview of the network traffic they see.

18:59.640 --> 19:03.740
This is hard to actually put in this talk because this was an area where he gave some

19:03.740 --> 19:08.400
visual examples and did an overview that was like put up on maps and whatnot.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.760
So we will link to the video so you can see the entire thing.

19:10.760 --> 19:13.240
It's not that long and it's interesting the entire time.

19:13.240 --> 19:19.440
I think it's one of the best virtual talks I've watched this last pandemic year.

19:19.440 --> 19:23.020
And so if you want to check out the whole thing I would encourage you but here's a little

19:23.020 --> 19:26.680
taste of the network infrastructure and even kind of where they're going with it.

19:26.680 --> 19:30.760
We're pushing 60 something gigabits out most of the time right now.

19:30.760 --> 19:34.040
We're currently working on expanding that capacity.

19:34.040 --> 19:39.000
My expectation is that flow will be probably in the 80 gigabit range once we kind of clear

19:39.000 --> 19:43.040
everything out here and then just more from there.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.600
So the inner site links that we do are kind of our current bottleneck.

19:46.600 --> 19:50.200
We run those with a technology called dense wave division multiplexing.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.640
I'm not going to get too into this.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.060
I just think it's super cool.

19:53.060 --> 19:55.580
So I tell people about it whenever it comes up.

19:55.580 --> 20:00.520
We use fiber optics to connect our sites and just like with a prism, if you shine the fiber

20:00.520 --> 20:04.940
optic in different colors, you can prism it together into a single beam of light and deprism

20:04.940 --> 20:06.780
it back at the other end.

20:06.780 --> 20:07.780
Super cool technology.

20:07.780 --> 20:10.440
Anyway, that's my little aside.

20:10.440 --> 20:14.040
What we're moving towards now is actually going to be a full fiber ring between our

20:14.040 --> 20:15.040
sites.

20:15.040 --> 20:19.280
We're going to have 100 gigabit links between all the sites.

20:19.280 --> 20:24.240
We are going to be able to utilize both directions of the fiber ring simultaneously, giving us

20:24.240 --> 20:28.680
kind of 200 gigabits of bandwidth in both directions.

20:28.680 --> 20:33.000
Of course, if we use the whole thing, then we're not going to get quite the redundancy

20:33.000 --> 20:36.520
of the fiber ring and that's the reason I'm really excited about it.

20:36.520 --> 20:42.120
It's been kind of one of the biggest causes of outages for us, especially long term outages.

20:42.120 --> 20:45.440
I know watching the networking details was your favorite part of the talk with.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.440
Oh my gosh.

20:46.440 --> 20:52.440
I just love the amount of openness here, which I guess sort of makes sense given it's archive.org,

20:52.440 --> 20:58.960
but tons of nitty gritty, tons of nice actual pictures of their somewhat messy networking

20:58.960 --> 20:59.960
stacks.

20:59.960 --> 21:02.520
You actually get to see some of how this really happens.

21:02.520 --> 21:03.520
Right.

21:03.520 --> 21:07.680
It's not so much like the PR photos you see from AWS or Google Cloud, but like their actual

21:07.680 --> 21:12.080
infrastructure, the real stuff, kind of like we're going to get to a little bit later

21:12.080 --> 21:13.080
in the show.

21:13.080 --> 21:19.920
Real infrastructure sometimes has issues, but what I appreciated about this talk was

21:19.920 --> 21:25.720
you could tell the staff understood the value that this infrastructure brings an electronic

21:25.720 --> 21:30.840
archive and Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive, wrapped it up with a

21:30.840 --> 21:35.920
real nice moment, actually, where he acknowledged Linux's role in all of this.

21:35.920 --> 21:40.120
And of course, how awesome his team has been at implementing open source technologies to

21:40.120 --> 21:41.960
solve these problems.

21:41.960 --> 21:46.480
We're all built on on Linux and the wonder of open source.

21:46.480 --> 21:53.640
And it's just what a sharing awesome, amazing environment, the whole Linux Ubuntu free and

21:53.640 --> 21:57.080
open source software, the sharing that's been going on.

21:57.080 --> 22:05.120
And then we built the Petabox infrastructure on top of that, mostly in PHP and Python,

22:05.120 --> 22:09.080
to go and offer our services to the world.

22:09.080 --> 22:13.680
It is a really impressive thing that this group has been able to pull off.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.520
Yeah, that was Brewster Kahle.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.520
That's pretty great.

22:16.520 --> 22:19.000
And it's nice to see them acknowledge Linux's role in that.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.540
Yeah, really nicely put.

22:20.540 --> 22:25.120
And with that, we'll just say thank you to Archive.org for everything they do.

22:25.120 --> 22:29.320
And a big, like, love from the show to them because they helped Jupiter Broadcasting do

22:29.320 --> 22:31.920
some of their early distribution.

22:31.920 --> 22:37.280
And I love, love, love the Wayback Machine, some serious nostalgia, but also just great

22:37.280 --> 22:39.320
to go back and see how things have evolved over time.

22:39.320 --> 22:44.760
Well, yeah, I mean, I think especially as we rapidly evolve what happens on the Internet,

22:44.760 --> 22:48.600
that's documenting the culture that exists or doesn't exist anymore.

22:48.600 --> 22:52.560
All right, Wes, grab your Swiffer.

22:52.560 --> 22:55.040
Time for a spot of housekeeping around here.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.800
I did this last week.

22:56.800 --> 22:57.800
It's your turn.

22:57.800 --> 22:59.580
No, we're going to both do it.

22:59.580 --> 23:01.320
We both have the broom.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.320
You know, it's shared.

23:02.320 --> 23:06.560
Gosh, I tell you what, I mean, I don't know where you found this dual handled broom, but

23:06.560 --> 23:07.560
OK.

23:07.560 --> 23:08.560
Wait, wait.

23:08.560 --> 23:09.560
Oh, you missed a spot there, Wes.

23:09.560 --> 23:10.560
Yeah, right there.

23:10.560 --> 23:11.560
Yeah.

23:11.560 --> 23:12.560
Come on now.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.560
Get that.

23:13.560 --> 23:14.560
He's going to get upset with me.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.440
So you go to Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash Telegram if you want to join the J.B.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.160
Telegram group.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.160
All kinds of reasons.

23:20.160 --> 23:23.720
Not only do you see behind the scenes discussion, but you follow up with us directly.

23:23.720 --> 23:28.120
Additionally, show announcements and when events are happening, you'll generally get

23:28.120 --> 23:32.820
info about them in their Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash Telegram.

23:32.820 --> 23:40.000
Every single Sunday, our virtual get together outside the show just to hang out and talk.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.500
Sometimes some of the sessions are recorded.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.200
Sometimes it's just to hang out and talk about things you love about Linux or things you

23:44.200 --> 23:47.720
do with Linux or ways to use Linux or learn.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.480
It's a pretty cool community and it's self-organizing.

23:50.480 --> 23:54.920
Every Sunday in our Mumble Room, we'll have the calendar event at Jupiter Broadcasting

23:54.920 --> 23:55.920
dot com slash calendar.

23:55.920 --> 24:00.920
And I encourage you to get Mumble set up because then you can join our virtual lug during the

24:00.920 --> 24:01.920
show.

24:01.920 --> 24:07.040
And I was just I was just thinking it's funny how the clubhouse social network thing has

24:07.040 --> 24:08.680
gotten so popular.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.480
It's really Mumble.

24:10.480 --> 24:14.220
The club, what Clubhouse is doing, it's Mumble.

24:14.220 --> 24:17.440
And it's not as good as Mumble and it's not free software.

24:17.440 --> 24:24.060
But the idea, the idea is sound so you can join the lug and hang out in there every Sunday.

24:24.060 --> 24:28.840
And while you're over at Jupiter Broadcasting dot com, why not grab the all shows feed?

24:28.840 --> 24:31.280
When we launch new content, you get it there.

24:31.280 --> 24:36.920
But additionally, in that feed, along with this show, you get Koda radio, self-hosted

24:36.920 --> 24:42.200
and Linux action news where Wes and I are breaking down all of the important Linux news

24:42.200 --> 24:44.120
every single week.

24:44.120 --> 24:46.200
That's all Jupiter Broadcasting dot com.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.160
Go get some.

24:49.160 --> 24:52.280
That should be the new slogan, you know, Jupiter Broadcasting dot com.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.280
Go get some.

24:53.280 --> 24:54.680
That'd be really obnoxious.

24:54.680 --> 24:59.280
Although obnoxious is kind of the name of the game because we wanted to be a little

24:59.280 --> 25:06.280
tongue in cheek, have some fun with this because, you know, it's the hacker games.

25:06.280 --> 25:11.000
What's even crazier than letting anyone join a virtual lug and speak on our podcast live

25:11.000 --> 25:12.320
on the air?

25:12.320 --> 25:17.160
How about sharing the login information to one of our application servers with our chat

25:17.160 --> 25:18.160
room?

25:18.160 --> 25:22.000
We've set up an application server with one major misconfiguration.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.480
If you find it, you can own the box.

25:24.480 --> 25:31.760
Whoever gets root first claims the yet to be announced 400 swag.

25:31.760 --> 25:35.160
One box, one hacker, one exclusive prize.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.040
It's the Unplugged Hacker Game.

25:38.040 --> 25:41.800
Oops, we misconfigured one of our systems.

25:41.800 --> 25:45.240
An actual misconfiguration that I've seen in production.

25:45.240 --> 25:50.720
The first who pops root on the box and leaves their name in an email and their email address

25:50.720 --> 25:57.360
in a text file in the slash root home folder wins lup 400 swag.

25:57.360 --> 26:02.440
Also the first who posts a link to the super secret file in the slash root home folder

26:02.440 --> 26:03.960
also will win the swag.

26:03.960 --> 26:05.280
So that's what we're doing today.

26:05.280 --> 26:12.520
We have this accidental configuration and it's on a server at rust.rodeo and the login

26:12.520 --> 26:15.440
is backup.

26:15.440 --> 26:17.640
And what was the password, Wes?

26:17.640 --> 26:18.640
Unplugged.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.640
Oh, right.

26:19.640 --> 26:20.640
Yeah.

26:20.640 --> 26:21.920
So the user account is backup.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.720
The password is unplugged.

26:24.720 --> 26:25.720
Rust.rodeo.

26:25.720 --> 26:26.720
Go log in.

26:26.720 --> 26:29.140
If you can pop the root first, you win.

26:29.140 --> 26:31.400
And if you can find the misconfiguration that we did.

26:31.400 --> 26:35.720
But this user account backup doesn't normally have a shell.

26:35.720 --> 26:43.420
A lot of systems like Ubuntu or Debian, this is a Debian box, will have a backup user pre-added.

26:43.420 --> 26:49.200
And I actually have seen in production when the client needed for some reason the backup

26:49.200 --> 26:53.960
account to actually like log in and do something over SSH, I can't even remember what the circumstances

26:53.960 --> 26:57.320
was back then, but it was something to do with backup PC.

26:57.320 --> 27:02.720
And they set a shell for their backup account and set a really basic password.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.520
And that is actually how I got access to the box.

27:05.520 --> 27:09.480
And so we're kind of replicating that setup, but with a modern twist because this is an

27:09.480 --> 27:11.960
application server that we have deployed.

27:11.960 --> 27:17.620
And so it's running amongst other things, container software, and it has net data installed

27:17.620 --> 27:19.480
for monitoring.

27:19.480 --> 27:24.800
It's a common system, pretty minimal install, running on Debian that you'd see with one

27:24.800 --> 27:29.320
or two mistakes that I've actually witnessed in production that have been made here.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.560
Maybe it's not the newest Debian, you know?

27:31.560 --> 27:33.520
Yeah, maybe there's a couple of old packages on there.

27:33.520 --> 27:43.560
So go log in to rust.rodeo with the user account backup and the password unplugged.

27:43.560 --> 27:48.220
And whoever gets there first, put your name and email in a text file in slash roots home

27:48.220 --> 27:51.400
folder and then let us know.

27:51.400 --> 27:55.220
And then in the meantime, what we thought we would do is tell you about kind of like

27:55.220 --> 27:57.720
a cheat way that won't work on this box, right, Wes?

27:57.720 --> 27:58.720
This isn't going to work.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.720
Like, we're not going to...

27:59.720 --> 28:02.760
I don't know if I want to tell them about it yet because then they could use it, but

28:02.760 --> 28:03.760
I don't think it'll work.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.240
No, I mean, it might work, yeah.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.240
You think?

28:07.240 --> 28:08.240
You think it might?

28:08.240 --> 28:09.240
Mm-hmm.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.240
Yeah.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.240
That'd be cheating.

28:11.240 --> 28:12.240
You know?

28:12.240 --> 28:13.240
That'd be cheating.

28:13.240 --> 28:14.240
But I'm going to tell you about...

28:14.240 --> 28:16.280
I'm going to tell you like a cheat code way you can do it.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.080
It's something that kind of inspired this segment.

28:18.080 --> 28:22.840
We're curious to see how long it takes somebody to get access because my thinking here is,

28:22.840 --> 28:25.760
oh, I'm actually seeing a little bit of usage tick up on it too.

28:25.760 --> 28:26.760
Interesting.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.840
I'm watching the system here.

28:28.840 --> 28:34.520
My thinking on it is quite simply, oh, oh, we have some definite...

28:34.520 --> 28:35.520
People are...

28:35.520 --> 28:36.520
Wow.

28:36.520 --> 28:37.520
Wow.

28:37.520 --> 28:38.520
Excellent.

28:38.520 --> 28:39.520
It's funny to watch what people are doing.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.280
So we have somebody who is spinning up Docker.

28:41.280 --> 28:46.240
We have somebody who's running Nano on the sudoers file right now.

28:46.240 --> 28:48.640
Look at you guys, you deviants.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.640
What are you doing to our box right now?

28:50.640 --> 28:52.040
This poor innocent box.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.240
Boy, there's a lot of things happening right now.

28:54.240 --> 28:57.640
Ideally, install some Rust on there because it's got a great domain name, but I don't

28:57.640 --> 29:00.180
think we put anything that was Rust powered on it yet.

29:00.180 --> 29:03.940
This is our Rust application development server, rust.rodeo.

29:03.940 --> 29:05.080
So while people are...

29:05.080 --> 29:08.440
I'm going to tell you a way you can get root, but if you use this, you don't qualify for

29:08.440 --> 29:09.440
the prize.

29:09.440 --> 29:11.000
But this is what kind of inspired the segment.

29:11.000 --> 29:16.960
It's like, you know in Mario when you get the star and then you're invincible?

29:16.960 --> 29:17.960
That's what this is.

29:17.960 --> 29:23.440
You can automatically exploit any low-hanging fruit to pop a root shell in Linux with this

29:23.440 --> 29:24.440
app.

29:24.440 --> 29:27.680
And I thought it'd be fun to tell you guys about it because if you wanted to test your

29:27.680 --> 29:32.120
systems and see how they stand up, we actually ran this against a couple of boxes, some of

29:32.120 --> 29:35.120
which it could not exploit and some of which it could.

29:35.120 --> 29:38.940
And it's called Traitor, and we'll have a link to it in the show notes.

29:38.940 --> 29:42.960
It's obviously up on GitHub, like seemingly everything is these days.

29:42.960 --> 29:49.180
And you run this Go app on your system as a regular user, and it will automatically

29:49.180 --> 29:55.280
check for all of the known likely vulnerabilities on a box and then pop you a shell using one

29:55.280 --> 29:56.280
of them.

29:56.280 --> 29:57.720
Oh, Neil, you got it.

29:57.720 --> 29:58.720
You got it already.

29:58.720 --> 29:59.720
Yep.

29:59.720 --> 30:02.460
I didn't remember exactly what you said I should do, so I just went ahead and dropped

30:02.460 --> 30:06.160
a file in slash root on the host file system.

30:06.160 --> 30:07.160
That's great.

30:07.160 --> 30:08.160
I found the super secret file.

30:08.160 --> 30:09.720
I also decided, you know what?

30:09.720 --> 30:10.720
Just whatever.

30:10.720 --> 30:12.560
I'll just drop something in there, too.

30:12.560 --> 30:13.560
I've owned everything.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.840
I access stuff.

30:14.840 --> 30:15.920
You want me to install something?

30:15.920 --> 30:16.920
I can.

30:16.920 --> 30:22.000
I can upgrade the system to Debian 10 and break everything if you'd like.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.240
Well, that only took a few minutes.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.240
Well done, sir.

30:26.240 --> 30:28.160
So walk people through how you got root.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.300
Tell us what you found and what was misconfigured.

30:31.300 --> 30:35.120
I don't know if this was the misconfiguration you were going for, but here's the one that

30:35.120 --> 30:36.680
I found.

30:36.680 --> 30:38.120
Docker PS worked.

30:38.120 --> 30:42.560
And that was enough for me to realize this is a Debian system, so this is probably going

30:42.560 --> 30:46.320
to be busted in all kinds of fun ways.

30:46.320 --> 30:52.720
So by default, on most of the non-Red Hat family, and I think this is actually kind

30:52.720 --> 30:58.040
of fixed in the SUSE family now, but at least in the Debian Ubuntu family, if you have the

30:58.040 --> 31:02.960
ability to access the Docker socket and you have a Docker service daemon, you're actually

31:02.960 --> 31:08.320
able to bypass every single protection if you don't have, you know, SE Linux working

31:08.320 --> 31:09.680
on it, for example.

31:09.680 --> 31:24.120
And so what I did was I just docker run dactechrm space-it-v slash to slash host and opened

31:24.120 --> 31:29.600
up fedora-latest, and that gave me a root of S with a mount point with read-write access

31:29.600 --> 31:31.840
to the host file system, and everything was there.

31:31.840 --> 31:37.000
And I just poked around and did stuff, and it's like, oh, well, you know, whatever.

31:37.000 --> 31:38.920
Man, Chris, you're bad at this.

31:38.920 --> 31:42.240
You just wanted to say that you used Fedora to own Debian.

31:42.240 --> 31:43.720
That's pretty great, yeah.

31:43.720 --> 31:48.080
But I think what's great is it's two issues that you compounded.

31:48.080 --> 31:51.720
So number one is you got access to the box.

31:51.720 --> 31:56.600
Maybe in this scenario, somebody has a backup account on a server, and they're using a really

31:56.600 --> 32:01.540
basic password that you're able to dictionary attack, or for whatever reason, you get shell

32:01.540 --> 32:02.540
on a box.

32:02.540 --> 32:03.540
But you didn't get root shell.

32:03.540 --> 32:04.540
You just got user shell.

32:04.540 --> 32:07.120
He wasn't in the sudoers file or anything like that.

32:07.120 --> 32:12.400
But then you leverage an extremely common docker misconfiguration to own the rest of

32:12.400 --> 32:13.400
the box.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.560
And that was actually exactly the route we thought somebody might take.

32:15.560 --> 32:16.560
So congratulations.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.560
Well done, sir.

32:17.560 --> 32:18.560
Well done.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.960
You will get the yet-to-be-announced swag item.

32:20.960 --> 32:25.600
And I think that the point we were trying to make with this is it is actually pretty

32:25.600 --> 32:29.520
exceptionally easy to have zero knowledge or experience with a box, and if you just

32:29.520 --> 32:34.040
have an understanding of how these fundamentals work, you can get access.

32:34.040 --> 32:37.480
And that was exactly the point we were trying to demonstrate, ah, PyCrash was going that

32:37.480 --> 32:38.480
route too.

32:38.480 --> 32:40.640
I almost made it, man.

32:40.640 --> 32:41.640
You almost made it.

32:41.640 --> 32:46.360
I left a little treat on slash root if you want to go look, Chris.

32:46.360 --> 32:51.180
Technically nobody has posted a link to the super secret file yet, PyCrash.

32:51.180 --> 32:55.120
So you could technically still do that and post a link to it in the IRC room, which means

32:55.120 --> 32:56.960
you have to get it uploaded somewhere.

32:56.960 --> 33:00.760
And then you would still qualify for the yet-to-be-announced swag item.

33:00.760 --> 33:03.280
Ah, Gamma was looking at set UID binaries.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.840
Yeah, that's a good idea.

33:04.840 --> 33:10.880
Yeah, this was a conversation that I think I had to really convince Wes we should do.

33:10.880 --> 33:14.400
The other thing we did, although it's not super obvious, is we decided to go with kind

33:14.400 --> 33:16.120
of an easy root password.

33:16.120 --> 33:21.960
It does have letters and numbers, so it's not super crazy easy, but it would probably

33:21.960 --> 33:22.960
be guessable.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.280
Definitely, yeah, dictionary attackable.

33:25.280 --> 33:26.280
Yeah.

33:26.280 --> 33:30.800
It's not really, everybody knows important passwords, but I just think that it's funny

33:30.800 --> 33:38.040
to reach into a past life where I actually saw this scenario and it was using not a super

33:38.040 --> 33:42.600
simple password, but a password for this backup account, back with this client.

33:42.600 --> 33:47.600
It was using a password that was in several scripts that multiple people had access to.

33:47.600 --> 33:51.560
So there was many scenarios where you would have an opportunity to see the password, like

33:51.560 --> 33:53.800
if you're on the LAN or something like that.

33:53.800 --> 33:59.280
And it was a dictionary word and you could just log in to any boxes backup with that

33:59.280 --> 34:03.240
password because they set it up on every single rig for the backups to work.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.920
And then all it really takes, right, is someone's trying to backup something, maybe they're

34:05.920 --> 34:07.400
trying to backup a container.

34:07.400 --> 34:11.640
So they add that user to the Docker group or they fuss with permissions on the Docker

34:11.640 --> 34:15.520
socket and suddenly your castle comes crashing down.

34:15.520 --> 34:20.640
Congratulations Neil, you are the winner of the first Unplugged Hacker Games.

34:20.640 --> 34:25.480
I also have been thinking about a version we could do where we leave a box running and

34:25.480 --> 34:28.320
then see if somebody can own it that is in the download audience.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.280
So you don't have to be here live for that too.

34:30.280 --> 34:31.280
Oh, IRC update.

34:31.280 --> 34:34.880
Yeah, it looks like someone's got the super secret prize linked.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.040
There you go.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.040
There you go.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.320
So that's two people now.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.320
Good.

34:39.320 --> 34:44.080
I was tempted to do both, but I figured, well, one, it's kind of a pain to copy the file

34:44.080 --> 34:45.200
out.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.760
We got you with laziness.

34:46.760 --> 34:47.760
Yep.

34:47.760 --> 34:52.480
And of course, because this is how it works on the Unplugged program, the super secret

34:52.480 --> 34:55.280
file was an adorable picture of Levi playing in the snow.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.280
It was cool.

34:56.280 --> 34:57.280
I loved it.

34:57.280 --> 34:58.280
With his baby tongue out.

34:58.280 --> 34:59.640
You got a little baby tongue sticking out there in the snow.

34:59.640 --> 35:00.680
You need more of those.

35:00.680 --> 35:01.680
I like Levi.

35:01.680 --> 35:02.680
Levi is, yeah.

35:02.680 --> 35:04.280
I mean, he is the prize.

35:04.280 --> 35:09.640
So put your, okay, yeah, good, Carl, you got, Carl, you got your, all right, great.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.640
Nicely done.

35:10.640 --> 35:11.640
Nicely done.

35:11.640 --> 35:12.640
Carl got in there too.

35:12.640 --> 35:13.640
Ha ha.

35:13.640 --> 35:14.640
Carl, which route did you take to get root?

35:14.640 --> 35:16.200
I did the same thing that Neil did.

35:16.200 --> 35:17.960
I knew that there was a way to do that.

35:17.960 --> 35:22.140
I'd seen it blogged about before, but I couldn't remember the exact flags and it was the volume

35:22.140 --> 35:26.220
mounting the root file system inside the container.

35:26.220 --> 35:27.340
Thor leaves his mark.

35:27.340 --> 35:28.580
Thor was here also.

35:28.580 --> 35:29.580
Very nice.

35:29.580 --> 35:30.580
Nicely done.

35:30.580 --> 35:31.580
I think we'll do this again.

35:31.580 --> 35:32.580
I really enjoyed that.

35:32.580 --> 35:36.600
But next time, next time it won't be a Docker misconfiguration, but it does show you the

35:36.600 --> 35:39.440
importance of things not running as root, doesn't it?

35:39.440 --> 35:40.440
Right.

35:40.440 --> 35:45.320
And also this is why I use Podman because this kind of stuff isn't actually the default

35:45.320 --> 35:46.320
setup.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.320
Right.

35:47.320 --> 35:48.960
That's what stuck with me here is like, you know, honestly, I mean, we probably wouldn't

35:48.960 --> 35:53.200
have used exactly this box, but this is not that far off from just sort of a lazy default

35:53.200 --> 35:54.840
setup of, oh, I just need to run some containers.

35:54.840 --> 35:55.840
I've installed Docker.

35:55.840 --> 35:58.360
I'm setting things up really quickly.

35:58.360 --> 36:02.280
And I mean, the tool we were talking about, Trader, it's able to do this too.

36:02.280 --> 36:05.560
You know, you just have that Docker socket open for it and away it goes.

36:05.560 --> 36:07.240
And Trader is just out there.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.240
Anybody can grab it.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.880
It's not, you don't, you know, you just, she just listened to some silly Linux podcast

36:11.880 --> 36:15.000
and you know about it.

36:15.000 --> 36:21.160
This has been your Unplugged PSA.

36:21.160 --> 36:25.920
Also I want to say thank you to our Unplugged Core contributors at unpluggedcore.com, keeping

36:25.920 --> 36:29.160
the show independent, helping us reduce the ad load needed.

36:29.160 --> 36:33.560
And also when you become a core contributor, you get access to two different feeds, a limited

36:33.560 --> 36:39.320
ad version of the feed, same full production, just no ads, or you get the full raw live

36:39.320 --> 36:43.080
stream, all our screw ups, all the stuff that never makes it into the show, the full pre

36:43.080 --> 36:46.600
and post show that's basically an extra show that never gets released.

36:46.600 --> 36:49.120
All of that is available to our members.

36:49.120 --> 36:54.360
And we do that as a thank you because it really makes a huge difference and we immensely appreciate

36:54.360 --> 36:55.360
it.

36:55.360 --> 36:59.160
And let's do a little bit of feedback before we get out of here because I really ran my

36:59.160 --> 37:01.200
mouth off a lot at the end of the last episode.

37:01.200 --> 37:06.240
But before we get to that, Thor of Norway, I wonder if it's the same Thor, writes in

37:06.240 --> 37:08.880
about Minecraft Bedrock Bridge.

37:08.880 --> 37:13.520
I was recently listening to the segment on Flatpak and the Flatpak packages for Minecraft

37:13.520 --> 37:15.560
Bedrock Edition that I mentioned last week.

37:15.560 --> 37:20.040
He said, I started looking at a main list of differences and capabilities and I came

37:20.040 --> 37:28.040
across a proxy bridge that bridges Minecraft Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Java Edition.

37:28.040 --> 37:32.360
I was linked to this in the Jupiter broadcasting telegram today as well.

37:32.360 --> 37:33.360
It's at geysermc.org.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.360
Geyser MC.

37:34.360 --> 37:35.360
Geyser MC.

37:35.360 --> 37:45.200
And it is a middle layer that allows Bedrock at Java Edition to play with each other.

37:45.200 --> 37:49.560
It does the translations in real time.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.960
That's remarkable.

37:50.960 --> 37:55.840
What an incredible bit of engineering and we'll put a link to it in the show notes because

37:55.840 --> 38:01.480
if you have this drugs like I have, then you know what a big deal this is.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.280
And so thank you for everybody who sent that along.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.400
I will definitely take a look into that.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.520
It also gives me another excuse to spin up a Linode.

38:07.520 --> 38:09.600
So there's that too.

38:09.600 --> 38:10.600
I always like that.

38:10.600 --> 38:11.600
All right.

38:11.600 --> 38:16.160
Well, moving on to our next piece of feedback from Kai asking about audio hardware.

38:16.160 --> 38:20.480
A long time listener, first time caller, I was wondering if you could talk about your

38:20.480 --> 38:23.000
audio hardware setup in the show.

38:23.000 --> 38:28.360
I'm in the process of building a new PC and was looking for a sound card.

38:28.360 --> 38:34.120
It seems that there's no sound card with official vendor support anymore, at least for Linux

38:34.120 --> 38:40.960
and lots of, well, use kernel XYZ and this firmware and well, maybe it works, at least

38:40.960 --> 38:43.040
that's the comments I see on Reddit.

38:43.040 --> 38:45.400
So do you guys have any ideas?

38:45.400 --> 38:46.400
Regards, Kai.

38:46.400 --> 38:51.800
I think it's safe to say that we're everybody on the team is a really big advocate of just

38:51.800 --> 38:56.560
getting a USB audio interface for anything that where audio quality matters.

38:56.560 --> 39:01.880
Yeah, so much so that it's been years and years that I've actually had like an internal

39:01.880 --> 39:02.880
sound card.

39:02.880 --> 39:09.000
Yeah, I use one upstairs on my desktop for my speakers, but I would never capture audio

39:09.000 --> 39:10.240
that way.

39:10.240 --> 39:14.440
And additionally, I have just found it super solid.

39:14.440 --> 39:20.280
The way this has just worked 100% rock solid for me every time is a name brand USB audio

39:20.280 --> 39:21.280
interface.

39:21.280 --> 39:24.240
They can be a wide range of prices.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.960
We have a couple that we like.

39:25.960 --> 39:27.360
Maybe West, you could mention those here a sec.

39:27.360 --> 39:31.840
But what I wanted, the tip I wanted to give you is whichever one you end up getting, you

39:31.840 --> 39:38.240
can go into pulse audio, any of the pulse audio control panels like Poova control and

39:38.240 --> 39:44.280
disable the HDMI audio out, disable the built in, in and out, just disable all of those

39:44.280 --> 39:48.800
and leave the only audio interface enabled that you actually use.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.280
For me, it's USB devices.

39:50.280 --> 39:54.020
And then you're never really going to have any problems with like zoom meetings, picking

39:54.020 --> 39:57.640
the wrong audio interface or an application launching and not playing audio right.

39:57.640 --> 40:01.840
If you disable the sound cards, you don't use improve a control solves the problem.

40:01.840 --> 40:05.400
Yeah, that definitely makes it simpler to sort of disable anything that you don't actually

40:05.400 --> 40:08.160
want to show up to actually be an option.

40:08.160 --> 40:13.440
And probably control sure is pretty handy, even if it's not the not the prettiest.

40:13.440 --> 40:16.800
People are sending broadcast messages on the owned machine.

40:16.800 --> 40:20.600
Do you have any audio interfaces off the top of your head that we recommend besides like

40:20.600 --> 40:24.720
the M audio, you 21 or 22, whatever it is, right?

40:24.720 --> 40:27.720
Yeah, the M audio one, they're not.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.120
It sort of depends on if you like them or not.

40:29.120 --> 40:33.920
But lexicon has some ones like the alpha, I think also the omega line that works just

40:33.920 --> 40:34.920
fine with Linux.

40:34.920 --> 40:39.600
I know there's been some mixed reports on the on the focus right Scarlett's of the newest

40:39.600 --> 40:41.720
Yeah, line maybe which I've not personally tried.

40:41.720 --> 40:45.240
But all their older stuff has always worked really nicely.

40:45.240 --> 40:48.960
That's what I'm talking to you on right now is a two i four, but the two i two works great

40:48.960 --> 40:49.960
too.

40:49.960 --> 40:56.080
So my top tip is get a used two i two or two i four Scarlett perhaps a focus right um,

40:56.080 --> 40:59.120
I have tried the newer ones and I don't I haven't really had any problems but I have

40:59.120 --> 41:02.860
had multiple people tell me that the older ones are slightly better with Linux support.

41:02.860 --> 41:08.160
In general, though USB audio devices just even the cheap crappy little tiny ones you

41:08.160 --> 41:13.960
buy off of Amazon are better, especially on a laptop than the built in audio interface.

41:13.960 --> 41:19.160
There's just a lot of electronics in a small space and it just kind of makes them sucky.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.080
And so that's why we always always break it out.

41:21.080 --> 41:26.240
All right, so let's get into the arch stuff because I had a lot to say in the post show

41:26.240 --> 41:29.080
and Eric writes in this is first of all love the show.

41:29.080 --> 41:32.600
But I wanted to respond to the concern about people making fun of arch users.

41:32.600 --> 41:36.360
I don't like abusing folks for their choice in well, pretty much anything.

41:36.360 --> 41:41.620
But you know, it might help the arch case if so many arch users didn't take to Reddit,

41:41.620 --> 41:43.560
the managerial forms and etc.

41:43.560 --> 41:46.440
And question why people use anything but arch.

41:46.440 --> 41:53.900
It just kind of begs for teasing regards, Eric, he's kind of right like this all I think

41:53.900 --> 41:55.080
started as a Reddit meme.

41:55.080 --> 42:01.800
Yeah, and there are you know, I think it's safe to say arch tracks some strong opinions,

42:01.800 --> 42:06.760
I guess on both sides, but but you know, people who discover it and use it and sort of evangelize

42:06.760 --> 42:12.080
it and I think it is fair to point out that there are times where that's not really appropriate

42:12.080 --> 42:16.420
or where the message isn't appropriately nuanced with clarifications around you know, this

42:16.420 --> 42:20.960
is why it works well for me, but everyone skips that first part and it's more like well,

42:20.960 --> 42:21.960
this is why it's the best.

42:21.960 --> 42:22.960
Indeed, indeed.

42:22.960 --> 42:23.960
All right.

42:23.960 --> 42:27.760
We got one more that kind of gets to the philosophical side of the arch discussion.

42:27.760 --> 42:30.400
Indeed it does from Mr. Ders.

42:30.400 --> 42:35.520
I just had to write in on love 394s after show arch discussion.

42:35.520 --> 42:39.120
I have a degree in computer engineering, so I get computers, but I don't do anything with

42:39.120 --> 42:41.560
Linux as a career.

42:41.560 --> 42:47.860
I've only ever heard about the toxic environment in open source but never experienced it.

42:47.860 --> 42:50.640
Part of that is how I approach life and human human interaction.

42:50.640 --> 42:55.040
But I honestly think the vast majority of the community are honest, kind, hardworking,

42:55.040 --> 42:56.040
real people.

42:56.040 --> 43:00.800
A person's self esteem is often wrapped up in their life's work, their value system choices

43:00.800 --> 43:02.720
and preferences.

43:02.720 --> 43:07.680
It can be difficult to hear that another user doesn't appreciate the same things we do,

43:07.680 --> 43:12.280
especially if we are a creator or contributor.

43:12.280 --> 43:16.880
For example, Neil commented that he had failed with all of his hard work on fedora if it

43:16.880 --> 43:19.920
didn't do what Chris needed it to do.

43:19.920 --> 43:24.880
I do love Neil's commitment to creating better and better software, but he is far from a

43:24.880 --> 43:25.880
failure.

43:25.880 --> 43:29.960
We only fail when we fail to appreciate the wonderful diversity and how open source tools

43:29.960 --> 43:36.160
can be used and everyone's individual rights to choose for whatever reason that is.

43:36.160 --> 43:40.300
For me, I choose PopOS, Ubuntu Server, Arch, Endeavor.

43:40.300 --> 43:42.800
Sometimes it's my perception is the best tool for the job.

43:42.800 --> 43:46.200
Sometimes it just feels good and it looks good and it sounds good.

43:46.200 --> 43:49.800
But at the end of the day, it gets the job done.

43:49.800 --> 43:53.560
There are so many car analogies I could make, but I've already said too much.

43:53.560 --> 43:56.000
Thank you for the show, Mr. Ders.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.680
Good point, Mr. Ders.

43:57.680 --> 44:01.560
And Carl and I were having a conversation in matrix and Neil and I were having a conversation

44:01.560 --> 44:02.800
in matrix after the show.

44:02.800 --> 44:07.680
And kind of what I realized too is part of the factor here is, especially when it comes

44:07.680 --> 44:13.720
to Linux distributions, is how much does community interaction matter to you and what community

44:13.720 --> 44:15.640
does that best for you?

44:15.640 --> 44:20.600
And for me, I realized afterwards, I don't think I have an Arch user form account.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.000
I don't think I've ever posted over there.

44:23.000 --> 44:27.920
I've never tried to submit something to an Arch maintainer for fixing.

44:27.920 --> 44:31.040
I've never done any level of community engagement.

44:31.040 --> 44:34.720
In fact, I think I've even commented to you off air that one of the things I've liked

44:34.720 --> 44:39.720
about Arch is I am 100% ignorant for the most part to any politics going on.

44:39.720 --> 44:43.200
I know there's some from time to time, but I'm mostly ignorant compared to what I know

44:43.200 --> 44:46.200
about what's going on with all the other distributions.

44:46.200 --> 44:48.920
And I kind of find that to be a respite.

44:48.920 --> 44:53.820
But others engage fully with the community and have had a different experience.

44:53.820 --> 44:58.220
And so that has factored into one of many factors of choosing a distribution.

44:58.220 --> 45:04.080
And I think that was probably what was missing from our conversation last week.

45:04.080 --> 45:08.440
Yeah, we all have sort of different experiences and interactions with even if it's the same

45:08.440 --> 45:12.960
organization, the same project, but you can use that, explore that and interact with the

45:12.960 --> 45:15.360
community in totally different ways.

45:15.360 --> 45:21.280
I'm just waiting for WSOS, you know, with the pain command line that's all like customized

45:21.280 --> 45:22.280
and looks really cool.

45:22.280 --> 45:26.040
And the pain window manager, the pain programming language.

45:26.040 --> 45:27.680
Then you're just going to come to me for support.

45:27.680 --> 45:30.440
I don't want that.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.840
You can find our sponsor Cloud Guru on social media.

45:32.840 --> 45:36.680
They're at just slash a cloud guru just about everywhere online, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube.

45:36.680 --> 45:39.020
It's just slash a cloud guru.

45:39.020 --> 45:42.720
If you do the Twitter thing, you can follow this here show for announcements at Linux

45:42.720 --> 45:43.720
Unplugged.

45:43.720 --> 45:47.040
The network for all kinds of news is at Jupiter Signal.

45:47.040 --> 45:48.560
And of course, I'm at Chris Last.

45:48.560 --> 45:50.720
Wes, I think you got a Twitter account, too.

45:50.720 --> 45:51.840
At Wes Payne.

45:51.840 --> 45:52.840
Look at that.

45:52.840 --> 45:53.840
That's so easy.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.820
It's actually simpler than what mine is.

45:55.820 --> 45:56.960
It's just my name.

45:56.960 --> 45:58.940
Yeah, that's a lot easier.

45:58.940 --> 46:05.280
The entire Jupiter Broadcasting Network of shows, fantastic shows, the best shows, JupiterBroadcasting.com.

46:05.280 --> 46:08.760
And if you work in the tech industry, don't miss Linux Action News.

46:08.760 --> 46:13.360
Every Monday morning, Wes and I break down everything that matters in the world of Linux.

46:13.360 --> 46:14.400
You're not going to want to miss that.

46:14.400 --> 46:15.400
LinuxActionNews.com.

46:15.400 --> 46:18.120
See you next week.

46:18.120 --> 46:20.760
Same bat time, same bat station.

46:20.760 --> 46:22.360
And do keep the Linux rolling.

46:22.360 --> 46:26.480
Tuesdays, join us live, 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

46:26.480 --> 46:28.280
That's a heck of a lot of Linux.

46:28.280 --> 46:30.300
But is it enough Linux?

46:30.300 --> 46:31.920
Only you can determine that.

46:31.920 --> 46:36.240
Links to everything we talked about today and how to contact us, the Mumble server info,

46:36.240 --> 46:40.920
our Matrix server info, all of it, all of it, LinuxUnplugged.com.

46:40.920 --> 46:42.960
It's that simple.

46:42.960 --> 46:44.920
People are still owning our box right now.

46:44.920 --> 46:47.320
I'm seeing the messages come in.

46:47.320 --> 46:48.320
Oh, man.

46:48.320 --> 46:49.320
The poor little machine.

46:49.320 --> 46:50.320
Deviants.

46:50.320 --> 46:54.440
All right, everyone, thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode of the Unplugged

46:54.440 --> 46:57.080
program as we build towards 400.

46:57.080 --> 47:24.760
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

47:27.080 --> 47:42.240
JBtitles.com, everybody go boat.

47:42.240 --> 47:47.840
I think our Rust application server has turned into a chat server for everyone who has owned

47:47.840 --> 47:48.840
it.

47:48.840 --> 47:51.200
They're just chatting back and forth using broadcast now.

47:51.200 --> 47:52.760
It's our own JB intranet.

47:52.760 --> 47:54.680
Yeah, really, it is.

47:54.680 --> 47:55.680
Look at all these people.

47:55.680 --> 47:56.960
So how many people are now logged into it?

47:56.960 --> 48:01.360
Okay, we've got 11 users currently active, a little bit less than during the show.

48:01.360 --> 48:03.040
I just killed a lot of sessions.

48:03.040 --> 48:04.040
Oh, did you?

48:04.040 --> 48:05.040
Thank you very much.

48:05.040 --> 48:06.040
He yanked everyone.

48:06.040 --> 48:10.040
Yeah, he has thrown me out, but I'm back in now.

48:10.040 --> 48:15.200
So there was 20 people by the time he yanked everything, and I'm not counting the four

48:15.200 --> 48:17.880
separate sessions I was running multiplex through Docker.

48:17.880 --> 48:18.880
Oh, good.

48:18.880 --> 48:22.720
I think the next one we'll try to do something that runs overnight or for a couple of days

48:22.720 --> 48:24.960
to give people a couple of chances.

48:24.960 --> 48:25.960
I think this is so much fun.

48:25.960 --> 48:28.600
All right, we'll do it even bigger and better next time.

48:28.600 --> 48:29.600
It was fun.

48:29.600 --> 48:56.720
Look, Chris, you're bad at security.
