WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.760
Do you guys see that Google is going to be shipping, it looks almost all but confirmed

00:04.760 --> 00:12.000
right now, that Google is going to offer a Google Home Mini October 19th for $50.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.720
At least it'll be on pre-order October 19th.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.280
So this is like to compete with the Echo Dot.

00:17.280 --> 00:22.720
So they're really pushing into this home cheapo automation stuff.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.720
I think that's interesting.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.200
It is interesting tech.

00:26.200 --> 00:32.320
I mean, the thing is, of course, it sends everything you do to Google and, well, yeah.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.720
Yeah, I'm not sure which company I trust more.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.760
You know, isn't that a horrible position to be in just to begin with?

00:38.760 --> 00:40.880
Like that position itself is just awful.

00:40.880 --> 00:44.040
Yeah, to have everything you mean being Google.

00:44.040 --> 00:48.640
Yeah, and or even just having to pick between the worst evil.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.000
Which evil do I want to utilize?

00:51.000 --> 00:54.040
Do I want to utilize the evil that wants to track and sell ads?

00:54.040 --> 00:55.040
Or do I want to utilize-

00:55.040 --> 00:56.040
It's like the past election cycle.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.040
Right.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.040
Yeah, it is.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.840
Or do I want to utilize the evil that wants to put a Walmart in my house?

01:01.840 --> 01:04.640
Which one do I want to go with?

01:04.640 --> 01:05.640
It's kind of awful.

01:05.640 --> 01:10.700
Yeah, I mean, even if these companies don't necessarily do or want to do something evil

01:10.700 --> 01:15.660
at the moment, first of all, they can inadvertently do something evil.

01:15.660 --> 01:19.880
You know, like with Facebook, the effect it can have on elections is massive, even if

01:19.880 --> 01:20.880
they don't try to.

01:20.880 --> 01:21.880
Right.

01:21.880 --> 01:24.840
Well, and also it's sort of like the universe is constantly expanding.

01:24.840 --> 01:27.800
The need for profit is constantly expanding.

01:27.800 --> 01:32.720
And when you've extinguished all your existing paths to revenue, you're going to have to

01:32.720 --> 01:33.720
take it.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.640
You almost legally have to take advantage of other paths to revenue.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.640
Absolutely.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.640
That's the other thing, right?

01:38.640 --> 01:39.640
I mean, there's this constant pressure.

01:39.640 --> 01:40.640
I mean, it's the same with Apple.

01:40.640 --> 01:47.740
They're now doing a huge amount of good stuff when it comes to security and privacy and

01:47.740 --> 01:48.740
all this stuff.

01:48.740 --> 01:52.800
But you have to realize there's a constant pressure on them to increase their profits.

01:52.800 --> 01:57.720
And if they can't keep selling more expensive iPhones, I mean, at the moment, the maximum

01:57.720 --> 02:01.160
doesn't seem in sight, but there will be a day that it will cost more than a car.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.160
Yeah.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.160
Yeah.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.160
You know, they're just going to start selling cars.

02:04.160 --> 02:06.160
They're going to have to look for another business model.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.160
Yeah.

02:07.160 --> 02:08.160
$10,000 iPhone.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.160
Yeah.

02:09.160 --> 02:14.480
The Daily Mail actually did an article today, 10 cars you could buy instead of an iPhone

02:14.480 --> 02:15.480
10.

02:15.480 --> 02:16.480
No kidding.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.480
Right.

02:17.480 --> 02:18.480
Yeah.

02:18.480 --> 02:19.480
Yeah.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.760
Let's yeah, let's not kid that is getting it is they are literally getting to the cost.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.440
These are really getting to the cost of a, you know, a used car.

02:25.440 --> 02:28.020
That is really something, isn't it?

02:28.020 --> 02:31.920
And you know, so you have, you have Apple that's kind of getting into this space with

02:31.920 --> 02:36.620
their HomePod in December, and that'll be interesting to see what it can do if it does

02:36.620 --> 02:39.360
the base minimums and what it reports home.

02:39.360 --> 02:44.840
And they appear to be doing a lot of investment in on box hardware, like in the HomePod, they

02:44.840 --> 02:50.200
have an A8 Apple CPU to do a lot of local thinking instead of shunting it off to the

02:50.200 --> 02:51.260
cloud.

02:51.260 --> 02:52.960
Maybe that'll make it a more competitive product.

02:52.960 --> 02:58.940
But right now, like Eric was just saying, you know, it really to me feels like I'm always

02:58.940 --> 03:03.060
constantly picking between the worst evil, either it's, it's iOS or Android, or it's

03:03.060 --> 03:09.560
Google Assistant or the Echo, it's, it's just all these different compromises in technology

03:09.560 --> 03:11.480
now.

03:11.480 --> 03:28.080
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 217 for October 3rd, 2017.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.960
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that still smells a little bit like

03:31.960 --> 03:32.960
New York.

03:32.960 --> 03:33.960
My name is Chris.

03:33.960 --> 03:34.960
My name is Wes.

03:34.960 --> 03:35.960
Hello, Wes.

03:35.960 --> 03:36.960
The beard's out today.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.220
I think he's trying to build a Gen 2 box.

03:38.220 --> 03:39.220
Is that right?

03:39.220 --> 03:40.220
He would be.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.220
That beard.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.220
He's building the Gen 2.

03:42.220 --> 03:43.220
I'm inspired.

03:43.220 --> 03:45.880
You know, Wes, that's okay though, because even without the beard, somehow we are going

03:45.880 --> 03:47.920
to manage to have a great show this week.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.160
Very excited to be back.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.920
I've brought with me all of the secrets from Canonical.

03:51.920 --> 03:52.920
You look excited, Shipper.

03:52.920 --> 03:53.920
I am.

03:53.920 --> 03:54.920
You're talking quick.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.920
You're right.

03:55.920 --> 03:56.920
I think you're stoked for some Linux.

03:56.920 --> 03:57.920
I am fired up.

03:57.920 --> 03:58.920
You're right.

03:58.920 --> 03:59.920
I am very fired up about this.

03:59.920 --> 04:04.040
I had a great time in New York, had a great time at the Ubuntu rally.

04:04.040 --> 04:09.160
And I set out to really figure out how a company like Canonical actually gets work done.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.360
And I walked away with some real insights.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.360
So we'll talk about those.

04:11.360 --> 04:13.680
Got a couple of interviews we're going to play on the show.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.320
Plus, we got some community news.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.600
One story in particular that I'm so excited about, I almost want to do it twice in the

04:19.600 --> 04:20.600
show.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.200
So we're not going to, but I almost want to.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.200
I'm on guard for that now.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.200
You watch out.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.200
I think it's going to be big.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.840
Not only good, but also bad.

04:26.840 --> 04:30.480
So it's one of those shows where it's really got a lot of stuff.

04:30.480 --> 04:36.060
Plus, later on in the show, Frank and Yos from Nextcloud are going to join us and talk

04:36.060 --> 04:41.760
about the new client-side end-to-end encryption that they're rolling into Nextcloud.

04:41.760 --> 04:42.760
Exciting stuff.

04:42.760 --> 04:46.680
They're doing it in a unique way that totally avoids browser compromises.

04:46.680 --> 04:51.440
And unlike some other projects, they're doing it with a bit of humble pie.

04:51.440 --> 04:52.440
So we'll tell you about that.

04:52.440 --> 04:57.520
Plus, our friends over at Canonical, Opie, has launched the Ubuntu Community Hub.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.200
And we'll talk a little bit about that.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.900
So much stuff to get into, plus another Linux event that's just around the corner.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.640
We can't go any further without saying hello to the virtual lug.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.120
Time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.920
Time, you whiny.

05:09.920 --> 05:10.920
Hello.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.480
Hello, guys.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.960
So I don't have it for you today.

05:16.960 --> 05:21.560
But I think next week, I think, I'm thinking about it.

05:21.560 --> 05:22.760
I want to make sure I'm ready.

05:22.760 --> 05:28.080
But I think next week, I'm going to review the Librem 15, the new Librem 15.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.720
So I haven't talked a lot about it on the show.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.600
I'm not sure how much I've said.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.680
But you guys are probably, if you've listened to the show for a while, familiar with my

05:34.680 --> 05:36.840
history with purism.

05:36.840 --> 05:45.600
And I crowdfunded one of their first laptops, literally their first laptop, and was underwhelmed

05:45.600 --> 05:46.600
in the results.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.520
Actually, though, in full disclosure, still using it today as a production machine.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.560
So how bad can it actually be?

05:52.560 --> 05:56.540
But you know, predominantly, I had issues with the fan.

05:56.540 --> 05:59.440
And I kind of gave it a mixed review.

05:59.440 --> 06:04.320
And over the last, I don't know, what has it been, two years, purism has decided to

06:04.320 --> 06:09.640
make good on the original machine and has shipped me, and I'm going to swap, I'm going

06:09.640 --> 06:18.860
to send back the old one, a brand new Librem 15, latest and greatest Librem 15 from purism.

06:18.860 --> 06:22.400
And I decided to put it to the ultimate test.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.680
And I took it with me.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.800
It was the machine I took to the Ubuntu rally.

06:25.800 --> 06:26.800
Is that right?

06:26.800 --> 06:30.160
I've spent a lot of time with this machine on the road.

06:30.160 --> 06:33.220
And so next week on the show, I'm going to try to give that a full review.

06:33.220 --> 06:36.520
But this week, we have to talk about the Ubuntu rally, and we have to get into some community

06:36.520 --> 06:38.220
news first.

06:38.220 --> 06:42.880
There's a story that I'm equally excited and equally freaked out about.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.180
And I think it's going to be great for people in production.

06:45.180 --> 06:47.080
I think it's going to be great for Android handsets.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.520
I think it's going to be great for lazy system on a chip users.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.820
It's going to be horrible for people that want new drivers.

06:51.820 --> 06:56.560
But Linux is about to get an extended support version of the kernel like we've never seen

06:56.560 --> 06:57.560
before.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.280
So you're familiar with things like Ubuntu LTS and Red Hat Enterprise Server.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.440
But one of the things you might not really think about is one of the things that one

07:03.440 --> 07:08.500
of the real values that these enterprise and LTS distributions is offering is a kernel

07:08.500 --> 07:10.960
that doesn't change that they backport all the shit to.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.780
All the stuff that breaks, all the vulnerabilities.

07:13.780 --> 07:15.380
Some companies call it hardware enablement.

07:15.380 --> 07:17.080
There's different names for it.

07:17.080 --> 07:20.620
But all these things that you push back into an older version of the kernel to kind of

07:20.620 --> 07:22.840
make it look like a new version of the kernel.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.840
And your cynical host here has often called this a fork of Linux.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.800
These distributions are a fork.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.560
They don't ship mainstream upstream Linux.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.520
They fork it and they run their own patches against it and you're running their fork of

07:33.520 --> 07:34.520
Linux.

07:34.520 --> 07:39.600
Red Hat Enterprise Linux is their version of Linux because there is no long term support

07:39.600 --> 07:40.600
kernel.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.360
As hard as Greg K.H. has worked over the years, the longest support we have for a Linux kernel

07:44.360 --> 07:45.840
has been two years.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.360
That's changing now.

07:48.360 --> 07:53.480
Linux's LTS release will now be maintained for six years.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.480
That's a huge jump.

07:54.480 --> 07:55.760
That's a long time.

07:55.760 --> 07:59.720
Greg K.H. will still be maintaining the releases beginning with kernel 4.4.

07:59.720 --> 08:03.280
The LTS cycle is going to be extended for six years.

08:03.280 --> 08:07.800
Now that's big because a lot of project treble devices are using kernel 4.4.

08:07.800 --> 08:12.840
Kernel 4.14 is the next LTS release currently being worked on that would then be supported

08:12.840 --> 08:13.840
until 2023.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.600
That is a long time.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.840
Maybe shipped maybe in time for 18.04.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.600
Wouldn't that be interesting?

08:22.600 --> 08:28.080
Now the downside of course is system on a chip vendors could now focus exclusively on

08:28.080 --> 08:33.720
LTS releases and say screw you newer releases and that would suck because waiting around

08:33.720 --> 08:37.840
until after 2023 to get new versions of the drivers would really be a pain in my arse.

08:37.840 --> 08:43.400
But overall, I picture running here in the studio, being able to run off the same kernel

08:43.400 --> 08:44.800
for six years.

08:44.800 --> 08:51.000
What that functionally gets us is a real targetable, stable set of APIs for hardware manufacturers.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.640
So your black magics, your hodgepodge and all of your reds, all of the other people

08:55.640 --> 08:59.800
that are making camera hardware that has to talk to a host operating system are going

08:59.800 --> 09:02.920
to be in a better position if there's something they can target that stays stable for six

09:02.920 --> 09:03.920
years.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.120
That's about as good as you're ever going to get on Windows and way better than you

09:06.120 --> 09:07.120
get on the Mac.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.440
You mean you won't have to install Ubuntu 10 just to get your drivers to work?

09:10.440 --> 09:12.320
Yeah, just to get your capture card to work.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.320
Which is a thing.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.320
It sure is a thing.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.480
Yeah, and I like this.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.080
I think it's going to be good overall.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.080
It's an interesting...

09:19.080 --> 09:21.160
It seems to be a coming together.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.880
There's maybe an acknowledgement that this sort of thing is happening anyway.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.160
So maybe if we make it official, it'll be better.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.160
I'm on the fence.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.160
I see what you're saying.

09:28.160 --> 09:29.160
I really do like that.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.160
It's good to have official support.

09:30.160 --> 09:31.400
It's good to have long, stable things.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.880
Linux is great for that.

09:32.880 --> 09:38.640
But like your little snip earlier, lazy sys admins, I'm dealing with a lot of that in

09:38.640 --> 09:40.360
my non-show life right now.

09:40.360 --> 09:46.320
So it's another reason for people not to build...Change is hard, it sucks, updates, things break.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.760
But unless you build that into your workflow and your day-to-day and have plans for it...

09:50.760 --> 09:53.580
And maybe if that plan is every six years, we will actually move.

09:53.580 --> 09:55.240
And if that's viable, great.

09:55.240 --> 09:58.720
But if it's just another excuse to be surprised in six years when, oh no, we have to get a

09:58.720 --> 09:59.720
new kernel again.

09:59.720 --> 10:03.340
But because you haven't been practicing it every two years, it's a lot harder.

10:03.340 --> 10:09.820
So I guess I should probably say, what's really forced this change, this huge commitment change,

10:09.820 --> 10:14.200
think about what two years versus six years is in the world of Linux.

10:14.200 --> 10:18.000
I mean, damn, Greg, if you need a beer, let me know, because you're going to need several.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.280
Are we even going to be running Linux in six years?

10:20.280 --> 10:21.280
I don't know.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.720
You know what's pushing this, right?

10:22.720 --> 10:24.120
It's Project Treble from Googs.

10:24.120 --> 10:25.160
It's Googs.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.160
This is for Googs.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.640
I mean, this is for everybody.

10:27.640 --> 10:28.640
But it's for Googs.

10:28.640 --> 10:32.200
Does that mean they won't run away and start running Fuchsia?

10:32.200 --> 10:35.320
I hadn't even thought of that.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.320
Is that what this is about?

10:36.320 --> 10:37.320
I don't know.

10:37.320 --> 10:38.320
It might be a factor, though.

10:38.320 --> 10:42.400
Is this to prevent, because Googs is going to do what Googs wants to do.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.400
That's just what they do.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.400
Yeah.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.280
And Greg's clever enough to say, all right, if this is what it takes to keep one of our

10:46.280 --> 10:50.120
biggest customers, hmm.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.120
I like that.

10:51.120 --> 10:52.120
You know what, Wes?

10:52.120 --> 10:53.120
That gets me thinking.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.120
That's good conspiracy bacon.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.120
That's what this show is about.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.120
Plot twist.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.120
Yeah.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.120
So that is a bit of a plot twist.

10:58.120 --> 11:01.720
Speaking of plot twists, Fedora 27 is out.

11:01.720 --> 11:02.720
At least the beta.

11:02.720 --> 11:03.720
Oh, wow.

11:03.720 --> 11:04.720
I should have, geez.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.280
Hey, will you just edit that part out where I said it like that?

11:08.280 --> 11:10.680
That's the beta release of Fedora 27.

11:10.680 --> 11:15.320
And there's not a lot to report here other than you're going to get GNOME 3.26, which

11:15.320 --> 11:18.760
means you're going to get the new display changes and the new network configuration

11:18.760 --> 11:22.420
panels as well as the overall settings panel improvements.

11:22.420 --> 11:25.020
But I thought I was curious.

11:25.020 --> 11:33.040
I was watching to see how would the Fedora project, one of the bastions of GNOME 3, how

11:33.040 --> 11:39.300
would they handle GNOME dropping the system tray, which to me feels still like a little

11:39.300 --> 11:40.520
user hostile.

11:40.520 --> 11:45.920
GNOME says they're doing it for users because tray icons take away your control.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.960
But to me, it's like, well, yeah, but I need that control over things like Dropbox and

11:49.960 --> 11:52.920
Skype and, you know, Nextcloud.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.840
So how does Fedora handle this?

11:54.840 --> 11:57.720
Are they going to ship top icons by default?

11:57.720 --> 11:59.560
Are they going to patch GNOME Shell?

11:59.560 --> 12:01.200
Whoops, they're kind of right in the middle.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.200
Yeah.

12:02.200 --> 12:03.760
But we now know.

12:03.760 --> 12:08.840
So the system search now shows more results at once, which is nice.

12:08.840 --> 12:15.720
And also, this is a direct quote, and also the antiquated system tray has been removed

12:15.720 --> 12:18.760
to reduce visual clutter and confusion.

12:18.760 --> 12:23.560
The top icons extension is available for use with any application that have not updated

12:23.560 --> 12:24.560
yet.

12:24.560 --> 12:26.320
Yeah, they basically are.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.200
They're all in on the same thing that GNOME is doing.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.200
Yeah, they are.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.680
What do you think of that?

12:30.680 --> 12:33.040
It's awful, but not surprising in any way whatsoever.

12:33.040 --> 12:36.720
Do you think it's also user hostile, or am I just being a snowflake here?

12:36.720 --> 12:41.360
It's absolutely user hostile in the sense that the entire community, one of the most

12:41.360 --> 12:46.240
popular extensions of GNOME extensions is top icon for the reason why it's one of the

12:46.240 --> 12:47.240
most popular.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.240
Yeah.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.240
Yeah.

12:49.240 --> 12:53.320
So they're like, oh, you know, community, you like this extension, nah, nah, screw it.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.320
No, we're not going to.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.000
We're going to go ahead and remove that.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.040
They're kicking the legacy applications to the curb.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.040
Screw you guys.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.520
That's not even the worst part.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.120
The fact that they're removing the tray is annoying.

13:05.120 --> 13:08.760
It's the fact that they're removing the API, which makes it broken.

13:08.760 --> 13:09.760
Okay.

13:09.760 --> 13:14.320
So the top icons people announced that they're going to deprecate it.

13:14.320 --> 13:18.640
So yes, Fedora, you're right, it is available for now.

13:18.640 --> 13:20.680
But they've also said that it's gone.

13:20.680 --> 13:27.720
So because the GTK 4 API has removed it entirely, top icon just breaks.

13:27.720 --> 13:28.720
Right.

13:28.720 --> 13:33.680
So this is an interesting split in the different implementations we now see of GNOME Shell.

13:33.680 --> 13:38.720
This particular change by GNOME Shell is going to force all the different distro maintainers

13:38.720 --> 13:41.320
that ship GNOME as their default desktop to show their cards.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.400
We already know what 1710 is doing.

13:43.400 --> 13:44.400
What's Antigros going to do?

13:44.400 --> 13:45.400
What's Manjaro going to do?

13:45.400 --> 13:48.600
What's, you know, all these different distributions that ship GNOME by default, what are they

13:48.600 --> 13:49.600
going to do?

13:49.600 --> 13:51.260
They're all going to have to share their, they're all going to have to put their cards

13:51.260 --> 13:55.420
on the table and show, are they going to switch over to shipping an extension installed

13:55.420 --> 13:56.420
by default?

13:56.420 --> 14:00.440
Are they going to ship mainstream GNOME without this critical user functionality feature?

14:00.440 --> 14:03.880
I find this to be a fascinating little rift that's developing here.

14:03.880 --> 14:06.360
And now we see where Fedora falls on this line.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.920
So keep your eyes out for more details on that release soon.

14:09.920 --> 14:14.900
It's interesting to see, like, how do we handle breaking or non-breaking changes?

14:14.900 --> 14:18.220
And I get, like, you know, I'm sure they're limited by having to support these old APIs.

14:18.220 --> 14:19.500
How long should that be?

14:19.500 --> 14:24.440
How do we deal with legacy apps that won't be motivated to adopt Linux mainstream?

14:24.440 --> 14:26.400
Or when is Linux mainstream changing too fast?

14:26.400 --> 14:27.400
I don't know.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.400
When has GNOME ever cared about?

14:28.400 --> 14:29.400
That's exactly what I was thinking.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.400
That's exactly what I was thinking.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.520
You know, you've got Skype, you've got Dropbox.

14:32.520 --> 14:33.800
Are they going to care?

14:33.800 --> 14:39.960
Well, even if they care, these are companies that can take a year or more to shift directions

14:39.960 --> 14:40.960
and support new things.

14:40.960 --> 14:45.720
I mean, so, producer Michael, what I'm worried about here is, and I've said this before,

14:45.720 --> 14:48.680
but it's not that it's a bad idea in totality.

14:48.680 --> 14:54.600
What it is, is that it is an idea that is based on idealism, like, as if they can set

14:54.600 --> 14:57.200
the direction of desktop application development.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.200
Do you agree?

14:58.200 --> 14:59.200
I agree.

14:59.200 --> 15:00.200
That's what they think, yeah.

15:00.200 --> 15:04.840
It's the main thing is that if you look at all environments, you know, even there's an

15:04.840 --> 15:08.680
implementation for Mac, and there definitely is for Windows, but so these companies are

15:08.680 --> 15:13.620
making it so that they feel like it's the same experience throughout, so that system

15:13.620 --> 15:17.120
tray icons is something that they're used to and people are used to.

15:17.120 --> 15:22.680
So while it's maybe not an ideal solution in their opinion, it's still the norm and

15:22.680 --> 15:24.440
it's still what people expect to exist.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.440
If you look...

15:25.440 --> 15:26.760
So they just remove it because they want to.

15:26.760 --> 15:32.000
So I think if you look at the Mac, the Mac would be an example of a platform that will

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
often do this.

15:33.000 --> 15:38.600
They'll try to force application developers to support certain features, but even one

15:38.600 --> 15:43.400
of the compromises on a Mac, if you look at any power user, Mac power users desktop, they've

15:43.400 --> 15:46.880
got tons of icons up in that menu bar.

15:46.880 --> 15:52.440
They've got drop boxes up there, there's tons of applications up there.

15:52.440 --> 15:56.640
So the Mac has the same problem and even Apple can't get away from this.

15:56.640 --> 16:03.300
So I find it interesting using the word legacy, which basically means obsolete, right?

16:03.300 --> 16:07.640
If you're using the word obsolete, I'm looking at my area in the top right hand corner of

16:07.640 --> 16:14.680
my screen and I'm seeing Telegram, Wire, Discord, Steam, Dropbox.

16:14.680 --> 16:21.040
Which of those are obsolete and who decided, who became king of the desktop and decided

16:21.040 --> 16:22.040
those were obsolete?

16:22.040 --> 16:26.720
Because those are all current applications that I can install right now, latest bleeding

16:26.720 --> 16:32.480
edge versions, and they all have icons in that area and I value them having them.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.480
Yeah, but that's almost different.

16:33.480 --> 16:38.640
I mean, you say that, but it's somewhat pointed in that like, I agree with your point, but

16:38.640 --> 16:40.520
they could still all be using a legacy API.

16:40.520 --> 16:45.520
I'm not saying that the judgment of legacy is correct, but them being up to date doesn't

16:45.520 --> 16:46.520
matter at all to this discussion.

16:46.520 --> 16:47.520
I think that's what it is.

16:47.520 --> 16:52.220
Bear in mind that Linux users are a niche already and people who use the GNOME desktop

16:52.220 --> 16:54.680
are a niche within that niche.

16:54.680 --> 17:01.920
So throw your weight around to say that everyone else who's outside of this bubble is a legacy

17:01.920 --> 17:08.760
product is ludicrously arrogant in my mind because the fact remains, all these developers

17:08.760 --> 17:13.720
have to go around changing all this stuff because a niche of a niche want them to, and

17:13.720 --> 17:16.360
I think that's just pushing it a bit too far.

17:16.360 --> 17:17.720
I couldn't say it better myself.

17:17.720 --> 17:18.720
It's certainly bad politics.

17:18.720 --> 17:23.560
As somebody who likes the GNOME desktop, I couldn't say it better myself, well put.

17:23.560 --> 17:27.120
That's I think, okay, so that's our thoughts on it and I'm curious to see where it goes

17:27.120 --> 17:32.500
and I will also, if it seems that application developers take note and they begin updating

17:32.500 --> 17:36.640
their applications to support the new APIs, I will be the first person here reporting

17:36.640 --> 17:37.640
it.

17:37.640 --> 17:42.200
I'm going to keep you updated, but I completely agree with Poby's assessment and producer

17:42.200 --> 17:43.200
Michael's assessment.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.600
I want to take a moment.

17:44.600 --> 17:47.880
I just got back from New York, but I can't stay still.

17:47.880 --> 17:54.800
This Friday, October 6th and 7th, I'm going to be at Seagull with Mr. West.

17:54.800 --> 17:55.800
That's right.

17:55.800 --> 17:56.800
And Ang.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.640
Ang is going to go too and Seagull is sort of a grassroots tech conference.

18:00.640 --> 18:05.160
It's a GNU slash Linux conference that respects your privacy and we're going to do a meetup

18:05.160 --> 18:06.160
there.

18:06.160 --> 18:11.120
So just go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for this Friday and we'll be there rocking

18:11.120 --> 18:12.120
it out.

18:12.120 --> 18:16.120
I'm giving a talk there, so it'll be fun for everyone.

18:16.120 --> 18:17.120
Did I know that?

18:17.120 --> 18:21.440
I mean, I did legitimately forget a few things about this, but did you tell me that and I

18:21.440 --> 18:22.440
forgot?

18:22.440 --> 18:23.440
I swear I did.

18:23.440 --> 18:24.440
It was a while ago.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.960
I think it was way back when it was first accepted, which was ages ago now.

18:25.960 --> 18:26.960
Wow.

18:26.960 --> 18:27.960
Yeah.

18:27.960 --> 18:28.960
Okay.

18:28.960 --> 18:29.960
That kind of rings a bell.

18:29.960 --> 18:30.960
What are you giving a talk about?

18:30.960 --> 18:35.600
I'm giving a talk about my dear friend Clojure, actually Clojure script and maybe why Linux

18:35.600 --> 18:38.040
admins might find it a great way to write shell scripts.

18:38.040 --> 18:39.040
So you maniac.

18:39.040 --> 18:40.040
What day is that?

18:40.040 --> 18:41.040
That's on Friday.

18:41.040 --> 18:42.040
Okay.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.040
That's the day I'm going to be there.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.040
I'm going to be there on Friday.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.040
Oh yeah.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.040
Clojure.

18:46.040 --> 18:47.040
Oh yeah.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.040
Right here.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.040
There you are.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.040
Room 3179 by Mr. Westpain.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.040
Look at you.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.040
That's right.

18:52.040 --> 18:53.040
Look at you.

18:53.040 --> 18:54.040
So if you want to see me there and of course I'll be hanging out all day.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.040
So yeah.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.040
Love to see you JB people in attendance.

18:56.040 --> 18:57.040
Yeah.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.040
That would be awesome.

18:58.040 --> 18:59.360
And we will be doing some interviews and we'll play.

18:59.360 --> 19:00.980
Seagull is new-ish.

19:00.980 --> 19:02.480
It's been going around for a few years.

19:02.480 --> 19:06.160
Eric, didn't you go like three years ago or something like that to Seagull?

19:06.160 --> 19:07.160
Oh gosh.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.160
Yeah.

19:08.160 --> 19:09.160
It had to be a good three years ago.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.160
Yeah.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.160
So we've been dabbling.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.160
I should have been last.

19:12.160 --> 19:13.160
Yeah.

19:13.160 --> 19:15.720
And so ever since, you know, we started really when Eric was like, okay, we got to start

19:15.720 --> 19:16.920
covering this.

19:16.920 --> 19:20.240
But the timing is constantly in conflict with other events.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.000
And so this year we're going to try to make an effort to go down there.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.360
And it's October 6th if you want to go there when we're going to be there.

19:26.360 --> 19:31.140
And Wes's talk, Mr. Wes's talk looks like it begins at 1045 Pacific time if you want

19:31.140 --> 19:33.680
to catch that in room 3179.

19:33.680 --> 19:34.680
How about that?

19:34.680 --> 19:35.680
That's right.

19:35.680 --> 19:36.760
I got the address in the show notes too.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.760
And we got the meetup page, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting.

19:39.760 --> 19:42.160
If you want to get it, if you look at that, we already got a few people going.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.160
Heck yes.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.160
That's awesome.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.160
Well, that'll be really cool.

19:45.160 --> 19:48.200
So Seagull, I've never been, but I'm curious about it.

19:48.200 --> 19:50.560
And what made you decide to give a talk?

19:50.560 --> 19:51.560
We were hanging out with them.

19:51.560 --> 19:55.000
They, some of the people who put it on at Linux Fest, and they're just talking it up

19:55.000 --> 19:56.920
that they're trying to get a broader range.

19:56.920 --> 20:01.360
So Linux is definitely there, but they wanted topics about general programming, DevOps,

20:01.360 --> 20:02.360
cloud, automation.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.840
I noticed your talk is not for Linux.

20:04.840 --> 20:06.440
It's closure for Unix hackers.

20:06.440 --> 20:07.440
Yeah.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.440
Well, I mean, I wanted to be inclusive.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.800
Wait, you think Node Run's on lots of platforms?

20:10.800 --> 20:12.320
You think Alan Jude's going to this thing?

20:12.320 --> 20:14.040
Well, you know, I mean, I wish.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.800
I should have sent him an invitation, I suppose.

20:16.800 --> 20:17.800
You know, that guy just got a MacBook.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.800
I saw that on Twitter.

20:18.800 --> 20:19.800
Is that right?

20:19.800 --> 20:20.800
Yeah.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.920
You should include, yeah, you do need to have a big umbrella because you've got to include

20:22.920 --> 20:23.920
him.

20:23.920 --> 20:28.840
So if you want to go, it's seagull.org, and you can find out more information on our show

20:28.840 --> 20:32.840
notes and meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting to go to that.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.800
I think just Friday for me, I think, is what we're going to do.

20:35.800 --> 20:36.800
We'll probably go during midday.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.800
That makes sense.

20:37.800 --> 20:38.800
I think it starts at like 9 a.m.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.800
Yeah, I think so.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.400
There's a lot of events going on.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.720
It's that season, I guess.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.400
Yeah, and we've got to get to the Ubuntu Rally stuff.

20:45.400 --> 20:49.960
I just have a couple of more community news items I just want to mention briefly.

20:49.960 --> 20:59.840
There's one story that, actually, let's see if the Discord chat room can guess what story

20:59.840 --> 21:01.640
I'm about to talk about next.

21:01.640 --> 21:08.320
There is one story in open source news that never dies, and I'll give you a hint.

21:08.320 --> 21:13.600
It is they're running Linux, and they're going to switch away from Linux, and then they're

21:13.600 --> 21:17.160
going to run Linux again, and then they're going to switch away from Linux again.

21:17.160 --> 21:22.400
If you can guess what story I'm about to talk about in the Discord room, you get, I don't

21:22.400 --> 21:23.840
know, five internet points for the day.

21:23.840 --> 21:28.160
But first, I'll mention Linux Academy, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

21:28.160 --> 21:31.860
It's a platform to learn more about Linux and get critical thinking and troubleshooting

21:31.860 --> 21:35.260
on Linux, too, which is, I think, incredibly valuable, and it's a great way to learn new

21:35.260 --> 21:36.800
skills and advance your career.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.920
It's really a platform for all of that.

21:38.920 --> 21:43.320
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged is where you go to support the show.

21:43.320 --> 21:44.520
You're smart enough to guess how that works.

21:44.520 --> 21:48.880
They track the fact that you went to that website, so they know that it's worth spending

21:48.880 --> 21:49.880
money here.

21:49.880 --> 21:52.040
But also, you can sign up for a free seven-day trial.

21:52.040 --> 21:53.040
Everybody wins!

21:53.040 --> 21:55.040
It's funny how that works.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.920
We don't have to track all of the things.

21:57.920 --> 22:00.240
We don't have to have deep metrics about your usage.

22:00.240 --> 22:05.080
You just go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and this show stays on the air, and you get

22:05.080 --> 22:08.880
a seven-day free trial for a platform that gives you self-paced, in-depth video courses

22:08.880 --> 22:13.520
on every freaking Linux and cloud and gosh-darn DevOps topic out there.

22:13.520 --> 22:16.760
I mean, hoo-wee, Wes, hoo-wee, Wes, hoo-wee.

22:16.760 --> 22:20.400
Also, hands-on, scenario-based labs that give you real experiences on real servers.

22:20.400 --> 22:24.040
You get to SSHN to a virtual server that they'll spin up on demand.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.840
But what if I only know Ubuntu?

22:25.840 --> 22:27.520
I really need to learn some Red Hat.

22:27.520 --> 22:28.520
Do they have that?

22:28.520 --> 22:29.520
Can they do that there?

22:29.520 --> 22:30.520
You know what, Wes?

22:30.520 --> 22:31.520
I got great news for you, Wes.

22:31.520 --> 22:34.760
You just choose the distribution, and kapow, all of the courseware and them virtual machines

22:34.760 --> 22:37.080
automatically switch over to match that choice.

22:37.080 --> 22:38.080
Boom.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.080
Boom, Wes.

22:39.080 --> 22:40.080
They also have learning paths.

22:40.080 --> 22:44.000
If you just want a series of courses and content that's been planned by their instructors for

22:44.000 --> 22:45.840
like a specific track, they got that.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.560
If you're going for certs, they got training for that.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.260
They got practice exams.

22:49.260 --> 22:52.360
They have all kinds of different planning and scheduling systems.

22:52.360 --> 22:58.120
If you're busy, maybe you own your own business, you've got three kids and you travel often,

22:58.120 --> 22:59.320
it can be hard.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.240
And they've got systems that'll help you plan for that.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.520
They got a community stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.760
They have iOS and Android apps so you can study on the go.

23:06.760 --> 23:11.360
And they have offline lesson audio, notebooks, and tools to help you study, even without

23:11.360 --> 23:12.360
the internet.

23:12.360 --> 23:13.560
I know, without the internet.

23:13.560 --> 23:17.440
Can you believe such a thing even exists, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged?

23:17.440 --> 23:18.440
What a platform.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.360
You're constantly getting new courseware.

23:20.360 --> 23:24.480
They're retrofitting old courseware, instructor mentoring, actual human beings are available

23:24.480 --> 23:25.480
whenever you need it.

23:25.480 --> 23:29.480
You get value out of that membership, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

23:29.480 --> 23:36.720
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring this year's Linux Unplugged program, linuxacademy.com

23:36.720 --> 23:37.720
slash unplugged.

23:37.720 --> 23:38.960
They're amazing.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.520
So I've got a guess for you.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.880
Patrick, Patrick, quit your quiz there?

23:42.880 --> 23:43.880
Yeah.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.880
I think the answer is the JB Studio.

23:45.880 --> 23:48.880
Oh, did you come up with that on your own?

23:48.880 --> 23:49.880
That's right to the core.

23:49.880 --> 23:50.880
Right to the core.

23:50.880 --> 23:51.880
Oh, you son of a...

23:51.880 --> 23:52.880
No, wait, that's not it.

23:52.880 --> 23:53.880
It's Linux in here.

23:53.880 --> 23:54.880
What am I saying?

23:54.880 --> 23:55.880
Yeah, although I got it.

23:55.880 --> 24:00.120
It's funny you say that because this morning, Gnome 3 was working on the OBS machine except

24:00.120 --> 24:03.080
for I can't move any windows, I can't resize any windows.

24:03.080 --> 24:04.080
Why would you want to do that?

24:04.080 --> 24:08.200
The applications menu won't come up and dash to doc was totally locked up.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.320
Outside of that though, OBS is working great.

24:10.320 --> 24:11.320
Perfect, beautiful.

24:11.320 --> 24:14.840
Yeah, and so I was like, oh shit, why did I switch this to Linux?

24:14.840 --> 24:16.320
No, it's Munich.

24:16.320 --> 24:22.400
It is Munich and the open source pioneer, as Tech Republic calls it.

24:22.400 --> 24:26.080
And something about this story, it just won't die.

24:26.080 --> 24:29.400
I honestly feel like I've been covering this story for 10 years.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.400
Yeah.

24:30.400 --> 24:31.400
Pretty much.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.400
I think I have been.

24:32.400 --> 24:33.400
I think I literally have.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.400
It has been ever since.

24:34.400 --> 24:37.440
Yeah, I just really can't believe I'm still talking about this.

24:37.440 --> 24:42.320
Honestly a little just befuddled by it, but if you look at the situation, it's kind of

24:42.320 --> 24:43.780
obvious it was going to go this way.

24:43.780 --> 24:46.400
Now that we know 10 years later everything we know.

24:46.400 --> 24:50.160
And it's been back and forth, on and off, are they going to switch to Windows, are they

24:50.160 --> 24:51.160
not?

24:51.160 --> 24:53.160
And the final decision isn't actually even made yet.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.880
It's not going to be until November this year.

24:55.880 --> 25:02.960
But it does appear to be going not in Linux's favor because the council has already begun

25:02.960 --> 25:03.960
work.

25:03.960 --> 25:04.960
The council.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.480
It sounds like this is something out of a sci-fi movie.

25:06.480 --> 25:12.580
The council has already begun work to switch to freaking Microsoft Exchange.

25:12.580 --> 25:18.220
And they say it with some rather, I don't know, maybe I'm reading too much into this,

25:18.220 --> 25:22.740
but I feel like there's a little bit of spite in this quote that Tech Republic got.

25:22.740 --> 25:23.800
And here's the quote.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.840
The city will use Microsoft Exchange.

25:26.840 --> 25:30.200
It will be used for mail and calendar.

25:30.200 --> 25:34.720
So Colab will not be used anymore.

25:34.720 --> 25:35.720
That's the entire quote.

25:35.720 --> 25:36.720
Oh, ouch.

25:36.720 --> 25:37.720
Yeah.

25:37.720 --> 25:40.280
And so we'll find out what happens with the desktops.

25:40.280 --> 25:45.520
But generally, when you're switching to Exchange and Outlook, it's slightly harder to use Linux.

25:45.520 --> 25:46.520
Yeah, just a bit.

25:46.520 --> 25:51.080
Although, you know, that if you can get by with Office 365, you got the web.

25:51.080 --> 25:55.200
Now we don't really need to worry too much about this because first of all, they rolled

25:55.200 --> 25:56.360
their old Linux distro.

25:56.360 --> 26:02.320
And second of all, we all know that the Windows kingdom is at risk as Apple and Linux operating

26:02.320 --> 26:03.920
systems post record gross.

26:03.920 --> 26:06.680
This is an article from Softpedia News.

26:06.680 --> 26:07.680
And it's-

26:07.680 --> 26:10.440
Why am I, why am I, I got a little tingle going on here.

26:10.440 --> 26:11.440
Something's-

26:11.440 --> 26:12.440
Something's not quite right?

26:12.440 --> 26:13.440
Yeah.

26:13.440 --> 26:14.440
Yeah, well, here's the article.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.880
And I've been seeing this float around all day today, so I thought we'd talk about it

26:16.880 --> 26:17.880
here for a moment.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.880
Windows is currently the leading choice for desktop operating systems, the article says.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.760
Obviously, everybody knows that.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.880
And the cited source says this.

26:24.880 --> 26:26.920
That's literally what the article says.

26:26.920 --> 26:33.120
With no less than 88.88%, 88.88% everybody of the computers across the world are running

26:33.120 --> 26:34.920
that Windows operating system.

26:34.920 --> 26:39.320
Now the Apple Mac, the runner up has 6.29%.

26:39.320 --> 26:48.920
And Linux comes in at a third with 4.83%, only are damn near 5%, everybody.

26:48.920 --> 26:50.680
I have no data to go off of.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.880
But when I hear that the Mac is at 6%, that sounds like bullshit.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.360
And when I hear that Linux is at 4%, that sounds like bullshit.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.560
And I'm not sure which one is exaggerated.

26:58.560 --> 27:02.040
But if you were to go by these numbers, Linux is way up.

27:02.040 --> 27:10.400
It has jumped from 3.37, yes, 3.37%, from last month, or I guess, no, maybe May, I think

27:10.400 --> 27:12.960
that's what it was, to 4.83%.

27:12.960 --> 27:17.140
So the growth is impressive, to say the least.

27:17.140 --> 27:21.040
And I think back in May, it was like 1.99%.

27:21.040 --> 27:25.040
So are these net market share numbers, like the usual source?

27:25.040 --> 27:26.960
Net market share for the month of September.

27:26.960 --> 27:27.960
Okay.

27:27.960 --> 27:30.700
Well, I'm not going to hold out any hopes here.

27:30.700 --> 27:34.240
Let's let it sit for a few months, see if we stabilize or if it's just a weird fluke.

27:34.240 --> 27:35.840
All of these are bullshit numbers.

27:35.840 --> 27:37.440
They're all bullshit numbers.

27:37.440 --> 27:40.880
But one of the things that's interesting is all the different bullshit number tracking

27:40.880 --> 27:45.960
systems, with the exception of the Steam, which is a separate, the Steam Hardware Survey,

27:45.960 --> 27:50.720
which is a whole separate thing, all of the other ones are actually showing a legitimate

27:50.720 --> 27:52.080
increase in Linux usage.

27:52.080 --> 27:58.440
So while I feel like in isolation, they're each bullshit, in totality, they are all reflecting

27:58.440 --> 28:00.320
an increase in Linux desktop share.

28:00.320 --> 28:03.960
We're going to do a meta-survey here, publish some results, try to weed out the bad ones.

28:03.960 --> 28:07.000
Well, I mean, none of them are showing a decrease, so that's notable.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
Definitely.

28:08.000 --> 28:13.440
In Linux Action News 18 or 19, I did a breakdown of how some of these market numbers are collected,

28:13.440 --> 28:16.320
and it is really crap.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.800
But the Steam Hardware Survey is a separate problem.

28:19.800 --> 28:26.960
So that's the one area where Linux is continuing to decline month over month, decline in total

28:26.960 --> 28:29.400
percentage of Steam users.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.560
And that's the key right there.

28:31.560 --> 28:36.840
Steam itself is growing at an incredible clip, and Linux users are not declining, but they're

28:36.840 --> 28:39.720
just becoming a smaller minority.

28:39.720 --> 28:42.120
So the Steam Hardware Survey being the exception to that.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.240
And it's, yeah, it's just a different mix.

28:44.240 --> 28:45.240
Come on, Eric.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.240
Oh, yeah.

28:46.240 --> 28:52.400
Did anybody ever see the NetMarketShare's preliminary report for this past September?

28:52.400 --> 28:53.920
I don't think so.

28:53.920 --> 29:01.040
They were like publishing their preliminary report at like 6.97% Linux market share.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.120
And I was just like, nope, there's no way.

29:03.120 --> 29:07.320
That means it would have had to double in one month.

29:07.320 --> 29:14.800
You know, this whole thing about measuring the totality of computer users seems like

29:14.800 --> 29:16.720
a bad way to go to begin with.

29:16.720 --> 29:24.440
Because you really, you know, if you measure all devices, that's a useless statistic.

29:24.440 --> 29:29.600
You almost need to measure like influences or active users, or I don't know.

29:29.600 --> 29:34.240
There's like another metric out there where I think Linux has a much higher percentage

29:34.240 --> 29:35.240
usage.

29:35.240 --> 29:39.560
I mean, there's hundreds of thousands of people that listen to Jupiter broadcasting shows.

29:39.560 --> 29:42.440
So there's got to be an audience out there.

29:42.440 --> 29:45.120
I mean, it's not like it's just 10 people downloading over and over again.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.640
Think of all the people NOAA's switching every day.

29:47.640 --> 29:48.640
Yeah, exactly.

29:48.640 --> 29:53.040
The same thing is also a thing where I've only been asked to do the hardware survey

29:53.040 --> 29:54.040
once ever.

29:54.040 --> 29:55.040
Once ever.

29:55.040 --> 29:56.040
Same.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.040
Once ever.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.040
Totally.

29:58.040 --> 29:59.600
And you know what's funny is we have one Windows system that I'll boot up every now and then

29:59.600 --> 30:01.560
in here, and that thing's gotten it a couple times.

30:01.560 --> 30:02.560
Yeah, right.

30:02.560 --> 30:03.560
Mine too.

30:03.560 --> 30:04.960
It's like I have two Linux machines, one Windows.

30:04.960 --> 30:08.480
Somehow the Windows always gets in the survey and it's like, okay, well, this is not representative.

30:08.480 --> 30:13.480
Well, I should say, before we go any further, I should say thank you to you in particular,

30:13.480 --> 30:15.080
End of the Beard, for filling in last week.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.720
Hey, it was a lot of fun.

30:17.720 --> 30:24.900
I caught some of the episode as data allowed, but I was impressed at how many Wi-Fi access

30:24.900 --> 30:26.680
points are open out there on the road.

30:26.680 --> 30:27.680
Is that right?

30:27.680 --> 30:29.760
And disappointed at how fricking many of them have CAPTCHAs.

30:29.760 --> 30:30.760
Just so annoying.

30:30.760 --> 30:34.320
And then like the CAPTCHAs where you have to reconnect after an hour or stuff.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.640
So I tried to listen to a bit of it, and I caught some of it live.

30:36.640 --> 30:37.640
So thank you for filling in.

30:37.640 --> 30:38.640
Oh, my pleasure.

30:38.640 --> 30:43.920
But on top of that, you and Mike banged out like a whole plethora of CoderRadio.

30:43.920 --> 30:44.920
I think Coder's done now.

30:44.920 --> 30:45.920
Is that how it works?

30:45.920 --> 30:46.920
I think so.

30:46.920 --> 30:47.920
I legitimately came in today.

30:47.920 --> 30:51.160
I'm like, well, I think I'm probably going to have to record a CoderRadio today.

30:51.160 --> 30:53.920
And Beard's like, no, I wasted like three of them on Friday.

30:53.920 --> 30:54.920
Excellent.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.400
I was like, holy crap.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.400
Okay.

30:57.400 --> 30:58.400
Well, all right.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.960
Hopefully that makes things a bit easier for you getting back here and focused on Unplugged.

31:01.960 --> 31:03.400
So thank you very much for that.

31:03.400 --> 31:07.440
So if time allows, I'll have to buy you lunch on Friday when we go to Segal.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.400
I think that's only fair, so you should make it a nice one.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.400
Yeah.

31:11.400 --> 31:15.000
Remember that place we went when we went to the Open Daylight Summit?

31:15.000 --> 31:17.480
Yeah, there is one of those in downtown, too.

31:17.480 --> 31:18.480
That was good.

31:18.480 --> 31:19.480
Yes, it was.

31:19.480 --> 31:20.480
I think I'm going to bring the vlog camera with me, too.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.480
Of course.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.480
Vlog a little secret.

31:22.480 --> 31:23.480
It's all content, baby.

31:23.480 --> 31:24.480
Yeah, that's right.

31:24.480 --> 31:25.480
That's right.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.480
Okay.

31:26.480 --> 31:29.200
But before we keep going about the new trip, I should probably talk about the last trip.

31:29.200 --> 31:30.200
Yeah, I guess so.

31:30.200 --> 31:34.360
Going to New York, New York City, and hanging out at the Ubuntu Rally.

31:34.360 --> 31:39.840
I had always been curious, because often after a big canonical event, Popeye and Wimpy will

31:39.840 --> 31:46.400
join us, and I'll ask them probing questions about it, but I didn't have the context.

31:46.400 --> 31:49.520
We only got that tiny slice of what it was like, what was really happening.

31:49.520 --> 31:50.520
Right.

31:50.520 --> 31:55.600
And plus, they could leave out something, or they could be excluding something, like

31:55.600 --> 31:59.800
90% of the people are screwing off, and 10% of the people there are actually the people

31:59.800 --> 32:00.800
getting work done.

32:00.800 --> 32:04.240
The only reason I say that is because I have been to company work events like that, and

32:04.240 --> 32:05.240
that's what it's like.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.080
You talk to one person, it's a totally different experience.

32:07.080 --> 32:09.680
Yeah, and I'm always the guy doing the work, too.

32:09.680 --> 32:15.600
I was really, really genuinely curious how Canonical gets something like this done.

32:15.600 --> 32:20.000
This is the first time they'd ever called it an Ubuntu Rally.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.640
You've had different conferences.

32:21.640 --> 32:25.680
It's like a conference for Canonical employees and certain community members that get brought

32:25.680 --> 32:29.240
in.

32:29.240 --> 32:34.060
It's particularly unique to them because they, more so than a lot of companies, have a lot

32:34.060 --> 32:37.960
of people working from home, a lot are remote working.

32:37.960 --> 32:44.280
They get brought together very rarely, and that gives it a unique energy and twist.

32:44.280 --> 32:47.400
That's another reason that really piqued my interest, and why I was willing to drive in

32:47.400 --> 32:51.520
a tiny, compact car from Seattle to New York.

32:51.520 --> 32:52.520
Yeah, wow.

32:52.520 --> 32:53.520
That is impressive.

32:53.520 --> 32:54.760
I don't think I'll ever do it again.

32:54.760 --> 32:59.880
I'm glad I did it once, I think, but I don't think I'll ever do it again.

32:59.880 --> 33:08.240
I definitely want to talk about the Ubuntu Rally, and if you want to see sort of my best

33:08.240 --> 33:14.840
attempt at combining three days into one video and giving you a sense of what it would like

33:14.840 --> 33:20.560
to be attend, to be an attendee at the Ubuntu Rally, I have posted on my vlog, I have posted

33:20.560 --> 33:26.800
vlog 58 inside the Ubuntu Rally, and it's nine minutes and 55 seconds long, and it encapsulates

33:26.800 --> 33:31.680
three days at the Ubuntu Rally, and it sort of gives you a sense of what it's like to

33:31.680 --> 33:36.960
be there, at least for one day, and I would encourage you to watch it, because a lot of

33:36.960 --> 33:40.440
effort went into making that, and if you find it enjoyable, I would ask that you would maybe

33:40.440 --> 33:43.720
share it with somebody, or retweet it, or something like that if you enjoyed it, and

33:43.720 --> 33:46.840
if you didn't, let me know what you didn't like about it, and I'll try to make it better

33:46.840 --> 33:50.000
in the future, and I have that embedded in the show notes if you want to check that out,

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
but I did...

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
It seems like an interesting...

33:52.000 --> 33:53.000
Just, sorry.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.000
No, no, go ahead.

33:54.000 --> 33:59.520
There's a huge advantage in that it's very much, like, obviously there's pluses and minuses,

33:59.520 --> 34:02.120
you know, Canonical is the company, but I feel like there's a lot of people, maybe not

34:02.120 --> 34:04.200
even Linux people, that might identify with that sort of thing.

34:04.200 --> 34:07.440
They're used to seeing Microsoft and Apple events, they're used to understanding the

34:07.440 --> 34:10.400
culture in that kind of way, and so maybe if they don't, they're not driven to Ubuntu

34:10.400 --> 34:13.920
in terms of, oh, here's this weird open source community thing, maybe seeing this, seeing

34:13.920 --> 34:17.320
the amount of work, seeing the culture, seeing the people who are doing it, it seems like

34:17.320 --> 34:19.800
a unique way to connect with the company.

34:19.800 --> 34:26.160
It gave me a great perspective on not only how a worldwide company does something like

34:26.160 --> 34:32.720
this, and holy, humbling, as a small business owner, a humbling sense of the amount of investment

34:32.720 --> 34:35.800
that Mark and Canonical put into something like that.

34:35.800 --> 34:43.280
My room, my bedroom alone, my one room that I paid for out of my own pocket was $470 a

34:43.280 --> 34:51.320
night, and Canonical employees got a discount, but not much, and the employees didn't pay

34:51.320 --> 34:52.720
it, Canonical did.

34:52.720 --> 34:55.780
So they got a group rate, but it was a group rate that wasn't very significant because

34:55.780 --> 34:57.400
I know what the group rate was.

34:57.400 --> 35:02.120
And so just the outlay on the rooms, because they had dozens of conference rooms, they

35:02.120 --> 35:09.640
had an entire plaza area, they had a huge keynote room, the flights of all of the community

35:09.640 --> 35:16.680
members and the Canonical members that went out there plus their rooms was a substantial

35:16.680 --> 35:21.680
investment easily, easily in the millions.

35:21.680 --> 35:25.000
Because just the equipment, Noah and I went through the equipment they use in the keynote

35:25.000 --> 35:29.880
room, and we are familiar with how much it costs to ship equipment, just equipment alone,

35:29.880 --> 35:32.560
$25,000 in shipment and equipment.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.360
So just an incredible outlay.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.360
They're doing it right.

35:35.360 --> 35:37.120
And you think about it though, they don't have an office space, right?

35:37.120 --> 35:39.360
They don't have a huge building in downtown London, right?

35:39.360 --> 35:42.880
So this is, they bring everybody together a couple of times a year.

35:42.880 --> 35:48.720
And so it's not an unbelievable outlay, but holy smokes, it is a hell of an outlay.

35:48.720 --> 35:49.760
It is really something.

35:49.760 --> 35:50.760
So I want to talk about that.

35:50.760 --> 35:55.120
I got a couple of clips I want to play, an interview with Daniel Foray I want to talk

35:55.120 --> 35:56.880
about which I thought turned out really great.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.760
So first I'm going to mention DigitalOcean.

35:58.760 --> 36:04.600
Go to digitalocean.com, create an account, and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, DOUNPLUGGED,

36:04.600 --> 36:08.920
all one word, you apply it to your account after you've created the account, and then

36:08.920 --> 36:10.840
you get the $10 credit.

36:10.840 --> 36:14.760
It's a really simple infrastructure that you can spin up and control on demand with an

36:14.760 --> 36:20.480
entire stack of Linux and Docker and an application ready to go, or just a bare Linux installation

36:20.480 --> 36:21.880
or even free BSD.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.000
They've got lots of distributions you can choose from.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
Everything's SSD.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.860
And the base rate starts at just $5 a month that you can get deployed within seconds.

36:29.860 --> 36:35.520
Now I had a chance since I got back to play with their new object storage.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.680
This is way different than what I was expecting.

36:37.680 --> 36:38.680
Is that right?

36:38.680 --> 36:39.680
What were you expecting?

36:39.680 --> 36:43.400
I was expecting essentially a straight up S3 competitor.

36:43.400 --> 36:44.400
And it is.

36:44.400 --> 36:45.400
It is.

36:45.400 --> 36:48.800
But it's an S3 competitor that human beings can use.

36:48.800 --> 36:54.840
It's so great because if you want, you can programmatically define storage, destroy storage,

36:54.840 --> 36:55.840
use storage.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.640
You can take advantage of their API.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.280
It's full on object storage.

36:59.280 --> 37:03.440
But if you just want to use it as a place to upload files and give someone a public

37:03.440 --> 37:08.160
URL, and they get a crazy fast download that has a time expiring link, you can just use

37:08.160 --> 37:09.160
it as that.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.160
It's so easy.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.160
It's nuts, man.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.160
So you go into the dashboard.

37:12.160 --> 37:15.640
You create your object storage, your space.

37:15.640 --> 37:16.920
And then you upload a file.

37:16.920 --> 37:19.500
And immediately everything by default is private.

37:19.500 --> 37:21.480
And then you can choose which goes public.

37:21.480 --> 37:24.540
And then everything gets a URL, which you can use programmatically.

37:24.540 --> 37:28.240
Or you can just go into the dashboard and say, generate me a URL.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.480
And you can just share a URL.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.200
And so I was sending files to Noah today.

37:32.200 --> 37:34.520
And I'm like, this is going to be destroyed in seven days.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.520
Here you go.

37:35.520 --> 37:36.520
Here's the URL.

37:36.520 --> 37:42.240
And I was saturating our 100 megabit connection here at the studio when I was pulling it.

37:42.240 --> 37:43.240
Saturating it.

37:43.240 --> 37:44.240
So spaces.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.320
And you just turn it on.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.400
They have a trial right now.

37:46.400 --> 37:47.880
The pricing is ridiculously great.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.920
You can try it two months for absolutely free.

37:49.920 --> 37:51.280
It's scalable storage.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.640
It's available as a standalone service outside of DigitalOcean.

37:53.640 --> 37:56.240
You don't have to have a Droplet spun up to take advantage of it.

37:56.240 --> 37:58.360
And you can get started in just an instant.

37:58.360 --> 38:00.080
And the API is S3 compatible.

38:00.080 --> 38:03.160
So if you have tools that work with S3, ship it up to JDO.

38:03.160 --> 38:07.880
I think you'll find their network, their transit costs, much more reasonable.

38:07.880 --> 38:08.880
It's so fast.

38:08.880 --> 38:14.720
And I was thinking, too, in regards to the API, I could really see Jbot taking advantage

38:14.720 --> 38:15.720
of something like this.

38:15.720 --> 38:20.240
Because we could give Jbot the ability to programmatically create a storage space it

38:20.240 --> 38:24.000
needs, dump files in there, like cache files, avatar files.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.920
If people in the chat room want to be able to transfer files between IRC and Discord,

38:27.920 --> 38:30.920
it could generate the temporary storage, store the file there, transfer the file, destroy

38:30.920 --> 38:31.920
the storage.

38:31.920 --> 38:34.160
Like, a bot could do all of this stuff.

38:34.160 --> 38:35.160
It'll just get taken care of.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.040
And it's just so easy to use.

38:37.040 --> 38:41.200
Or if you just want to drag files from your desktop into your web browser and generate

38:41.200 --> 38:42.200
a URL, you can do that.

38:42.200 --> 38:43.200
That just works.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.200
It just works.

38:44.200 --> 38:46.080
Yeah, like you said, a real human could use it.

38:46.080 --> 38:50.280
I mean, I never thought it would be this cool.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.280
So you could check it out.

38:51.280 --> 38:56.000
Go to DigitalOcean.com, create the account, and then use our promo code D1Plugged.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.640
And they also have a two-month trial right now.

38:57.640 --> 39:00.760
You can just try it for free, the new object storage spaces.

39:00.760 --> 39:01.760
It's so cool.

39:01.760 --> 39:05.880
There's a lot of great features over at DigitalOcean, but object storage might be my new favorite.

39:05.880 --> 39:09.000
DigitalOcean.com, create the promo code D1Plugged.

39:09.000 --> 39:13.520
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring this show and for creating spaces.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.840
I am going to use the S out of spaces.

39:16.840 --> 39:17.840
Very excited about that.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.400
Just use our promo code D1Plugged to get that $10 credit.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.400
All right.

39:21.400 --> 39:25.880
So let's talk about the Ubuntu rally.

39:25.880 --> 39:29.240
I got there Sunday night.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.000
And it was a long haul.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.040
It was like six or seven days of driving.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.040
And I got there.

39:35.040 --> 39:38.440
And I mean, I couldn't have nailed the timing any better.

39:38.440 --> 39:41.000
We got there, and they were all going out to dinner.

39:41.000 --> 39:42.000
And I was like, oh, I want to go.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
I want to go.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
So it was perfect.

39:44.000 --> 39:49.120
And I thought I'd talk a little bit about what it was like to go as an attendee for

39:49.120 --> 39:55.100
a moment, because there was a feel to the room.

39:55.100 --> 40:00.120
And that feel was there is a responsibility to get work done.

40:00.120 --> 40:06.320
Like the people there understood the outlay that Canonical had spent to make it all happen.

40:06.320 --> 40:10.000
And so everybody felt a sense of, we've got to get work done.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.440
And I thought Mark did a good job of reminding everybody, we are here to work.

40:13.440 --> 40:16.120
So you carry a lot of responsibilities.

40:16.120 --> 40:19.120
And so for that reason, I want to ask you not to take the expression that this is a

40:19.120 --> 40:24.760
city that never sleeps as a personal challenge.

40:24.760 --> 40:25.760
This is an incredible environment.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.760
I'm delighted to have us here.

40:26.760 --> 40:32.280
You know, I like going to kind of out of the way places where there's at least one extra

40:32.280 --> 40:38.200
leg just to torture everybody, but mainly actually so that we can be in special places

40:38.200 --> 40:44.600
that you may never otherwise get to, but you might read about them on travel or some interesting

40:44.600 --> 40:45.600
blog.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.800
I thought that was an interesting point he makes.

40:46.800 --> 40:52.240
So one of the, essentially what Mark is saying here is, first of all, don't party too much

40:52.240 --> 40:54.260
because we're all here to get some work done.

40:54.260 --> 40:57.680
And second of all, he's saying one of the perks of being a canonical employee is every

40:57.680 --> 41:01.320
now and then you get to go to these places that you really only kind of read about.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.320
And isn't that true?

41:02.320 --> 41:05.080
Like I've never been to New York and I'm not even a canonical employee.

41:05.080 --> 41:07.600
Like I went to New York because of this canonical event.

41:07.600 --> 41:11.360
Like when they create a gravitational pull around something, people come to an area they've

41:11.360 --> 41:12.720
never been to before.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.080
And that is kind of a unique perk to a company.

41:15.080 --> 41:20.080
And then he kind of goes to set a little more of the tone of why folks are here.

41:20.080 --> 41:25.440
I like to go to those places, we get to go to those places as part of our work and it

41:25.440 --> 41:30.600
makes for sort of a special dimension to life at canonical and in Ubuntu.

41:30.600 --> 41:34.160
But occasionally there is reason for us to come somewhere where pretty much everybody

41:34.160 --> 41:38.080
has direct flights and this is one such occasion.

41:38.080 --> 41:43.760
So basically make the most of it, but please don't be that person that lets your team

41:43.760 --> 41:47.120
down because you just went wild.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.040
Go wild and get some sleep.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.280
And so the tone was sort of set.

41:51.280 --> 41:54.000
Like we chose New York for a very specific reason.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.520
Everybody can have a direct flight and we're all here to get some work done.

41:57.520 --> 42:02.240
And the focus was specifically set when Mark started to drop some numbers about the usage

42:02.240 --> 42:04.240
of the Ubuntu LTS releases.

42:04.240 --> 42:06.000
The data are pretty simple.

42:06.000 --> 42:15.600
An LTS gets about 10x the utilization of a non-LTS and sorry, of all the non-LTSs and

42:15.600 --> 42:20.620
about therefore about 20x the average non-LTS release.

42:20.620 --> 42:26.660
So to make that clear, an LTS release gets 20x the amount of users, 20x the amount of

42:26.660 --> 42:28.920
users as a non-LTS release.

42:28.920 --> 42:30.960
So it really counts.

42:30.960 --> 42:35.080
Use that information, use that data to shape your choices this week about what you're going

42:35.080 --> 42:36.600
to try and get done.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.640
So that's Mark setting the focus.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.240
This is our priority.

42:40.240 --> 42:45.560
Make sure it impacts the LTS release because this is the release that matters most to Ubuntu

42:45.560 --> 42:46.560
users.

42:46.560 --> 42:48.920
And with that, it was essentially it.

42:48.920 --> 42:51.200
Mark set the tone and everybody got to work.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.200
That's awesome.

42:52.200 --> 42:55.280
So I wanted to get a sense, and we're going to talk to both Wimpy and Pope here, we're

42:55.280 --> 43:00.040
going to talk to them in just a moment, but I wanted to get a sense from a fellow outsider.

43:00.040 --> 43:02.120
What was your impression of this?

43:02.120 --> 43:06.160
Because I could ask the people that work for the company, but there's going to be a certain

43:06.160 --> 43:07.160
familiarity.

43:07.160 --> 43:10.640
So I wanted to ask somebody who came from the outside, small business owner who was

43:10.640 --> 43:14.320
there at this event that could share a perspective with me.

43:14.320 --> 43:19.400
And so I sat down with the founder of Elementary L. So you guys may be familiar with.

43:19.400 --> 43:22.040
My name is Daniel Fore and I'm from Sacramento, California.

43:22.040 --> 43:25.680
You guys know Daniel Fore and so Daniel sat down with me and I asked him what it felt

43:25.680 --> 43:27.880
like to be an outsider at this Ubuntu event.

43:27.880 --> 43:31.840
Well, I definitely feel actually super at home at these events.

43:31.840 --> 43:35.320
I don't know if a lot of people know, but I used to do contracting work for Canonical

43:35.320 --> 43:36.800
on their design team.

43:36.800 --> 43:39.740
So I used to attend UDS and all that.

43:39.740 --> 43:42.080
So it's nice to see a lot of familiar faces.

43:42.080 --> 43:45.160
I have a lot of friends that are still working at Canonical.

43:45.160 --> 43:50.880
So yeah, I really enjoy being here and getting to see those people again and it's definitely

43:50.880 --> 43:52.520
nice to reconnect with them.

43:52.520 --> 43:57.040
And I feel like that the people that I hadn't met before are really easy to get along with.

43:57.040 --> 43:59.600
Everybody's really welcoming.

43:59.600 --> 44:06.200
It seems like there's a culture of outreach within Canonical where people want to make

44:06.200 --> 44:10.480
I guess the wider open source community members feel like they're welcome and important and

44:10.480 --> 44:11.980
their feedback matters.

44:11.980 --> 44:15.400
I thought that was an interesting point because I think a culture of outreach might be something

44:15.400 --> 44:18.720
that I'd also say I felt was present there.

44:18.720 --> 44:23.280
And it was obvious why I wanted to go from a Linux journalism standpoint.

44:23.280 --> 44:24.680
It was obvious why I wanted to be there.

44:24.680 --> 44:28.120
But what was really the value for elementary and for Daniel for being there?

44:28.120 --> 44:34.720
Even if we come back and don't ever ship snaps, just being here, we've been able to get different

44:34.720 --> 44:39.280
issues that we have in front of people and have them be able to go, oh yeah, okay, you

44:39.280 --> 44:42.840
know, I saw that in the bug tracker but I didn't get around to it.

44:42.840 --> 44:46.480
Or oh, you know, you need to talk to this person about that or I think just being able

44:46.480 --> 44:48.000
to network is really valuable.

44:48.000 --> 44:53.240
I know that we've already had a couple of instances where we identified a couple issues

44:53.240 --> 45:00.000
in Snap that were rapidly either addressed or confirmed in the issue tracker.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.640
So I think the FaceTime really helps.

45:02.640 --> 45:07.860
And like I said, I think the wider effect even outside of snaps is being able to communicate

45:07.860 --> 45:12.600
with people that are involved in different parts of the desktop team maybe because Ubuntu

45:12.600 --> 45:13.900
is our upstream.

45:13.900 --> 45:15.020
Very true.

45:15.020 --> 45:16.800
And I thought that was a great point.

45:16.800 --> 45:20.680
So I thought, okay, Daniel, well, let's ask you something that's maybe a little uncomfortable

45:20.680 --> 45:22.880
because you've been fairly positive so far.

45:22.880 --> 45:30.160
How has the switch from Unity 7 to GNOME and all of the changes in Ubuntu 17.10 screwed

45:30.160 --> 45:31.520
things up for elementary OS?

45:31.520 --> 45:33.980
How has it really messed things up?

45:33.980 --> 45:39.440
In a lot of ways, actually, the change is positive for us because there's less overlap

45:39.440 --> 45:45.000
between what happens in our desktop environment and what happens in Ubuntu.

45:45.000 --> 45:51.600
I know that we've had issues in the past where Ubuntu is carrying a patched version of GDK

45:51.600 --> 45:56.720
or only had certain libraries that only worked in Ubuntu.

45:56.720 --> 46:03.640
And so our kind of wider fan base, I guess, on other distributions who are trying to leverage

46:03.640 --> 46:07.400
our source code there were having problems because it was very Ubuntu specific.

46:07.400 --> 46:12.200
And we're also a little more disconnected from upstream libraries like GLib and GNOME

46:12.200 --> 46:13.400
and things like that.

46:13.400 --> 46:18.860
So I think with Ubuntu's move to a more vanilla kind of GNOME experience and also trying to

46:18.860 --> 46:24.500
pull in newer versions of the packages that it's helped us out a lot not having to worry

46:24.500 --> 46:29.000
so much about breaking changes from patches and backports and things like that.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.480
And he wasn't the only person I heard that from.

46:31.480 --> 46:35.160
That was actually kind of a common sentiment that I heard is that actually these changes

46:35.160 --> 46:37.240
have all been pretty much for the positive.

46:37.240 --> 46:39.080
Neil was there from the Fedora project.

46:39.080 --> 46:40.760
He said kind of the same thing, essentially.

46:40.760 --> 46:45.560
He had more perspectives and different issues that he wanted to address.

46:45.560 --> 46:50.920
And I thought overall, everybody was sort of there in part of the conversation.

46:50.920 --> 46:53.680
Everybody was at least part of the conversation.

46:53.680 --> 46:59.400
And I would say, so picture it's a hotel room and you have a couple of different floors

46:59.400 --> 47:00.400
of this hotel room.

47:00.400 --> 47:06.640
You have conference room floor and floor 14, which are really decked out for having meetings.

47:06.640 --> 47:09.480
And Canonical has co-opted all of these meeting spaces.

47:09.480 --> 47:14.960
And you just have like a laser printer or dot matrix or not dot matrix, but a printout

47:14.960 --> 47:15.960
on the door.

47:15.960 --> 47:17.400
It's like, this is the kernel room.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.280
This is the software as a service room.

47:19.280 --> 47:21.700
This is the SNAP room, right?

47:21.700 --> 47:22.700
And you have these.

47:22.700 --> 47:26.400
And this is you go in there and if you have a question for that team, like Noah and I,

47:26.400 --> 47:31.840
there was a great interview that aired yesterday on Ask Noah with one of the Canonical employees

47:31.840 --> 47:34.680
who's working on Wayland and Mir.

47:34.680 --> 47:38.320
And so we just had questions about like, wow, what are you guys struggling with?

47:38.320 --> 47:41.200
And so we just walk into that room and just start asking them questions.

47:41.200 --> 47:43.600
And that just aired yesterday and Ask Noah if you want to check that out.

47:43.600 --> 47:45.720
And so it's the second half of the show.

47:45.720 --> 47:46.720
Really great interview.

47:46.720 --> 47:52.080
Also, they talk in there about what they might do if Wayland totally bombs in 1710 and what

47:52.080 --> 47:53.800
their backup plans might be.

47:53.800 --> 47:55.220
That's in the Ask Noah interview.

47:55.220 --> 47:58.820
But the room that I think I found to be the most fun to hang out in, the most interesting

47:58.820 --> 48:01.280
to hang out in, would be the SNAP room.

48:01.280 --> 48:02.280
So here's a little bit from that.

48:02.280 --> 48:06.800
So Noah and I are crashing the SNAP craft room right now because there's a good mix

48:06.800 --> 48:10.080
of different companies and projects all in one space.

48:10.080 --> 48:13.760
So this is sort of a microcosm of the entire event.

48:13.760 --> 48:15.520
So it's one of our favorite rooms to hang out in.

48:15.520 --> 48:17.960
And of course, our buddy Wimpy's over there, too.

48:17.960 --> 48:22.680
And I wouldn't say it was the biggest room of the event, but there did seem to be a lot

48:22.680 --> 48:26.920
of buzz and a lot of different eclectic companies in there, eh, Wimpy?

48:26.920 --> 48:28.680
Yeah, it was quite the collection.

48:28.680 --> 48:37.160
Yeah, that was where most of the people that were invited from the community or from ISVs

48:37.160 --> 48:39.400
were doing their work.

48:39.400 --> 48:42.060
And I saw your Google Plus post.

48:42.060 --> 48:47.040
You mentioned there was different some of those different vendors where I think Microsoft

48:47.040 --> 48:48.600
was on the list.

48:48.600 --> 48:49.600
Yeah.

48:49.600 --> 48:57.800
So we had three representatives, well, four representatives from three Microsoft teams.

48:57.800 --> 49:05.560
So we had two guys from the.NET team there, one guy from the Visual Studio Code team,

49:05.560 --> 49:09.440
and one guy from the Skype for Linux team.

49:09.440 --> 49:10.440
What do you think?

49:10.440 --> 49:21.400
Wow, I'm now just sort of taking in totality your sort of trajectory here with Canonical.

49:21.400 --> 49:26.640
And you just found yourself smack dab in the middle of probably one of the more important

49:26.640 --> 49:31.600
rooms at a very important Canonical event with very important companies and projects,

49:31.600 --> 49:34.680
and they're trying to produce packages around very important applications.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.480
How do you feel about all that?

49:37.480 --> 49:42.200
Well, see, you were experiencing that for the first time.

49:42.200 --> 49:49.160
What we're doing day to day is talking to the likes of those guys and community projects

49:49.160 --> 49:56.040
as well and assisting them from afar and giving them some technical advice and representing

49:56.040 --> 50:02.960
their requirements in terms of development resources and capabilities and things like

50:02.960 --> 50:04.040
that.

50:04.040 --> 50:09.560
But doing that from afar when they're not tasked necessarily to work on particular things

50:09.560 --> 50:17.400
with a high degree of priority, having all of those people in a room for a week and also

50:17.400 --> 50:22.400
putting the right people from Canonical around them really accelerated a lot of what we were

50:22.400 --> 50:24.360
all trying to achieve and work on.

50:24.360 --> 50:28.760
So it was a very energetic room to be in, and I thoroughly enjoyed the week.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.440
It was absolutely fabulous.

50:30.440 --> 50:32.520
How are you feeling?

50:32.520 --> 50:41.920
I'm just about getting over the jet lag, I somehow messed up my sleeping when I got back.

50:41.920 --> 50:44.520
But yeah, I'm just about over that now.

50:44.520 --> 50:47.480
But yes, it was a brilliant week.

50:47.480 --> 50:51.760
We obviously had some exciting companies there working alongside us.

50:51.760 --> 50:54.180
And also we've heard from Daniel.

50:54.180 --> 51:01.160
We also had Alish and Scarlett from Blue Systems and KDE.

51:01.160 --> 51:03.040
They were doing some fantastic work there.

51:03.040 --> 51:08.240
They've really expanded the portfolio of their applications that have snapped up.

51:08.240 --> 51:11.040
Yeah, and it was great to actually meet someone from Blue Systems.

51:11.040 --> 51:13.280
That was great.

51:13.280 --> 51:15.400
Quite the rare opportunity.

51:15.400 --> 51:22.860
And then of course, Daniel and Aiki from my point of view had some great over a beer conversations

51:22.860 --> 51:29.760
with them and also with Cody and the KDE guys in the evening because I've got a passion

51:29.760 --> 51:35.840
project which is a desktop distro and talking to other people working on Linux desktop projects

51:35.840 --> 51:38.840
and getting their take on things and insight on things.

51:38.840 --> 51:44.840
It's the kind of conversations you can't have effectively over Slack and IRC.

51:44.840 --> 51:51.520
So as Daniel said, that kind of face time, even if it's not necessarily working on stuff,

51:51.520 --> 51:55.960
but just in the evening, talking about all sorts of things like crowdfunding and stuff

51:55.960 --> 51:59.160
like that was really fascinating as well.

51:59.160 --> 52:05.120
I had a definite moment where there was a few celebrities as far as I'm concerned, Did

52:05.120 --> 52:08.600
Rocks and others that are creating code that really impact my daily life.

52:08.600 --> 52:14.280
It's like, oh, it's so cool to meet that person and put a real voice and a face to the name.

52:14.280 --> 52:18.320
I thought that right there and the stuff was very, very invaluable.

52:18.320 --> 52:22.400
I also noticed, and I was wondering, Poppy, if this was sort of maybe as a result of some

52:22.400 --> 52:27.160
of the collaboration and work at the Ubuntu Rally that the new community site is launched

52:27.160 --> 52:28.160
today.

52:28.160 --> 52:34.680
Yeah, thanks for mentioning that community.ubuntu.com.

52:34.680 --> 52:42.120
It kind of has been worked on for a few weeks now, but we got it solidified last week.

52:42.120 --> 52:49.760
We were going to launch a kind of prototype version of the site, but we had a nice conversation

52:49.760 --> 52:58.920
with our Canonical IS people and they decided to spin up a well-managed and robust version

52:58.920 --> 53:05.060
of the course for our community site, which replaces a static old crusty site that nobody

53:05.060 --> 53:06.920
ever maintained.

53:06.920 --> 53:11.840
So hopefully that will see a lot more active use.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.460
Yeah, it looks really nice.

53:13.460 --> 53:18.000
And I see a lot of well-known names from Canonical participating in the community over there

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
too.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
Yeah.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
Yeah.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.480
What was your takeaway from the Ubuntu Rally as compared to previous events and sort of

53:24.480 --> 53:26.400
your historical perspective with Canonical?

53:26.400 --> 53:27.400
What did you think of it?

53:27.400 --> 53:34.280
It's funny, you mentioned that and you played the chat with Daniel from elementary.

53:34.280 --> 53:39.000
When he mentioned the fact that he'd been to previous Ubuntu Developer Summits or UDSs

53:39.000 --> 53:44.040
as we call them, I just looked up and the first UDS I went to was in 2007.

53:44.040 --> 53:45.040
Wow.

53:45.040 --> 53:50.920
So over 10 years ago was my first UDS and I paid my own way to go to my first UDS as

53:50.920 --> 53:54.080
a community guy in Seville in Spain.

53:54.080 --> 53:59.120
And Mark's right, like with Canonical, you get to visit a lot of interesting places.

53:59.120 --> 54:04.080
There's no way I would have chosen to go to Seville or I might not necessarily have gone

54:04.080 --> 54:10.160
to Prague and possibly wouldn't have been able to afford to fly to San Francisco multiple

54:10.160 --> 54:11.160
times.

54:11.160 --> 54:16.920
So I'm very grateful for the opportunity to go to these interesting places and last week

54:16.920 --> 54:22.840
I went up the Empire State Building and had a bit of time away from the office to see

54:22.840 --> 54:30.080
the sights of New York and the Irish bars of New York with Martin and Heike.

54:30.080 --> 54:32.080
I heard those stories.

54:32.080 --> 54:39.620
But it did really remind me of some of the UDSs of the past.

54:39.620 --> 54:44.680
But one of the problems with the UDSs of the past is they just got too big.

54:44.680 --> 54:49.800
Towards the end there were 700 people there and you've alluded to how expensive it probably

54:49.800 --> 54:50.800
was.

54:50.800 --> 54:54.400
I have no idea of the cost but how expensive it was to run that event in the center of

54:54.400 --> 55:00.760
New York City and you imagine running that every six months with 500 plus people going.

55:00.760 --> 55:06.360
That's a tremendous amount of money to inject into events on a regular basis.

55:06.360 --> 55:09.680
Isn't it still going right now?

55:09.680 --> 55:14.280
I just saw a tweet from Dustin earlier today at the One World Trade Center.

55:14.280 --> 55:16.600
He's still in New York.

55:16.600 --> 55:22.080
So we often piggyback multiple events back to back because some of the senior management

55:22.080 --> 55:24.120
need to be to multiple events.

55:24.120 --> 55:29.280
So last week the event you were at was the Ubuntu rally and yeah we've never called it

55:29.280 --> 55:33.040
a rally before and it's a bit of a strange name for it.

55:33.040 --> 55:35.160
It's what we internally call a sprint.

55:35.160 --> 55:40.900
We all get together and we all, like you say, we all hack from 8.30 in the morning through

55:40.900 --> 55:45.640
till whatever time in the evening and often later.

55:45.640 --> 55:49.640
But then the following week, which is this week, there's a sales sprint and then the

55:49.640 --> 55:51.800
week after there's a product sprint.

55:51.800 --> 55:56.840
So we often have these back to back but you can think of the tremendous cost that that

55:56.840 --> 56:02.000
incurs for the company to host these events with so many people.

56:02.000 --> 56:14.680
It was 200 plus people at the event last week in a, not a crap hotel by any stretch of imagination.

56:14.680 --> 56:18.200
Given the price of the beer in the bar, it wasn't a terrible hotel.

56:18.200 --> 56:24.360
But yeah, when Daniel mentioned the memories of UDS gone by, it did rekindle that, especially

56:24.360 --> 56:29.960
given that on this occasion we were able to invite some community people along and rebuild

56:29.960 --> 56:37.560
some of those relationships which might not have been as well tended over the previous

56:37.560 --> 56:38.560
years.

56:38.560 --> 56:39.560
We're trying to rebuild some of those relationships.

56:39.560 --> 56:40.560
So that went well.

56:40.560 --> 56:41.560
Yeah.

56:41.560 --> 56:42.560
It did seem like a reset there a bit.

56:42.560 --> 56:43.560
There was a bit of a reset in a sense.

56:43.560 --> 56:46.520
And that's part of why we've started to rebuild the community website.

56:46.520 --> 56:51.280
So if you go to community.ubuntu.com, it's part of our mission at the moment and part

56:51.280 --> 56:57.760
of my mission as my role is to improve the onboarding process for new people who want

56:57.760 --> 56:58.960
to contribute to Ubuntu.

56:58.960 --> 57:02.680
So people who've, you know, bought their Dell laptop and it's got Ubuntu pre-installed

57:02.680 --> 57:06.440
and they think, you know, how can I help make this better or I want to be a good open source

57:06.440 --> 57:10.200
citizen and I want to file bugs in the right place or I want to, you know, make sure I

57:10.200 --> 57:13.600
contribute back to this thing that I got for free.

57:13.600 --> 57:18.200
I want to contribute back and we want to make the on-ramp easier for those people.

57:18.200 --> 57:22.580
But the second thing is we really want to make the communication from the teams at Canonical

57:22.580 --> 57:24.560
out to the community a lot better.

57:24.560 --> 57:29.360
So it's easier for people to talk to the people who can affect change, as Daniel said, being

57:29.360 --> 57:35.000
in the room with certain people in Canonical who he could put issues in front of them and

57:35.000 --> 57:41.040
say, hey, you know, we've been having a problem with this issue and that's, you know, slipped

57:41.040 --> 57:44.560
someone's mind or it's gone to the back of their queue or their to-do list.

57:44.560 --> 57:50.280
It's nice to be able to like poke the right people and get stuff done and get stuff working.

57:50.280 --> 57:54.120
And so that's part of why the new community hub exists.

57:54.120 --> 57:57.480
It's not there as a, I mean, we're using discourse.

57:57.480 --> 58:03.280
So you might be forgiven for thinking it's a forum, but we're trying to use it as more

58:03.280 --> 58:07.760
of a hub, more of a central place where people can go to find out information about what's

58:07.760 --> 58:11.160
going on in Ubuntu development and get involved in Ubuntu development.

58:11.160 --> 58:15.800
That seems really handy, especially like that can be a very hard thing to get right for

58:15.800 --> 58:16.800
a project.

58:16.800 --> 58:17.960
And, you know, it's easy to get turned off.

58:17.960 --> 58:20.240
Like if I can't find what I need, I'll go somewhere else.

58:20.240 --> 58:22.240
So if you can get it right from the first interaction, that's awesome.

58:22.240 --> 58:26.760
I was also surprised by just the type of conversations that were being had out in the public.

58:26.760 --> 58:29.600
That was my first impression when I saw it, I was like, oh, so they're just going to talk

58:29.600 --> 58:30.600
about that.

58:30.600 --> 58:31.600
Okay.

58:31.600 --> 58:32.600
Well, we're going to have to kill you now.

58:32.600 --> 58:36.080
I was like, well, I'm going to go ahead and read that thread.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.080
It's very interesting.

58:37.080 --> 58:38.080
Yeah.

58:38.080 --> 58:39.080
And I like it a lot.

58:39.080 --> 58:40.760
So I think it looks clean too.

58:40.760 --> 58:41.760
Yeah.

58:41.760 --> 58:47.160
It was, so it's interesting how little things like this sort of get extra momentum from

58:47.160 --> 58:48.160
the rally.

58:48.160 --> 58:52.080
I talked a little bit with Aiki about some of the work he's doing with snap integration

58:52.080 --> 58:53.080
for the Solus software center.

58:53.080 --> 58:56.760
I talked obviously with Daniel about it too and others.

58:56.760 --> 59:00.280
And I think everybody got a little bit of extra momentum on everything they're working

59:00.280 --> 59:01.280
on.

59:01.280 --> 59:02.280
Even non snap related things.

59:02.280 --> 59:03.280
Yeah, you mentioned Aiki there.

59:03.280 --> 59:04.280
Yeah.

59:04.280 --> 59:06.880
What you didn't see is Aiki gave one of the lightning talks on Friday.

59:06.880 --> 59:07.880
I had to miss that.

59:07.880 --> 59:08.880
Ooh.

59:08.880 --> 59:09.880
That was great.

59:09.880 --> 59:10.880
Yeah.

59:10.880 --> 59:14.160
It was a great, it was a great lightning talk and halfway through he got a round of applause

59:14.160 --> 59:19.840
from everyone at Canonical when he, you summarize, summarize the work that he's, he's done in

59:19.840 --> 59:20.840
Solus.

59:20.840 --> 59:21.840
Oh really?

59:21.840 --> 59:22.840
Yeah.

59:22.840 --> 59:23.840
That was really nice to see.

59:23.840 --> 59:24.840
Oh, I wish I could have stayed that long.

59:24.840 --> 59:27.880
I had to cut out by Wednesday, but you know, it was just the way it was, but I think that's

59:27.880 --> 59:29.880
one of the things that was really nice.

59:29.880 --> 59:35.240
Those lightning talks, there was, you know, Canonical people there, there were community

59:35.240 --> 59:36.240
people there.

59:36.240 --> 59:42.900
Nathan gave a great talk at the end about how he hopes app developers can improve things

59:42.900 --> 59:47.320
and how Canonical can improve things in Ubuntu and he's identified a bunch of, you know,

59:47.320 --> 59:49.760
places where we need to improve things.

59:49.760 --> 59:55.400
But there were other people who were invited to come along and, and participate in the

59:55.400 --> 59:56.400
SnapCraft room.

59:56.400 --> 01:00:05.440
For example, Mohammed Zedek works for a company that make robot ships that are quite cool

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:14.080
that go around in the sea and do stuff under the command of like computers.

01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:17.560
But it was really great having him in the room, in the SnapCraft room, working along

01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:22.160
with Kyle and Leo and Sergio from the SnapCraft team.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.160
And he was bringing real world problems.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:29.960
Like it's not, it's not hypothetical issues that are on a computer somewhere in a lab.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:35.880
This is a guy who has boats who are out in the sea and they need to be autonomously controlled

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.740
and they need to be updated securely and robustly.

01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:43.780
And he's talking directly to the people who are able to affect, you know, packaging his

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.440
software efficiently.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.440
And he gave a talk as well.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.440
And that was great fun.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:48.440
That's great.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.160
You know, one of the things that, and this is a small example, but it happened a few

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:54.680
times was a problem was identified.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:59.660
The issue was sort of quantified and then Upstream was given a suggestion and the patch

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:02.120
was actually created on site.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.960
And Popa, you could probably talk a little bit about the, one of them, which was like

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.160
a little doc issue when you're trying to switch desktops, kind of a small problem in totality,

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.300
but it was sort of a great example of how here's a problem I found and the fix got turned

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:14.300
around immediately.

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.960
I don't know which bug that is.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:20.080
You don't recall when you, when you scroll on the dash on the doc.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:21.080
Oh, that one.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.080
Yeah.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.080
Yeah.

01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:24.080
Yeah.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:30.400
So, yeah, we've got in 1710, we've got this new Ubuntu gnome, you know, user interface.

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:31.400
It's new.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.400
He's heard of it before.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.400
It's a bit different for us.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.920
You know, we used to Unity, we've been using it for years and years and years, and we got

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:39.160
this newfangled gnome stuff.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:44.720
And one of the community guys, Nathan, who was there, noticed that you could use the

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:48.600
mouse wheel to switch between desktops if you hover the mouse in the right place.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.460
But also it did it if you hover the mouse in the wrong place.

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:56.400
And so he walked up to the desktop people with his laptop and went, hey, look at this.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.380
And this, this is, like you say, one of the benefits of like, we're all remote users and

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:05.700
sometimes it's easy to articulate something in a bug report when you type it out.

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:10.040
But it's much easier to just walk up to a desktop developer and show them your laptop

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.840
and say, hey, this is, you know, this is the problem.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:19.600
So he files the bug and upstream, who is someone who happened to not be at the event, turned

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.560
around a bug in an hour or so.

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.560
And that was fixed.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:28.460
And it was a, it was a great collaboration between someone who works in the community,

01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:33.040
who identified an issue, the Ubuntu developers who are like, yep, this is the component you

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.160
need to file a bug against.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.880
He goes and files a bug, upstream are super attentive and they turn around a fix super

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.320
fast and we'll consume that in Ubuntu.

01:02:41.320 --> 01:02:44.200
That's, that is exactly what Ubuntu is all about.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:47.480
It was pretty neat to watch it, to be there for, oh, here's a problem.

01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:49.240
Oh, here's how you reproduce the problem.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.400
Oh, and here's the patch.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.920
Oh, and upstream's working on it already.

01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:55.320
Every bug contributor wish that's what happened every time.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:59.280
It was great to see just go boom, boom, boom, boom, the whole stage, every stage of the

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.280
process.

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.280
Yeah.

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.280
I dream of that every night.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.280
I wish, right?

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.320
If I could just grab them and make them look at this, how stupid this problem is.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:07.320
Yeah.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:10.880
I really had a good time and I actually enjoyed New York a lot more than I thought I would

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:11.880
do.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.880
I don't know.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:13.880
I went in there.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:14.880
So the studio's moving.

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:15.880
Is that what you're saying?

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:16.880
Yeah.

01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:17.880
Right.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:18.880
Yeah.

01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:19.440
When I want to become a millionaire, when I, when I, when I can afford, when I can afford

01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:22.640
to swank pads, yeah.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:28.680
You know, there was a couple other things that I, I will share as I left that really,

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:29.680
really blew me away.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.080
So for those of you that don't remember, because I don't know if we ever covered any of our

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.840
shows, because why would we?

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:43.720
Back in 2010, your buddy and mine, Mark Shuttleworth, bought himself not just a nice apartment in

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.760
New York, you know, a place to crash.

01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:53.960
He bought himself the nicest apartment in New York, a $31.5 million condo in, on the

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.840
17th floor, back in 2010.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:01.680
So there could be some, that could have been some reason as to why Mr. Shuttleworth wanted

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.520
to have an event in New York, but there could also be this.

01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:09.760
I was leaving the hotel Wednesday evening and I was all done.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:10.760
Yep.

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:11.760
Heading out of town.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:15.040
I was heading out of town and I, you, there is nothing to confirm this except for my word.

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.760
You'll just have to believe me for the story I'm about to tell you.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.440
Hadeah and I are waiting for our car from the valet because that's the only way you

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.520
can park at the Hyatt, the Grand Hyatt in Manhattan.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.000
It's not just any Hyatt.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
It's the Grand.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Yeah.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:33.920
You, you, you, you are, you are thankful that for $70 a night, they will valet your car

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:37.680
and you will thank them for it and you will tip them for it greatly.

01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:44.160
And so as I am waiting for my little car to be returned to me, uh, I am standing in front

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:46.680
of the rotating, what do you call those doors, Wes?

01:04:46.680 --> 01:04:48.640
Those rotating, um, what are those called?

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.640
Revolving.

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:50.640
Revolving doors.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.560
There's a series of revolving doors and I'm standing there in front of these gold doors

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:58.040
that are wrapped in gold and they're just beautiful glass swinging doors.

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.200
And dude, they weren't gold.

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.200
No, they were.

01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:02.200
On the Mez.

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.200
On the Mez.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.200
I'm on the Mez.

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.200
I'm on the Mez.

01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.200
Not the main entrance.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.200
The Mez.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.200
Yeah.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.400
On the Mez where the, uh, where the, uh, they're very fancy doors where you wait for

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.680
your car.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:20.040
And I, I kid you not, I, these right out of like a 1980s movie, the, the, uh, like a bankers

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:25.360
and like a guy that looks like the lead banker, uh, lawyers and a bunch of lackeys walk up

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.680
to me all wearing suits that look like they cost more than I make in a year.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:32.520
And they're standing next to me and they're going on and they're talking about deals and

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.520
they're just yammering and Hadid and I are looking at each other and we're just rolling

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:38.720
our eyes and I got all my stuff packed up and I'm holding it there and I'm just waiting

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.720
for my damn car.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.120
And now there's a group of stiffs is standing next to me talking about things from their

01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.400
little board cube.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:49.840
And I think that's just really adorable until they start talking about the value in data

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.840
centers.

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:51.840
I'm like, Oh, okay.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:52.840
That's interesting.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.760
And then they, and I'm, you just have to take my word for this.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:00.360
They start talking about the Shuttleworth deal and they're working on the Shuttleworth

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.600
deal because they think there's going to be a lot in data centers.

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:07.680
I don't know what that means, but as I was leaving the hotel, you didn't pry for more

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.680
info.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.920
You didn't pretend that you were, I was, I was flabbergasted because I was in civilian

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:13.920
mode.

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.920
I had my cameras and my microphones packed up.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.360
I'm waiting to get in my car.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.360
I'm going to do a hardcore drive.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.360
You're checked out.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.400
I literally totally checked out a hundred percent.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:27.360
And then these bankers show up, start talking about the Shuttleworth deal and I couldn't

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.660
believe my ears.

01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:34.400
What is the, what is the luck that a podcaster with a microphone would be standing next to

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.400
these guys?

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.800
And what is the luck of that?

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.120
And so I, that's all I got.

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.120
That's it.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:41.320
That was the totality of all of the secret information I learned.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:45.120
But I would suspect there was more to New York than meets the eye.

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:49.960
Dude, if you continue to pack your camera away, you're never going to be the next Casey

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:50.960
Neistat.

01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:55.480
I know I could have been the biggest, wouldn't that have been an ending to my inside the

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.480
Ubuntu rally vlog.

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.160
That would have been an ending.

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.760
Damn it, I didn't even think of that.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:01.760
Next time.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:02.760
Yeah.

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:03.760
I'll just have to come back.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.960
Although the ending that you have is pretty fantastic.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:06.960
Well thank you.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:07.960
Yeah.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.840
And well, of course it stars Ike, the very, very ending, which is of course how you want

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.840
to end every vlog.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.840
If you can.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.000
I'm just going to have to go to, I'm just going to have to go to that well over and

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
over again.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Yeah.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.840
So it was a great trip and it was, that was a funny way to end it.

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:26.080
And it was really neat to see how everybody worked together and how seriously everybody

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.320
took that.

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.680
It was great to see you and Noah actually.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.800
It was lovely sitting there doing my work on a daily basis and I'd look up every so

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:39.560
often and there's you walking around with a camera and Noah with a startled face every

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.560
so often.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:41.560
Yeah.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:42.560
That's amazing.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.560
Yeah.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:46.320
I managed, I managed to constantly keep Noah on his toes while we're going to events like

01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.320
that.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.320
One way or another I managed.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:49.320
I think that's your job.

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.320
Yeah.

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.900
There was also a moment where he and Ike got to get away and have a beer and have a good

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.040
chat and I think that was good because they've, they've had disagreements here on this very

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.040
show about.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.040
Yeah.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.040
That was a great spectator sport that evening.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.040
Did you attend that?

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:03.440
I bought beers and popcorn for everyone whilst that conversation was running.

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:04.440
Good for them though, right?

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:08.080
That's exactly the kind of thing you want to have happen at an event like that is just

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.080
kind of work it out.

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.360
And then, you know, at the end of the day, it sounded like they all kind of came to common

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:12.360
ground.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:13.360
So that's good.

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:14.360
They did.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:15.360
Yeah.

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:16.360
All right.

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360
Well, so there you go.

01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:18.360
That's the Ubuntu rally.

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:19.900
I actually have, so I have the, the, the vlog that I've now mentioned a couple of times

01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:23.680
obnoxiously that's coming out, it's already out, but I have a few more things from our

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:27.400
trip to New York that'll probably be in the next one as well, episode or vlog 59.

01:08:27.400 --> 01:08:30.480
I guess they're not called episodes for some reason.

01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:36.120
Anyways, I'll have more from New York, including from some of our friends over there at Canonical,

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:39.320
over at youtube.com slash Chris Fisher, if you want to watch that.

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:43.680
And also check out some of the links in the show notes for more information on how to

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:48.540
get involved in elementary OS, as well as the new announcement from the SnapCraft folks

01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:56.040
about Chrome 60 being packaged up as a snap and be sure to check out ask Noah 28 where

01:08:56.040 --> 01:09:00.160
in about the second half of that, he has an interview with one of the Canonical developers

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.560
about their efforts in Wayland from the Ubuntu rally.

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:08.920
And it just, I, I think just really great audio quality in that interview.

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:12.480
Like some of these interviews came out the best we've ever done from an event like, uh,

01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.480
on location.

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.840
So I think that's how we're going to do our future stuff too, cause like, it sounds like

01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:19.640
you're going to do your future stuff in very expensive hotels in New York.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.440
Once you've tasted it, how can you go back?

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:25.460
I meant how we recorded it, but yeah, I mean, when you hear the interview and ask Noah,

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:29.680
you would think that guy was in studio with Noah and they were there in the display server

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:32.640
room, just asking, you know, just having a chat.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.640
Yeah.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:34.980
So, uh, it really turned out pretty good.

01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:39.240
And that's ask Noah 28 and yeah, it was a, it was worth the trip.

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:44.320
I will say it was, we drove for days and days there and back and it was totally worth the

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:45.320
trip.

01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.320
We drove back.

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.920
We stopped in Salt Lake city and that was a lot of fun and I just, yeah, I really enjoyed

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.920
it.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:54.360
I think, um, I would probably do it a little differently and how I got there, but, uh,

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:59.360
I would absolutely do it again because I honestly feel like I'm walking away with years of understanding

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:05.560
and insight into how different community members themselves individually operate and how canonical

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.560
operates.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:10.400
And it's, I would, I would honestly just drive across the country to hang out with you guys.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.600
Sometimes I have, I really enjoy my time with Pope and I do, I just wonderful people.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.600
They really are.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.040
They really, truly are.

01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:21.040
And um, it's so nice because, you know, the episode before I left, I was all worked up

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:25.920
about Linux journalism and certain members in the community that are degrading the conversation.

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:31.180
And then I went to an event where people were just getting shit done and creating really

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:34.960
good stuff, not like average stuff, but really good stuff.

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:38.260
And then the people there are, or we're all a players.

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:42.220
Just everybody was on the a player team doing their piece and it was a real privilege to

01:10:42.220 --> 01:10:43.220
see all that.

01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:49.360
But it was a good sort of contrast from the episode I recorded right before I left.

01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:50.360
So yeah.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:51.360
Yeah.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.360
Yeah.

01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:54.040
I would, I would try to make it to a future event if they had it.

01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:55.040
All right.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.800
Well, we're not quite done just yet.

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.800
We have one more really cool thing.

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.320
There's always more on the Linux Unplugged Show.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.320
There is.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.900
Um, our friends over at the Nextcloud project are working on a feature that has been requested

01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:11.380
over and over again since probably before Nextcloud was even a project.

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:13.900
So Frank and Yoss are going to join us from the Nextcloud project.

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:17.200
But first got to thank Ting.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:21.300
Go to linux.ting.com to save a little money, like $25 off a device.

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:26.780
Or if you bring a device and they have CDMA and GSM, guess what you get $25 in service

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:27.780
credit.

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:28.780
What?

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:29.780
No way.

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:30.780
Yeah.

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:31.780
Now my bill will be slightly more this month.

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:32.780
I'll admit it.

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:33.780
I will admit it.

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:36.720
Driving across the country, having only my mobile device means I pay more this month

01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:37.720
on Ting.

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.720
Everything's more expensive at NYC.

01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.720
That's true.

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.720
That's just how it works.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:42.580
But the reality is that's what's great about Ting.

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.180
You pay for what you use.

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:49.460
So 11 months out of the year, my average bill, like $23.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:52.220
Now maybe it's going to be $65.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.900
This month I haven't gotten it yet.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:56.180
Not a big, like that works out.

01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:57.500
That math, that works out.

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.900
It's still cheaper than like everyone else's plan.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.580
I just, and that's why it's not a big deal.

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:04.300
Like the one or two months I go over on Ting, I'm like, I don't care.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:05.300
It's so liberating.

01:12:05.300 --> 01:12:06.300
It's surprising.

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:07.300
I was worried, honestly.

01:12:07.300 --> 01:12:09.300
I was like, okay, well, if I'm paying for what I use, am I going to be like nickel and

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:12.240
dime in myself in the back of my head, like, don't use data.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:16.060
But really it's like, if you want to be frugal, you are empowered to do so.

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:19.220
If you just want to pay for the data you use, it's great rates.

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:20.220
Yep.

01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:21.220
Yep.

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.220
And no contracts, nationwide coverage.

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:25.460
I used both CDMA and GSM during my coverage or during my trip.

01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:32.700
And the coverage was dramatically better than when it was when I went over to Noah's to

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:37.420
do like his tour of his house and his home automation back in last days, a few years

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:38.520
ago.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.420
This time, almost same route, dramatically better coverage.

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:46.420
Really in the past I had, in my past road trip, I had one or two days where I didn't

01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:47.420
have coverage.

01:12:47.420 --> 01:12:48.420
Oh yeah, I've been talking about that.

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:49.420
It's like Montana, dude.

01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:50.420
It's just like, it's like.

01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:51.420
People don't live there.

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:52.420
So why would they put cell towers?

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:53.900
No, it's way better now.

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.740
Like I had, I went from one or two days to one or two hours.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:57.740
Wow.

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:58.740
Yeah.

01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.740
Yeah.

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:04.700
And that's, you know, I was using both the GMA and the CDMA and the GSM networks, which

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:08.420
is my, my, my privilege on the Ting, on the Ting.

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:09.420
I really like it.

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:11.220
Plus it can turn it off when I'm not using it.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.220
That's really nice.

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:13.620
They have a great dashboard to manage all of it.

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:17.200
And because they have CDMA or GSM networks, that means there's more devices they support

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.020
that you could just bring with you that you already have.

01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.820
Or if you want to buy a device, that's great too.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.900
They have really great prices on devices or you can just get a SIM card and they're giving

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.420
away free data this fall.

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:29.740
You can get up to additional two gigabytes if you add a line and they have more details.

01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:30.740
Really?

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:33.300
Yeah, they got more details on their blog.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.300
You can check it out.

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:39.800
I'm going to linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com, a smarter way to do mobile.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.700
And thank you to Ting for sponsoring this year's show.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.540
And thanks to you guys for going to linux.ting.com.

01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.180
That way you get the discount and you support the show.

01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:51.780
Now you guys know I'm a Nextcloud user, so I'm always following the latest updates.

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:55.300
Really excited to have both Jas and Frank join us from the Nextcloud project.

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:58.060
Guys, welcome back to the show.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:59.060
Awesome to be here.

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.060
I think it's a first for Frank.

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:01.060
Oh, Frank.

01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:02.060
Yeah.

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:03.060
Yeah.

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.620
I know it's a fun Linux action show, but welcome to Linux Unplugged, Frank.

01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:06.620
Absolutely.

01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.100
Thanks for having me.

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:11.940
Well, guys, you know why you're here.

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:16.540
There is big news in Nextcloud land.

01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:21.480
Speaking of land though, Joe and I did cover the details sort of in depth on Linux action

01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.300
news episode 21.

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:25.060
So if you want to hear that, check that episode out.

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.940
But there's a piece I'd like to just deep dive into right off the top.

01:14:27.940 --> 01:14:31.420
We can talk about other stuff, but there's one aspect I really want to talk to you guys

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.420
about.

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:36.900
It's the new end-to-end encryption, the client-side encryption, because I imagine this is something

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:40.340
you guys have been hearing people ask for for a long time.

01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:45.820
So I'll start with Frank, and then you guys just sort of pass it back and forth as you

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:46.820
feel best.

01:14:46.820 --> 01:14:49.940
But Frank, from a project standpoint, how long have you guys been working towards this

01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:50.940
particular goal?

01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:54.940
Yeah, that's an excellent question.

01:14:54.940 --> 01:15:01.980
You mentioned already that it's a feature that is requested from the users for a long,

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:02.980
long time.

01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:03.980
For many, many years.

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:06.260
Yeah, I mean, encryption is a big deal to a lot of people.

01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:07.260
Absolutely.

01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:12.980
It's a totally big deal because the main point of Nextcloud is to secure your data and to

01:15:12.980 --> 01:15:16.860
protect your data and privacy and so on in the first place.

01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:19.460
And encryption, obviously, is a big part of it.

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:23.100
So we already support different kinds of encryptions for a long time.

01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:28.380
So obviously, all the transfer of data over the internet is done via HTTPS, TLS.

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:29.820
So this is already encrypted.

01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:33.960
And then we have server-side encryption, which also helps in some scenarios.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:40.220
But basically, having the full end-to-end, the client-side encryption, this is new.

01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:44.380
This was requested for a long time, for many, many years and discussed.

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:47.940
I mean, there are so many GitHub issues about, should we do it like this or should we do

01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:48.940
it like that?

01:15:48.940 --> 01:15:53.540
And it actually took a while, as you have noticed, to really do it.

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:57.480
And the reason is that it's actually hard because this is something where you really

01:15:57.480 --> 01:16:03.740
have to do it in a way that it doesn't compromise user experience, that it's really easy to

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:05.100
use and really secure.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.480
And it's also enterprise-ready.

01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:12.860
So with enterprise-ready, we mean that it fits into the way companies work, that you

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:18.460
have central key management and compliance regulations and so on.

01:16:18.460 --> 01:16:21.340
So this actually took us a while to do it the right way.

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:23.920
Yeah, I guess I want to just underscore that.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:27.800
Somebody who's implemented a lot of different solutions for companies over the past decade,

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:31.540
you can kind of get an idea when a project is building in some of the most fundamental

01:16:31.540 --> 01:16:36.420
features from the beginning versus racing to bolt them on after the fact.

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.380
And I will definitely give a tip of the hat.

01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:42.300
Without having tried it yet, I'll say, just from reading through this, you guys apparently

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:44.780
are doing that from the beginning right.

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:48.100
Like you said, you support creating offline administrator recovery keys.

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:50.220
I thought, okay, that's a great feature.

01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:52.880
But then you guys actually took it a step further, and I thought, these sons of guns

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:53.880
really get it.

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:58.900
Because so not only do you have administrative recovery keys, but the users get a warning

01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.660
that the administrator has used that recovery key.

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:05.840
And that's the kind of thing that I feel like Nextcloud, only Nextcloud does.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:06.840
I guess put it that way.

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.500
It's something that only Nextcloud does.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:11.580
And so Yas, I wanted to maybe jump over to you for a moment.

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:16.340
When I read through the post, I have it linked in the show notes, announcing the client-side

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:21.540
encryption, it came across to me, one word that came across to me probably the most predominantly

01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:23.020
was, humble.

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:27.320
It felt like a humble, like, we're doing this, we're going to give this a real go, but we

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.020
admit we're not totally there yet.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:31.100
Can you expand on that part for a bit?

01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:38.620
Yeah, so first going back a little bit to the thing you said about that, well, that

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.780
we warn users, right.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.420
I mean, this is really central.

01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:47.220
Like what Frank already said, it is hard to do because you have conflicting requirements

01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:48.860
and conflicting demands.

01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:53.460
Like you mentioned the recovery key.

01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:56.680
Now when you really think about it, you have end-to-end encryption.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:18:05.220
So that means that the data is encrypted on one device and decrypted on, well, the recipient

01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:09.500
device and nothing in between ever gets access to that data.

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.060
So what happens if you lose your password?

01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:14.580
Well, you lose your data.

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:16.220
That's pretty uncool.

01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:20.620
And I mean, that might be acceptable to some degree for the access security for most home

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:24.700
users, but for an enterprise user, that's of course, well, people forget their password

01:18:24.700 --> 01:18:25.940
all the freaking time, right.

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:28.060
This is totally not a solution.

01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:34.740
So you need this recovery key, but then if you enable that, well, that kind of compromises

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:38.460
security to, well, maybe a limited degree, but still, right.

01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:44.900
The way it works is when you enable the recovery key, the data gets encrypted to this key that

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:52.220
is given to the sysadmin and the sysadmin gets a password shown with which his key is

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.580
encrypted and this password is long.

01:18:54.580 --> 01:19:00.300
It's a 12 random words password, so it's really long and it gets shown only once.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:04.380
That's why we call it an offline key because you have to write it down because if you don't,

01:19:04.380 --> 01:19:09.460
well, once you close that window, there's no way to get this password back.

01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:15.180
So if somebody hacks your server, they don't have that password unless you were, well,

01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:19.300
stupid enough, no offense, to copy paste it and then store it on the server.

01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:20.300
You shouldn't, right.

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:24.820
You literally should take this offline, put it on a piece of paper or something or a USB

01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:26.620
stick and put it in a vault.

01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:28.700
That's at least what I would suggest.

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.700
And there are companies that literally have processes for this and that's what you should

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:32.700
do.

01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:41.220
But then this still, to some degree, you compromise security by this because still the admin could

01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:45.220
be, you know, well, you could literally put a gun to his or her head and say, okay, give

01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:47.340
me the bloody key, right.

01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:50.680
So especially when you're talking about a state actor like a government, they could

01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:54.100
simply demand that they have access to this key.

01:19:54.100 --> 01:19:58.420
And obviously a lot of people want to use Nextline to protect themselves against that

01:19:58.420 --> 01:19:59.420
specific scenario.

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:01.860
At least it's a part of it.

01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:08.060
So we warn the user that this key is enabled so that people can say, well, I'm using it

01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:10.140
as a public provider.

01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:14.260
And the moment this provider would enable the key, they would know that their security

01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:21.100
is essentially, well, compromised and they can say, okay, this is not cool, I'm out.

01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:23.660
Or they can at least know that it isn't enabled.

01:20:23.660 --> 01:20:30.500
That really is, it's something that, so Apple just published their quote unquote transparency

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:34.380
report, Google publishes one every quarter, so does Facebook, so does Twitter.

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:38.580
A lot of the tech companies publish these transparency reports in which they disclose

01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:40.920
that they've just been giving away information constantly.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.460
There's no notification to the end user.

01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:45.080
You don't know if you're one of the people in the disclosure because all the numbers

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.200
are randomized.

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:50.820
But in this particular case, the technology is built in such a way that the notification

01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:52.540
goes to the user.

01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:54.100
The technology is built that way.

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:56.140
That's why I say it feels like something only Nextcloud could do.

01:20:56.140 --> 01:21:00.140
But now I do want to talk about the fact that this is still preview and it seems like there's

01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:02.980
a bit of a humble pie in how you guys are approaching this.

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:03.980
Yes.

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:04.980
Yeah.

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:08.860
The thing is, of course, with that, I mean, security is really hard.

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:13.780
So first of all, what we already didn't do is like roll our own crypto or something like

01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:14.780
that.

01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:15.780
Right?

01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:18.900
I mean, there's been a lot of debate about, for example, Telegram who had a bunch of really

01:21:18.900 --> 01:21:24.300
smart mathematicians and, well, they thought that was good enough to be able to build good

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:25.300
security.

01:21:25.300 --> 01:21:27.820
Turns out, well, at least most security experts disagree.

01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:28.820
Right.

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:29.980
I mean, crypto is really hard.

01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:31.700
So we don't roll our own.

01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:37.980
We tried to find a cross section of algorithms, secure algorithms that are supported on all

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:43.820
the devices we want to support and use that and then just use like standard libraries

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:50.660
and open SSL on Linux and all the stuff that's available, Android and iOS and use those.

01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:55.660
But of course, it's also pretty well known that usually crypto isn't broken.

01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.180
It's worked around.

01:21:57.180 --> 01:21:59.060
So it's usually the implementation that's wrong.

01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:00.060
Right.

01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:04.740
There are some pretty famous examples of like devices that had really, really good crypto

01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:09.460
but then didn't actually check whether somebody tried to hack it and other stuff.

01:22:09.460 --> 01:22:16.540
So what we've done or what we're doing here is trying to put it out as early as possible

01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:20.860
so the wider community can have a look first at our design.

01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:25.500
Like is the way we do this, is this actually sensible?

01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:28.260
Will this protect the way we think it does?

01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:35.380
And that's quite complicated because you're really talking about just to create an identity.

01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:37.420
You're creating a whole bunch of keys.

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:40.180
You're signing some of the keys on the server.

01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:41.180
You need to store them.

01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:44.580
You need to encrypt the keys themselves in the right way, et cetera.

01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:46.500
So there's a whole description.

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:50.660
And if you download the white paper, you get even pretty pictures that explain the process

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:56.220
for each of these because it's pretty complicated the way we do it.

01:22:56.220 --> 01:23:03.160
For example, we didn't want that users would have to re-upload data if they would remove

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:07.300
somebody from the access list.

01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:10.700
So let's take a do-it-yourself way, right?

01:23:10.700 --> 01:23:13.840
And again, this is a great enterprise approach.

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:18.980
You've got employees that get fired or quit and all of a sudden you have to revoke access.

01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:22.820
How do you work around not having to re-encrypt all of the data?

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:25.180
So that was a key requirement.

01:23:25.180 --> 01:23:28.940
And the way we do it is by using a layered approach.

01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:33.180
So we encrypt each file with a unique key.

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:40.220
And then that key is stored in a metadata file, which is encrypted with a metadata key.

01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:45.500
And this key is in turn encrypted against all the people who have access to it.

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:51.180
So when you remove someone, all you have to do is create a new metadata key and re-encrypt

01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:52.180
it.

01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:53.180
That makes sense.

01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:57.060
You don't have to re-upload or re-download all the data.

01:23:57.060 --> 01:24:02.860
And this is just one example and we have many places where you have this multi-layer affair.

01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:07.100
And obviously we want to know from people whether they think it makes sense and whether

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:11.500
we didn't make any logical mistakes.

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.720
Obviously we've been working on this for a while, we have experience with this.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:20.020
We use similar technologies with the server-side encryption that also uses this layered approach,

01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.380
but a lot less complicated.

01:24:21.380 --> 01:24:26.060
I can tell you I was working on white paper for this and I wanted to make nice pictures

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:27.060
of it.

01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:31.260
And I looked at the pictures for server-side encryption and they had like in every area

01:24:31.260 --> 01:24:32.780
they had two or three steps.

01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:35.860
So I needed only to make two or three icons.

01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:38.300
Well here it's like six or seven.

01:24:38.300 --> 01:24:43.260
So it was really quite a pain in the ass to kind of portray it in a simple way.

01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:46.100
So actually I didn't have to do it.

01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:49.220
I let our designer help with that.

01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:55.700
But because it's complicated, well yeah it looks good I think, but the thing is of course

01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:56.700
it's complicated.

01:24:56.700 --> 01:25:01.300
And it would be stupid of us to assume that in our company even though we have I think

01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:06.340
very clever people to think that we have all the knowledge in-house to do this in a truly

01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:07.340
secure way.

01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:08.340
I like that.

01:25:08.340 --> 01:25:13.300
And so it seems like a very open-handed approach to the community to ask for guidance.

01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:17.300
There's a question that's coming in that I'd also like to know from Timelord, which I really

01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:20.820
feel honored that he traveled through time and space to ask this question.

01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:25.940
He says, I don't understand generally how are multiple devices handled like a phone

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:26.940
and a desktop?

01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:31.060
How do the keys that get you access to the encryption get transferred between those multiple

01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:32.060
devices?

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:33.060
Yeah.

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.060
Yeah.

01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:37.860
So I mean Frank I see you wanted to say something.

01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:39.860
I mean I can explain it.

01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:40.860
No, no, go on, go on.

01:25:40.860 --> 01:25:42.860
I had something related to it.

01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:43.860
All right.

01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:48.580
So the way that works is when you create an identity it is the very first step like you

01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:54.860
choose to client-side encrypt the folder and at that point identity is created for you.

01:25:54.860 --> 01:26:00.100
And this is a public and a private key and the public key becomes part of certificate

01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:05.940
that's signed by the server which is your secure identity so people can download that

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.460
identity from the server and check.

01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:10.420
Signed by your next cloud, your own personal next cloud server?

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:11.420
Exactly.

01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.420
Yes, exactly.

01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:13.980
You can't change by the way.

01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:20.340
We've done this in such a way because if somebody would take over the server and then create

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:26.020
a new identity for you and then well ask all the people you shared with to re-encrypt

01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:31.740
their data or at least a metadata key as we discussed for the new identity of yours they

01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.940
will be able to get access to your data.

01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:39.820
So you can't change an identity once it's created and you've shared with someone else

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:45.700
they download your identity, they check if it is signed by the server and after that

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:51.340
they will store it locally and if the identity would change they wouldn't trust that.

01:26:51.340 --> 01:26:54.400
So it's trust on first use tofu as they say.

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:58.700
So that's about the sharing but back to the multiple devices case.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:06.100
So we wanted to make it as easy as possible for people of course to add multiple devices

01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:09.020
but at the same time it had to be foolproof.

01:27:09.020 --> 01:27:12.940
Now foolproof already means you don't let people pick their own password and you try

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:15.820
not to give them an opportunity to forget it either.

01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:19.260
So you're taking out the human factor.

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:22.460
Well to some degree.

01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:26.460
This is like maybe if I can jump in like the human factor this is actually what makes everything

01:27:26.460 --> 01:27:27.460
difficult.

01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:28.460
Absolutely.

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:32.580
Because if you think that encryption when we said earlier that encryption is hard sure

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:36.820
there's an absolutely hard mathematical part to it like the actual encryption algorithm

01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:38.780
but this is something we don't invent.

01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:43.820
We use standard AES encryption for that though this already exists but a human factor in

01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:49.940
the right process is like you said this is the difficult part to make it really secure

01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:54.700
because sorry for Joss for interrupting but I find it's an interesting aspect that if

01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:59.820
you would allow people to pick their own passwords they probably would pick the same password

01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:06.180
than the normal login password from the company from the company active directory which is

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:10.700
then controlled by the admin they would probably use the same password which why I have two

01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:17.420
different passwords right and then the feature is sort of useless because then it's all if

01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:21.100
you hack the server and you have the password then you can also decrypt the data.

01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:25.580
But this is why I picked this approach that the password is generated for the user and

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:30.020
then of course the question is okay if you present this super long super secure password

01:28:30.020 --> 01:28:35.460
to the user how do they even I mean they can remember it but can they even write it down.

01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:42.220
I mean try to write down like whatever 50 character hex passwords that's no one gets

01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:46.340
this right but if you actually pick real words then it actually becomes possible.

01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:51.820
So sorry Joss for interrupting but this is this human factor which is the difficult part

01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:52.820
in this process.

01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:55.900
Yeah it makes a hundred percent sense Frank actually.

01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:59.740
So I was when I said the human factor I was serious I mean encryption is hard but not

01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:02.500
for computers it's hard for humans really.

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:06.100
And I exactly you know Frank I actually wanted to ask you something while I have you just

01:29:06.100 --> 01:29:08.500
sort of to match the theme of today's show.

01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:12.180
One of the conversations you and I had offline a long time ago and I know it's something

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:18.500
you've mentioned before on air with me too is the difficulty in some distributions and

01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:22.120
this is getting better than it was at the time you and I chatted but ship shipping old

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:26.000
versions at the time it was own cloud and now next cloud that are still vulnerable not

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.420
necessarily supported.

01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:32.660
So I'm curious to see what you think now about the evolution of universal packages to sort

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:35.540
of solve this problem like flat packs and snaps in particular.

01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:39.220
Are you following this at all and do you have any particular interest from a next cloud

01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:40.220
perspective.

01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:41.220
Oh absolutely.

01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:43.220
I'm absolutely following that.

01:29:43.220 --> 01:29:49.260
I mean I tried to a long time ago a long time ago and another like hobby project called

01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:55.700
the project which I tried to do with the open to the guys together to somehow solve

01:29:55.700 --> 01:30:03.260
this by this basically enable software developers to ship like new versions of the software

01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:04.260
directly to the end user.

01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:08.420
And this was an idea even long before own cloud or next cloud even existed.

01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:09.900
So I'm totally following that.

01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:13.740
That's basically one of my pet pet topics.

01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:20.020
So I think what's going on at the moment with like the flat pack guys and like like in the

01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:22.700
server world more like docker containers.

01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:23.820
This makes total sense.

01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.820
I mean this is just this makes total sense.

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:31.820
I mean in the old days like 20 years ago and longer than that like Linux distributions

01:30:31.820 --> 01:30:37.980
actually had the job of basically collecting all the source code files all the files that

01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:44.820
are floating around on the Internet by packaging it compiling it and putting it on floppy disk

01:30:44.820 --> 01:30:51.580
or CDs and ship it to the users and then hey this and on this CD you have everything that

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:55.460
exists in the Linux world like and you can use it.

01:30:55.460 --> 01:30:58.900
But this idea of course is obviously no longer works.

01:30:58.900 --> 01:31:03.740
So we have to do we have to do something in a way how it exists in the mobile world for

01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:08.820
a long time that you have an operating system which is it comes from someone and then you

01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:13.480
have like the applications and the applications that come directly from the software developers

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:16.980
via an app store or some other distribution mechanism.

01:31:16.980 --> 01:31:22.180
And this makes total sense and this is what we like to do and then the next load too.

01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:26.980
So in the future I hope that we can basically have a way to that we shipped our clients

01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:33.220
directly to users without basically going through the packaging of the distribution.

01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:36.660
We have an app image right now as of today.

01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:41.940
As a download from our server you can download an app image and this is already quite popular.

01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:47.860
So the app image is getting subtraction.

01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:53.020
Yeah well it is the only thing that we make right because for the other packages we rely

01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:57.940
on the distributions themselves and if you have you know SUSE and Fedora and you know

01:31:57.940 --> 01:32:02.580
most of the distribution simply have packages they have an active team that keeps the packages

01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:03.580
up to date.

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:04.580
Right.

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:10.060
But of course if they're not rolling release we're back to this problem of outdated software

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:14.580
and yeah if you then get the app image directly from us you don't have that problem.

01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:19.060
So guys I wanted to just sort of set the expectations with the audience as far as how baked this

01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:23.380
feature this client side encryption is and when they could expect it to start rolling

01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:25.940
out as like a really full-fledged feature.

01:32:25.940 --> 01:32:29.020
So who wants to tackle that one?

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:32.060
I'll leave it to you Frank.

01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.060
Sure.

01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:38.900
So this is as Jan already described at the moment what we have is a pre-release.

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:44.020
You can play around with it there will be like will get better there will be desktop

01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:49.260
client support and iOS support coming in the next few days so really fast but this is all

01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:52.740
in the preview in which we wanted to do to have like early feedback.

01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:57.100
So if you don't really want to test this or if you don't really care about giving feedback

01:32:57.100 --> 01:33:01.580
if you only want to use like something that's stable and production ready then this will

01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:04.900
be as part of next cloud 13.

01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:11.580
The next cloud 13 is the next big release of next cloud and this is scheduled I can't

01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:16.100
give you a like a real date at the moment but this year.

01:33:16.100 --> 01:33:21.300
So later this year later this year and this will be one of the main features not the only

01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:25.100
big features there will be a lot more interesting stuff but one of the main features of next

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:26.100
cloud 13.

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.100
So later this year.

01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:30.620
Well I can't wait and if you do want to try out the current preview version grab next

01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:36.460
cloud version 12.0.3 which I will be grabbing to kick the tires Joss Frank guys thank you

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:41.540
for coming on the show and really really happy to hear about this feature hitting next cloud

01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:47.740
just keep up the great work okay always all done by the community of course not by us

01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:54.140
well of course of course no not a lot of code is written by you know which is actually good

01:33:54.140 --> 01:34:01.620
yeah especially when it comes to the encryption stuff right guys well I really do appreciate

01:34:01.620 --> 01:34:05.500
you coming on the show and keeping us up to date and I will give that a good of it a try

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:11.340
is there anything else you guys want to mention before we run I'll go try it out and of course

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:16.540
download the white paper but if you try it out I mean the changes we make might even

01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:22.860
break the decryption of data that was encrypted of earlier version so seriously don't use

01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:29.460
this on any production data it's nice to play with but nothing more just good a big one

01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:32.540
yeah that's a great warning and I will do that I will I will keep that in mind when

01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:37.060
I test it so thank you guys very much for coming on the show all right well that will
