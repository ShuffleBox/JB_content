1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
So they say it's a phone that's designed so you don't use it.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,240
It's called the Light Phone, and Brandt

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,080
has his hands on a minimal phone with a neat trick.

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,840
It's got an e-ink display.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,600
I do.

6
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,840
And I must say, this phone fits the hand so well.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,600
If you remember the original iPhone,

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,520
it's kind of like it's a bit smaller than that, actually.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,700
It's beautiful.

10
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,880
And light would be accurate.

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,980
It doesn't weigh hardly anything.

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,160
But this phone is really neat.

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,520
It's simplistic.

14
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,400
So you have to be sort of up for that.

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,480
And I'm struggling here to get the screen on.

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,280
There we go.

17
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,640
Is it slow with e-ink?

18
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,960
Does it take a second or two for things to update?

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,480
I think if you're used to a modern phone,

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,960
I would call this like a meditative phone,

21
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,600
because you have to give it a moment to react

22
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,440
to anything you do.

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,040
But it gives you that split second

24
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,240
to think about your life choices.

25
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,960
Does it have apps?

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,080
Does it do maps?

27
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,320
OK, let's call them apps.

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,800
But it does do things.

29
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,780
So here we go.

30
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,720
I'm pulling up the menu, which takes it

31
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,840
kind of like flashes between menus to clear the screen.

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,140
That's the kind of e-ink perk, I suppose.

33
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,720
Well, yeah, the mark of e-ink as it updates, yeah.

34
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,600
Implementation detail, perhaps.

35
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,240
Right.

36
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,960
I was kind of surprised, because the screen is simplistic,

37
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,960
but easy enough to read in full sunshine and stuff like that.

38
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,520
So that was impressive.

39
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,640
You asked about apps.

40
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,120
So I've brought up the apps menu, which

41
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,200
when I got my hands on this, it only

42
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,080
had three apps, which was phone, alarm, and calculator.

43
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,840
However, we've discovered that there are many more apps

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,840
to add, which includes directions, which

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,140
is very exciting, and I'll talk about it in a moment.

46
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,120
It does have a music app.

47
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,360
That seems essential.

48
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,600
It also has, Chris, podcasts, which I haven't tried yet.

49
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,640
You haven't tried that?

50
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,120
Come on.

51
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,440
How did you not listen to a Linux

52
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,000
unplugged first thing you did?

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,680
I know.

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,520
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,240
I've disappointed you all.

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,180
So Heather and I tried the directions,

57
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,800
because we thought, holy gee, that seems pretty advanced

58
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,240
for such a simplistic device.

59
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,360
And there are kind of two views.

60
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,120
Actually, it found the addresses of the local Home Depot

61
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,920
we were trying to get to very quickly.

62
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,640
So I don't know what the underpinning is,

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,680
whether it's OpenStreetMaps, or if it's actually

64
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,040
just Google in the back.

65
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,080
Maybe some handy listener can let us know.

66
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,760
But it did really well.

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,440
You have to expect that it's of this light phone design.

68
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,960
So the map itself is kind of like, hmm, imagine Pong,

69
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,000
but it's trying to tell you where to go.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,100
So very simplistic lines and things.

71
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,560
And it's kind of delayed a little bit, which is not

72
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,440
that helpful if you're driving.

73
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,560
However, if you're hiking or something,

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,920
I imagine that would be perfect.

75
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,080
But we used the text instructions,

76
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,480
and it was perfect.

77
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,040
Got us there.

78
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,320
So I would say if you're looking for a phone that

79
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,720
is trying to keep you disconnected,

80
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,120
this is pretty good.

81
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,240
And it also has hotspots.

82
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,680
So if you want to carry your real phone around,

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,720
you could do that, too.

84
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,520
It definitely seems like it has a more simplified UI.

85
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,080
And they kind of brag about it not having social media.

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,240
From what I can find online, LiteOS, all they really say

87
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,000
is it's built with React.

88
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,080
So I'm not quite sure the details

89
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,240
on the underpinnings of it.

90
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,760
But it also seems like they're picking up

91
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,960
the bill for the cost to run those maps right now.

92
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,240
Wow.

93
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,720
That is something.

94
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,440
That's impressive.

95
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,840
I would say that's probably a feature that a lot of users

96
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,400
are asking for.

97
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,720
And if you're trying to get around with this,

98
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,280
I think it's there.

99
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,800
It's there.

100
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,960
So that sounds really quite amazing.

101
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,000
The battery, I think if you're not using maps,

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,360
and you're not using the hotspot,

103
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,480
it lasts quite a long time.

104
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,720
But it certainly doesn't if you're using those,

105
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,600
let's say, advanced functions.

106
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,320
You would hope that e-ink screen would

107
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,760
mean that it has a week-long battery life or something

108
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,520
like that.

109
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,000
But it sounds like it's a kind of standard battery life

110
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,400
if you're using sort of standard smartphone features.

111
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,600
Yeah, exactly.

112
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
But that being said, I'm sure the battery in this

113
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,040
is a fraction of the size.

114
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,760
So pretty neat phone.

115
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,280
There you go.

116
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,680
It's the Light Phone 2.

117
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,320
We'll have a link in the show notes.

118
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,920
It looks like it's about $299 if you buy the North American

119
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,760
model.

120
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,320
And there's a pre-order with the next plan

121
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,880
to ship mid-October.

122
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,480
I haven't seen it yet, but I saw pictures on their website.

123
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,440
And I think Brent's description of the original iPhone

124
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,680
that size, maybe slightly smaller screen,

125
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,480
that's about right.

126
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,240
So there you go, Wes.

127
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,480
Time to get rid of your Pixel and get yourself a Light Phone.

128
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:20,980
Uh-oh.

129
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:31,560
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

130
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,440
My name is Chris.

131
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,600
My name is Wes.

132
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
My name is Brent.

133
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,560
Hello, gentlemen.

134
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,260
You know, this episode is brought to you

135
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,440
by the all new A Cloud Guru.

136
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,840

138
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
of hands-on labs.

142
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,120
Well, coming up on the show today, about a month ago,

143
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,320
I switched to a new daily driver Linux distro.

144
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,820
And I didn't say anything.

145
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,400
Didn't want to mention it on the show.

146
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,640
I just thought it would be, honestly, a fading thing

147
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,440
that I just thought would a fling, a Linux fling,

148
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,680
if you will.

149
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,760
But then I started to realize, you know,

150
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,000
there is an important place for fun in the Linux distro world.

151
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I want to share a little diamond in the rough.

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,960
I even talked Wes into giving it a go and trying it out.

153
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,760
We're going to tell you all about that later today

154
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,640
and maybe even have a conversation

155
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,600
about the place for fun Linux distributions

156
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,000
in the overall ecosystem.

157
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,680
So welcome in.

158
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,280
And before we get to any of that,

159
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,600
I have got to say time-appropriate greetings

160
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,400
to our Mumble Room.

161
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,240
Hello, Virtual Lug.

162
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,740
Hello.

163
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,440
Hello, Chris.

164
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,940
Hello, Wes.

165
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,440
Namaste.

166
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,560
Hello.

167
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,000
Hello.

168
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
Thank you for being here, everybody.

169
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,320
Yeah, we're going to need your support today.

170
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,220
Yes, it does.

171
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,400
It feels like it's an episode where we're

172
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,320
going to need people's support.

173
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,080
So we do have chapter markers.

174
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,640
So I'm going to give you everybody a brief update

175
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,880
on their reunion road trip.

176
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,360
But if you just want to get to the Linux stuff,

177
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,520
hit the chapter.

178
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,360
But since our last episode, since we gathered together

179
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,760
last time, my slides that I've talked about before

180
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,040
on the show have been fixed, thankfully.

181
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,000
It's great.

182
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,120
Very happy.

183
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,640
Working really good.

184
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,160
The shop doesn't necessarily want

185
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,120
me to give them publicity about it yet,

186
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,760
because they're still in the R&D phase.

187
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,160
But when they do, I'm going to be telling people about it,

188
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,200
because life changer for us.

189
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,640
And for a solid 15 minutes, I felt

190
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,360
like Lady Joops was in the best shape of her life.

191
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,600
And I felt amazing that my home, here it is, six years old,

192
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,440
was better than ever.

193
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,200
Like, I felt on fire.

194
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,400
It was just great, and not in a bad way.

195
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,800
About 15 minutes later, though, I

196
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,300
experienced extreme disappointment,

197
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,160
as I discovered a major issue with Lady Joops, my RV,

198
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,280
while pulling out of the shop that fixed our slides.

199
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,920
I literally discovered the next devastating issue.

200
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,680
I didn't even make it 15 minutes with the victory.

201
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,840
It was just awful.

202
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,560
So I had to park it again.

203
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,800
Our rear driver's side had a supposedly indestructible Sumo

204
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,920
spring that was ripped away from its top mount,

205
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,480
causing the spring to fall over onto our inner dually tire.

206
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,360
I can only presume, because I apparently

207
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,760
decided to take a tour of America's worst roads

208
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,280
and between Colorado, parts of New Mexico, which

209
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,840
parts of New Mexico are a lot better,

210
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,680
but some parts of New Mexico are not,

211
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,160
and Arizona, which is a hell-failed state,

212
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,360
has the worst roads probably in the country.

213
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,400
I can only imagine, because there are just

214
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,520
entire sections of the road that are missing.

215
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,280
So you literally can't have worse roads,

216
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,700
because there are parts where there are no road.

217
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,960
Did you take a piece of the road as a souvenir for your trip,

218
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,440
I hope?

219
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,260
I took a piece of the RV as a souvenir.

220
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,600
That's what happened, is that driving around

221
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,400
and all that stuff.

222
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,800
It was really damaging.

223
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,200
And when that spring fell onto our tire,

224
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,400
it's there for a while.

225
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,280
There's significant rub damage on the spring.

226
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,280
So I don't know what the condition of that tire is,

227
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,120
and a blowout there could be extremely, extremely dangerous.

228
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,640
So I determined it was just too dangerous to drive

229
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,880
with a broken rear suspension and a tire that had been

230
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,480
significantly rubbed.

231
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,520
I got the OK from the shop, and I never even

232
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,000
got to leave their parking lot.

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,400
No hookups either, of course.

234
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,000
And this was the Friday before the long Labor Day weekend.

235
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,240
About 3 PM, and all of Tucson had already shut down.

236
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,740
No shops, no techs, no parts departments.

237
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,320
Nobody was answering the phone.

238
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,520
You're just stranded.

239
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,480
Totally stranded, dude.

240
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,160
Totally stranded on a Friday when

241
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,640
we had been intending not only to be driving

242
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,060
the entire weekend, but I had an event

243
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,400
that I was going to where I wanted to potentially meet

244
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,400
two new potential hosts on the network for a show

245
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,020
that we were considering doing.

246
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,680
And I wanted to have an in-person meeting with them

247
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,760
to kind of suss them out, and talk to them, and see where

248
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,560
they're at, and really get a feel for it.

249
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,440
And now that's not happening.

250
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
So this has an impact on my business, too.

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,160
So we get stuck here the Friday before Labor Day weekend.

252
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,880
We check Amazon.

253
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,920
They've got these Sumo springs, but they're a week

254
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,000
and change out, like into next week.

255
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,280
And we just spent the weekend roasting in 105 degrees.

256
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,160
Most days about 105.

257
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,080
The sun from sunrise to sunset was beating down on Lady Joops.

258
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,160
When I was doing LAN on Saturday evening,

259
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,960
it got up to 122 degrees inside Lady Joops.

260
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,680
It's crazy, right?

261
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,760
Because it's a hot car in the sun.

262
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,460
And when you turn off any kind of airflow,

263
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,080
it just heats up in here like crazy.

264
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,380
And we're constantly managing the generator temperature,

265
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,880
and the inverter temperature, and the battery temperatures,

266
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,840
because everything's working at its max

267
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,600
to try to generate enough power to run air conditioning, which

268
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,220
causes everything to overheat.

269
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,800
And when it's 105 degrees outside,

270
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,640
and the sun is beating down on the bays that

271
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,440
contain your electrical system, it's

272
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,800
an impossible, impossible battle.

273
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,360
The food in our cupboards started to go bad.

274
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,680
Like cleaning sprays started to separate and get gross.

275
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,200
Up front where I'm recording, there's

276
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,480
the smell of burning plastic.

277
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,200
It starts around 10 AM and lasts all day,

278
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,160
just the smell of plastic burning.

279
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,320
I mean, we are literally baking our RV, and ourselves,

280
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,040
and Levi in this parking lot.

281
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,280
So we knew we needed to attempt a fix.

282
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,120
Even if nobody was available, nobody could help us.

283
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,080
We knew we had to do something, because we are dying here.

284
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,000
I mean, I'm literally getting heatstroke like every day.

285
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,600
When I record, I get heatstroke, because as I record,

286
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,720
like this show right now, it'll get up to 130 degrees in here.

287
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,680
It's absolutely mental.

288
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,440
It is inhospitable to human life.

289
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,260
Man was arrogant to ever build in Tucson.

290
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,000
So we decided to try to do something.

291
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,360
And we're from Seattle.

292
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,400
We're used to 70s this day.

293
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,200
I mean, Wes, what's the temperature right now?

294
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,360
It's the beginning of September.

295
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,440
What's the weather outside?

296
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,040
Ooh, checking the weather report.

297
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,440
It's 72 and partly cloudy today.

298
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,360
Oh, oh, yeah, 72, right?

299
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,480
So you can see, like, here I am, September.

300
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,120
It's 105 degrees.

301
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,920
The sun is beating down directly on the spot

302
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,720
where our tire and our suspension is.

303
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
We could only be crawling around on the ground doing stuff

304
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,220
down there for like 10 minutes at a time,

305
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,320
and then we're dying.

306
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,960
So what we realized is we got to get out here like 5 AM, 6 AM,

307
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,160
when it's only like 85 degrees Fahrenheit.

308
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,040
Only.

309
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,000
And I took a pass at it, and I went inside,

310
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,240
and Hadia went out, my wife.

311
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,840
She took a pass at it, and she managed

312
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,160
to hook the suspension up.

313
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,240
She hooked the Sumo spring up using bungee cords.

314
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,440
So it was hanging in place.

315
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,840
At least it wasn't touching the tire anymore.

316
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,320
And we thought, OK, we can make it 10 minutes down the road

317
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,600
where we'd seen an RV park.

318
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,840
We could test this.

319
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,200
We can make sure it's working before we go.

320
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,800
This is going to work out OK.

321
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,160
This is about Sunday.

322
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,760
This is Sunday.

323
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,980
Wes and I recorded Saturday, so that way I could use Sunday

324
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,120
to try to fix this for Linux Action News.

325
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,520
And Sunday rolls around.

326
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,240
Midday, we're feeling pretty good.

327
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,720
We're ready to test it.

328
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,080
And the first alert.

329
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,360
You know when you get like the amber alert on your phone

330
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,200
and it buzzes and stuff?

331
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,240
The first one comes in.

332
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,680
Severe thunderstorm alert.

333
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,760
OK, all right, that sounds bad.

334
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,680
The next one, major hail storm, massive property damage

335
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,880
from these giant hail balls stay inside.

336
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,160
I'm like, oh, God, that's going to probably destroy our solar

337
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,040
panels.

338
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,600
Then about 20 minutes later, maybe 15 minutes,

339
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,760
we get a dust storm alert instructing everyone

340
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,800
to remain indoors, not to travel, and to take shelter.

341
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm like, jeez, a dust storm too?

342
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,600
And then about 30 minutes after that, maybe less,

343
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,600
maybe 15 minutes, we get a very alarming and very serious

344
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,680
tornado warning that a tornado is in the area.

345
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,680
And it specifically says in the tornado warning,

346
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,540
mobile homes will be destroyed.

347
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,960
That's what it says in the tornado.

348
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,200
We're sitting here in our RV, and we

349
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,880
get a push notification that says mobile homes are

350
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,440
about to be destroyed.

351
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:31,480
As that clears, then we get a flash flood alert warning.

352
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,200
This all is like within an hour, all of these alerts.

353
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,920
And the wind, it starts picking up.

354
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,800
And at first, we're like, jeez, it

355
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,320
doesn't look so bad out there.

356
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,120
We look outside, and it's clear blue skies.

357
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,800
Oh, it doesn't seem so bad.

358
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,680
And then I notice the awning starts to flap,

359
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,000
and then it starts to flap more.

360
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,040
So I pull the awning in, our only, only source of shade.

361
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,860
And then the winds really pick up.

362
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,160
It starts rocking the rig.

363
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,160
And I bring up the radar of the storm,

364
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,320
and I can see we're just on the edge of the storm.

365
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,040
So it's way too windy and chaotic to actually drive,

366
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,780
but we're not getting the brunt of this thing.

367
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,820
There was nothing about this in the forecast, which

368
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,620
I had been watching like a hawk, by the way,

369
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,000
because it's literally life and death right now.

370
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,080
So I watch it multiple times a day.

371
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,080
There was nothing in the forecast about any of this.

372
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,880
It just starts dumping rain on us.

373
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,720
But we figured we can handle the rain

374
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,880
because we're from Seattle.

375
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,280
So we go out, and we start testing the rig

376
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,860
in their parking lot, trying to get it to rock back and forth

377
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,560
to see if our bungee patch will hold long enough for us

378
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,320
to get 10 minutes down the road so we can hook up to power

379
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,920
and at least run our air conditioning nonstop.

380
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,560
And we test it in the driveway, and it seems like it holds.

381
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,500
And so we set off towards the campground

382
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,600
we had spotted earlier.

383
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,720
And about five minutes into the drive,

384
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,760
the rain picks up to monsoon level.

385
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,000
I mean, it just starts slamming Tucson, raining so hard

386
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,920
you could only see a few feet in front of the RV.

387
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,160
And almost instantly, parts of the road begin to flood.

388
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,280
Looking like almost a river rushing down the road.

389
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,800
And thankfully, Joups' heavy butt could manage it,

390
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,840
and so we kept on going.

391
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,160
But I couldn't believe how fast it was happening.

392
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,700
And when we arrived at the campground,

393
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,920
the rain slowed down, but it continued to pour.

394
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,160
So of course, I'm out there hooking up electricity

395
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,840
because that's why I'm there.

396
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,180
And it's still, even though all of this is going on,

397
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,240
it's still 9,800 degrees outside.

398
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,920
So you still need everything hooked up.

399
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,960
You still need air conditioning.

400
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,080
You need the water.

401
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,200
So I'm out there just getting completely drenched.

402
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,320
Horrible.

403
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,480
Everything's dripping.

404
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,240
And thankfully, power's good.

405
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,080
AC's been running.

406
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,140
We've been here since Sunday.

407
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,920
It has been livable.

408
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,320
With the AC going 24-7, both of them,

409
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,320
it maintains about 86, 87 degrees in here during the day,

410
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,720
during the afternoon, 87 degrees, maybe 88.

411
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,820
We can really only bring it 20 degrees below

412
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,340
whatever it is outside.

413
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,680
So as the temperature skyrockets outside,

414
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,900
we kind of go with it.

415
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,720
We just have a 20 degree buffer inside,

416
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,680
and it removes the humidity,

417
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:53,440
which is historically high in Tucson while we're here,

418
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,760
which has resulted in historic growth of bugs,

419
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,240
which has meant we are covered in bug bites

420
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,440
because they've never had this many bugs here before

421
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,400
while we're here.

422
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,560
It's been absolutely wild.

423
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,380
And because it's the Labor Day weekend,

424
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,040
we had no progress on getting parts.

425
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,160
We had to wait until this morning, Tuesday,

426
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,680
to start making as many calls as we could.

427
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,240
Shops around here have been shockingly misinformed

428
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,520
about how these Sumo Springs,

429
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,640
which are extremely popular and well-known, how they work.

430
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,000
It's been alarming, like some of these shops,

431
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,560
what they do and don't know.

432
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,080
And we're hoping to get some sort of temporary fix in place,

433
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,600
maybe get them removed even

434
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,720
so we can just make the drive home.

435
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,900
Ideally, I'd love to have the shop

436
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,260
that originally installed them fix it,

437
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,360
but I don't know if we can make it up to Oregon.

438
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,680
And the other issue is,

439
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,640
now that we've ended up getting stuck here for so long,

440
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,140
we've ended up pushing into another heat wave.

441
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,940
And so our drive home is over 100 degrees in many places,

442
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,400
all the way until Southern Oregon.

443
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,280
California is gonna experience a massive heat wave next week.

444
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,560
I-5 corridor will be over 100 degrees.

445
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,240
When does that happen in California, right?

446
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,280
And it's gonna be miserable everywhere.

447
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,160
So it has actually crossed my mind, as a last resort,

448
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,680
I've never really thought about this before,

449
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,140
but I am now considering abandoning ship

450
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,260
and putting jupes in storage

451
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,720
and driving home in our chase car

452
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,960
and then fly back down here later.

453
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,520
But of course it's super expensive.

454
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
Well, and that's just gotta be hard emotionally too, right?

455
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,000
I mean, you're abandoning your home basically.

456
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,520
Yeah, I didn't go on this reunion road trip

457
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,600
to abandon my home,

458
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
just after I got the slides fixed too, right?

459
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,660
Like that wasn't the goal here.

460
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,980
You don't go on a road trip to leave your vehicle behind.

461
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,960
And yeah, it is our home.

462
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,560
And it's like, so you'd wanna make sure

463
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,420
it's really well taken care of while we're not here.

464
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,600
And it's miserable because I don't know how safe it is

465
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
to drive on this or not.

466
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,280
I assume because the tire has been rubbed,

467
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,240
I should get it checked out professionally.

468
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,840
So I assume I shouldn't probably drive that far

469
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,720
until I make sure my inner dually isn't gonna explode on me.

470
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,520
I imagine that our temporary fix with a bungee cord

471
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,880
isn't gonna last 1400 miles.

472
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,960
In 100 degree weather, probably not.

473
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,800
Right?

474
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,680
And with roads that suck.

475
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:00,140
And so we're using the crap out of our suspension system.

476
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,520
It is become an impossible situation.

477
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,680
And I feel like the shows will suffer because of it

478
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,720
because I'm miserable.

479
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,800
I'm barely making it through the days.

480
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,040
There's almost every day I've gotten heat stroke,

481
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,880
mild heat stroke,

482
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,860
and I don't manage to recover

483
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,240
until about an hour or two after the sun sets.

484
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,960
And the days I record, the RV gets so hot

485
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:20,060
that it never really gets down until like 10 p.m. at night

486
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,480
and back into a reasonable temperature

487
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,400
and reasonable being low 80s inside.

488
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,600
So it's just, you know,

489
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,460
it's like I didn't wanna come to Tucson for the meetup.

490
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,400
I came to Tucson to get the RV fixed.

491
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,420
My slide broke in May.

492
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,160
And I waited until September

493
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
to just try to wait out the heat.

494
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,240
With three kids during summer break,

495
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,720
I waited with a broken living room slide.

496
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,480
So I wasn't in Tucson in the dead middle of summer,

497
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,460
like in August or something stupid like that.

498
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,340
And I still am getting screwed by this weather.

499
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,240
It's just, it's horrible.

500
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,400
It's been really rough.

501
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,840
And so I don't really know what I'm gonna do.

502
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,560
I don't know where I'll be next week.

503
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,520
I don't know where I'm gonna be later

504
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,040
for recording self-hosted.

505
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,960
It's just been awful.

506
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,720
Stay tuned for the next Linux Unplugged everyone.

507
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,000
Hopefully there'll be one.

508
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,240
Yeah, hopefully there will be.

509
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,280
And you know, and then to make things extra difficult,

510
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,960
the server is out at the studio.

511
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,800
We haven't had a chance.

512
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,920
There's nothing, nothing could be done while I'm not there.

513
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,680
And so like that is,

514
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,160
extra hoops have to be jumped through for production.

515
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,980
And just all these things,

516
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,560
like all these little things are adding up

517
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,440
to make this end of the trip really difficult.

518
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,380
And ironically, this is the wing of the trip

519
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,080
I thought was gonna be smooth sailing

520
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,760
because we'd have working slides.

521
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,080
It was just gonna be Hadia and I.

522
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,480
We went from three kids and three adults

523
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,240
to just two adults.

524
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,080
And smooth sailing with no hard deadlines.

525
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,620
Like we didn't have any meetups to get to

526
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,460
or anything like that.

527
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,480
It was just take our time.

528
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,960
And yet now here we are stuck in an area

529
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,520
we never intended to be for more than a couple of days.

530
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,560
And we're so desperate to get home now

531
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,200
that we are gonna have to push like hell

532
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,680
once we can get out of here.

533
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,280
It's a totally unfortunate situation.

534
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,680
And it's just sort of one of the random things

535
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,800
that can happen on a road trip this long, I suppose.

536
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,760
And the part shortage that's going on

537
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,200
affects the RV industry as well.

538
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,200
So funny enough, the shop in Oregon has the parts we need,

539
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,280
but the shops here at Tucson don't.

540
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,480
And so like, it's just one of those things

541
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,680
where if we were back at home right now,

542
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,780
we wouldn't have a part shortage.

543
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,120
That shop happens to have stock,

544
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
but these ones down here, they don't.

545
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,140
And where they would get their stock from

546
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,500
is the shop we use back up in Oregon.

547
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,580
Chris, may I ask how your tech infrastructure

548
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,000
has lasted in this heat?

549
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,060
There was one day where I shut everything down

550
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,080
just because we couldn't keep up with the heat.

551
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,280
And so I turned it off just to make sure,

552
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,060
it was getting so, so hot.

553
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,900
But otherwise it's been holding pretty well.

554
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,980
Thankfully the road trip to Texas last year,

555
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,800
I kind of, you know, I learned a few tricks

556
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,200
to keep that stuff running.

557
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,200
But yeah, not fun, not fun.

558
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,040
It is great to have working slides again.

559
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,720
And if it was, you know, in the mid eighties

560
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,960
and I was stuck here, it'd be no problem, right?

561
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,800
That'd be no problem.

562
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,400
Even low nineties would work because again,

563
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,160
we can get it down 20 degrees.

564
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,800
So whatever the ambient temperature outside is,

565
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,680
we can bring it down 20 degrees.

566
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,160
Of course, some of that's offset by the fact

567
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,300
that we're in direct sun,

568
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,360
but at least now we're at a campground with power and water.

569
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,560
So we can just turn them on and let them run.

570
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,920
And we don't have to worry about using up gasoline

571
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,760
and all that kind of stuff.

572
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,800
Cause that was another problem of course,

573
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,280
we were stuck, didn't have gas.

574
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,520
So let's talk about good news.

575
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,800
Let's talk about ingenuity.

576
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,840
You know, that little Linux copter on Mars,

577
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,280
it has really, really done well.

578
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,160
I mean, above and beyond.

579
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,200
We've talked before about how well it's doing

580
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,540
because it was only supposed to fly five times.

581
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,400
And yet the little helicopter on Mars

582
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,600
has completed 12 flights now

583
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,520
and given its stunning and unexpected success,

584
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,520
the US space agency has extended the admission indefinitely.

585
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,040
The little helicopter that could

586
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,040
has become a regular travel companion

587
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,780
of the Rover Perseverance.

588
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,800
So given all of its awesome success,

589
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,440
NASA says it's on board

590
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,360
with keeping this thing flying indefinitely, if possible.

591
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah, according to Josh Ravitch,

592
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,800
the head of Ingenuity's mechanical engineering team,

593
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,200
everything is working so well.

594
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,360
We're doing better on the surface

595
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,640
than we had ever expected.

596
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,780
And we've actually been able to handle winds greater

597
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,400
than we could really have ever hoped.

598
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,960
To add onto that, you know,

599
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,460
Ingenuity, it's not just a tech demo anymore.

600
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,820
At first, that was kind of the goal.

601
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,720
Could it fly at all?

602
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,800
You know, would this all survive the landing,

603
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,280
the harsh temperatures?

604
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,140
But now they're actually doing real helpful science.

605
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,360
According to Ken Farley,

606
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,920
head of Perseverance's science team,

607
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,320
photos taken by Ingenuity during its 12th flight

608
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,400
showed that a region that they might have wanted

609
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,560
to check out with the Rover,

610
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,840
which of course takes a lot longer to get there,

611
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,360
well, the photos showed it was kind of just boring.

612
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,240
And so they might actually not send the Rover there.

613
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,300
Okay, maybe that's boring,

614
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,400
but that means valuable time is saved

615
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,240
and they can go look for more interesting areas

616
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,560
to do better science.

617
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,940
That seems huge, actually.

618
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,520
That seems like a great use of the Linux Copter.

619
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,820
Yeah, it really does.

620
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,520
And hopefully it's gonna keep going, right?

621
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,480
I mean, in theory, it's been doing well,

622
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,040
but there is an approaching Martian winter,

623
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,920
kind of the reverse problem you're having, Chris.

624
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,540
So we'll see, fingers crossed that Ingenuity makes it out.

625
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,840
But regardless of what happens

626
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,160
with our favorite first Copter,

627
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,280
NASA now has a whole bunch of data from all those flights

628
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,280
and is already working on a next generation successor or two.

629
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,960
Maybe something in the 20 to 30 kilogram range,

630
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,200
able to carry science payloads.

631
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,440
Ooh, very cool.

632
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,480
I mean, just as a reconnaissance little robot too,

633
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,000
it's so awesome.

634
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,320
And I could see the winter being particularly challenging.

635
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,240
The great thing is if it survives,

636
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,820
you know the software is gonna run.

637
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,500
It's gonna just keep going, so.

638
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,040
You just say that because it's powered by Linux.

639
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,600
Yeah, that's right, that's right.

640
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,560
Well, let's talk about our friends over at Plasma.

641
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,400
Plasma's Wayland session is getting really, really stable,

642
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,300
at least just recently following a bunch of fixes.

643
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,920
And of course, KD developer, Nate Graham,

644
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,180
continues to publish his weekly development summaries,

645
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,280
outlining all of the work,

646
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,960
which we are very appreciative here on the show

647
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,680
and we read every single week.

648
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
This week, he's got good things to say

649
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,920
about the state of KDE on Wayland.

650
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,040
Gazillions of bug fixes,

651
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,840
including many for the Plasma Wayland session.

652
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,520
It's finally reaching stability.

653
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,400
I'm using it myself as a daily driver now.

654
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,360
And at this point,

655
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,640
my biggest annoyances are all with third party apps,

656
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,800
not any KDE software.

657
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,280
I know it's taken a while,

658
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,800
but I think we're very nearly there.

659
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,640
That's great.

660
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,880
If you just add another three releases on top of that,

661
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,240
it's probably gonna really be there.

662
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,760
I kid, but some highlights of this Plasma 5.23,

663
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,000
beyond just X-Wayland and Wayland support, of course,

664
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,860
is there is now improvements

665
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,640
to how the Plasma desktop experience is on Wayland.

666
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,080
Like for example,

667
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,600
virtual desktops are now on a per activity basis on Wayland.

668
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,060
Again, that wasn't the case before,

669
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,320
that was only an X11 feature.

670
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,000
And Plasma 5.23 will now correctly identify

671
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,320
the sending app for notifications

672
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,680
from flat pack applications,

673
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,520
both on Wayland and on X-Wayland.

674
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,320
And there are fixes for multiple Nvidia GPU issues

675
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,080
with the Plasma Wayland session as well.

676
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,000
And as Nate said,

677
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,040
these are really just the cream of the crop

678
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,600
of a gazillion other fixes and improvements.

679
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,320
KDE Plasma 5.23 is really looking like

680
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,040
it will be a great release.

681
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,680
I think it should arrive sometime in early October.

682
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,560
Really looking forward to that.

683
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,080
The daily driver I've switched to is Plasma based.

684
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,920
They offer a bunch of different desktop options,

685
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:34,560
but I went with the Plasma one and I am so happy.

686
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,440
There's a few tweaks that have been done to this one

687
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,520
that have made me extra happy.

688
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,040
And I'll share those with you when we get to that point.

689
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,120
But first, there is a pretty anticipated development

690
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
with NF tables.

691
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,140
The Linux kernel is, as you know, very fast moving,

692
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,620
but sometimes it seems like a few things

693
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,840
can take a long time to land.

694
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,080
And I would say NF tables is one of those.

695
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,560
Yeah, really this is a good example of just,

696
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,520
sometimes it takes a long time to get stuff right

697
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,220
or get it merged, get it to a place that's usable.

698
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,900
And as usual, Jonathan Corbett at LWN

699
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,380
has a really great write up on some of the history

700
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,600
and what's going on with NF tables,

701
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,000
which if you're not familiar,

702
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,320
aims to replace the kernel's packet filtering subsystem.

703
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,680
And it started way back in 2008,

704
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,120
but it's still not being used by most,

705
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,240
perhaps even many production firewalls.

706
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,080
That transition may be getting closer though,

707
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,040
because there was just NF tables 1.0

708
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,480
released on August 19th.

709
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,680
Now look, we're not gonna judge you firewall

710
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,080
how you want a firewall.

711
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,720
You packet filter how you like to packet filter,

712
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,560
but some of us see a need for a change.

713
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,440
And you know, that could include the fact

714
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,200
that the kernel has more than one packet filtering mechanism

715
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,040
so it's complex.

716
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,080
There's one for IPv4.

717
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,300
Of course, as you probably just guessed,

718
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,760
there's one for IPv6,

719
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,840
and then there's one for ARP and so on.

720
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,320
And each one of those subsystems is mostly independent

721
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,600
with a lot of duplicated work and codes.

722
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,360
Shock, surprise, right?

723
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,240
And beyond that, IP tables contains

724
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,920
an excessive amount of built-in protocol knowledge.

725
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,640
And I think some would argue it suffers

726
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,480
from a lack of a proper API

727
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,760
for people who want to manage it at scale.

728
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,560
And so I think that,

729
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,400
that has led people to look for an alternative,

730
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,520
all of those things combined.

731
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,120
It's not that IP tables is bad itself,

732
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,040
it's just everything in totality.

733
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,240
You know, for people who like to mess with firewalls.

734
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,980
And really more seriously here,

735
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,500
the core idea behind NF tables is to kind of throw away

736
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,280
as much of that protocol aware

737
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,600
and specific machinery that you can,

738
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,160
and replace it with a simple virtual machine

739
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,720
that could be programmed from user space.

740
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,880
So, and administrators would still write rules

741
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,360
referring to specific packet header fields and such,

742
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,960
because of course that's kind of what you need to do

743
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,600
when you're setting up firewalls.

744
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,360
But then in this model,

745
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
user space tooling would translate those rules

746
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,740
into low level commands and load that into the kernel,

747
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,200
which basically it means

748
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,520
you get smaller packet filtering engine

749
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,200
that is way more flexible

750
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,640
and has the potential to perform a lot better.

751
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,840
Me like fast packet filtering.

752
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,480
You know, I think a lot of us have probably heard

753
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,400
the name NF tables because it did make a splash

754
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,920
when it was launched, I'd say.

755
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,720
But then it just kind of, I don't know,

756
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,380
it just kind of disappeared from view.

757
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,960
In 2013, the project was essentially rebooted

758
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:20,000
and got a lot of code or all of its code,

759
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,520
I don't remember exactly, merged into the mainline kernel.

760
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,600
And they did that as like job one.

761
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,520
So they got done with that.

762
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,920
NF tables found its way into the Linux 3.13 kernel

763
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,160
back in 2014.

764
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,520
That feels like a million years ago.

765
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,680
And since then, kind of the hard work

766
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,080
has been just filling in all the little gaps.

767
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,380
The core engine was in the kernel,

768
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,320
but you actually need to make NF tables

769
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,200
sufficiently appealing that users

770
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,520
would want to make the transition.

771
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,740
The language that you use to write those filtering rules,

772
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,680
it's gained a lot of new features since then

773
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,080
for stateful tracking, address mapping,

774
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,400
and all kinds of other stuff like handling large rule sets.

775
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,080
There's also documentation to write, of course.

776
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,400
There is an NF tables Wiki,

777
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,840
which we'll have linked in the show notes,

778
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,960
but it sounds like that's still one area

779
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,920
that is maybe a bit lacking.

780
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,080
Yeah, I think though the biggest challenge,

781
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,880
and I bet people listening right now

782
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,400
are thinking this already,

783
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,580
it's that there's so many people

784
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,840
that are using IP tables already.

785
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,580
You know, they have their setup that they like.

786
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,920
They don't want to mess with it

787
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,840
because they've developed it over years

788
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,480
through blood, sweat, and tears,

789
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,680
and lots of hard lessons learned,

790
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,240
and they just want it to keep working.

791
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,920
It's been working for fine.

792
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,280
Why switch to something like NF tables

793
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,280
when IP tables is doing the job,

794
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,880
and it's perfectly fast enough for them?

795
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,640
I think that is going to be the biggest barrier to adoption

796
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,880
and people switching over.

797
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,600
Yeah, I mean, firewalls are a serious component

798
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,000
of your security, right?

799
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,480
Like you don't want to go changing this

800
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,800
and suddenly realize that packets you thought were dropped

801
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,080
are no longer dropped,

802
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,960
or ports you thought were closed are suddenly open,

803
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,840
but it may not be so bad because in some cases,

804
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,040
users might be able to make that jump without even noticing.

805
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,560
Linux distributions have carried support

806
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,800
for NF tables for a while now,

807
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,200
and work is being done to port some tools

808
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,840
like Red Hat's firewall D to NF tables.

809
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,120
So if you're using a higher level tool,

810
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,780
once they've switched the backend out,

811
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,360
you can just keep your rules and that engine

812
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,500
will handle converting things from IP tables to NF tables.

813
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,300
Right, or I suppose put another way,

814
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,600
it's like if you're going to transition,

815
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,480
maybe transition to this higher level tool,

816
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,600
so that way when these kind of backend changes happen,

817
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,440
you can move around.

818
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,920
And I mean, it's deployed to a point, right?

819
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,400
Like Debian got it in Debian 10 Buster,

820
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,080
which was released in 2019,

821
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,660
but Ubuntu didn't adopt it until 2104.

822
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,260
So I mean, most districts do have it,

823
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,800
but 2104 is a fairly recent release of Ubuntu

824
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,080
to actually have it land.

825
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,040
Yeah, really.

826
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,540
As with all these things, it just takes a long time.

827
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:51,520
I mean, in this case, 13 years,

828
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,240
but with 1.0, with Netfilter declaring IP tables now

829
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,120
a legacy tool at the latest Netfilter workshop,

830
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,720
it seems like now is a great time to give it a shot

831
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,320
and prepare yourself for what may be our eventual future.

832
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,520
Neil, I can hear your ears are burning.

833
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,760
You've got something to say about this.

834
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,600
Go ahead.

835
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,520
Firewall D 1.0 happened,

836
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:14,840
and that's actually going to land in Fedora Linux 35.

837
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
And it defaults to NF tables.

838
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:20,340
So it actually will transition everything over.

839
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,780
And if you're using most of the higher level

840
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,360
default behaviors with Firewall D,

841
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,680
like using services, telling it via add ports or whatnot,

842
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,640
it'll seamlessly translate those into NF tables rules.

843
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,760
Libvert has already been adapted for it.

844
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,520
Container engines are in the process of being adapted.

845
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,440
I think they're all done in Fedora.

846
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,840
So across the board, generally speaking,

847
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,840
with Fedora Linux 35, you're going to see NF tables

848
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,360
being used, and you won't notice

849
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,120
because it's all been done for you in the background.

850
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,920
If Firewall D has been told by the user

851
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,400
to add specific firewall IP tables rules,

852
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,640
because you can do that.

853
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,520
You can say, I want to add this IP tables rule

854
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,660
and Firewall D will manage it.

855
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,920
Then it won't auto flip, but otherwise it will.

856
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,520
So in Fedora, it's already done.

857
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,000
It's also the case in RHEL 8.

858
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,420
They actually did it before Fedora did

859
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,320
because initially it happened in Fedora.

860
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,800
It got reverted once and now they're trying again

861
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,320
and saying, this is now good.

862
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,500
And of course in RHEL 9, it will be there too.

863
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,340
I like that.

864
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,160
That sounds good.

865
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,520
A nice, smooth transition.

866
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,720
That sounds appealing.

867
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,560
Lino.com slash unplugged.

868
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,960
Go there to get $100 in credit on a new account

869
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,160
and you support the show.

870
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,840
You know, a Linux content creator out there,

871
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,600
Nick at the Linux experiment just went full time

872
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,680
a few weeks ago.

873
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,460
And yesterday, YouTube shut down his channel

874
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,880
with no communication or maybe by the time you're hearing

875
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,100
this probably a couple of days ago,

876
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,560
they just deleted his channel, removed it completely.

877
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,600
And then told him that if he didn't respond fast enough,

878
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,460
he'd be gone forever.

879
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,880
And then just kind of gave him the cold shoulder.

880
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,880
And he had just gone full time.

881
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,800
That's so scary.

882
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,680
Imagine that your livelihood just like that

883
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,220
taken away from you.

884
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:02,360
And that's why I want to just say thank you to everyone

885
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,840
who takes advantage of our sponsors,

886
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,980
who understands the model that we have here.

887
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,760
This is an independent business.

888
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,440
You know, it's just a small team of us

889
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,360
that are independently working our butts off

890
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,000
to make content every single week for you.

891
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,520
And the reason why we can stick around and do these shows

892
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,300
is because you take advantage of our sponsors

893
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,880
or you become members or you tell people about the show.

894
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,320
And the great thing about Linode

895
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,840
is it's a perfect partnership where we can work

896
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,800
with a partner that gets what we're doing

897
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,560
and you guys get what they do.

898
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,560
Because like JB, they're independently owned

899
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,120
and they've been doing this one thing for a long time.

900
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,200
They've been doing it longer than we have.

901
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,280
They have been focused on cloud computing for 18 years.

902
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,840
I mean, that's really something that defines an industry

903
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,380
and they have focused on just doing a really good job

904
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,220
at that.

905
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,200
And because they're Linux geeks along the way,

906
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,520
they understood the reason why they should reinvest back

907
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
into the community.

908
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,780
They get how that works.

909
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,880
They've helped projects out.

910
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,420
They've helped out this network.

911
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,960
I mean, they've really been there

912
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,320
for a lot of different groups,

913
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,280
including although we don't get to go to them anymore,

914
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,440
some of our favorite events like Linux Fest Northwest.

915
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,960
And as a long time Linux user,

916
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,340
I really can tell that they are fans,

917
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,960
that they have built tools around Linux

918
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,840
before the technology necessarily existed.

919
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,560
Like at the time when they became their own ISP,

920
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,160
it was extremely uncommon to run Linux on your routers

921
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,160
and on your switches.

922
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,760
And I just, that was insane.

923
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,580
Who does that?

924
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,240
Who runs Linux on their firewalls, routers and switches?

925
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,080
Nobody does that.

926
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,900
Well, Linode did.

927
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,040
They wanted to figure out a way to do it.

928
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,440
And as a result, they have a flexible service

929
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
that's been able to meet the needs of their users.

930
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,000
And now they have 11 data centers around the world

931
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,440
with nearly a million customers.

932
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,240
And man, they've just built a product

933
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,200
that you've got to check out.

934
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,560
And that's why they're confident in giving you $100

935
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,040
because they know if they give you $100

936
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,320
and they give you 60 days to play with it,

937
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,160
you're going to go on there

938
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,180
and you're going to build something.

939
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,020
You're going to try it.

940
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,640
And you're going to see that it's faster.

941
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,680
The UI is cleaner.

942
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,080
The documentation is better.

943
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,560
The API is fantastic.

944
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,580
And the customer support is the best in the business.

945
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,260
That's why I run my business infrastructure on Linode.

946
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,360
So go to linode.com slash unplugged,

947
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,080
sign up, support the show and get $100 to kick the tires

948
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,600
and see what we've been talking about.

949
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,840
Linode is the best way to host something

950
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,160
and they're true real Linux users.

951
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,960
So you can rest assured knowing

952
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,520
that they love what they're doing.

953
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,360
And I love it.

954
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,120
I love it when that works its way into a product.

955
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,340
Linode.com slash unplugged.

956
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,360
You can't just use Linux for fun, can you?

957
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,200
No, I only use it to get work done.

958
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,300
You know that Windows is for fun.

959
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,240
Right, it's only a serious tool.

960
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,960
And you should never download a distribution

961
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,520
just because you think you might have fun with it.

962
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,260
Except for that's exactly what I did.

963
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,280
A little while ago on July 22nd,

964
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,600
I decided to give Garuda Linux a try.

965
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,340
And I kind of laughed it off as a project

966
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:49,400
because it looked like Linux turned up to neon 11 to me.

967
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:52,680
And when it comes to ready-made arch based distributions,

968
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,520
Endeavor OS and Manjaro really serve that purpose

969
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,920
very, very well.

970
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,680
And I just sort of instinctually kind of brushed it off

971
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,000
thinking, yeah, that's what we need is another arch clone.

972
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,280
Yeah, that's going to solve the problem.

973
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,320
But then I decided, you know, I looked at their website

974
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,800
and I liked a few things about it.

975
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,220
I liked how opinionated it was.

976
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,800
It felt like kind of a distro of before

977
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,680
where they were going to kind of actually reminded me

978
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,840
a little bit of Mandrake.

979
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,440
I have to be honest with you.

980
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,960
Where they've got some tools to manage the distribution.

981
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,000
They've really picked a theme and identity.

982
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,240
They embrace it and they've optimized it

983
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,280
for the user desktop.

984
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,800
And that's been their sole focus.

985
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,720
And those are items that appealed to me.

986
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,840
And I was ready just to,

987
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,480
I was going to try an intermediary distro

988
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,200
before our next review anyways.

989
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,000
And so I decided to throw Garuda on my ThinkPad X1.

990
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,240
And my initial impressions were that it was gaudy.

991
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,480
That it was over the top.

992
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:51,480
That it was a little, it clashed a little bit

993
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,960
in a few places.

994
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,480
But as I started to use it,

995
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,760
I started to take it a little bit more seriously.

996
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,840
And I started to notice that my system felt

997
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,000
a little more responsive.

998
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,680
You know, they use the Zen kernel, for example,

999
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,240
which is, you know, you can argue for it or against it.

1000
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,540
But some people say it's great for desktop loads.

1001
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,640
They've chosen a CPU scheduler also

1002
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,000
that's maybe more tuned for desktop performance.

1003
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,360
And they've done things like they've enabled ZRAM

1004
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,400
by default.

1005
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,760
They've turned on an out of memory killer.

1006
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,480
And they're using ButterFS as default file system

1007
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,640
with ZTSD, ZSD compression.

1008
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,440
I don't know, Z standard compression I guess it must be.

1009
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,680
Z standard.

1010
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,280
Anyways, it's a formula.

1011
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,240
It's a recipe that I like.

1012
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,040
And so I kind of tried to encourage Wes

1013
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,880
to take a look at it.

1014
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,540
And you've got fresher first impressions than I do, Wes.

1015
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,720
So I'm curious to know, like, when you decided to bite

1016
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,960
and you went over to the website

1017
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,520
and you gave it a download,

1018
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,200
just curious what your first impressions were.

1019
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,480
Ooh, there's just a lot here.

1020
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,760
The theme kind of is intense.

1021
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,880
Yes, gaudy is probably a good word for it.

1022
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,480
But it's consistent.

1023
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,640
There's elements that I like.

1024
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,520
It all hangs together very nicely.

1025
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,640
And there's just a lot of attention to detail

1026
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,880
in areas I'm not used to.

1027
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,240
I think we're used to thinking about

1028
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,240
the kind of attention to detail in the distro building

1029
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,340
and maybe a bigger classic distro sense

1030
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,720
and all the hard work that Fedora does

1031
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,760
that we highlight on the show

1032
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,240
to build the next generation of the Linux desktop

1033
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,960
and integrate a lot of these low level tools

1034
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,160
or the Ubuntu team putting together

1035
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,960
an Ubuntu desktop release.

1036
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,760
But because it's built on Arch,

1037
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,600
you're basically just installing a bunch of upstream software

1038
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,740
and so you get these tweaks in other areas

1039
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,420
that you kind of don't on more mainstream distros.

1040
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,000
Yeah, you know, you can see this with Manjaro too.

1041
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,160
They provide you some tools to select your kernel

1042
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,380
and they give you some wizards

1043
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,900
and they work you through part of the setup process.

1044
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,840
What Garuda does differently is they take all of that

1045
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,640
and they kind of turn it up to 12 or 13 even.

1046
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,640
And as I used it, they call their KDE look Dragonfied

1047
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,040
and it's a variant of the sweet theme for Plasma.

1048
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,240
And as I used it, it dawned on me,

1049
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,740
I've always had a problem with Plasma's

1050
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,920
sort of look and feel compared to GNOME Shell,

1051
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,000
like an elegance factor that GNOME Shell

1052
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,740
just felt like a little smoother in terms of look,

1053
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,100
a little sharper, a little cleaner.

1054
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,840
And on Plasma, I was always kind of attempting

1055
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,520
to get to that normal level of polish,

1056
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,120
but never quite getting there

1057
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,400
and always left a little frustrated.

1058
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,860
And I often just kind of just sort of gave up

1059
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,000
and always just went back to Breeze

1060
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,600
because Breeze works with everything

1061
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,080
and maybe it's not perfect.

1062
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,340
Just becomes kind of a workstation focus.

1063
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,280
Yeah, you're like, okay, whatever.

1064
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,780
It's not as beautiful as maybe I want,

1065
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,780
but it works great, I love Plasma, so I'm happy enough.

1066
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,280
Where Garuda comes along and says,

1067
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,880
well, if it's not gonna be beautiful,

1068
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,380
what if we just embrace the shit out of being different

1069
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,800
and kind of like an elite desktop?

1070
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,260
What if we just kind of lean into it a little bit?

1071
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,740
And that's what Garuda has done.

1072
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,480
Like the terminal is,

1073
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,800
it's got like a kind of a blurred fade to it by default.

1074
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,860
They launch it with like NeoFetch output information.

1075
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,160
They've got a customized shell.

1076
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,000
The icons are very neon.

1077
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,480
The look is very, very unique

1078
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,020
and it actually has won me over, over time.

1079
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,760
And they have these management tools that I like

1080
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,840
that remind me of the Drake tools from Mandriva

1081
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,680
or the Drac tools.

1082
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,920
Like they give you one to help you install curated games

1083
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,800
and emulators, just check a few boxes

1084
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,760
and you can get everything.

1085
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,440
Like there's gaming software on there I'd never heard of,

1086
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,920
like a free Epic launcher replacement.

1087
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,520
I got that installed now.

1088
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,280
They have boot options to let you tweak kernel parameters,

1089
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,140
select the default OS that boots,

1090
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,360
disable Specter mitigations and a lot more.

1091
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,300
I mean, they just,

1092
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,800
they have tools for managing common butterFS things

1093
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,320
like getting an accurate free space reading,

1094
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,760
running a rebalance if you need.

1095
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,360
And it'll tell you, you don't need to do this.

1096
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,760
It'll say right there, this is not needed right now.

1097
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,480
Give you tools to manage the fact that you have butterFS.

1098
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,720
And then on top of all of that,

1099
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,440
they have enabled time shift snapshots by default.

1100
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,040
And not only can you use the GUI

1101
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,440
and a command line interface to restore snapshots,

1102
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,800
but they also put a menu entry in grub.

1103
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,720
So when you're booting up,

1104
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:05,920
you can just restore from a snapshot

1105
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
right there at the boot menu.

1106
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,320
That's glorious when you're working

1107
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,480
with an arch-based system.

1108
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,280
It really is like kind of a new,

1109
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,640
maybe not new is the right word,

1110
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:15,880
but a different way of using arch.

1111
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,080
Obviously the packages, right?

1112
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,040
Are coming from arch.

1113
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,180
It's a lot of that arch goodness,

1114
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,680
but where I'm used to building up an arch system

1115
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,800
for myself and kind of selecting stuff,

1116
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,480
I feel like with Gruta, for good or bad,

1117
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,660
I almost have to do the opposite

1118
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,760
because so much of that has been done.

1119
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,800
Like you mentioned the terminal,

1120
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,160
that's probably where I crossed the line.

1121
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,260
I'm like, I don't want you showing NeoFetch

1122
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,560
every time I open the darn thing.

1123
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,400
That's just wasting my cycles, but it looks really nice.

1124
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,020
It's a good first experience.

1125
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,440
And for some things, it might make more sense

1126
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,700
to start with this if you like most of what they do,

1127
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,120
to start with Gruta and then, you know,

1128
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,800
just tweak things back down a little bit

1129
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,460
if there's some stuff you don't need.

1130
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,320
So I'll give you an example.

1131
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,740
So I think they're trying to make arch

1132
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,660
not for regular humans.

1133
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,080
They're not trying to make arch for humans,

1134
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,800
like Ubuntu's making Debian for humans.

1135
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,120
They're making arch for geeks

1136
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,120
that want a powerful workstation.

1137
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,200
And you guys know that always pushes my buttons.

1138
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,040
I'll give you an example.

1139
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,400
Like you've ever had an arch machine

1140
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,680
where you have key ring issues eventually,

1141
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,360
like this happens to me on a machine

1142
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,680
that if I don't update it frequently enough,

1143
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,440
well, this has happened to some Gruta users.

1144
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,000
So the team put together a tool that goes through

1145
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,240
and works out these key ring issues during updates.

1146
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,200
It automatically updates your key rings in the backgrounds

1147
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,320
and it also lets you go through and install

1148
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,960
what they have as like a hot fix package,

1149
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,800
which resolves the issue.

1150
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,560
It's just, it's a tool that really is only applicable

1151
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,280
for a rolling distribution like arch

1152
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,520
that has something like that.

1153
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,040
It happens every now and then.

1154
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,400
And then this just smooths it out for you.

1155
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,280
And so they've built a few tools like that,

1156
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,120
like, and you know,

1157
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,480
or included tools that have been created

1158
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,980
by other distributions.

1159
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:44,900
There's a little bit of that too.

1160
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:47,880
Like they're using the same installer that Endeavor uses

1161
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,200
and timeshift of course is, you know,

1162
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,040
it's available for any distribution,

1163
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,040
but it's nice to see it.

1164
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:56,920
And it has its own look, but you can change that.

1165
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,240
And if you change the theme, if it's too much for you,

1166
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,100
you've still got a lot of great choices.

1167
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,360
Snapshots by default, butterFS by default,

1168
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,280
current plasma by default.

1169
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,960
I would also argue, although I think this is,

1170
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,560
people could see it the other way.

1171
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,260
I like that they're using the Zen kernel

1172
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,360
and I like that they're using a desktop scheduler.

1173
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,680
I think those things are tweaks and changes

1174
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,740
that I've begun making to my boxes.

1175
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:22,200
And in part, that's how I came across Garuda is I,

1176
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,840
and Wes knows this, since I got my X1,

1177
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,720
I have been on kind of this pursuit to make it faster,

1178
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:30,440
to make it perform as well as it did under Windows.

1179
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,560
I mean, I think you kind of want to forget that there's,

1180
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,920
you know, anything between you

1181
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,800
and exactly what you want the computer to do, right?

1182
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,240
Like when you see those apps take a while to launch,

1183
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,580
that seems to cause you physical pain.

1184
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,420
It does.

1185
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,480
Well, it really, it broke me after I,

1186
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,940
on a lark, tried Windows 11 on the X1,

1187
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,960
and it was faster and the battery life

1188
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,500
was significantly better.

1189
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,340
Ugh.

1190
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,720
And I'm like, no, this cannot stand.

1191
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,460
So I had been doing a custom arch install

1192
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,680
and I had done the like Alan Cox kernel

1193
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,960
and I was doing all my little tweaks to like pre-cache stuff

1194
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,200
and put the browsers in RAM,

1195
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,800
all the stuff I've talked about before.

1196
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,760
And I was building a lot of this myself anyways.

1197
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,600
And that's kind of when I discovered Garuda.

1198
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,640
And I thought, well, this is silly,

1199
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,080
but I'm exasperated at this, at this laptop at this point.

1200
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,280
I'm just going to throw this silly distribution on there.

1201
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,680
And I admit, I thought that way.

1202
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,520
And then about a week into it,

1203
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,880
I was like, that's not so bad actually.

1204
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,500
And I thought the first thing I'd do is change the theme,

1205
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,800
but I didn't.

1206
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,080
And that never happens.

1207
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,360
And so I stuck with it for a little bit.

1208
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,360
And now here I am.

1209
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,400
I'm like, man, I've been using this for more than a month.

1210
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,320
And I think this is my new go-to Arch.

1211
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,320
And I'm not recommending it for everybody.

1212
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,320
I still think Manjaro and mainline Arch,

1213
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,280
if you want to use Arch are the way to go.

1214
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,800
That's my official recommendation.

1215
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,400
But if you kind of line up with me

1216
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,640
and how you want your Linux desktop to perform

1217
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,520
and how you use Linux, it's worth a fun look

1218
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,080
because if nothing else,

1219
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,060
it's like visiting a version of Linux

1220
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,000
that used to be very common,

1221
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
where they had lots of apps and tweaks preloaded.

1222
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,180
They had management tools.

1223
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,060
They had a strong identity

1224
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,160
and they tried to solve a specific problem

1225
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,000
for a specific niche.

1226
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,380
And that's what Garuda does,

1227
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,560
including it has various different versions.

1228
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,820
Cause like Wes, I know you're a huge gaming guy now.

1229
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,940
So I installed the gaming version.

1230
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:14,780
Yeah. Right.

1231
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:15,600
Why not?

1232
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,440
It comes with steam.

1233
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,040
It comes with a whole bunch of handy tools.

1234
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,280
And honestly, that's one area where it is kind of nice

1235
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,400
because yeah, all right.

1236
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,400
I like to play games,

1237
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,360
but not that many and mostly on Linux.

1238
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,980
I don't keep up with the latest and greatest

1239
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,720
of optimizing Nvidia integrations with stuff

1240
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,640
or like little tweaks to make gaming go better.

1241
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,040
So if Garuda does, that's pretty useful

1242
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,520
cause it's exactly the kind of thing

1243
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:38,800
where I don't necessarily want to spend an hour.

1244
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,280
I might want to go play with NF tables

1245
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,840
rather than tweak my system for gaming.

1246
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,120
So I can get something out of the box

1247
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,520
that just makes it easy.

1248
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,340
That's great.

1249
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,180
Yeah.

1250
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,440
They also in their management tools,

1251
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,240
they have options to like check a box

1252
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:53,540
to turn on auto CPU fric or maybe you want thermal D.

1253
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,080
So they have a few things that just make it quick

1254
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,480
to play with that kind of stuff,

1255
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,160
which this was my take on it.

1256
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,120
It's just, they have a lot of tools

1257
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,360
that you can do something really quick.

1258
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,280
That's just an alternative to you going

1259
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,720
and looking up how to do it in the Wiki

1260
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,320
and then doing the same thing on the command line.

1261
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,400
Like it's nothing you couldn't figure out on your own

1262
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,720
if you're this type of user,

1263
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,520
but maybe you don't want to have to all the time.

1264
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,540
And it's neat to see them working on that.

1265
00:45:17,540 --> 00:45:18,920
And it's interesting too, in the arch world,

1266
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,880
I feel that, you know, some other distribution sometimes

1267
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,320
I don't necessarily know where to look.

1268
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,480
You know, I might be curious what that GUI tool is,

1269
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,680
but because they kind of do it their own way,

1270
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,600
I don't always know like exactly how that's implemented

1271
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,320
under the hood, but because I mean, it's just on arch,

1272
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,680
you can kind of tweak it in Garuda.

1273
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,840
And then if you want to, yeah, go pull up the Wiki

1274
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,320
and go find out where all that lives under the hood.

1275
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,360
Yeah, and as far as I'm concerned,

1276
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,680
it's staying on this laptop.

1277
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,760
And the next time I need a quick arch box,

1278
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,640
I'm going Garuda because they're doing 98%

1279
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,280
of the tweaks that I would do.

1280
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,440
And also, I think it's one of the funnest distributions

1281
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,280
out there.

1282
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,120
It is a blast to try this thing.

1283
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,640
They have a clever community.

1284
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,480
They have what about eight members on their team,

1285
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,200
do you think Wes, roughly?

1286
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,040
Yeah, sure seems like it,

1287
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,320
and seemingly from across the world.

1288
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,360
And it's fairly new.

1289
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,840
I think it kind of came out last year.

1290
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,560
So it's been around for over a year now.

1291
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,440
And they've set up some services for their community.

1292
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,240
I didn't bother looking into how to sign up,

1293
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:16,120
but I did notice that they had a hosted Bitwarden available,

1294
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,760
hosted Nextcloud, a private pastebin alternative,

1295
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,840
collaborative like notepad thing.

1296
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,120
They had a few services that they would make available

1297
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,040
to their community.

1298
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,560
And they also make a start page available,

1299
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,520
which, you know, I don't need that, but it's nice.

1300
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,400
It's a good idea.

1301
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,960
And it's further extending open source,

1302
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,520
other open source projects too.

1303
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,120
Right, and I think it adds to that,

1304
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,680
that feeling of community, right?

1305
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,840
Like you feel like you're, it's not just like,

1306
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,280
for better or worse in the arch world,

1307
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,480
you're kind of left out on your own, right?

1308
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,520
Like they've got the Wiki and there's forums,

1309
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:46,360
but like you are the one who's doing this.

1310
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,440
And Groota feels just a little bit more,

1311
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:50,760
like people are out there to maybe hold your hand

1312
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,000
if you want to hold hands.

1313
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,720
You know, Chris, I was noticing those services

1314
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,840
when I went diving in to try to find out how active

1315
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,400
this project was.

1316
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,400
And I expected them to be charging a little bit of money

1317
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,640
for these services, but it seems to me,

1318
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,480
I couldn't figure out a way to give them money

1319
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,320
for the services.

1320
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,960
They're just kind of giving it to the community.

1321
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,200
There's certainly a donate page,

1322
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,360
but it'd be nice to see a project like this

1323
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,480
stick around for a while.

1324
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,600
So they have a couple of ways to contribute right now.

1325
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,240
The primary way they want you to contribute,

1326
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:21,400
the problem there is that platform is really only set up

1327
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,480
for monthly contributions.

1328
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,360
Where I basically, I wanted to send them 50 bucks

1329
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,680
and say, thanks for the great distro.

1330
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,920
I don't necessarily want to send them money

1331
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,280
every single month.

1332
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,720
I like to annually give to projects that I'm still using

1333
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,640
because my usage changes sometimes.

1334
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,720
And then the second way they recommended things,

1335
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,040
oh, also the first way they recommend things,

1336
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,520
you can go in there and set up an account,

1337
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,480
connect it to your PayPal,

1338
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:41,960
but then when you go to contribute monthly,

1339
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,160
cause I kind of just decided fine, I'll do monthly,

1340
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,360
then it doesn't let you use PayPal.

1341
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,440
So then you have to connect it to a bank.

1342
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,880
And so I bailed at that point,

1343
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,920
I switched over to just send them a PayPal payment,

1344
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,800
which they have a link for that.

1345
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,360
And I was going to send them 50 bucks.

1346
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,720
And then I got an error saying that their PayPal stuff

1347
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,040
isn't working and you can't send them money right now.

1348
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,360
And they're using open collective to track expenses

1349
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,480
and try to document everything.

1350
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,200
So they're doing it in an open governance way.

1351
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,360
So I like that.

1352
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,240
And when they get their payment stuff sorted out,

1353
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,160
I'll send them a few bucks

1354
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:10,360
because it's been a great little desktop for me.

1355
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,880
And I think they should keep it going.

1356
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,680
I think they're doing something fun and unique here.

1357
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,960
And even if it's just a testing ground for fun ideas,

1358
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:18,800
I love this.

1359
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,760
And that's where I kind of wonder

1360
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,920
if there is a place for the fun distro.

1361
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,120
Like hear me out for a second,

1362
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,120
but I think you could make the argument

1363
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,520
that experienced Linux users

1364
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,440
who know how to submit bug reports,

1365
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,480
who maybe can kind of suss out the nature of a problem,

1366
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,400
they can probably help reproduce that problem.

1367
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,360
I almost feel like we have an obligation

1368
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,980
to use more mainstream distributions

1369
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:45,280
like your Ubuntu and your Fedoras and even your Mints,

1370
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,680
because those distributions need people submitting bugs.

1371
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,560
And they need users who understand how to submit bugs.

1372
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,880
And that's us, right?

1373
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,400
But here we are using these sort of niche distributions

1374
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,160
that maybe don't have a bigger impact

1375
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:02,480
on the wider Linux ecosystem.

1376
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,400
And that's where I wonder if it's slightly irresponsible

1377
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,600
on somebody who considers himself a Linux advocates part

1378
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,200
to use a distro like that.

1379
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,040
What are your thoughts, gentlemen?

1380
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,320
That's kind of tough.

1381
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,160
You're right.

1382
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,000
I mean, it is out there and you're not using some stuff

1383
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,160
that's been customized by the distro as much.

1384
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,240
Maybe you're just relying

1385
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,040
on the more upstream arch packages.

1386
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,840
So I don't know, I have two minds.

1387
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,300
I think there is an element of truth to that.

1388
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,120
But I also think that maybe the kind of issues

1389
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,140
that you're going to run into as someone who gravitated

1390
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,480
towards this kind of optimized distro for certain use cases

1391
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,100
are probably different than maybe the wifi issues

1392
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,100
that someone might have as a new user

1393
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:45,140
trying to use an Ubuntu desktop.

1394
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,460
So I think it's still important that you contribute

1395
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:50,520
both to Garuda and also maybe start filing some bugs

1396
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,680
upstream for stuff that doesn't work.

1397
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,440
But I don't know that I would worry too much about it.

1398
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,280
Seems to me like a project like this

1399
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,800
might get someone more interested

1400
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,640
or like get their minds thinking about things

1401
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,160
they never thought of before.

1402
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,440
Like some of the features you mentioned

1403
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,960
that they just make very easy

1404
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,240
to just kind of click and turn on.

1405
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,300
Wes was mentioning that having it work by default,

1406
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,160
but then diving in with curiosity to see how it all works.

1407
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,640
That speaks to me and gets my ears up.

1408
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,480
That is exactly how I love to learn.

1409
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,560
So I could see a project like this

1410
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,040
just getting us a whole bunch more contributors

1411
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,960
than we originally had.

1412
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,560
Yeah, okay, ByteBidden,

1413
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,520
you had something you wanted to add on the subject.

1414
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,240
Yeah, so I jumped in with the Dragon Eyes gaming version.

1415
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,360
I was like, well, hit me with it.

1416
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,560
And I was astonished by all the tools they deliver with it

1417
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,040
or even giving you the choice

1418
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,600
because I didn't know half the choices that I got

1419
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,640
where I felt informed.

1420
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,800
Do I want an emulator?

1421
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,480
They got an entire page of that

1422
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,720
and I can now check that information.

1423
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,640
And only downside is that I can't get

1424
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,760
my Nvidia proprietary driver working,

1425
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,420
but that's where the ButterFast snapshot feature came in

1426
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,560
and I was like, back.

1427
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,000
And you can keep testing and testing.

1428
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,300
And well, the only thing is that the Dragon Eyes version

1429
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,880
is a bit too sparkly for me.

1430
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,600
So I will probably step back to a normal version

1431
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,360
and then use their tooling to get back on it.

1432
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,280
But also you can install like five different software

1433
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,360
boutiques and updaters and stuff like that.

1434
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,120
So whatever you want, they have the choice for you

1435
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:34,080
to just check the box, click install and it's done.

1436
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:37,760
Yes, they have now a third configuration screen

1437
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,040
that might be a bit troublesome

1438
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,920
if you want to check for a setting

1439
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,300
somewhere in one of those three.

1440
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,020
But yeah, it's really nice.

1441
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,160
And also a lot of things I found in Barchi

1442
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,160
where I was like Barchi is my home system,

1443
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:56,560
Geruda felt like a bit like a new home to me.

1444
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:58,280
Yeah, it feels like a new home to me as well.

1445
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,840
And I think my take on the using the niche distros

1446
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,000
versus putting your attention

1447
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,440
and focus on the mainstream distros is

1448
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,240
it means the onus is on me to recognize

1449
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,040
or at least attempt to recognize as best I can

1450
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,200
that if I'm encountering a bug,

1451
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,380
is it because I'm using a different scheduler?

1452
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,920
Is it because I'm using a Zen kernel?

1453
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,240
Or is it because I'm using a very opinionated theme

1454
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,660
and this app isn't rendering correctly?

1455
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,600
Like the onus is on me to figure that out,

1456
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,300
but potentially because it is an arch derivative,

1457
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:27,860
I'm using a lot of upstream packages

1458
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,000
and I could still have an impact

1459
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,160
on those upstream projects if the bug is legitimate.

1460
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,240
And I think if I'm willing to accept that compromise

1461
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,840
that, hey, the onus is on me to suss out

1462
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,160
the cause of this and that is something

1463
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm willing to accept,

1464
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,980
then I don't think it is a bad thing.

1465
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,360
I think you can still have an impact

1466
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,800
and because the beautiful thing about open sources is

1467
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,920
if I report an issue with console on Garuda,

1468
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,800
it's going to improve the situation for somebody

1469
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,000
on a future version of Fedora using plasma as well.

1470
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,480
And so I say, you know what?

1471
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,300
To hell with it.

1472
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,720
Go use the fun distro for a little while, have some fun.

1473
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:04,660
That's why we got into this stuff.

1474
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,640
Stop taking it so seriously all the time

1475
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,800
and just have some damn fun.

1476
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,160
That's what I say.

1477
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,840
Also, I want to mention that our friends

1478
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,180
over at a Cloud Guru have a course on Linux web services.

1479
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,840
So it's a course that focuses on the tools

1480
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,080
and utilities used to configure web services

1481
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:19,920
on a Linux host.

1482
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,800
So you're going to install Apache.

1483
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,200
You're going to install squid, I believe, NGINX.

1484
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,400
You're going to set up virtual hosts.

1485
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,440
You're going to set up reverse proxying, which is dope.

1486
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,480
You're going to mess with HTTP and SSL, load balancing.

1487
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,400
It's all in there including how to collect Apache metrics

1488
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,720
and all that stuff on NGINX as well.

1489
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,680
So head over to our show notes or go to acloudguru.com

1490
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,160
and search for Linux web services.

1491
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,720
We will have a link in the show notes

1492
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:48,160
at linuxunplug.com slash 422.

1493
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,520
Thank you to a Cloud Guru.

1494
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,960
Now we have some email to get into gentlemen.

1495
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,040
What do you say?

1496
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,360
Time for some feedback?

1497
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,560
Well, yes, our mailbag today is quite on theme

1498
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:02,140
because Oren has finally switched to plasma.

1499
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,800
He writes, IJB, I finally did it.

1500
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,200
After the recent episode in which you guys talked about KDE

1501
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:12,560
plasma as a great alternative to GNOME, I finally switched.

1502
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,000
I'm an Ubuntu user who prefers his desktop environment

1503
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,200
clean and stable.

1504
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,980
I don't like to install plugins and prefer to just use

1505
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:23,600
what comes out of the box, which is why my GNOME desktop stayed

1506
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,640
the same pretty much all the time.

1507
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,520
I held off on KDE largely because every time you guys

1508
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,720
talked about it, it sounded like you'd have to configure

1509
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,960
and invest time to get the whole system into a usable state.

1510
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,000
But I have to say, after a quick install,

1511
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,440
I love every minute of KDE.

1512
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,160
I feel like a younger version of myself

1513
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,640
when I first started using Windows 95

1514
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,960
after spending way too long in DOS.

1515
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,460
I click on every setting KDE has to offer.

1516
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,160
I've been going over it for over a week,

1517
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:58,560
and I still find cool new things.

1518
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,000
There's nothing that compares to it.

1519
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,920
The system is fully customizable,

1520
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,480
but it also works great with the default settings

1521
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,320
right out of the box.

1522
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:10,800
From my side, I'm sold, and I'm never going back.

1523
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,560
Yeah, the trick is, Oren, is to still get your work done

1524
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,800
and not spend all your time playing with all the settings.

1525
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:22,240
That's why you didn't have the dock done this morning.

1526
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,400
Yeah, I was too busy playing with my plasma.

1527
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,040
I do love it.

1528
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:27,880
I do love it a lot.

1529
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,880
Thanks, Oren, for writing in.

1530
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,280
And I'm glad you like it.

1531
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,900
I think it's different folks, different strokes.

1532
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,600
We got a bunch of suggestions for DWM

1533
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,560
last week after I complained about wanting tiling

1534
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,960
on particular virtual desktops.

1535
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,240
But different desktops for different folks.

1536
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,980
But plasma is working really great for us.

1537
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,320
I think all three of us now are on plasma, right?

1538
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,520
Yeah, it's your fault, Chris.

1539
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,960
Thank you very much.

1540
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,760
All right, well, I'll take that blame.

1541
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:53,840
I'll take that blame.

1542
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:56,880
We do have a bit of housekeeping.

1543
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,760
And I just wanted to mention the lup lug,

1544
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,440
because I haven't been able to make it for a few weeks,

1545
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:01,760
because I've been dying in the heat.

1546
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,360
But the lup lug continues on a nice, chilled, relaxed chat

1547
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:05,640
with Linux friends.

1548
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,440
You can get information about our mumble room

1549
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,920
at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

1550
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,700
Go over there, enjoy.

1551
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,280
And we'd also love to hear from you.

1552
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,080
Fact, we'd love to do a feedback episode again.

1553
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:15,780
It's been a bit.

1554
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,080
So send your questions in.

1555
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,800
We're going to start collecting them.

1556
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,800
I just decided right now, linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1557
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,840
Send in your questions to the show about anything

1558
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:26,320
we've covered in the past that you'd like us to follow up on,

1559
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,040
anything about the show itself, or a technology stack

1560
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,240
that you got questions about.

1561
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,040
We'll take them at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

1562
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,040
And last but not least, join the conversation

1563
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:39,520
that continues every single week at jupiterbroadcasting.com

1564
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,320
slash telegram.

1565
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,560
You can go in there, hang out.

1566
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:45,320
There's members of our crew chatting in there all the time.

1567
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:46,920
Oh, I suppose I do have one more thing.

1568
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,680
So not quite last, but now this one is.

1569
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,240
But definitely not least, the stickers.

1570
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,960
Go over to jupitergarage.com and grab yourself a sticker.

1571
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:54,920
They're great.

1572
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,040
They're fresh.

1573
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,720
And they're high resolution.

1574
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,520
And they make your laptop just look better.

1575
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,000
That's at jupitergarage.com.

1576
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,160
We have a pick this week.

1577
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,800
And this one is useful because YouTube

1578
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,440
has a habit of just pulling down content these days.

1579
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:13,760
So how about something to replace that YouTube

1580
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,960
DL, which seems to be on the rocks these days?

1581
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,920
Yeah, YTDLP, a YouTube DL fork with additional features

1582
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,080
and fixes.

1583
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,040
How about that?

1584
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,800
I mean, I love me some YouTube DL.

1585
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,840
I probably use it, if not every day,

1586
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:30,320
at least several times a week.

1587
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,760
But that's the beauty of open source, right?

1588
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,840
You can take something, maybe it's

1589
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:35,480
not seeing as much investment or maintenance,

1590
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,000
or you just have some new ideas.

1591
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:37,640
You can fork it.

1592
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:38,520
You can remix it.

1593
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,800
You can make it better.

1594
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,480
Yeah, it has all kinds of interesting features

1595
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:45,440
that they've added on top of YouTube DL.

1596
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,240
In fact, some things are really simple,

1597
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,240
just like the way it displays different formats.

1598
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,280
But then other things are fascinating.

1599
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,560
You can mark and remove sponsor sections in YouTube videos

1600
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:57,320
by utilizing the Sponsor Block API,

1601
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,600
and it has built-in support for that.

1602
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,000
It supports all kinds of resuming scenarios

1603
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,800
that YouTube DL doesn't, including workarounds

1604
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,120
for when YouTube throttles you.

1605
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,760
If anybody's a heavy YouTube DL user,

1606
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,200
you run into this, where YouTube starts throttling you.

1607
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,440
It happens to me.

1608
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,640
They got workarounds for that as well.

1609
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,160
But we have a bonus YouTube pick as well,

1610
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,200
because I think the faster you can get content off YouTube,

1611
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,040
the better.

1612
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:26,040
And this one is YTMDL, or YouTube Music Download, YTMDL.

1613
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,080
It's an app that just gets songs from YouTube in MP3.

1614
00:58:31,080 --> 00:58:33,000
It grabs all of the metadata you'd like, too,

1615
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,440
and takes care of that, like the artist name,

1616
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,240
the album name, all of that.

1617
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,720
Yeah, that's the added benefit here.

1618
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,920
I mean, sure, YouTube DL, you can tell it to download MP3,

1619
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,880
but YTMDL, well, it's gonna go out to sources

1620
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,000
like iTunes, Spotify, Deezer, Last.fm,

1621
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:48,840
and pull all that juicy metadata

1622
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:51,880
that if you want to add this to your personal collection,

1623
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,960
you really need to have.

1624
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,720
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, that's pretty nice to see.

1625
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,360
And you guys know we're big fans of PeerTube

1626
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,680
here on this show.

1627
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,120
We think that's a great way for content creators

1628
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,360
that want an independent,

1629
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:05,440
under their control media platform for video.

1630
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,560
But there's a lot of other alternatives out there, too.

1631
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,880
So the great thing about these apps

1632
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,560
is they support just about every

1633
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,560
semi-popular video streaming site.

1634
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:16,520
So it's not just YouTube that they work with,

1635
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,520
but we mention it because that's the most popular

1636
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,840
and that's how they name them.

1637
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,160
You know, pick suggestions,

1638
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,040
another great use of that, contact form.

1639
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,040
You get the sense, I really would like people

1640
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,520
to email us in questions and ideas and stuff

1641
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,200
just to help us out while we're on this road trip,

1642
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,520
because my God, has it been miserable on this road trip.

1643
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,840
We could use the help, you know,

1644
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,240
and it's a great way to touch base with the audience.

1645
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,480
If you've got something that you've added to your workflow

1646
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,080
that you think other folks in the audience

1647
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,960
might benefit from, yeah, please do send it in.

1648
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,800
Bonus points if it's made with rest.

1649
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,280
Totes, wow, yeah, I mean, we love to play the horn.

1650
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,920
And then also, I'm still on the road for a bit.

1651
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,240
I don't know exactly what my sitchimication is,

1652
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,080
and I don't know how many meetups I'll be able to do,

1653
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,160
but check out colonytracker.live,

1654
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,400
and there's a micro meetup link there.

1655
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,100
And if you can't meet up with me,

1656
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,800
but maybe you know something about the area I'm in,

1657
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:04,800
because we have the live map there,

1658
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,160
the tracker's still going.

1659
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,000
It looks like it's broken because it's been stuck

1660
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,520
in the same spot for a while,

1661
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:11,880
but this could be a way to help out.

1662
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,680
If you know a spot where I could store the RV,

1663
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,240
potentially, if I have to bail,

1664
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,880
if you know something about the area I'm in,

1665
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,040
or if you'd like to meet up and grab a bite, potentially,

1666
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,280
there's a micro meetup link at colonytracker.live.

1667
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,840
And I mention that because it sends a push notification

1668
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,120
to me, and so I see those.

1669
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,160
We have a channel that we collect those in.

1670
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:34,520
So sometimes like the emails and stuff,

1671
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:36,440
they'll slip through the cracks every now and then,

1672
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:39,520
whereas that is a specific channel for that purpose.

1673
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,760
So something over at colonytracker.live

1674
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:42,640
if you'd like to help out.

1675
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,320
In the meantime, if you do the Twitter thing,

1676
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:47,160
you can follow the show over at atlinxunplugged.

1677
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:49,560
The entire network is at Jupiter Signal,

1678
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,160
where we have all kinds of announcements

1679
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,280
for podcast releases and other show news

1680
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,640
and stuff like that.

1681
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:56,880
And if you work in the tech industry,

1682
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,840
go check out Linux Action News.

1683
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,520
Every Monday morning, Wes and I break down

1684
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,300
everything that matters in the world of Linux,

1685
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:03,960
nothing more, nothing less.

1686
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,440
And sometimes that means it's a 15 minute show

1687
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,760
when there's nothing going on in the dead of summer.

1688
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,800
And sometimes it means it's a 40 minute show.

1689
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,860
But what we do is we cut out all the BS

1690
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:14,160
and we focus on just the stuff

1691
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,640
we really think you need to know about

1692
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,200
and we try to do the best analysis possible for you.

1693
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,320
That's linuxactionnews.com.

1694
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,760
And the show continues to roll on

1695
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:24,440
regardless of where I'm at live on a Tuesday.

1696
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,760
See you next week.

1697
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,280
Same bad time, same bad station.

1698
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:32,120
Yeah, 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1699
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,640
Wherever I'm at, I just go by JB time.

1700
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,620
It makes it easier.

1701
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:36,240
Links to everything we talked about today,

1702
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,880
including the contact page, the mumble server,

1703
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,880
our matrix community, how to subscribe.

1704
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:43,840
It's all at linuxunplugged.com.

1705
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:48,200
Links for this specific episode, linuxunplugged.com slash 422.

1706
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,360
And that's it.

1707
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,200
That's pretty much it.

1708
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,760
You can get links to everything right there.

1709
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,840
Thanks so much for joining us

1710
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,880
on this week's episode of The Unplugged Program.

1711
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,720
Assuming I survive the heat,

1712
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:02,000
maybe, maybe I'll even be lucky to get the hell outta here.

1713
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,640
Man should never have built in Tucson.

1714
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,400
Assuming all that works out,

1715
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,560
see you right back here next Tuesday.

1716
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:13,560
We'll be right back.

1717
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:43,560
All right, JBtitles.com.

1718
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:49,920
Everybody go over there and vote.

1719
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,000
Let's pick our title, see if we can name this thing.

1720
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,240
So I finally did it.

1721
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,080
I wasn't even gonna mention that I was using Garuda.

1722
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:56,920
I don't know why.

1723
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,520
I just thought like, I'll keep this to myself.

1724
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,520
You know, Chris, you kept it so to yourself

1725
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:04,400
that even despite my living with you for what, two weeks,

1726
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,880
I had no idea.

1727
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,720
Yeah.

1728
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,000
Well done, sir, well done.

1729
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,760
So did you guys see that Boiling Steam had an interview

1730
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,360
with the CodeWeavers folks?

1731
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:16,800
And in that interview, they tried to clarify that,

1732
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,240
hey, we don't think Valve meant that the Steam Deck

1733
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:22,600
is gonna be able to run every Steam game

1734
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,080
from a software perspective.

1735
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:27,840
We think Valve just meant the hardware would be capable

1736
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,760
of it if the developers put the effort

1737
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,120
to get it working on Proton.

1738
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:33,560
And I think that has been a massive misread.

1739
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:36,200
People, because of that IGN interview that Valve did,

1740
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,680
it sounded like Valve was saying,

1741
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,320
every game in the Steam library,

1742
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,680
they're hoping to have run on the Deck

1743
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,120
by the end of the year.

1744
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,880
And what CodeWeavers is saying,

1745
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,760
the people that would be plumbing that,

1746
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:48,760
they're saying, actually, it's just possible,
