WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.720
So Popey you you made a post about 11 gig. Oh

00:05.440 --> 00:08.000
Yeah, yeah 24 oh

00:08.760 --> 00:10.760
You left yours running as well

00:10.960 --> 00:14.000
The recorder you left with the recorder running or something or what? Yeah

00:15.560 --> 00:18.800
So we all use NTP to make sure we're all in sync

00:18.800 --> 00:23.240
So we don't have to clap or click or anything. Oh, you're all using your own custom NTP server

00:23.240 --> 00:26.960
Is that what you're doing? Like yeah, well, no, we just all point at the same one. Oh that works

00:26.960 --> 00:30.320
Yeah, so we're only ever like no, yeah, not to write

00:30.320 --> 00:34.120
It's not like that so they all the audio recorders start at the same time very smart

00:34.120 --> 00:39.680
So they're very easy to line up. But the problem is because we've said it to like start recording at nine o'clock

00:40.560 --> 00:43.300
And audio recorder by default will auto

00:44.080 --> 00:46.940
Spawn when you log in so the next day off now

00:47.440 --> 00:52.080
Yeah, me too. I reboot and audio recorders sat there in the background. I didn't even know

00:53.080 --> 00:54.680
started recording

00:54.680 --> 01:00.520
Four days later and I'm shutting down my PC for like a kernel update or something and the very last thing to shut down

01:00.520 --> 01:05.920
I look and see hang on a minute. That thing's been recording for four days and there's an 11 gig file

01:07.820 --> 01:12.920
No, no, there was there was me babbling away in a conversation with my wife about birthday presents and wish lists

01:12.920 --> 01:17.880
I was like I need to delete this there is going to be something incriminating. Yeah, I'm gonna get rid of it now

01:17.880 --> 01:19.360
I was

01:19.360 --> 01:25.740
What drew my attention to it was I suddenly thought why is the system monitor showing? There's always CPU activity

01:25.740 --> 01:30.680
What's going on? And then I ran h-top and I was like, what's all do you record a doing running now?

01:31.960 --> 01:38.760
Oh, I've been recording audio for half days. This is a legitimate reason why I have I try to always have an extension that puts my

01:38.760 --> 01:44.560
CPU usage up somewhere on my screen because that's often how I'll catch stuff is I'll just glance up and notice wait a minute

01:44.560 --> 01:47.320
That's CPU usage looks a lot higher for them what I'm doing right now on the computer

01:47.320 --> 01:52.060
And I don't I normally don't check it and sometimes I wouldn't even notice unless I had a little system monitor applet that told

01:52.060 --> 01:54.060
me so if you've seen

01:54.960 --> 01:56.960
There's a new Chrome bit

01:57.520 --> 02:02.960
So now we've got Chromebooks Chrome boxes and now the thing that's long as ever Chromecast

02:03.280 --> 02:07.120
That is effectively Chrome in a in a year in a HDMI stick

02:07.320 --> 02:12.480
And you plug in the power and you plug in a keyboard and there's your computer. I was just looking at this actually

02:12.480 --> 02:19.400
It's funny you say that longer Google are completely eating our lunch with these machines. Are they you think you think they're totally like taking

02:19.400 --> 02:21.240
away, that's how smart their number

02:21.240 --> 02:23.240
Yeah, totally. There's no number one

02:23.880 --> 02:29.160
Laptops on Amazon if you go to right if you go to Amazon and look at laptops the number one seller has a Chromebook

02:29.160 --> 02:32.760
Yeah, no, not a Windows laptop, right or Mac. We should be there

02:33.160 --> 02:37.880
Well, I agree and we are in a way but the thing is is Google's got brand

02:37.880 --> 02:41.160
They got OEMs working with them and it's a simplified package

02:41.160 --> 02:46.720
It's it's sort of it's capitalizing in a way isn't it almost in a way capitalizing on the failed promise of tablets

02:46.960 --> 02:48.400
You know the tablet didn't do it

02:48.400 --> 02:49.640
You ended up needing a keyboard

02:49.640 --> 02:55.280
But you still need something kind of simple like a tablet and something cheap and I don't know maybe this is maybe this is

02:55.960 --> 02:58.120
Maybe this is the right product for the right time

02:58.800 --> 03:04.040
Doesn't necessarily now I wonder I don't know about these USB sticks, but a Chromebook doesn't necessarily mean it's a loss for a Linux

03:04.040 --> 03:10.800
Installation people might get bored with the very basic nature of Chromebook and one look elsewhere. I

03:11.480 --> 03:13.720
Mean well, maybe it'll eventually make more like switchers

03:13.720 --> 03:19.720
I mean like I look at those those stream PCs those really cheap HP PCs that come with Windows 8 1 pre-installed with Bing

03:21.840 --> 03:26.520
And you know what I just look at those as a future Linux boxes as well, I'm not too worried about it

03:26.520 --> 03:31.480
Yeah, I I wish I wish Google would have just wouldn't have been crazy

03:31.480 --> 03:35.040
You know in a crazy universe if Google just would have done like Ubuntu

03:37.600 --> 03:39.600
That would have been nice

03:40.360 --> 03:46.360
Considering that they have their own I know exactly exactly would have been so cool if they just would have done that

03:47.760 --> 03:51.980
Originally it was crime crime OS originally was based on Ubuntu then they switched

03:52.760 --> 03:58.360
Building their own packages using Gentoo, right? I mean that would have been a heat. That would have that would have changed everything

03:58.360 --> 04:01.400
And it used to use Firefox. Oh

04:04.440 --> 04:05.680
Right

04:05.680 --> 04:11.000
Right, it did didn't know it did that the very first Chrome OS was before the Chrome browser, right?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.480
And it was Firefox based, wasn't it? Yep

04:14.760 --> 04:16.760
What yes, this is

04:17.080 --> 04:22.760
Yes, the original concept was Firefox and a really really thin Ubuntu ish thing

04:22.760 --> 04:28.800
Yeah, and it wasn't like Chrome OS so much as it was a distro really. I'm gonna go look for it

04:31.800 --> 04:36.160
Yeah, I wasn't from Google yeah, and I was using it from like

04:37.680 --> 04:43.760
Well, not when it was a Chrome OS release right right as a product when they were coming up with the concept for it

04:43.760 --> 04:46.440
It was Firefox based. Yeah, and I think did you read this in a book?

04:46.440 --> 04:51.400
Is that where you and I both saw this in in the entering the plex? Is that where you got this? It wasn't a book

04:51.400 --> 04:57.520
I can't remember where I remember this from but just know it's somewhere on the history of Chrome OS. Yeah

04:58.920 --> 05:02.860
When Chrome OS was based on Firefox and rejected by Google

05:05.880 --> 05:10.480
My goodness, you're right. I had no idea. Where did you find it? Where did you find that? Yeah, I'm looking for the verge

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
There you go

05:13.000 --> 05:16.280
Chrome OS was originally based on the different rails of Firefox

05:16.280 --> 05:17.360
Yeah

05:17.360 --> 05:21.440
Could you imagine if they would have gone with Firefox and Ubuntu how different the world would be after at this point?

05:21.440 --> 05:23.440
I wonder if we'd be as successful

05:23.440 --> 05:27.840
Hmm see people still refer to Google having their own in-house Ubuntu

05:27.840 --> 05:31.920
But I think we're you know looking back quite a long time Popey

05:31.920 --> 05:36.440
I mean, do you know anything about that or is it really an internal thing? They still use it internally

05:36.440 --> 05:41.760
Yeah, and is it Ubuntu or is it their their own, you know, spin of Ubuntu?

05:41.760 --> 05:48.800
It's it's Ubuntu. It's called gubuntu and it's it's Ubuntu with some stuff ripped out and some other stuff added

05:49.040 --> 05:54.640
Like any corporate desktop is windows stuff ripped out and stuff added so it's no different than that

05:55.480 --> 05:57.480
and

05:57.640 --> 06:03.320
The last time we interviewed, you know, if you listen to the show you would have known we interviewed the guy who's responsible for this

06:03.320 --> 06:04.880
at Google and

06:04.880 --> 06:06.880
it's it was

06:06.880 --> 06:10.960
Um, basically isn't it as a new starter at Google you you would have three choices

06:11.640 --> 06:18.680
Sorry two choices. You'd either have a PC or a Mac and if you got a Mac you'd get OS 10 if you chose PC

06:18.680 --> 06:20.480
you'd either get Windows or

06:20.480 --> 06:24.400
Ubuntu you could install something else if you want to but that's what you would get

06:25.000 --> 06:27.320
And yeah, good one too is basically a bunch

06:27.320 --> 06:33.560
I mean we have bugs in our bug tracker from you know, the Google IT people who are you know

06:34.240 --> 06:36.240
working on problems

06:36.240 --> 06:42.480
Delivering it to their to their users, but I haven't I haven't heard much about it for the last night year or so

06:42.480 --> 06:44.480
I don't know. Yeah

06:45.200 --> 06:47.200
Whether they all use Chrome OS

06:47.560 --> 06:51.880
You know is Chrome OS their new internal desktop operating system

06:51.880 --> 06:55.160
So and this is what I was told from someone who got hired recently and so puppy

06:55.160 --> 06:56.800
I wonder if this lines up with what you heard is

06:56.800 --> 06:59.660
You get like three choices when you get hired at Google right now

06:59.660 --> 07:01.800
You get a gubuntu which is based on

07:01.800 --> 07:07.120
1404 and and and they they rev in a new one every new LTS and that's what they've been doing for a long time now is

07:07.280 --> 07:11.800
The official gubuntu is based on the latest LTS and then so that's your first option

07:11.800 --> 07:17.360
Your second option is a Chromebook and your third option is a MacBook and I guess like if you want to buy a Windows machine

07:17.360 --> 07:22.040
Like you have to get approval and like I think there's like a whole different like path

07:22.040 --> 07:24.200
You have to go through to even get a Windows box at all

07:25.360 --> 07:27.720
So that I don't know if that lines up with what you've heard at all

07:27.720 --> 07:33.720
Yeah, it may well be their policies changed over time. But as I understand it gubuntu still exists. That's all that's all I know

07:33.720 --> 07:34.920
I heard it was the first choice

07:34.920 --> 07:36.920
I heard gubuntu is the top choice

07:36.920 --> 07:41.920
Chromebook second choice or Mac books are second choice and Chrome and Chromebooks are third choice or something like that on on average

07:46.920 --> 07:52.120
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that is bracing for the fools of April

07:52.120 --> 07:58.120
My name is Chris Ted. My name is Matt. Hey Matt episode 86, buddy. That's not that's not too bad

07:58.120 --> 08:02.120
86 already. No, that means we're getting I mean, I don't know if you're familiar with the way this works

08:02.120 --> 08:04.720
But I think that means we're nearing episode 90. I

08:05.120 --> 08:09.120
Believe so. I'm you know, mathematically challenged, but I do believe we got 87 and then a few others

08:10.120 --> 08:15.120
Hey, so but don't worry. We're not even we're not even looking if we're not looking ahead. We haven't lost track

08:15.120 --> 08:19.120
We're focused. We're hunkered in we're in the trenches of episode 86 this week

08:19.120 --> 08:23.120
We got a lot to cover first up. There is a horrible rumor

08:24.120 --> 08:27.120
Horrible rumor spreading around the internet right now

08:28.120 --> 08:33.120
And that is that the Linux kernel is being forked by a very ambitious team

08:33.120 --> 08:37.120
I will tell you more about that in just a little bit as the show goes on and if it's true or not

08:37.120 --> 08:39.120
and you

08:39.120 --> 08:43.120
You probably have heard this rumor. It's spreading like crazy right now. Also some new improvements coming to the cinnamon desktop

08:43.120 --> 08:45.120
We're gonna talk about that

08:45.120 --> 08:49.120
Official Linux fest Northwest planning coverage begins and also

08:50.120 --> 08:53.120
We're gonna hopefully get to it this week. I have we been

08:54.120 --> 08:56.120
Have we been negligent in our coverage Matt?

08:56.120 --> 09:00.120
Have we been negligent in covering some of the other distributions that we all know and love out there?

09:00.120 --> 09:06.120
So Matt today we will so we will find out we'll take audience. We will take a test Matt

09:06.120 --> 09:08.120
I will challenge that assumption of yours

09:08.120 --> 09:12.120
And then last and then last but not least there's a really cool device that runs Linux

09:13.120 --> 09:17.120
That is just one of those things reminds you it's really 2015 and it's pretty exciting

09:17.120 --> 09:20.120
And we'll talk about that coming up a little bit in the show

09:20.120 --> 09:22.120
But Matt before we go too far

09:22.120 --> 09:24.120
We do have a you won't be able to hear it

09:24.120 --> 09:30.120
But they over far in the distance Matt if just over the horizon wolf blitzers over there with a little

09:31.120 --> 09:33.120
little breaking news

09:33.120 --> 09:35.120
That's right. Yeah, we're going to talk a little bit about that

09:35.120 --> 09:39.120
It's a little breaking news breaking news. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, we have a little breaking news right now

09:39.120 --> 09:41.120
You might have heard it

09:41.120 --> 09:47.120
But apparently the systemd team is planning to fork the Linux kernel everybody get your pitchforks

09:47.120 --> 09:49.120
It's time to fight. We are going all-in

09:50.120 --> 09:51.120
No, not really

09:51.120 --> 09:56.120
They are not forking the Linux kernel but various places on the internet it even made it to hacker news

09:56.120 --> 09:58.120
the pharaonic forms the reddit

09:58.120 --> 10:05.120
And apparently a github account was even created with the name system Damon and registered and registered to somebody

10:05.120 --> 10:10.120
And the whole rumor was is that the systemd folks were going to fork the Linux kernel in order to

10:11.120 --> 10:15.120
Make things just work a little better streamline areas and have full control over the entire stack

10:16.120 --> 10:18.120
Turns out it was totally an April Fool's joke

10:18.120 --> 10:26.120
Totally a mumble room. Did you guys did you guys catch this the systemd is forking kernel the kernel story?

10:26.120 --> 10:32.120
I saw something saying that it wasn't true on reddit, but yeah, I saw the chatroom talking about it all morning

10:34.120 --> 10:41.120
Weekly and it got linked to an actual github repo and the name of the github repositories name

10:41.120 --> 10:48.120
Or at least the system Damon's name is Ivan got you bitch gotcha Ivan gotcha

10:48.120 --> 10:53.120
Yeah, in other words in other words April Fool's April Fool's, right?

10:53.120 --> 10:59.120
This isn't really it makes a nice change from people saying the next thing canonical will fork is the Linux kernel

10:59.120 --> 11:01.120
So that made me

11:03.120 --> 11:05.120
Oh

11:05.120 --> 11:07.120
I gotta pull that post down then hang on

11:07.120 --> 11:09.120
I gotta pull that post down then hang on

11:11.120 --> 11:13.120
Yeah

11:13.120 --> 11:15.120
People like are you gonna talk about this Chris are you gonna double think? Yeah

11:16.120 --> 11:20.120
I'm gonna talk about this. It's for somehow somehow it missed the Linux action show this weekend

11:20.120 --> 11:22.120
I don't I don't quite know how that happened

11:22.120 --> 11:25.120
Also, I also wanted to give a shout out to the digi. Oh, hi there

11:25.120 --> 11:30.120
I want to give a shout out to the digicam project there at CBIT 2015 and

11:31.120 --> 11:34.120
Digi digicam got an award. It's really cool

11:34.120 --> 11:40.120
They actually got the best open source photo management application and digicam is often compared to Adobe Lightroom

11:40.120 --> 11:43.120
Which the project considers to be pretty much in a compliment

11:43.120 --> 11:49.120
But it's an application Lightroom is an application popular among enthusiasts and professional photo photographers on Windows and Mac OS

11:49.120 --> 11:57.120
So they consider that to be an achievement and congrats to digicam. I've been specifically looking at digicam perhaps for a close family members

11:57.120 --> 12:00.120
photo workflow in the near future as

12:00.120 --> 12:03.120
as the fruit company who also makes hardware is

12:04.120 --> 12:11.120
Sunlighting their long-term ifoto photo management program now seems like the perfect opportunity for those of us who are open source

12:11.120 --> 12:17.120
Enthusiast to recommend a really solid open source alternative to ifoto. I don't think photos is it?

12:17.120 --> 12:20.120
I don't think Apple's replacements it I'm not a big fan of the nearline system

12:20.120 --> 12:25.120
I don't totally totally trust iCloud for the things that I consider to be the most precious digital asset that I own the photos of my

12:25.120 --> 12:31.120
Children so for me perhaps that's a great opportunity to recommend the transition to an open source photo management program

12:31.120 --> 12:33.120
So I'll be doing that for a few people in my life

12:33.120 --> 12:37.120
And I think digicam is probably the one I'm going to pick because the timing is now

12:38.120 --> 12:44.120
It makes sense. I mean because I'm actually in a similar situation with my wife who is not real pleased with that news either

12:44.120 --> 12:47.120
Yeah, and you know and that might actually be a solution

12:47.120 --> 12:51.120
I could actually she's perfectly comfortable with Linux so it's certainly plausible

12:51.120 --> 12:57.120
And what do we always say if you give people tools that are available on Linux and available that you can first set them up

12:57.120 --> 13:02.120
On their existing platform when they make that transition to Linux. It's even easier because all the applications are the same that they love

13:03.120 --> 13:04.120
Exactly

13:04.120 --> 13:05.120
Congrats to digicam

13:05.120 --> 13:08.120
We just want to give them a little shout out at the top of the Linux Unplugged show episode 86

13:08.120 --> 13:11.120
See it's good luck. It's good luck and then last but not least

13:11.120 --> 13:17.120
Get ready to run that gnome application everywhere you want anywhere everywhere across any distribution

13:17.120 --> 13:20.120
Could it be true? Can it be real? The gnome project thinks so

13:20.120 --> 13:25.120
We've talked about a little bit before but the official first gnome SDK runtime builds are out

13:25.120 --> 13:27.120
Yeah, this is a gnome runtime

13:27.120 --> 13:32.120
So you can build your gnome application against this runtime and then this runtime gets distributed to any distribution

13:32.120 --> 13:36.120
And as long as you have that runtime the app runs doesn't matter what distro it is

13:36.120 --> 13:39.120
It's based on gnome 3.16 run libraries

13:39.120 --> 13:45.120
And there's this is definitely just a developer preview. So they're considered to be weekly supported

13:45.120 --> 13:50.120
The developer will try to keep them somewhat updated as major issues and API has come up, but right now it's a work in progress

13:50.120 --> 13:52.120
And I think it's kind of neat

13:52.120 --> 13:57.120
I don't know if anybody in the mobile room has any thoughts on this, but I thought this was a neat way

13:57.120 --> 14:01.120
This is this is kind of clunky. I'll totally admit that it's a little low tech

14:01.120 --> 14:06.120
You're bundling up a whole bunch of libraries and stuff and sticking them in some directory somewhere and then telling developers to write to that

14:06.120 --> 14:11.120
That's what steam does today, but it works and steam selling $60 games doing this

14:11.120 --> 14:16.120
I don't know. I'd like to pick wimpy's brain. What do you think wimpy?

14:17.120 --> 14:22.120
Well, yeah, it's a departure from the traditional way of doing things on Linux

14:22.120 --> 14:38.120
But I think systems like this, a way that you can bundle either a runtime or an overlay to give developers a predictable development target is the way that Linux is going to have to go

14:38.120 --> 14:45.120
If we're going to continue to want to drive adoption, particularly for application developers

14:45.120 --> 14:52.120
Could you see a distribution like Ubuntu Mate shipping this runtime out of the box?

14:52.120 --> 14:57.120
And maybe even having a package in the repository that gets updated or Ubuntu might or somebody. Could you see a world like that?

14:57.120 --> 15:04.120
Yeah, I can. I can see Ubuntu doing it. I can see OpenSUSE are doing it. I can see Fedora doing it

15:04.120 --> 15:09.120
And as soon as you get the big players doing it, then everyone's got it and then you've you've cracked it, haven't you?

15:09.120 --> 15:13.120
Yeah, because you've essentially you create an API, a stable API that people can write to

15:13.120 --> 15:21.120
You've created a certain set of expectations that you can write to and that a certain and gnome 3.16 is no slouch

15:21.120 --> 15:25.120
That's the latest and freshest gnome. So it's not going to be that far behind even after a few releases

15:25.120 --> 15:29.120
Having 3.16 as the base is actually going to be pretty good

15:29.120 --> 15:35.120
I mean, Steam seems to be successfully doing it. So maybe others can successfully do it

15:35.120 --> 15:39.120
And we have the hard drive space to have a few extra libraries

15:39.120 --> 15:43.120
And if as long as they keep updated for security fixes, which is always the trick with this kind of stuff

15:43.120 --> 15:47.120
But that's not a challenge we're incapable of solving. We have package managers everywhere

15:47.120 --> 15:53.120
So, yeah, I think it's kind of interesting. We'll see. This could be a great way to get

15:53.120 --> 16:00.120
It would be funny if like Qt has like all the real nice technical advantages and market share advantages

16:00.120 --> 16:04.120
But GTK comes along and says, well, but we've got builder

16:04.120 --> 16:08.120
We've got this runtime and we've got a pretty good looking desktop

16:08.120 --> 16:14.120
So here's all the things you just here's your here's your complete solution to delivering it on across all distributions

16:14.120 --> 16:18.120
And you don't even have to have like file system overlays and containers

16:18.120 --> 16:22.120
And I think it's not a bad solution. We'll see if anybody really uses it

16:22.120 --> 16:26.120
We'll see. It's going to take somebody to actually package up their application with it

16:26.120 --> 16:29.120
Someone's bound to do it

16:29.120 --> 16:33.120
Has anybody tried it? I mean, how difficult is it?

16:33.120 --> 16:36.120
Super new. Super, super new. Like yesterday new

16:36.120 --> 16:39.120
Yeah, it was just posted online yesterday

16:39.120 --> 16:42.120
So I don't think there's much of anybody using it

16:42.120 --> 16:47.120
But I've just been following it closely on the show because what I'm really trying to crack

16:47.120 --> 16:51.120
And maybe I should make this more obvious, right, is universal application distributions across all distributions

16:51.120 --> 16:55.120
Because on Coder Radio, the email we get in all the time and when we started Coder Radio

16:55.120 --> 17:00.120
The email we get is, hey, so I'm an iOS developer and I just got myself a little Linux machine for the first time

17:00.120 --> 17:04.120
It's really cute and quaint and I want to write an adorable little app for that Linux desktop

17:04.120 --> 17:07.120
Can you point me in the direction of the SDK?

17:07.120 --> 17:10.120
Can you point me how I'm supposed to get started? What I'm supposed to do?

17:10.120 --> 17:14.120
And every time we just have a different answer depending on the trend, you know, it's

17:14.120 --> 17:19.120
And this is a this is a full fledged answer, which I think is kind of exciting

17:19.120 --> 17:21.120
I think it'll be interesting to see where it all ends up in the long run

17:21.120 --> 17:23.120
I agree Matt, I agree

17:23.120 --> 17:28.120
So you can find out more information in the show notes or check blogs.gnome.org

17:28.120 --> 17:29.120
And maybe it goes nowhere

17:29.120 --> 17:31.120
This is all part of their work on sandbox applications too

17:31.120 --> 17:34.120
So I imagine if you're going to be sandboxing apps, this will become more important as well

17:34.120 --> 17:40.120
So it all fits in with application distribution, sandboxing, the future of different desktops

17:40.120 --> 17:44.120
It's a big picture that we're watching come slowly together in front of our eyes

17:44.120 --> 17:48.120
Speaking of bringing things together in front of your eyes, how about your education?

17:48.120 --> 17:52.120
Over at Linux Academy, I mean it, go over to Linux Academy right now and check them out

17:52.120 --> 17:53.120
They freaking rock

17:53.120 --> 17:56.120
Linux Academy is our sponsor right here on the Unplugged program

17:56.120 --> 17:59.120
And they I think are I think one of the best sponsors for Linux Unplugged

17:59.120 --> 18:01.120
Because they're such a great fit for you guys

18:01.120 --> 18:07.120
It really is the matchup of open source enthusiasts, Linux administrators, and educators coming together to build something special

18:07.120 --> 18:11.120
And you can take advantage of it by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

18:11.120 --> 18:13.120
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

18:13.120 --> 18:17.120
Head over there right now, check them out and get our special discount

18:17.120 --> 18:20.120
Discount at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

18:20.120 --> 18:24.120
Step-by-step video courses for everything they cover and the content is always expanding

18:24.120 --> 18:28.120
So that's very nice and they have downloadable comprehensive study guides you can bring with you on the go

18:28.120 --> 18:30.120
Ah, maybe you're in the shower

18:30.120 --> 18:32.120
Maybe you're traveling

18:32.120 --> 18:34.120
No judging, I'm not going to judge

18:34.120 --> 18:37.120
And they're always, they're always like the best, the best

18:37.120 --> 18:41.120
Because these people really truly get the content and what your goals are

18:41.120 --> 18:44.120
Because they've been in your shoes, they've been in your position

18:44.120 --> 18:47.120
And so when they see things that come up like Docker

18:47.120 --> 18:50.120
And things like Vagrant and Amazon Web Services

18:50.120 --> 18:53.120
They really can wrap their brains around how to make scenario based labs

18:53.120 --> 18:57.120
So that way you can go in and really get your hands on with that technology

18:57.120 --> 19:00.120
And they have self-paced courses where you can set your own limits

19:00.120 --> 19:02.120
You get your percentages when you log in

19:02.120 --> 19:05.120
See exactly where you're going to have to take off, where you're going to leave off

19:05.120 --> 19:07.120
And exactly how long it's going to take you to get through that course

19:07.120 --> 19:09.120
And I like that, I guess I'm a bit of a data head

19:09.120 --> 19:12.120
I like to be able to break it all down and see how long something's going to take me

19:12.120 --> 19:17.120
The idea that I could see the goal of learning Python will take six hours

19:17.120 --> 19:21.120
Or I think it's like five and a half hours on Linux Academy

19:21.120 --> 19:25.120
That is such a, that is a quantifiable thing that I can put that in my head and go

19:25.120 --> 19:29.120
I can learn the basics of Python in five and a half hours?

19:29.120 --> 19:35.120
That is a huge, huge pivot from like I have to learn this nebulous thing called Python

19:35.120 --> 19:38.120
And it's this programming language that's going to be very complicated

19:38.120 --> 19:41.120
You know, it just cuts through all of that

19:41.120 --> 19:45.120
Plus you've got instructor help, you've got live streaming, a fantastic community

19:45.120 --> 19:47.120
And they're going to do some big content updates

19:47.120 --> 19:49.120
April 16th, they're going to do a live stream

19:49.120 --> 19:51.120
New content coming to Linux Academy

19:51.120 --> 19:55.120
I've also gotten notes about folks that pass their certifications after training at Linux Academy

19:55.120 --> 19:57.120
And it happens more and more all the time

19:57.120 --> 19:59.120
It is a really, really great setup

19:59.120 --> 20:04.120
And I think one of the things that I've found is when we'll follow things in the news

20:04.120 --> 20:07.120
I'll be like, this is obviously going to be a big deal

20:07.120 --> 20:11.120
I end up talking to the folks who run Linux Academy, they're already working on courseware for it

20:11.120 --> 20:13.120
They have a really cool lab setup

20:13.120 --> 20:18.120
When we first brought them on as a sponsor, I got sort of geeky with the backend technology

20:18.120 --> 20:22.120
And really sort of was like, wow man

20:22.120 --> 20:24.120
I was talking to Anthony who runs Linux Academy

20:24.120 --> 20:27.120
If I was going to do this today, like if I was going to launch Jupyter Broadcasting today

20:27.120 --> 20:29.120
I might seriously do something like this

20:29.120 --> 20:31.120
Because it's so genius

20:31.120 --> 20:32.120
They've got everything

20:32.120 --> 20:38.120
You've Red Hat training, Python, OpenStack, DevOps, Android, PHP, Ruby

20:38.120 --> 20:40.120
The Amazon Web Services stuff is particularly great

20:40.120 --> 20:44.120
Because I find that to be an expensive thing to learn

20:44.120 --> 20:48.120
And the fact that all of the Amazon Web Services are just included with your Linux Academy subscription

20:48.120 --> 20:50.120
Makes that really stress free

20:50.120 --> 20:53.120
Makes that you don't even have to worry about getting that accidental charge from Amazon

20:53.120 --> 20:55.120
Which I have done

20:55.120 --> 20:56.120
And it is not cheap

20:56.120 --> 20:59.120
I accidentally one time got charged $200

20:59.120 --> 21:04.120
Because I left an AWS services server running for 30 days by mistake

21:04.120 --> 21:05.120
Not doing a single thing

21:05.120 --> 21:07.120
But it was like $280 just running

21:07.120 --> 21:09.120
Because I was just trying to learn Amazon Web Services

21:09.120 --> 21:11.120
I don't have to worry about that with Linux Academy

21:11.120 --> 21:13.120
linuxacademy.com slash unplug

21:13.120 --> 21:15.120
Get our special Linux Unplugged discount

21:15.120 --> 21:19.120
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program

21:19.120 --> 21:22.120
You guys are powerful

21:22.120 --> 21:24.120
Alright, so we got some feedback into the show

21:24.120 --> 21:26.120
Tell me that I'm a dummy

21:26.120 --> 21:30.120
He says, Ubuntu touch apps and other distributions are how Chris is wrong

21:30.120 --> 21:33.120
Right, so this has been stopping me from sleeping for a while

21:33.120 --> 21:35.120
Because, well, it wound me up

21:35.120 --> 21:37.120
On a certain episode of Linux Unplugged

21:37.120 --> 21:40.120
Chris questioned how Ubuntu applications made with the Ubuntu SDK

21:40.120 --> 21:42.120
Would look on non-Ubuntu desktop environments

21:42.120 --> 21:44.120
And quite rightly came to the conclusion

21:44.120 --> 21:46.120
Well, they would probably look out of place

21:46.120 --> 21:49.120
Fine, let's stop right now and talk about something else

21:49.120 --> 21:50.120
GNOME apps

21:50.120 --> 21:52.120
GNOME apps are effing s

21:52.120 --> 21:54.120
Under anything that isn't GNOME, however

21:54.120 --> 21:56.120
Nobody is giving GNOME a hard time over this

21:56.120 --> 22:00.120
GNOME is essing all over everyone else in their poorly designed applications

22:00.120 --> 22:04.120
And the Ubuntu desktop and other desktops are suffering because of it

22:04.120 --> 22:06.120
And he includes some examples

22:06.120 --> 22:08.120
Here is a GNOME app

22:08.120 --> 22:09.120
Under Unity

22:09.120 --> 22:11.120
That looks horrible with the client-side decoration

22:11.120 --> 22:14.120
Here's one that also looks quite horrible

22:14.120 --> 22:16.120
Because it doesn't have the right decorations

22:16.120 --> 22:18.120
He says, this is just totally effed

22:18.120 --> 22:21.120
This is Canonical's responsibility for patching GNOME apps to make them look right under Ubuntu

22:21.120 --> 22:23.120
You could make that argument

22:23.120 --> 22:24.120
But he disagrees

22:24.120 --> 22:27.120
If that's the case, Canonical should be allowed to do whatever they want

22:27.120 --> 22:29.120
And everybody else just patch that as well

22:29.120 --> 22:30.120
It goes both ways

22:30.120 --> 22:32.120
So if Canonical could make their own applications

22:32.120 --> 22:34.120
Look or don't look remotely

22:34.120 --> 22:37.120
Look remotely okay under any other desktop

22:37.120 --> 22:39.120
Then that's just fine

22:39.120 --> 22:41.120
Because GNOME is getting away with it as well

22:41.120 --> 22:43.120
Canonical shouldn't have

22:43.120 --> 22:47.120
The TLDR is Canonical shouldn't be given a hard time for making their applications

22:47.120 --> 22:49.120
And if they don't work on anything else

22:49.120 --> 22:51.120
That's nothing different than GNOME and the GNOME apps right now

22:51.120 --> 22:53.120
Or you could say maybe the elementary apps and things like that

22:53.120 --> 22:55.120
What do you think of this argument, Matt?

22:55.120 --> 22:57.120
That's like, hey, if they want to reinvent the wheel

22:57.120 --> 23:00.120
And make them only work okay on the Ubuntu desktop

23:00.120 --> 23:02.120
And not look okay on, say, Fedora with GNOME

23:02.120 --> 23:04.120
That's totally fine

23:04.120 --> 23:06.120
And this is just my opinion

23:06.120 --> 23:08.120
The whole thing, in my opinion, is just completely ridiculous

23:08.120 --> 23:10.120
It's like, okay, look

23:10.120 --> 23:13.120
As long as they're willing to make their efforts public

23:13.120 --> 23:15.120
And the code available and all that sort of stuff

23:15.120 --> 23:17.120
I don't care what they theme it with

23:17.120 --> 23:21.120
Because that's really where the ethical responsibility ends

23:21.120 --> 23:23.120
Is that, hey, we did something cool, here's the code for it

23:23.120 --> 23:25.120
You want to pretty it up, go ahead

23:25.120 --> 23:27.120
But it's not their responsibility

23:27.120 --> 23:30.120
They are, in fact, looking out for their desktop environment

23:30.120 --> 23:31.120
And what they're doing

23:31.120 --> 23:33.120
And if that doesn't play well with other things

23:33.120 --> 23:35.120
Well, whether it be GNOME, Unity, doesn't matter

23:35.120 --> 23:37.120
Same thing applies

23:37.120 --> 23:39.120
It just feels like a real straw man kind of argument

23:39.120 --> 23:41.120
I have a hard time getting behind it

23:41.120 --> 23:43.120
Hmm, okay, alright

23:43.120 --> 23:45.120
I can see, yes, I can see that point

23:45.120 --> 23:47.120
Anybody in the mumble room want to jump in

23:47.120 --> 23:49.120
Before I share my thoughts?

23:49.120 --> 23:54.120
If I'm an individual, you know, working on an application

23:54.120 --> 23:57.120
I wrote an application called Journal

23:57.120 --> 23:59.120
For the GNOME desktop

23:59.120 --> 24:01.120
And, you know, that's

24:01.120 --> 24:03.120
It's because that's what I use

24:03.120 --> 24:08.120
If I was going to port that over to Ubuntu Touch

24:08.120 --> 24:10.120
That would be fine

24:10.120 --> 24:12.120
But, you know, I would want some assistance

24:12.120 --> 24:16.120
From some actual Ubuntu Touch developers to do that

24:16.120 --> 24:18.120
So here's my question

24:18.120 --> 24:22.120
So, I think there's a pretty big difference between

24:22.120 --> 24:26.120
A desktop environment implementing something like a client-side decoration

24:26.120 --> 24:30.120
And the world's most popular Linux distribution

24:30.120 --> 24:32.120
Coming up with a new way for applications to look

24:32.120 --> 24:34.120
Because, and the reason why there's a difference

24:34.120 --> 24:36.120
Is because one is a desktop environment

24:36.120 --> 24:39.120
And one is the most important Linux distribution in the world

24:39.120 --> 24:40.120
For desktops

24:40.120 --> 24:41.120
Okay, you see the difference there?

24:41.120 --> 24:44.120
So if you want to write applications for Ubuntu

24:44.120 --> 24:45.120
They are going to look different

24:45.120 --> 24:48.120
And there's more people that probably want to write applications for Ubuntu

24:48.120 --> 24:50.120
Than they do for the general Linux desktop

24:50.120 --> 24:51.120
So now do you see the difference there?

24:51.120 --> 24:54.120
More people want to write applications for the Ubuntu desktop

24:54.120 --> 24:56.120
Than they want to write for the Linux desktop

24:56.120 --> 24:59.120
So that means more applications will be looking like they're designed for Ubuntu

24:59.120 --> 25:01.120
Regardless of the distribution you're using

25:01.120 --> 25:03.120
Do you see a problem with that, anybody?

25:03.120 --> 25:05.120
It's, no

25:05.120 --> 25:08.120
All the way through this I've just been thinking

25:08.120 --> 25:11.120
It's kind of like Qt and GTK

25:11.120 --> 25:15.120
If you run a GTK application on a Qt desktop

25:15.120 --> 25:17.120
It looks absolutely horrible

25:17.120 --> 25:20.120
Yeah, and you know, I just

25:20.120 --> 25:23.120
I actually don't know if it's going to be a bad thing or not

25:23.120 --> 25:25.120
I think maybe I was getting a little more hate for it

25:25.120 --> 25:27.120
I'm pointing out it's going to be a thing

25:27.120 --> 25:29.120
Doesn't mean it's going to be a bad thing

25:29.120 --> 25:30.120
Maybe it'll be fine

25:30.120 --> 25:32.120
In fact, maybe

25:32.120 --> 25:36.120
Because there's going to be like a standard design language

25:36.120 --> 25:39.120
Maybe there'll be the best looking apps on the Linux desktop

25:39.120 --> 25:40.120
Maybe

25:40.120 --> 25:42.120
Could be, could be

25:42.120 --> 25:44.120
Maybe it'll just take off because it looks good

25:44.120 --> 25:45.120
We'll wait and see

25:45.120 --> 25:47.120
I doubt it

25:47.120 --> 25:50.120
One more little update before we get into Linux Fast Northwest stuff

25:50.120 --> 25:54.120
I thought we'd talk a little bit about Cinnamon just super quick

25:54.120 --> 25:57.120
Because yesterday Clem did a blog post

25:57.120 --> 25:59.120
An update for Mint

25:59.120 --> 26:01.120
And he said a huge amount of work has gone into making Cinnamon load faster

26:01.120 --> 26:03.120
And I just got an email into the show the other day

26:03.120 --> 26:05.120
It said, how come you guys never talk about Cinnamon?

26:05.120 --> 26:07.120
So he says, we're only halfway there

26:07.120 --> 26:08.120
The results aren't conclusive yet

26:08.120 --> 26:10.120
One of our test machines on there

26:10.120 --> 26:13.120
Cinnamon was able to load in less than a second in normal conditions

26:13.120 --> 26:17.120
But can take up to 12 seconds to load the very first time the computer is turned on

26:17.120 --> 26:21.120
Investigations show that this delay took place in Cinnamon menus and Cinnamon desktop

26:21.120 --> 26:23.120
During the initial loading of application infos

26:23.120 --> 26:25.120
From like the menus and the user share applications directories

26:25.120 --> 26:26.120
And the icon themes of course

26:26.120 --> 26:30.120
Through optimizations the loading times were reduced from 12 seconds to 7 seconds on average

26:30.120 --> 26:34.120
Which is the first step but doesn't yet solve anything

26:34.120 --> 26:39.120
He says, we're still working on this and hoping we'll be able to drastically reduce that initial time

26:39.120 --> 26:42.120
Wouldn't it be cool if Cinnamon becomes one of the fastest, snappiest desktops?

26:42.120 --> 26:45.120
That would be very cool, especially considering all its little bells and whistles

26:45.120 --> 26:51.120
Mint has also made a call out for photographers and graphics designers and web people

26:51.120 --> 26:53.120
They need a lot of work there

26:53.120 --> 26:59.120
And they'd eventually like to have somebody that could maybe even take over responsibility of the look of Linux Mint

26:59.120 --> 27:01.120
Some also some information about upcoming releases

27:01.120 --> 27:04.120
Linux Mint 18 is going to be released sometime in 2016

27:04.120 --> 27:06.120
We don't have a specific date yet

27:06.120 --> 27:12.120
However, Linux Mint 17.2 which I believe is based on Ubuntu 14.04 will be coming soon

27:12.120 --> 27:14.120
Probably very soon

27:14.120 --> 27:15.120
So we'll keep an eye out for that

27:15.120 --> 27:16.120
Congrats to the Linux Mint people

27:16.120 --> 27:20.120
I wanted to try to give them a little coverage since we've been kind of missing that

27:20.120 --> 27:24.120
Anybody want to chime in on anything before I move on?

27:24.120 --> 27:26.120
Okay, good enough

27:26.120 --> 27:28.120
Sometimes there's nothing to say

27:28.120 --> 27:31.120
I wanted to mention that I started a meetup and a couple of things

27:31.120 --> 27:32.120
Boy, there's a lot to cover today

27:32.120 --> 27:35.120
I'm sorry I'm going kind of fast, but I wanted to get to some of our other topics

27:35.120 --> 27:37.120
So I decided to do something

27:37.120 --> 27:40.120
I decided to create a meetup group for Jupyter Broadcasting

27:40.120 --> 27:44.120
I've been kind of trying to figure out the best way to sort of organize future meetups

27:44.120 --> 27:46.120
And as well as Linux Fest Northwest

27:46.120 --> 27:50.120
So I kind of wanted to get an idea of how many people are coming to Linux Fest Northwest for planning

27:50.120 --> 27:54.120
But I realized long term, as the weather gets nice in the Seattle area

27:54.120 --> 27:59.120
I'd like to maybe do semi-frequent meetups with Jupyter Broadcasting audience members

27:59.120 --> 28:01.120
Maybe like once a month

28:01.120 --> 28:03.120
Maybe we could even record them or stream them

28:03.120 --> 28:05.120
You know, eat chat, talk about show stuff

28:05.120 --> 28:09.120
And then of course if we travel and we have an event

28:09.120 --> 28:13.120
We would use this meetup group that I set up to organize events in your local area

28:13.120 --> 28:20.120
So I have linked and I will link it right now in the IRC as I'm talking too

28:20.120 --> 28:23.120
I've created an event for Linux Fest Northwest

28:23.120 --> 28:27.120
And I've created just a general Jupyter Broadcasting group on meetup.com

28:27.120 --> 28:29.120
I don't know if meetup.com is the best place

28:29.120 --> 28:31.120
But it seems to be pretty popular in the Seattle area

28:31.120 --> 28:34.120
There's lots of open source meetups already on there

28:34.120 --> 28:36.120
So I was hoping maybe we could capitalize on some of that too

28:36.120 --> 28:38.120
So I created an event for Linux Fest Northwest

28:38.120 --> 28:40.120
If you're going to be going

28:40.120 --> 28:43.120
Please go to meetup.com slash Jupyter Broadcasting

28:43.120 --> 28:45.120
And go to the Linux Fest Northwest event

28:45.120 --> 28:46.120
I'll have it linked in the show notes

28:46.120 --> 28:47.120
And RSVP

28:47.120 --> 28:51.120
So we just get an idea of how much food and swag items we need to bring

28:51.120 --> 28:53.120
It would be a rough idea

28:53.120 --> 28:55.120
I think it's got a lot of potential if you think about it

28:55.120 --> 28:57.120
Because there's a lot of local folks that would love to do that

28:57.120 --> 28:59.120
I think maybe then we could get a list of local folks

28:59.120 --> 29:02.120
And in the future we'll have the list

29:02.120 --> 29:04.120
And we can let them know we're going to do other meetups as well

29:04.120 --> 29:06.120
I don't know if meetup lets you

29:06.120 --> 29:08.120
But maybe we could just notify you when you're going to be in your area too

29:08.120 --> 29:11.120
Because I figure when we travel or we go to other fests

29:11.120 --> 29:14.120
We could use this as a way to sort of organize events in that area too

29:14.120 --> 29:18.120
So the site or the page is meetup.com slash Jupyter Broadcasting

29:18.120 --> 29:20.120
And the event is linked in the show notes

29:20.120 --> 29:22.120
So we start with Linux Fest Northwest

29:22.120 --> 29:24.120
Maybe give us an idea of how many you're going

29:24.120 --> 29:26.120
And then we'll use it for other stuff

29:26.120 --> 29:27.120
That would be neat

29:27.120 --> 29:30.120
Who needs a mumble and bye guys? I'm replacing you with people in real life

29:30.120 --> 29:31.120
Ha!

29:31.120 --> 29:33.120
No kidding right?

29:33.120 --> 29:34.120
I'm just kidding

29:34.120 --> 29:36.120
Actually Wimpy sounds so good this week you'd almost think he's in studio

29:36.120 --> 29:39.120
I know, it's a new mic or something?

29:39.120 --> 29:41.120
What did you do Wimpy? Tell Matt

29:41.120 --> 29:43.120
It's an old mic

29:43.120 --> 29:45.120
I got some old kit from the loft

29:45.120 --> 29:47.120
And a few USB adapters

29:47.120 --> 29:50.120
And had a bit of an experiment last night

29:50.120 --> 29:51.120
And you sound good

29:51.120 --> 29:52.120
Wow

29:52.120 --> 29:53.120
Doesn't he sound good?

29:53.120 --> 29:54.120
He sounds really good

29:54.120 --> 29:56.120
He sounds so good you'd think he's going to be here for Linux Fest Northwest

29:56.120 --> 29:58.120
But he's not

29:58.120 --> 30:00.120
I really wanted to try and go

30:00.120 --> 30:02.120
Really wanted to try and go

30:02.120 --> 30:03.120
I know, I know

30:03.120 --> 30:04.120
Maybe next year

30:04.120 --> 30:05.120
Maybe next year

30:05.120 --> 30:07.120
I think next year definitely

30:07.120 --> 30:09.120
Maybe even present

30:09.120 --> 30:10.120
Really?

30:10.120 --> 30:11.120
That'd be really cool

30:11.120 --> 30:12.120
Yeah you could go

30:12.120 --> 30:13.120
Totally Wimpy

30:13.120 --> 30:15.120
Oh my gosh don't tease

30:15.120 --> 30:17.120
I would like that a lot

30:17.120 --> 30:19.120
Alright so if you are going to make it

30:19.120 --> 30:21.120
Check out meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting

30:21.120 --> 30:23.120
And you'll find the Linux Fest Northwest event there

30:23.120 --> 30:25.120
Let us know if you're going

30:25.120 --> 30:28.120
And also if you'd like to maybe volunteer for Linux Fest Northwest

30:28.120 --> 30:29.120
They do have a contact page

30:29.120 --> 30:31.120
Linux Fest Northwest slash contact

30:31.120 --> 30:32.120
And you can give them your info

30:32.120 --> 30:34.120
Maybe you got something you can help them do

30:34.120 --> 30:35.120
That'd be kind of cool

30:35.120 --> 30:36.120
Just give them a mention

30:36.120 --> 30:37.120
Alright

30:37.120 --> 30:39.120
So I want to talk about this hardware device

30:39.120 --> 30:40.120
This

30:40.120 --> 30:41.120
It's made it on

30:41.120 --> 30:43.120
It's like one of the top stories in our subreddit this week

30:43.120 --> 30:45.120
It's called the Onion Omega

30:45.120 --> 30:48.120
And it looks like it's smaller than a USB thumb drive

30:48.120 --> 30:51.120
I'd say it's a little bit bigger than a quarter

30:51.120 --> 30:52.120
And it's kind of amazing

30:52.120 --> 30:54.120
It's a tiny but powerful Linux

30:54.120 --> 30:56.120
With Wi-Fi

30:56.120 --> 30:58.120
An app store

30:58.120 --> 31:00.120
You'd think those Chrome sticks look interesting

31:00.120 --> 31:01.120
They got nothing

31:01.120 --> 31:03.120
They got nothing on this thing

31:03.120 --> 31:05.120
So I want to show this to you guys

31:05.120 --> 31:06.120
And see if this could be a viable thing

31:06.120 --> 31:07.120
And if it is

31:07.120 --> 31:08.120
Maybe

31:08.120 --> 31:09.120
Well maybe we'll get one

31:09.120 --> 31:11.120
And maybe we'll review it on the show

31:11.120 --> 31:12.120
And put art on it

31:12.120 --> 31:13.120
I mean matte

31:13.120 --> 31:14.120
I mean

31:14.120 --> 31:15.120
No I'm just kidding

31:15.120 --> 31:17.120
But first I'm going to tell you about our friends over at Ting

31:17.120 --> 31:19.120
Go to linux.ting.com

31:19.120 --> 31:20.120
linux.ting.com

31:20.120 --> 31:22.120
That'll take $25 off your first device

31:22.120 --> 31:23.120
Or you know what

31:23.120 --> 31:24.120
You probably have a device that works with Ting

31:24.120 --> 31:26.120
Because they just take all these GSM devices now

31:26.120 --> 31:28.120
And they take a whole bunch of CDMA devices

31:28.120 --> 31:30.120
So if you got a device that already works with Ting

31:30.120 --> 31:32.120
They'll give you $25 service credit

31:32.120 --> 31:33.120
Wait you don't know what Ting is?

31:33.120 --> 31:35.120
Oh my gosh

31:35.120 --> 31:38.120
How did you not hear about the best thing to happen to mobile ever?

31:38.120 --> 31:39.120
I'm serious

31:39.120 --> 31:41.120
Ting is really here to shake up the mobile duopoly

31:41.120 --> 31:43.120
It's mobile that makes sense

31:43.120 --> 31:44.120
No contracts

31:44.120 --> 31:46.120
You only pay for what you use

31:46.120 --> 31:49.120
Flat $6 dollars for that line

31:49.120 --> 31:51.120
You want a new line on your Ting?

31:51.120 --> 31:52.120
Boom

31:52.120 --> 31:53.120
$6 dollars

31:53.120 --> 31:54.120
$6 dollars

31:54.120 --> 31:56.120
That is less than a sandwich these days

31:56.120 --> 31:57.120
For a cell phone line

31:57.120 --> 31:59.120
$6 dollars a month in your usage on top

31:59.120 --> 32:01.120
They have a kick ass dashboard

32:01.120 --> 32:03.120
That totally dominates all the other carriers dashboards

32:03.120 --> 32:05.120
It takes their dashboards

32:05.120 --> 32:07.120
And smashes them into the ground by the face

32:07.120 --> 32:09.120
It is such a great dashboard

32:09.120 --> 32:11.120
But then to like lap them

32:11.120 --> 32:13.120
They have no hold customer service

32:13.120 --> 32:15.120
You call that Ting at 1855 Ting FTW

32:15.120 --> 32:17.120
Any time between 8am or 8pm

32:17.120 --> 32:19.120
And a human answers the phone

32:19.120 --> 32:20.120
And that human is empowered to solve your problems

32:20.120 --> 32:21.120
You know why?

32:21.120 --> 32:23.120
Because they're like hey here's an idea

32:23.120 --> 32:26.120
Let's hire Android geeks to do our Android phone support

32:26.120 --> 32:30.120
Let's hire iOS fanboys to do our iOS support

32:30.120 --> 32:31.120
So you get the enthusiasts

32:31.120 --> 32:33.120
And then they said hey you know what

32:33.120 --> 32:35.120
Let's give them the ability to actually just solve the problem on their first call

32:35.120 --> 32:37.120
Solve the problem on their first call

32:37.120 --> 32:39.120
What a freaking concept

32:39.120 --> 32:41.120
What a freaking concept

32:41.120 --> 32:42.120
That's Ting

32:42.120 --> 32:43.120
And they just like

32:43.120 --> 32:45.120
That kind of just very straight forward logic applies to everything

32:45.120 --> 32:46.120
I'll give you another example

32:46.120 --> 32:47.120
You want hotspot and tethering?

32:47.120 --> 32:48.120
Turn it on

32:48.120 --> 32:49.120
Just check the box

32:49.120 --> 32:51.120
That's why Google built it into the OS

32:51.120 --> 32:53.120
And that's why Apple built it into the OS

32:53.120 --> 32:54.120
And probably Microsoft does it

32:54.120 --> 32:55.120
I don't know what Microsoft does

32:55.120 --> 32:56.120
Anyway that's why it's there

32:56.120 --> 32:57.120
You should just be able to turn it on

32:57.120 --> 32:58.120
It's a wireless ISP

32:58.120 --> 33:00.120
You want to treat Ting like a wireless ISP?

33:00.120 --> 33:01.120
Do it bro

33:01.120 --> 33:02.120
Go for it sister

33:02.120 --> 33:03.120
I don't care

33:03.120 --> 33:04.120
I'm not judging you

33:04.120 --> 33:05.120
Because you're only paying for what you use

33:05.120 --> 33:06.120
They take your minutes

33:06.120 --> 33:07.120
They take your megabytes

33:07.120 --> 33:08.120
And that's it

33:08.120 --> 33:09.120
Go to linux.ting.com to get started

33:09.120 --> 33:11.120
I'll tell you how crazy like a Fox Ting is too

33:11.120 --> 33:13.120
Look up over on their blog post right now

33:13.120 --> 33:15.120
Ting Tip for Android

33:15.120 --> 33:16.120
Make calls through Hangouts for free

33:16.120 --> 33:18.120
They talk about this app

33:18.120 --> 33:19.120
That's in the Play Store

33:19.120 --> 33:22.120
That just sets up your dialer to use the Hangouts app

33:22.120 --> 33:23.120
So when you just make calls

33:23.120 --> 33:25.120
And you dial phone numbers on your Android phone

33:25.120 --> 33:27.120
It just routes the call through Hangouts

33:27.120 --> 33:29.120
So all your calls are free

33:29.120 --> 33:32.120
Now that's going to cost Ting money

33:32.120 --> 33:34.120
They're going to make less money off you

33:34.120 --> 33:36.120
Because you are not going to use as many cellular minutes

33:36.120 --> 33:38.120
You're going to be making your calls over Wi-Fi

33:38.120 --> 33:40.120
That's crazy like a Fox

33:40.120 --> 33:41.120
That's Ting

33:41.120 --> 33:42.120
linux.ting.com

33:42.120 --> 33:43.120
Go check them out

33:43.120 --> 33:45.120
Been my mobile service provider for well over two years now

33:45.120 --> 33:46.120
linux.ting.com

33:46.120 --> 33:49.120
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program

33:49.120 --> 33:50.120
You crazy Foxes over there

33:50.120 --> 33:51.120
You keep it up

33:51.120 --> 33:52.120
You keep it up

33:52.120 --> 33:55.120
And I can't wait to get myself a brand new spanking Android phone soon

33:55.120 --> 33:57.120
And put it on the Ting GSM network

33:57.120 --> 34:01.120
linux.ting.com

34:01.120 --> 34:03.120
Alright so this is maybe the coolest thing ever

34:03.120 --> 34:07.120
We've shown many hardware devices on the Unplugged show

34:07.120 --> 34:09.120
In fact I want to show more

34:09.120 --> 34:12.120
But we've also shown many a Kickstarter

34:12.120 --> 34:13.120
Many a Kickstarter

34:13.120 --> 34:15.120
But you guys

34:15.120 --> 34:19.120
Not only is this one of the coolest Kickstarter devices we have ever seen on the show

34:19.120 --> 34:23.120
I think this is the best Kickstarter video I have ever seen

34:23.120 --> 34:25.120
At least for anything that runs Linux

34:25.120 --> 34:26.120
So here it is

34:26.120 --> 34:29.120
The tiny but powerful Linux Wi-Fi development board

34:29.120 --> 34:32.120
With 166 backers

34:32.120 --> 34:35.120
It's currently at $5,285

34:35.120 --> 34:37.120
At a $15,000 goal

34:37.120 --> 34:38.120
A nice modest goal

34:38.120 --> 34:39.120
$15,000

34:39.120 --> 34:40.120
That's modest

34:40.120 --> 34:41.120
34 days to go

34:41.120 --> 34:42.120
Here we go

34:42.120 --> 34:43.120
Check this thing out

34:43.120 --> 34:45.120
This is so, so freaking cool

34:45.120 --> 34:49.120
And I think I gotta give mad props for a great Kickstarter video as well

34:50.120 --> 34:52.120
There are two worlds

34:52.120 --> 34:54.120
The real world

34:54.120 --> 34:55.120
And the digital

34:56.120 --> 34:58.120
And then there's the cat world

34:58.120 --> 35:01.120
Oh the lovely cat world

35:02.120 --> 35:05.120
The problem with the two worlds is that

35:05.120 --> 35:09.120
In order to connect objects in the real world with the digital world

35:09.120 --> 35:12.120
You need to be a rocket scientist

35:12.120 --> 35:15.120
Or some sort of physicist from the Manhattan Project

35:15.120 --> 35:18.120
Or one of those brains in a jar

35:18.120 --> 35:20.120
But not anymore

35:20.120 --> 35:28.120
Meet Onion

35:28.120 --> 35:30.120
For the past year

35:30.120 --> 35:34.120
We've been hard at work building something that's small, affordable

35:34.120 --> 35:36.120
And really easy to use

35:36.120 --> 35:39.120
So that we can merge the two worlds together

35:39.120 --> 35:41.120
We wanted to be like Tony Stark

35:41.120 --> 35:44.120
And be able to build whatever comes to our mind

35:44.120 --> 35:47.120
Without learning how to build these things

35:47.120 --> 35:51.120
And that is exactly why we created this

35:51.120 --> 35:53.120
The Onion Omega

35:53.120 --> 35:55.120
Thanks Oliver

35:55.120 --> 35:58.120
It's a tiny computer with built-in Wi-Fi

35:58.120 --> 36:01.120
And it runs the Linux operating system

36:01.120 --> 36:04.120
This little bad boy lets you create connected devices

36:04.120 --> 36:06.120
In environments that you're already familiar with

36:06.120 --> 36:10.120
Using tools such as SSH, Git, and MPM

36:10.120 --> 36:15.120
And it also allows you to write software in Python, Node.js, PHP

36:15.120 --> 36:18.120
Or whatever language you feel comfortable with

36:18.120 --> 36:21.120
You now have the power to build anything you can imagine

36:21.120 --> 36:25.120
Such as smart home devices

36:25.120 --> 36:27.120
Security drones

36:27.120 --> 36:30.120
Security spiders

36:30.120 --> 36:31.120
What?

36:31.120 --> 36:35.120
I don't want that, I do not want that, I do not want that, I do not want that!

36:35.120 --> 36:41.120
Or even a cat feeder

36:41.120 --> 36:45.120
A cat feeder that realizes your cat is too fat

36:45.120 --> 36:46.120
With a laser?

36:46.120 --> 36:47.120
And then makes it exercise

36:47.120 --> 36:48.120
Laser pointer

36:48.120 --> 36:51.120
Or if you don't want to build from scratch

36:51.120 --> 36:54.120
You can browse the Onion app store for ready-made apps

36:54.120 --> 36:58.120
In fact, if you want to see what you can build on the Omega right now

36:58.120 --> 37:03.120
Click on the live demo below and start to experience the Omega in real time

37:06.120 --> 37:08.120
I want the cat stuff, that's cool

37:08.120 --> 37:11.120
Yeah, okay, so this is the Omega Onion

37:11.120 --> 37:13.120
And I'm telling you, it's the future

37:13.120 --> 37:15.120
You're going to have one of these in your backpack

37:15.120 --> 37:18.120
You're going to have one of these in your, I don't know, your milk jug

37:18.120 --> 37:20.120
This thing is nuts, it's tiny

37:20.120 --> 37:24.120
It is one fourth the size of a Raspberry Pi

37:24.120 --> 37:25.120
Wow, it's ridiculous

37:25.120 --> 37:26.120
It's got a full Linux environment

37:26.120 --> 37:29.120
Full Linux environment, they say, with a powerful processor

37:29.120 --> 37:33.120
Capable of running the full Linux operating system

37:33.120 --> 37:35.120
That is just

37:35.120 --> 37:37.120
I mean, it's just the stuff you can do with it

37:37.120 --> 37:40.120
And the ready-made apps, that's going to make this work

37:40.120 --> 37:41.120
That's what's going to make this work for people

37:41.120 --> 37:42.120
Yeah, the app store is

37:42.120 --> 37:43.120
Because someone like me that's lazy

37:43.120 --> 37:45.120
It's just like, I just want the cool stuff, you know

37:45.120 --> 37:47.120
Right, yeah, that is actually a pretty good point

37:47.120 --> 37:51.120
And it comes with a pretty nice little UI out of the box where you can load stuff

37:51.120 --> 37:54.120
To me, this looks like a

37:54.120 --> 37:57.120
Finally a version of this kind of

37:57.120 --> 38:00.120
Tech that might be more approachable to somebody like me

38:00.120 --> 38:02.120
Whereas I think the Raspberry Pi and the Arduino boards

38:02.120 --> 38:04.120
And the BeagleBone Black are super cool

38:04.120 --> 38:09.120
But I just, I am not inventive enough to see them and come up with something

38:09.120 --> 38:11.120
Right, but this

38:11.120 --> 38:13.120
But this

38:13.120 --> 38:15.120
This looks a little more approachable to me

38:15.120 --> 38:16.120
I don't know, a number of them

38:16.120 --> 38:18.120
Any thoughts, would you guys back something like this?

38:18.120 --> 38:19.120
The prices, here, I'll give you the prices

38:19.120 --> 38:21.120
And you guys tell me what you think, okay?

38:21.120 --> 38:22.120
So here's your backing prices

38:22.120 --> 38:25.120
If you just want to get in sort of cheapo style, you know

38:25.120 --> 38:26.120
Like low rent

38:26.120 --> 38:27.120
You could just

38:27.120 --> 38:29.120
You could get

38:29.120 --> 38:30.120
Oh, they're all gone

38:30.120 --> 38:31.120
They did start at $19

38:31.120 --> 38:32.120
They're all gone now

38:32.120 --> 38:34.120
For $25, you get an Omega and a dock

38:34.120 --> 38:36.120
$35, you get an Omega and a dock

38:36.120 --> 38:38.120
And a dock or expansion

38:38.120 --> 38:41.120
But you really start cooking when you get up to 99 bucks

38:41.120 --> 38:43.120
99 bucks, you get a camera kit

38:43.120 --> 38:46.120
Which is, you get an Omega and a dock

38:46.120 --> 38:47.120
A camera kit

38:47.120 --> 38:48.120
A tilt mount

38:48.120 --> 38:49.120
A servo

38:49.120 --> 38:50.120
An Omega servo

38:50.120 --> 38:51.120
And accessory instructions

38:51.120 --> 38:52.120
And wiring

38:52.120 --> 38:53.120
And then it just keeps going up

38:53.120 --> 38:55.120
Like $109, you get the printer kit

38:55.120 --> 38:57.120
$119, you get all that stuff

38:57.120 --> 38:58.120
And a starter kit

38:58.120 --> 39:00.120
And essential items to build something else

39:00.120 --> 39:02.120
You know, like everything, you get more and more stuff

39:02.120 --> 39:04.120
So it's a pretty straightforward pricing structure

39:04.120 --> 39:06.120
Starting as, you know

39:06.120 --> 39:08.120
You can go as low as $35

39:08.120 --> 39:12.120
Or really $25 for a little bit longer

39:12.120 --> 39:14.120
There's only 21 spots left, I think

39:14.120 --> 39:15.120
But, you know

39:15.120 --> 39:16.120
I don't know

39:16.120 --> 39:17.120
My thoughts

39:17.120 --> 39:19.120
Seems like a pretty reasonable price for a pretty interesting device

39:19.120 --> 39:20.120
Yes? No?

39:20.120 --> 39:22.120
I'm not really happy with the software

39:22.120 --> 39:23.120
Well, I think it is

39:23.120 --> 39:25.120
What was that? I'm sorry

39:25.120 --> 39:26.120
What about the software?

39:26.120 --> 39:30.120
They've kind of made their own Onion Cloud

39:30.120 --> 39:31.120
Yes

39:31.120 --> 39:32.120
Own lab

39:32.120 --> 39:33.120
Yes

39:33.120 --> 39:34.120
Own everything

39:34.120 --> 39:35.120
Yes

39:35.120 --> 39:37.120
I'm not sure how future proof it is

39:37.120 --> 39:39.120
If they're only a small company

39:39.120 --> 39:41.120
It's actually a pretty fair critique, actually

39:41.120 --> 39:43.120
I have two reasons

39:43.120 --> 39:44.120
Okay

39:44.120 --> 39:46.120
Two things

39:46.120 --> 39:47.120
One

39:47.120 --> 39:52.120
Called the Onion Omega

39:52.120 --> 39:53.120
Yes

39:53.120 --> 39:55.120
Which, I mean, it gets points right there

39:55.120 --> 39:57.120
And then two

39:57.120 --> 39:59.120
The guy almost sounded like Morgan Freeman

39:59.120 --> 40:01.120
Yeah, yeah, that's great, right?

40:01.120 --> 40:03.120
Strategic viewpoints

40:03.120 --> 40:05.120
So just based on those two things

40:05.120 --> 40:07.120
I guess you almost have to

40:07.120 --> 40:08.120
See, okay, that was what I was thinking

40:08.120 --> 40:10.120
Is the Morgan Freeman really did it for me

40:10.120 --> 40:13.120
I thought, I like this idea too because

40:13.120 --> 40:15.120
You know, last week we talked about

40:15.120 --> 40:17.120
Oh, I should follow up on that too

40:17.120 --> 40:19.120
Last week we talked about a computer for my kid

40:19.120 --> 40:23.120
And I think it was Wimpy that recommended

40:23.120 --> 40:25.120
You know, get him a computer

40:25.120 --> 40:27.120
But maybe also get him a Raspberry Pi

40:27.120 --> 40:29.120
I think that was you, right, Wimpy?

40:29.120 --> 40:30.120
What do you think about this

40:30.120 --> 40:32.120
As opposed to the Raspberry Pi for kids?

40:32.120 --> 40:34.120
Well, this is, I think, the step on

40:34.120 --> 40:36.120
From the Raspberry Pi, isn't it?

40:36.120 --> 40:39.120
This is the next level of

40:39.120 --> 40:43.120
DIY computing and experimentation

40:43.120 --> 40:45.120
So yeah, definitely something

40:45.120 --> 40:48.120
When you've surpassed the initial novelty

40:48.120 --> 40:49.120
Of the Raspberry Pi

40:49.120 --> 40:52.120
And using it a bit more like a traditional computer

40:52.120 --> 40:54.120
And you want to get into robotics

40:54.120 --> 40:56.120
And actually embed a device in something

40:56.120 --> 40:59.120
Or, you know, motorize small things

40:59.120 --> 41:02.120
Then this looks like a neat solution for that

41:02.120 --> 41:05.120
And not too expensive

41:05.120 --> 41:07.120
Lots of language support as well

41:07.120 --> 41:08.120
And I see Python in there

41:08.120 --> 41:10.120
Which of course you're soon going to be an expert in

41:10.120 --> 41:11.120
So that'll be good

41:11.120 --> 41:12.120
Oh, I see, although now they're trying to

41:12.120 --> 41:14.120
Get me back onto Ruby again

41:14.120 --> 41:17.120
Don't do that, don't do that to yourself

41:17.120 --> 41:20.120
You know, so a follow up

41:20.120 --> 41:22.120
I wanted to get a computer for my son

41:22.120 --> 41:25.120
And I had an exchange

41:25.120 --> 41:28.120
With our friends at System76

41:28.120 --> 41:31.120
Now I won't say who

41:31.120 --> 41:35.120
But I got like an Apple-style rumor for you

41:35.120 --> 41:37.120
You ready for this?

41:37.120 --> 41:38.120
Rumor has it

41:38.120 --> 41:39.120
Now I cannot confirm or deny this

41:39.120 --> 41:40.120
But rumor has it

41:40.120 --> 41:42.120
On Thursday of this week

41:42.120 --> 41:44.120
So let's see, what day is that going to be?

41:44.120 --> 41:46.120
So this is Tuesday the 31st

41:46.120 --> 41:47.120
So on April

41:47.120 --> 41:48.120
Oh yeah, it's probably a good idea

41:48.120 --> 41:49.120
They don't do it on April

41:49.120 --> 41:52.120
Yeah, so on April 2nd

41:52.120 --> 41:55.120
A new System76 laptop is going to be announced

41:55.120 --> 41:56.120
That's the rumor

41:56.120 --> 41:57.120
That's the rumor

41:57.120 --> 41:59.120
And so it might be the perfect machine for my son

41:59.120 --> 42:01.120
And I might have first dibs on it

42:01.120 --> 42:03.120
These all might be things that are true

42:03.120 --> 42:04.120
They may or may not

42:04.120 --> 42:05.120
So we'll see

42:05.120 --> 42:07.120
And then if they do have a new laptop

42:07.120 --> 42:09.120
That releases this Thursday

42:09.120 --> 42:11.120
Then we'll probably have one of the first reviews

42:11.120 --> 42:13.120
Because I think I'm going to have one of the first units

42:13.120 --> 42:14.120
On the Linux action show

42:14.120 --> 42:15.120
So that was

42:15.120 --> 42:16.120
Oh, that's awesome

42:16.120 --> 42:17.120
I decided to go with a laptop

42:17.120 --> 42:18.120
So that way he could come to the studio

42:18.120 --> 42:19.120
And you know

42:19.120 --> 42:21.120
I'll probably make him use this machine for like 5, 6 years

42:21.120 --> 42:23.120
Or he'll use it for a couple of years

42:23.120 --> 42:25.120
And then his sisters will use it for a couple of years

42:25.120 --> 42:26.120
As they get a little bit older

42:26.120 --> 42:27.120
So yeah

42:27.120 --> 42:30.120
Hopefully that will work out pretty good for him

42:30.120 --> 42:31.120
I think he'll like it quite a bit

42:31.120 --> 42:34.120
And I think it's going to be the perfect machine for him too

42:34.120 --> 42:35.120
So yeah

42:35.120 --> 42:36.120
I really call

42:36.120 --> 42:37.120
I'm really nice to him

42:37.120 --> 42:38.120
I was really nice to him

42:38.120 --> 42:39.120
So what do you think?

42:39.120 --> 42:40.120
Should we back this Onion Omega?

42:40.120 --> 42:41.120
What do you guys

42:41.120 --> 42:42.120
I could go in

42:42.120 --> 42:44.120
I could go in for 25 bucks

42:44.120 --> 42:46.120
Is it worth backing to see if we could get one for the show?

42:46.120 --> 42:47.120
I think so

42:47.120 --> 42:49.120
I mean I think just based on the fact that it said

42:49.120 --> 42:51.120
Hey Chris, would you like to be your own Tony Stark?

42:51.120 --> 42:52.120
I think they kind of win there

42:52.120 --> 42:53.120
So I would say yeah

42:53.120 --> 42:54.120
I would like to be my own Tony Stark man

42:54.120 --> 42:55.120
That is

42:55.120 --> 42:56.120
Yeah

42:56.120 --> 42:57.120
Yeah

42:57.120 --> 42:58.120
All right

42:58.120 --> 42:59.120
Do it

42:59.120 --> 43:00.120
Chatroom says do it

43:00.120 --> 43:01.120
Mumble room

43:01.120 --> 43:02.120
Anybody want to say don't do it?

43:02.120 --> 43:03.120
Anybody want to vote for not backing this project?

43:03.120 --> 43:05.120
Speak now or forever hold your peace

43:05.120 --> 43:06.120
I'm going to do it

43:06.120 --> 43:07.120
There you go

43:07.120 --> 43:08.120
Wow

43:08.120 --> 43:09.120
Okay

43:09.120 --> 43:10.120
There we go

43:10.120 --> 43:11.120
I'm going to back

43:11.120 --> 43:12.120
I'm backing it right now

43:12.120 --> 43:13.120
I'll back it $25

43:13.120 --> 43:14.120
And because I feel like $25 is totally worth it

43:14.120 --> 43:15.120
If we can have it here on the show

43:15.120 --> 43:16.120
So

43:16.120 --> 43:22.120
And I've just bought a device that you can use to exploit your new found Python skills

43:22.120 --> 43:23.120
You're really pushing me in that direction

43:23.120 --> 43:24.120
There you go

43:24.120 --> 43:27.120
I feel slight amount of pressure to go in a certain direction

43:27.120 --> 43:29.120
You'll learn something Chris

43:29.120 --> 43:31.120
We'll back you in a way or what

43:31.120 --> 43:32.120
Oh man all right

43:32.120 --> 43:33.120
So there we go

43:33.120 --> 43:34.120
I just backed it

43:34.120 --> 43:36.120
And I felt good

43:36.120 --> 43:37.120
I feel like that was a good choice

43:37.120 --> 43:39.120
Like at first I wasn't sure if that was a good choice

43:39.120 --> 43:41.120
But then I remembered that I wanted to be Tony Stark

43:41.120 --> 43:42.120
And then I felt like a good choice

43:42.120 --> 43:45.120
And I also want Morgan Freeman to narrate my decisions

43:45.120 --> 43:47.120
And all decisions I make

43:47.120 --> 43:49.120
So that sort of sealed the deal for me

43:49.120 --> 43:51.120
And if you'd like to as well

43:51.120 --> 43:54.120
I mean they only have a couple slots left at the $25

43:54.120 --> 43:55.120
And then it starts getting expensive

43:55.120 --> 43:58.120
But there we go woo-hoo

43:58.120 --> 44:01.120
I mean at the $35 level

44:01.120 --> 44:04.120
That's a pretty good deal

44:04.120 --> 44:07.120
Because you get basically the same components

44:07.120 --> 44:08.120
Now you tell me

44:08.120 --> 44:09.120
As the

44:09.120 --> 44:12.120
You can opt to get the network card

44:12.120 --> 44:16.120
And then you get the same components as the Raspberry Pi basically

44:16.120 --> 44:17.120
Now you tell me

44:17.120 --> 44:19.120
After I just backed the $25 one

44:19.120 --> 44:21.120
Dude way too late on the commentary

44:21.120 --> 44:22.120
Way too late

44:22.120 --> 44:23.120
No kidding right

44:23.120 --> 44:24.120
I should have mentioned it earlier

44:24.120 --> 44:25.120
I was going to mention it earlier

44:25.120 --> 44:26.120
But then I was like eh

44:26.120 --> 44:28.120
No you got to mention that

44:28.120 --> 44:29.120
I pulled the trigger

44:29.120 --> 44:30.120
Should I cancel it

44:30.120 --> 44:31.120
Can you cancel a Kickstarter

44:31.120 --> 44:32.120
Is that like a

44:32.120 --> 44:33.120
What's that called when you back something

44:33.120 --> 44:35.120
And then you pull out

44:35.120 --> 44:36.120
What's that called

44:36.120 --> 44:37.120
Are you talking about on Kickstarter

44:37.120 --> 44:38.120
In real life

44:38.120 --> 44:39.120
Oh on Kickstarter

44:39.120 --> 44:41.120
You're not completely pulling out

44:41.120 --> 44:42.120
You're just pulling out

44:42.120 --> 44:44.120
And giving them more money instead

44:44.120 --> 44:46.120
Yeah I should leave a note like

44:46.120 --> 44:47.120
You can just give them more

44:47.120 --> 44:48.120
And they'll upgrade

44:48.120 --> 44:49.120
The former is called birth control

44:49.120 --> 44:51.120
Yeah I should just send them a note like

44:51.120 --> 44:52.120
This is not

44:52.120 --> 44:54.120
I'm not judging you with this cancellation

44:54.120 --> 44:55.120
I love you

44:55.120 --> 44:56.120
Really I'm just giving you more money

44:56.120 --> 44:57.120
I'm sorry

44:57.120 --> 44:58.120
No I think it's fine

44:58.120 --> 44:59.120
$25 is fine

44:59.120 --> 45:00.120
I think you can do it

45:00.120 --> 45:01.120
That's fine

45:01.120 --> 45:02.120
No 25 is

45:02.120 --> 45:03.120
I don't

45:03.120 --> 45:04.120
Well that's

45:04.120 --> 45:05.120
It's not too committal

45:05.120 --> 45:06.120
You get in there early

45:06.120 --> 45:07.120
If they grow cool

45:07.120 --> 45:08.120
You can always add to it right

45:08.120 --> 45:09.120
Yeah I suppose

45:09.120 --> 45:10.120
I suppose

45:10.120 --> 45:11.120
Yeah

45:11.120 --> 45:12.120
I mean it's just

45:12.120 --> 45:13.120
Tell yourself that

45:13.120 --> 45:14.120
Yeah

45:14.120 --> 45:15.120
Yeah

45:15.120 --> 45:20.120
Yeah I just wanted something for the show

45:20.120 --> 45:21.120
Okay alright well

45:21.120 --> 45:22.120
Ah jeez

45:22.120 --> 45:23.120
If you want

45:23.120 --> 45:24.120
If you want it

45:24.120 --> 45:25.120
Oh you know what we need

45:25.120 --> 45:26.120
That's why he has three kids

45:26.120 --> 45:27.120
Wow

45:27.120 --> 45:28.120
Wow

45:28.120 --> 45:29.120
You can change your pledge

45:29.120 --> 45:30.120
Okay

45:30.120 --> 45:31.120
Alright so maybe I'll do that

45:31.120 --> 45:32.120
I don't know

45:32.120 --> 45:33.120
We'll save that for the post show

45:33.120 --> 45:34.120
If I remember

45:34.120 --> 45:35.120
Yeah there you go

45:35.120 --> 45:36.120
That's probably a good point

45:36.120 --> 45:37.120
Okay so we might have a little ass kicking

45:37.120 --> 45:39.120
That we need to be handed to us

45:39.120 --> 45:42.120
And we got a couple of good notes that came into the show

45:42.120 --> 45:43.120
Okay

45:43.120 --> 45:48.120
And Ryan did our friend from Evolvo S show up?

45:48.120 --> 45:49.120
Easier

45:49.120 --> 45:51.120
Okay who's that?

45:51.120 --> 45:52.120
Ikey

45:52.120 --> 45:53.120
Hi Ikey

45:53.120 --> 45:54.120
Hi Ikey

45:54.120 --> 45:55.120
Hi Ikey welcome to the show

45:55.120 --> 45:56.120
Oh thanks

45:56.120 --> 45:57.120
And you're with Evolvo S?

45:57.120 --> 45:59.120
That's one way of putting it yeah

45:59.120 --> 46:01.120
Okay well you are Evolvo S?

46:01.120 --> 46:03.120
Yeah for the most part yeah

46:03.120 --> 46:06.120
Yeah okay alright well good I'm really glad you're here because

46:06.120 --> 46:11.120
You could give us a great perspective on this I think discussion we're about to have

46:11.120 --> 46:16.120
And really which sort of translates into how much attention do we give distributions

46:16.120 --> 46:19.120
That maybe don't have a larger user base as some of the other ones

46:19.120 --> 46:21.120
Which obviously translates into audience interest

46:21.120 --> 46:23.120
So it's kind of a tricky topic for us

46:23.120 --> 46:27.120
But because you know part of the goal of our show is to give exposure to things

46:27.120 --> 46:29.120
That deserve more exposure that aren't currently getting it

46:29.120 --> 46:32.120
It's something I feel it's worth reevaluating pretty frequently

46:32.120 --> 46:34.120
I don't want to make it obnoxious

46:34.120 --> 46:37.120
But because you the listener have a bit of a stake in this

46:37.120 --> 46:41.120
I think it's probably good we just have this discussion with our lug on the record

46:41.120 --> 46:44.120
So you know where if there's a bias where it lies which there isn't one

46:44.120 --> 46:48.120
But you at least know the logic and the process that goes into selecting what we coverage

46:48.120 --> 46:50.120
What we cover and what dictates that coverage

46:50.120 --> 46:53.120
So before we do that I'll thank our third sponsor this week

46:53.120 --> 46:55.120
And that's DigitalOcean

46:55.120 --> 46:57.120
Now this is the secret right here

46:57.120 --> 46:59.120
You want to make yourself look like a boss

46:59.120 --> 47:00.120
You want to offer out client services

47:00.120 --> 47:02.120
You want to have a great back end infrastructure

47:02.120 --> 47:04.120
You want to make sure your website runs super fast

47:04.120 --> 47:05.120
You want to make sure your project looks smart

47:05.120 --> 47:06.120
You want to have your own domain

47:06.120 --> 47:08.120
You want to get your data off some cloud service

47:08.120 --> 47:10.120
You want to do it right it's DigitalOcean

47:10.120 --> 47:12.120
I'll tell you why DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider

47:12.120 --> 47:15.120
Dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you

47:15.120 --> 47:16.120
To spin up your own cloud server

47:16.120 --> 47:18.120
You're going to have root access with an HTML5 console

47:18.120 --> 47:19.120
And through a great interface I'll tell you about

47:19.120 --> 47:21.120
And all of it you can get started right now

47:21.120 --> 47:24.120
In super super no time like super flat no time

47:24.120 --> 47:26.120
It's crazy and you can try it out two months for absolutely free

47:26.120 --> 47:28.120
We use our promo code

47:28.120 --> 47:30.120
We got a special promo code for the unplug show

47:30.120 --> 47:32.120
It's D.O. Unplugged

47:32.120 --> 47:33.120
D.O. Unplugged all lower case one word

47:33.120 --> 47:36.120
Gets you a $10 credit over DigitalOcean

47:36.120 --> 47:37.120
Find out about DigitalOcean

47:37.120 --> 47:39.120
Just go try it with that promo code

47:39.120 --> 47:40.120
Because there's no cost up front

47:40.120 --> 47:41.120
You're not going to need a credit card

47:41.120 --> 47:43.120
And you can get started in less than 55 seconds

47:43.120 --> 47:45.120
You'll have a server for less than $5 a month

47:45.120 --> 47:46.120
Or about $5 a month

47:46.120 --> 47:49.120
I actually have three servers and I like it a lot

47:49.120 --> 47:51.120
Because I just apply a balance to my account

47:51.120 --> 47:52.120
And this is I think a really great system

47:52.120 --> 47:55.120
Because I have a few PayPal accounts

47:55.120 --> 47:57.120
And one I use for Steam purchases

47:57.120 --> 47:59.120
And that PayPal account that I use for Steam purchases

47:59.120 --> 48:02.120
I just also sometimes have a couple extra bucks

48:02.120 --> 48:03.120
After I buy the Steam games

48:03.120 --> 48:04.120
And I'll just send them over to my DigitalOcean account

48:04.120 --> 48:06.120
But you can use our promo code D.O. Unplugged

48:06.120 --> 48:07.120
And you get a $10 credit

48:07.120 --> 48:09.120
And you can try out the $5 rig for free

48:09.120 --> 48:10.120
Here's what you're going to get for $5

48:10.120 --> 48:12.120
512 megabytes of RAM

48:12.120 --> 48:13.120
A 20 gigabyte SSD

48:13.120 --> 48:14.120
One CPU

48:14.120 --> 48:16.120
And a terabyte of transfer

48:16.120 --> 48:17.120
A terabyte

48:17.120 --> 48:19.120
They're all SSDs too

48:19.120 --> 48:20.120
They did that early on

48:20.120 --> 48:21.120
And I think that's a really smart move

48:21.120 --> 48:22.120
And made them really competitive

48:22.120 --> 48:24.120
And they've got data center locations in New York

48:24.120 --> 48:26.120
San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and London

48:26.120 --> 48:28.120
But their interface is really great

48:28.120 --> 48:30.120
The DigitalOcean control panel is like their secret sauce

48:30.120 --> 48:32.120
It sits on top of their great connectivity

48:32.120 --> 48:34.120
Their excellent data centers

48:34.120 --> 48:35.120
They're all SSD I.O.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.120
Of course, Linux

48:36.120 --> 48:37.120
The KVM virtualizer

48:37.120 --> 48:39.120
Which as you know is the best out there

48:39.120 --> 48:40.120
Come on, what's up

48:40.120 --> 48:41.120
Come on, you know that

48:41.120 --> 48:43.120
All of that rides on top

48:43.120 --> 48:45.120
All of that is just controlled by this

48:45.120 --> 48:47.120
This interface is just amazing

48:47.120 --> 48:49.120
It's the best out there

48:49.120 --> 48:50.120
It's very intuitive

48:50.120 --> 48:52.120
And you can replicate its functionality on a larger scale

48:52.120 --> 48:53.120
With DigitalOcean's very straightforward API

48:53.120 --> 48:55.120
Which a lot of the community is already doing

48:55.120 --> 48:57.120
You can take advantage of the stuff that's already out there

48:57.120 --> 48:58.120
You can do DNS management

48:58.120 --> 49:00.120
You can take care of your snapshots

49:00.120 --> 49:01.120
Back things up

49:01.120 --> 49:02.120
Destroy them

49:02.120 --> 49:04.120
Use the template to get started even faster

49:04.120 --> 49:06.120
Use one-click deployments to get Ruby on Rails going

For sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program

49:29.120 --> 49:31.120
It's a really good service

49:31.120 --> 49:34.120
Okay, so let's talk about our coverage

49:34.120 --> 49:37.120
So we've kind of got Gabriel 3 in the subreddit

49:37.120 --> 49:38.120
Kicks it off

49:38.120 --> 49:40.120
He says, hi there, Chris, Matt, Noah, JB Producers

49:40.120 --> 49:41.120
Mumble Room

49:41.120 --> 49:42.120
Fellow community members

49:42.120 --> 49:44.120
On the latest Linux Unplugged episode

49:44.120 --> 49:46.120
Chris announced a roundtable on distro coverage criteria

49:46.120 --> 49:48.120
In my opinion, it's worth to express our thoughts

49:48.120 --> 49:50.120
On this as a community too

49:50.120 --> 49:52.120
He wanted to kind of work through this

49:52.120 --> 49:53.120
You know, you have mainstream distros

49:53.120 --> 49:55.120
You have new distros

49:55.120 --> 49:58.120
Third derivative distros that are beginner friendly

49:58.120 --> 50:01.120
Fifth is, you know, he says you also have

50:01.120 --> 50:04.120
Fifth, despite Chris and JB's good will

50:04.120 --> 50:05.120
Some interesting distros will not be covered

50:05.120 --> 50:07.120
Because there are hundreds of distros

50:07.120 --> 50:08.120
It's quite impossible

50:08.120 --> 50:09.120
That's very true

50:09.120 --> 50:12.120
So he started off a pretty good conversation

50:12.120 --> 50:14.120
And folks, you know, sort of kicked in

50:14.120 --> 50:16.120
Like some people want to see more coverage on NixOS

50:16.120 --> 50:19.120
And I wasn't so sure I wanted to get into the specific distros

50:19.120 --> 50:20.120
We should be covering

50:20.120 --> 50:21.120
Although we can talk about specific distros

50:21.120 --> 50:25.120
But I wanted to talk a little bit about

50:25.120 --> 50:27.120
Sort of the selection criteria

50:27.120 --> 50:29.120
And then maybe Aiki can chime in with what he thinks about it

50:29.120 --> 50:32.120
From somebody who's maybe tried to get more attention

50:32.120 --> 50:33.120
From a media outlet

50:33.120 --> 50:36.120
So our selection usually is based on what we perceive

50:36.120 --> 50:39.120
To probably generate the most interest in the audience

50:39.120 --> 50:43.120
And also has to be something we have experience with

50:43.120 --> 50:45.120
Or use ourselves to some degree to be able to review it

50:45.120 --> 50:46.120
And that depends

50:46.120 --> 50:47.120
Like so, you know, we'll try out an op

50:47.120 --> 50:49.120
We'll try out a distro for a couple of weeks

50:49.120 --> 50:51.120
That we don't actually run just to do a review

50:51.120 --> 50:52.120
But things that are more in our wheelhouse

50:52.120 --> 50:54.120
Are going to be stuff that's closer to our daily run

50:54.120 --> 50:56.120
So that's sort of

50:56.120 --> 50:58.120
If there is a bias, that would be it

50:58.120 --> 50:59.120
And then what we select

50:59.120 --> 51:02.120
The only real selection criteria is if it interests us

51:02.120 --> 51:04.120
And we think it might interest the audience

51:04.120 --> 51:05.120
So sometimes we will feature something

51:05.120 --> 51:06.120
That maybe the audience has never heard of

51:06.120 --> 51:09.120
But we think, ah, based on what we think they're going to like

51:09.120 --> 51:10.120
Once they find out about this

51:10.120 --> 51:11.120
It'll pique their interest

51:11.120 --> 51:12.120
And so we'll run it

51:12.120 --> 51:16.120
But that does mean that certain things kind of get left out

51:16.120 --> 51:18.120
More often than not

51:18.120 --> 51:23.120
Distributions that maybe you could label as less relevant

51:23.120 --> 51:25.120
But I don't really feel like that's fair

51:25.120 --> 51:27.120
Because even a really small distribution

51:27.120 --> 51:29.120
Can have something very innovative going on

51:29.120 --> 51:34.120
But it's maybe distributions that have a much lower user base

51:34.120 --> 51:36.120
I don't know exactly how to say this

51:36.120 --> 51:38.120
That sounds about right to me

51:38.120 --> 51:39.120
Yeah, you know what I'm trying to go here, right?

51:39.120 --> 51:40.120
Yeah, yeah

51:40.120 --> 51:41.120
Yeah

51:41.120 --> 51:42.120
Something that makes

51:42.120 --> 51:45.120
Ryan, you have an idea of what makes something coverable?

51:45.120 --> 51:49.120
Yeah, there are derivative distributions out there

51:49.120 --> 51:53.120
And a lot of distributions that build just ever so slightly

51:53.120 --> 51:57.120
On, you know, an innovation from its parent distro

51:57.120 --> 51:58.120
Which is fine

51:58.120 --> 52:02.120
But to me that doesn't make it necessarily worth covering

52:02.120 --> 52:04.120
I think you're right when you say

52:04.120 --> 52:06.120
You really want to cover a distro

52:06.120 --> 52:09.120
When it's doing something innovative and new

52:09.120 --> 52:12.120
And something that might actually be a game changer

52:12.120 --> 52:16.120
One reason I contribute to and enjoy Volvo S

52:16.120 --> 52:18.120
Is because they

52:18.120 --> 52:21.120
Aiki did a really great job of pulling out a lot of stuff

52:21.120 --> 52:23.120
And he built it on top of

52:23.120 --> 52:26.120
It's not a derivative of another distro necessarily

52:26.120 --> 52:29.120
Or at least not any living distros

52:29.120 --> 52:34.120
And really just rethought the whole desktop environment

52:34.120 --> 52:35.120
From the ground up

52:35.120 --> 52:36.120
Yeah, that's exciting

52:36.120 --> 52:38.120
And so when you look

52:38.120 --> 52:41.120
What I would like to hear as a five-year listener

52:41.120 --> 52:44.120
Of Jupiter Broadcasting is

52:44.120 --> 52:47.120
Is about distros that are doing something new and exciting

52:47.120 --> 52:51.120
Not necessarily every distro that pops up as a derivative

52:51.120 --> 52:54.120
I don't want to hear about the Ubuntu derivative

52:54.120 --> 52:56.120
Sorry, Opi and Wimpy

52:56.120 --> 52:58.120
Well, wait a minute

52:58.120 --> 53:00.120
Sometimes they're really good

53:00.120 --> 53:02.120
Well, if they are, then that's great

53:02.120 --> 53:04.120
I think Ubuntu Mate is worth hearing about

53:04.120 --> 53:07.120
Because, I mean, where are you going to go to try out Mate?

53:07.120 --> 53:09.120
You know, if you're not on Arch

53:09.120 --> 53:11.120
Or some place where you're just going to

53:11.120 --> 53:13.120
Throw it on your machine and go

53:13.120 --> 53:15.120
Everywhere, it's in every distribution

53:15.120 --> 53:18.120
But not done right, it's not done right, is it?

53:18.120 --> 53:21.120
Well, no, some distributions do it better than others

53:21.120 --> 53:22.120
But, you know

53:22.120 --> 53:24.120
Okay, so Aiki, coming from the

53:24.120 --> 53:26.120
You know, the Evolvo S perspective

53:26.120 --> 53:29.120
You probably don't hear Evolvo S mentioned as often as you'd like

53:29.120 --> 53:32.120
What are your thoughts on that sort of spot you get stuck in

53:32.120 --> 53:34.120
When you're a distribution of that size?

53:34.120 --> 53:36.120
Lovers

53:36.120 --> 53:39.120
Basically

53:39.120 --> 53:41.120
We wouldn't get a lot of attention

53:41.120 --> 53:43.120
So, what people are interested in now is

53:43.120 --> 53:45.120
Ooh, shiny

53:45.120 --> 53:47.120
So, I mean, I'm not going to point out

53:47.120 --> 53:49.120
Any specific distros at the moment

53:49.120 --> 53:51.120
Because, like, people listen to this

53:51.120 --> 53:53.120
And I'd get in trouble

53:53.120 --> 53:55.120
But people are really, really interested in the whole

53:55.120 --> 53:57.120
Design-led philosophy at the moment

53:57.120 --> 53:59.120
So, something's really, really pretty

53:59.120 --> 54:01.120
They take something else and basically whack a new skin on it

54:01.120 --> 54:03.120
And that's what people seem to be interested in

54:03.120 --> 54:05.120
So, for us

54:05.120 --> 54:07.120
I guess you could say in that way that we suffer

54:07.120 --> 54:09.120
Because, you know, I mean

54:09.120 --> 54:11.120
We've got the budget desktop and, you know, it's kind of sexy

54:11.120 --> 54:15.120
But people want all the shiny Google things

54:15.120 --> 54:17.120
Which we're not really doing

54:17.120 --> 54:19.120
We're more interested in making something that works

54:19.120 --> 54:21.120
So, yeah, we do have to work a bit harder

54:21.120 --> 54:23.120
But, unlike some of the other projects

54:23.120 --> 54:25.120
We're not actually

54:25.120 --> 54:27.120
Financially dependent on success

54:27.120 --> 54:30.120
Which kind of makes things a lot easier for us

54:30.120 --> 54:33.120
Like, we're not whacking a new wallpaper on and saying

54:33.120 --> 54:35.120
Can we have a donation?

54:35.120 --> 54:37.120
Because, you know, we look good

54:37.120 --> 54:39.120
So, it's easier for us in that respect

54:39.120 --> 54:41.120
And the thing that

54:41.120 --> 54:43.120
It seems to be the hump you have to find

54:43.120 --> 54:45.120
The hump to get over is

54:45.120 --> 54:48.120
That, oh, there's something interesting happening here

54:48.120 --> 54:50.120
And then once everybody kind of agrees

54:50.120 --> 54:52.120
Something interesting is happening here

54:52.120 --> 54:54.120
It seems like the coverage just sort of naturally starts rolling

54:54.120 --> 54:56.120
And so, why don't you tell us a little bit about

54:56.120 --> 54:58.120
Evolve OS and pique people's interest

54:58.120 --> 55:00.120
Because it looks super slick

55:00.120 --> 55:02.120
It looks really nice

55:02.120 --> 55:04.120
I mean, so it's got a bit of a history behind it

55:04.120 --> 55:06.120
So, I mean, a lot of people would know

55:06.120 --> 55:08.120
That I was, you know, involved in

55:08.120 --> 55:10.120
Well, involved in Solus West

55:10.120 --> 55:12.120
I was Solus West before all this

55:12.120 --> 55:14.120
So, what I did there is

55:14.120 --> 55:16.120
You know, we made a couple of mistakes along the way with Solus West

55:16.120 --> 55:18.120
One of the things I really, really, really wanted to do

55:18.120 --> 55:20.120
Is make something that only targeted the desktop

55:20.120 --> 55:22.120
Now, to a lot of people

55:22.120 --> 55:24.120
That's going to sound really stupid

55:24.120 --> 55:26.120
Because they'd be like, well, you can take Ubuntu or Fedora

55:26.120 --> 55:28.120
And just like, you know

55:28.120 --> 55:30.120
Only have a desktop on there

55:30.120 --> 55:32.120
The problem with those distributions

55:32.120 --> 55:34.120
They are very much generic

55:34.120 --> 55:36.120
Now, I don't mean that by way of an insult to those distributions

55:36.120 --> 55:38.120
But if we look at Debian

55:38.120 --> 55:40.120
It advertises itself as the universal distribution

55:40.120 --> 55:42.120
You know, it's the universal operating system

55:42.120 --> 55:44.120
You can use it anywhere

55:44.120 --> 55:46.120
To be fair, I mean

55:46.120 --> 55:48.120
I only have desktop machines

55:48.120 --> 55:50.120
And I really couldn't care less

55:50.120 --> 55:52.120
If I had the potential to run this on a Raspberry Pi

55:52.120 --> 55:54.120
Or something like that

55:54.120 --> 55:56.120
I just want to run a desktop machine

55:56.120 --> 55:58.120
I mean, it's great being able to do that

55:58.120 --> 56:00.120
But for me, I just want something that runs on what I have

56:00.120 --> 56:02.120
And that happens to be 64-bit machines

56:02.120 --> 56:04.120
That are desktops

56:04.120 --> 56:06.120
So, I only want a desktop on it

56:06.120 --> 56:08.120
I don't want to be able to run this like we have Apache

56:08.120 --> 56:10.120
And MySQL, and you know, all those carry-on

56:10.120 --> 56:12.120
Sorry, MariaDB

56:12.120 --> 56:14.120
Got to be politically correct

56:14.120 --> 56:16.120
Got to keep it hip

56:16.120 --> 56:18.120
But, you know, that's all I wanted

56:18.120 --> 56:20.120
So, it had to be very, very

56:20.120 --> 56:22.120
You know, it had to be trimmed from the get-go

56:22.120 --> 56:24.120
It couldn't have all these possible options

56:24.120 --> 56:26.120
So, you can only run Budgie Desktop on that

56:26.120 --> 56:28.120
That's all you're getting

56:28.120 --> 56:30.120
For anyone who doesn't know, Budgie Desktop is

56:30.120 --> 56:32.120
It's a GTKM modder-based desktop

56:32.120 --> 56:34.120
Similar to

56:34.120 --> 56:36.120
I guess similar to how Pantheon is implemented

56:38.120 --> 56:40.120
You know, where you just use the same libraries

56:40.120 --> 56:42.120
And basically piggyback on all that hard work

56:42.120 --> 56:44.120
To put it bluntly

56:44.120 --> 56:46.120
But another approach with this was

56:46.120 --> 56:48.120
Kind of to show people what you can do with GNOME

56:48.120 --> 56:50.120
So, you know, I mean

56:50.120 --> 56:52.120
GNOME has been forked so many times now

56:52.120 --> 56:54.120
That they're going to need to puncture a packet

56:54.120 --> 56:56.120
There's just loads of forks

56:56.120 --> 56:58.120
Like, flying around the place

56:58.120 --> 57:00.120
We wanted to show what you could do with the technology

57:00.120 --> 57:02.120
You know, it's a bit more work

57:02.120 --> 57:04.120
But in the end it pays off

57:04.120 --> 57:06.120
So, we've got a healthy upstream relationship with GNOME

57:06.120 --> 57:08.120
We contribute to GNOME

57:08.120 --> 57:10.120
I know I was supposed to be saying good GNOME

57:10.120 --> 57:12.120
But, you know, I have the remnants of an accent

57:12.120 --> 57:14.120
And that's just not happening

57:14.120 --> 57:16.120
I see, and you're linked to friends of GNOME here on your site

57:16.120 --> 57:18.120
Right here on the blog, which is nice

57:18.120 --> 57:20.120
Yeah, you've got to be nice

57:20.120 --> 57:22.120
You know, got to help them out

57:22.120 --> 57:24.120
I've got some bugs in them

57:24.120 --> 57:26.120
Sometimes they're not interesting bugs to the GNOME project

57:26.120 --> 57:28.120
So, I don't know about you guys

57:28.120 --> 57:30.120
But, like, I like to play Kerbal Space Program

57:30.120 --> 57:32.120
Because, you know, I'm so rad

57:32.120 --> 57:34.120
And cool

57:34.120 --> 57:36.120
This is not selling, is it?

57:38.120 --> 57:40.120
So, one of the problems that I actually found

57:40.120 --> 57:42.120
Is on older versions of GNOME

57:42.120 --> 57:44.120
Or GNOME Shell or, in our instance, Budgie

57:44.120 --> 57:46.120
Would just die

57:46.120 --> 57:48.120
Which was really, really oddly depressing

57:48.120 --> 57:50.120
I couldn't play Kerbal Space Program

57:50.120 --> 57:52.120
I had to fix for that and send the patch upstream

57:52.120 --> 57:54.120
And that's now living in mutter

57:54.120 --> 57:56.120
So, that's some of the stuff that we do

57:56.120 --> 57:58.120
That you wouldn't find in, say, a respin

57:58.120 --> 58:00.120
Where they add a new wallpaper on

58:00.120 --> 58:02.120
You know, there's not a lot of upstream stuff happening

58:02.120 --> 58:04.120
Whereas we build everything

58:04.120 --> 58:06.120
Right, yeah

58:06.120 --> 58:08.120
And that's a ton of work, I mean, that's the downside, right?

58:08.120 --> 58:10.120
Doesn't that seem like a huge, huge

58:10.120 --> 58:12.120
Never-ending amount of work?

58:14.120 --> 58:16.120
Yes and no

58:16.120 --> 58:18.120
So, I mean, when I was building LibreOffice

58:18.120 --> 58:20.120
Well, I mean

58:20.120 --> 58:22.120
I'm getting flashbacks now, that was hard

58:24.120 --> 58:26.120
I was ranting all over Google Plus

58:26.120 --> 58:28.120
About that, and then, you know

58:28.120 --> 58:30.120
Four hours into the build and it's like, yeah dude

58:30.120 --> 58:32.120
I needed this tool that I didn't tell you I needed

58:32.120 --> 58:34.120
Haha, thanks

58:34.120 --> 58:36.120
But, I mean, a lot of it is, you know

58:36.120 --> 58:38.120
People seem to think distribution building

58:38.120 --> 58:40.120
Is all about packaging, because that's the

58:40.120 --> 58:42.120
Concept we've been exposed to

58:42.120 --> 58:44.120
You know, you get all these packages and you put them together

58:44.120 --> 58:46.120
Well, to be honest, packaging is really boring

58:46.120 --> 58:48.120
So, if people tell you

58:48.120 --> 58:50.120
They like maintaining

58:50.120 --> 58:52.120
A load of packages and updating them

58:52.120 --> 58:54.120
They're either lying to you or

58:54.120 --> 58:56.120
You need to refer them to the local mental health unit

58:56.120 --> 58:58.120
Because, you know, it's

58:58.120 --> 59:00.120
Not nice to do it

59:00.120 --> 59:02.120
So, some of the stuff that we're tackling in Evolver West

59:02.120 --> 59:04.120
Is basically just to get rid of all that crap

59:04.120 --> 59:06.120
So, how does that work?

59:06.120 --> 59:08.120
So, how do security updates work? Is there a package management?

59:08.120 --> 59:10.120
Does it pull down updates or is it

59:10.120 --> 59:12.120
What? How does that system work?

59:12.120 --> 59:14.120
Okay, so, we're

59:14.120 --> 59:16.120
Using, I can't even say the name

59:16.120 --> 59:18.120
Of the package manager, because we've renamed it

59:18.120 --> 59:20.120
I guess you would

59:20.120 --> 59:22.120
Renounce it PC, but it's spelled

59:22.120 --> 59:24.120
P-I-S-I

59:24.120 --> 59:26.120
Yeah, anyway

59:26.120 --> 59:28.120
So, that was abandoned

59:28.120 --> 59:30.120
By Pardis Linux like a couple of years ago

59:30.120 --> 59:32.120
So, the way I was looking, I wasn't really

59:32.120 --> 59:34.120
I know it sounds bad, but I wasn't interested

59:34.120 --> 59:36.120
In package management itself

59:36.120 --> 59:38.120
Because I think that was really, really, really

59:38.120 --> 59:40.120
Boring. So, I mean, if you're looking for

59:40.120 --> 59:42.120
A real hardcore package manager that's got

59:42.120 --> 59:44.120
All the bells and whistles and all that kind of

59:44.120 --> 59:46.120
Stuff, then use Arch Linux or something

59:46.120 --> 59:48.120
That really care about their package manager

59:48.120 --> 59:50.120
Because I don't. I want

59:50.120 --> 59:52.120
To be able to install packages and update

59:52.120 --> 59:54.120
And, to me, that's what a package manager should do

59:54.120 --> 59:56.120
But I noticed, like, Firefox 37, which came out today

59:56.120 --> 59:58.120
Is available for Evolve OS already

59:58.120 --> 01:00:00.120
It is, because it takes me no

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:02.120
Time to update it at all. So, the

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:04.120
Thing that we want to do is make

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.120
Everything really easy. So, it's

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:08.120
About the development process, because it's

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.120
Mainly me doing the packaging. I've also got Justin doing

01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:12.120
Packaging now. But, if I'm

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.120
Going to spend hours doing packaging, then

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:16.120
There's never going to be a feature in the

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.120
Distribution. There's never going to be any

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.120
Level of integration, which is pointless.

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.120
So, if I'm super concerned about security fixes

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:24.120
Should I maybe use something else? So, this is more

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.120
About experimenting a little bit?

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.120
Oh, no. We do security updates. So,

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.120
I think it was just the other day that

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.120
We did some glibc updates. There was

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.120
Another one that went in yesterday. I'd have to check

01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.120
The git log, to be honest. But it's all off

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:38.120
From git hub. So, one

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.120
Of the projects that I've done in my

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.120
Own work time, like in my own professional

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.120
Work, is open source.

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.120
And that's called CVE Check Tool.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.120
Now, that's usable by all projects. So,

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.120
Yes, I made it for work, but I also

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.120
Made sure that it worked for Evolver West as well.

01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:54.120
You know,

01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.120
You've got to do these things. So, I mean,

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.120
That particular tool is something that's now been

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.120
Used by Evolver West, and it uses the National

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:02.120
Vulnerability database, which is synced

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.120
Every three to four hours, and maps

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.120
Into every source package we have in our

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.120
Distribution. Which, to be fair,

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:10.120
I mean, it's not the greatest number, but they'll then

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.120
Tell us if we have any vulnerabilities, what we've patched,

01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:14.120
What we've addressed. You know, like

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.120
The latest OpenSSL incident, it discovered

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.120
That before it had

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.120
Been formally announced. But it's

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:22.120
It's all non-embargable

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.120
TVs, but there is a process to it.

01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:26.120
You've got to have secure

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.120
Up-to-date software, but we're not a rolling release.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.120
Right. So, it's

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:32.120
So, there are points in time where

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.120
I would sort of maybe reload

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.120
After a certain new release, it wouldn't be necessarily

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:38.120
Upgraded to that new release.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.120
Right, and, I mean, that's

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.120
Kind of across that bridge when we get to it

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.120
Situation, because we haven't done a one-to-two

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.120
Yet, but ideally we want to make it

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:48.120
An update that works, because, you know,

01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.120
Linux is notorious for it doing

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.120
Between two major

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.120
Releases, so we want to make sure that actually

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:56.120
Does work when we go ahead and do that.

01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.120
That sounds really exciting. That sounds like a really interesting

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.120
Does anybody in the mumble room have any questions

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.120
For Ike?

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.120
I think I'll

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.120
Be able to download the ISO and give it a run.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.120
Sounds pretty fun. I think it's something I want to test out.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.120
I've actually got a machine in mind I'd like to pop it on there.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.120
It's going through the website, just kind of getting a

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.120
Feel for it. I like the layout.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.120
I like where it's going. I think it's interesting, but it's

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:18.120
Definitely something I want to immerse myself in for a little bit.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.120
Also,

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:22.120
You guys would really probably want to

01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:24.120
Shout out our software center.

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:26.120
It's pretty darn lightweight.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.120
It loads instantly.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.120
That's not a jab at anybody.

01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.120
But,

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:34.120
Granted, right now

01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.120
It's still getting defied, kind of

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.120
By our art team and our

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:40.120
App developers.

01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:42.120
But we hope

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:44.120
That it'll both look

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.120
Sexy and be speedy

01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:48.120
Because nobody wants to wait whenever they're

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.120
Ready to install a new package.

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:52.120
And I'm really excited

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.120
About what that could be in the future.

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.120
Yeah, really.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:58.120
Wimpy, you had a question.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.120
Yeah, so, hello Ikey.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.120
I'm running Evolvo

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.120
S on one of my laptops. It's one of

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:06.120
The distributions that I tinker with

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:08.120
And take a look at to see

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.120
What inspiration I can draw

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.120
From it. But I was wondering

01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.120
What's your long-term plans

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.120
For the project? Where do you want to take it?

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.120
And what's your drive and

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.120
Motivation for making it?

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.120
Sure, so I mean, I guess to

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.120
Shorten the question that's basically

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.120
Is it a hobby or is it something that's actually going to

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.120
Go somewhere, right?

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:30.120
Not necessarily, just

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:32.120
Why are you making it and where do you want to take the

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.120
Project?

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.120
So for me personally, I've had

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.120
A bit of a problem with Linux distributions

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.120
For quite a while now.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.120
I've been around doing the whole

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.120
Linux distro thing for a while.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.120
I kind of have a vision of what a

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:48.120
Distribution should be and to me personally

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.120
Nothing I use on the desktop

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.120
Suits what I want.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.120
To me

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.120
You should never have to open a terminal.

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.120
Yes, I am a geek. I'm paid as a software

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.120
Engineer. I use a terminal

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.120
A lot. But I don't

01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:04.120
Believe I should be using that to do something as

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.120
Stupid as make PulseAudio work again.

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.120
Or to reload a configuration.

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:10.120
I mean, the most common thing

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.120
You see on any forum is just

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:14.120
Open a terminal and type sudo apt-get install

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.120
Or sudo yum this that and the other.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.120
You shouldn't be doing that. Everything should work

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:20.120
From the get-go. So this isn't a packaging

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.120
Effort. It really is like an integration

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.120
And distribution effort.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.120
If you like the distribution

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.120
Model when we go forward from

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:30.120
The stable release, you're looking at

01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.120
Basically two years support per release

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.120
Because it should keep working.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.120
And why should everyone keep updating?

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.120
Because things just don't get that exciting

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.120
In two years.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.120
So for rolling release distros, that's all

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.120
Well and nice, but I personally don't

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.120
Want to deal with a breakage in libpng.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.120
And I don't think anyone else does.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.120
To me

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.120
For users, the thing that are really important

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:54.120
Is like, is my firefox

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:56.120
Browser two years out of date?

01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:58.120
No. Great. Do I have VLC?

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.120
Is it recent? Do I have all

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.120
The support I need? Yes. Brilliant.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:04.120
And going forward, we can have things like

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.120
Automatic driver management, which is basically

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.120
A given now.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:10.120
But there's other things going on behind the scenes

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:12.120
Like backup and things like that.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.120
Cool.

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:16.120
It's just a silly little thing.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.120
So one thing that's always got me

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:20.120
And I don't know about you guys, but when you boot up

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.120
Now and you look at grob on any single distro

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.120
You've got a recovery option, right?

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:26.120
Now, what if grob

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.120
Is gone?

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:30.120
Yes, yes.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:32.120
I've actually experienced that, yes.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.120
Right, so

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.120
It's a completely redundant option.

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.120
And you look at package manager

01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.120
So I mean the package manager that we basically inherited

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.120
And slash forked, if you like

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.120
I mean it's got options to do like

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.120
It's got rollback, which you know, that's absolutely great

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.120
But that needs to roll back from the internet

01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:50.120
So if I push out an update

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.120
Say, I don't know, and I broke network manager

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.120
Which I totally didn't do a couple

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.120
Of months ago

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.120
Yeah, that was well awkward

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:00.120
But

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.120
You know, I mean you're absolutely screwed

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:04.120
You have no network connectivity

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.120
That that's gone, or let's say like, you know

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:08.120
Grob is gone, or you've corrupted

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.120
The first few blocks of your hard drive. You're absolutely

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.120
Notly screwed. So I don't see

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.120
Anything out there at the moment that's solving them for

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.120
Yes, there's no like, immediate

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.120
Recovery option. There isn't the whole thing you have

01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:20.120
Windows, yeah I mentioned Windows

01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:22.120
People can burn me, I don't care, it's cool

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.120
But

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:26.120
You don't have realistic recovery options

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:28.120
You don't

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:30.120
I mean, what's the most common thing people do?

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.120
Oh no, that's screwed, I'm going to reinstall it. Well no

01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:34.120
You have to think in the concept like, I mean

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.120
You know, I'm not making a product here, I'm really not

01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.120
But you have to think along the lines that this is a product

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.120
And you have to imagine as if it was

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:42.120
An OEM installation, they have

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.120
No disk to reinstall it, what are they going to do?

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.120
So you have to start thinking of solutions like that

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:48.120
How are these people going to get by for the next 2 years

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.120
With no recovery disk, you don't want them

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.120
To reinstall, and you have to be able to solve the problems

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:54.120
You need to be able to roll back somewhere

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.120
So that's the kind of things that we want to address in the Volvo West

01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.120
Longevity of an installation

01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:00.120
Basically. Very nice

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.120
Lael, you wanted to ask a question?

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.120
Yeah

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:06.120
My question is this

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.120
I notice in

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.120
I mean, most of the distros I've tried

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.120
Right now I am on Ubuntu Mate

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.120
Most of the distros I've tried

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.120
Whether in VirtualBox or actually on my

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.120
System

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.120
They require you to

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.120
Type in the command prompt to resolve

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.120
Dependencies, how does your

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:26.120
Distribution answer the question

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.120
Of resolving dependency through

01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:30.120
Installing it through your package manager?

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.120
So

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.120
The package manager is something we basically wanted

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.120
To extract, I mean you can use it from a terminal

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.120
That's really really fine, if that, you know, that's what

01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:40.120
Gets you going, more than fine doing that

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.120
But I mean, it works the same as any other package manager

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.120
You have binary dependencies

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.120
When we build our packages, that's actually

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.120
Automatic at runtime, similar to RPM

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.120
So there's a binary dependency

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.120
By a shared library, that's automatic

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:54.120
So dependency resolution, all that stuff

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.120
You know, works the same as any other

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:58.120
Distro, but we don't really want people to use

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.120
That, because that's dull, boring

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:02.120
And what not, you know, not what

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:04.120
Quote, normal people

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.120
Do, so you'd have a graphical software

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:08.120
Manager where you get everything done

01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.120
But yeah, dependencies and everything, that's all

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.120
Automatic, and there's one

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.120
Place that we do differ, to say

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:16.120
Ubuntu or Debian

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.120
We avoid package conflicts

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.120
So, in the

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:22.120
Likes, especially things like

01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:24.120
Build dependencies, which, you know, not applicable

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:26.120
To a user, but in Debian you have

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.120
Like libjpeg, and you have libjpeg

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.120
Turbo, which both conflict with each

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.120
Other, with us we'll just choose one

01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.120
And we'll use that across the entire distribution

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.120
So you won't install something, it's like, ah

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:38.120
But you need to remove those 49 packages

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.120
And probably break your system

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:42.120
So we avoid those, and design it to

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.120
Work going forward anyway

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.120
And Colton, you had a question

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:48.120
Yeah

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.120
So, I went

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.120
Ahead and I torrented your ISO and I

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.120
Loaded it up in a virtual box just now

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.120
And

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:58.120
I'd just like to say that I

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.120
Really like your desktop environment

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.120
And your installer's pretty nice too

01:09:02.120 --> 01:09:04.120
But, it seems a little bit

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:06.120
Technical, like there's no options

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:08.120
That allow the

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:10.120
Installer to automatically

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.120
Create a partition

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.120
On the hard drive, or

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.120
Like the option to install

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.120
Grub is unchecked by default

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:20.120
So, like

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.120
Do you have any plans to fix that in the future?

01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:24.120
Oh yeah, I mean

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:26.120
That thing, you know, it's

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.120
Ugly, it's like an abortion of free will

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.120
Oh no!

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.120
No, it's getting replaced, I mean that's got a bit of

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.120
History, that installer, so

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.120
It's probably, next to

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.120
Ubiquity, it's one of the oldest installers

01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:40.120
In Linux land

01:09:40.120 --> 01:09:42.120
It was originally the LMD live

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:44.120
Installer, which I mean I used to be involved in that

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.120
Once upon a time, you know

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.120
We all make mistakes, no joking

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:50.120
And then another

01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:52.120
Another thing that

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:54.120
I noticed is when I was setting up the

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:56.120
Disks, like I, one thing

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:58.120
Is I had to open Gparted and do everything

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.120
Manually, which is, you know

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:02.120
Something that most people aren't going to

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.120
Want to do, and then also

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:06.120
Like, it didn't have options

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.120
It had an option to set up

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.120
A root partition and a swap partition

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.120
And that's it, no custom

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:14.120
Home partition or anything like that

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:16.120
Yeah, I mean I'm not proud of it

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.120
And

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.120
I mean it looks nice

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:22.120
Visually it looks nice, but

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.120
Just the actual content

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.120
Of it is not very useful

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.120
Yeah, I mean it sort of sucks

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.120
Do you need help Ike?

01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:32.120
What is a situation like that?

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.120
Do you kind of like doing it sort of

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.120
With a small team, or just yourself

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:38.120
Or just a few helpers? How does that work for you?

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.120
No, I mean if people want to jump in

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:42.120
By all means, jump in, you know

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.120
I mean obviously it started out for myself

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.120
I wanted, you know, I had certain needs

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.120
That weren't being, that doesn't sound right

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.120
I had certain needs for a distribution

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.120
We all do Ike, we all do

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:56.120
Wow

01:10:56.120 --> 01:10:58.120
But yeah, certain needs that won't be fulfilled

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.120
In the distribution sense

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.120
You know, so that started out for me

01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:04.120
But then other people started getting interested

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.120
Probably because I actually spammed the crap out of Google Plus

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.120
With screenshots, now I think about it

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.120
Might have something to do with it

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:12.120
Yeah, I mean we're on GitHub

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:14.120
They can just jump in and send us a pull request

01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:16.120
And I will put a link to your GitHub page

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.120
In the show notes as well

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:20.120
So, that's cool

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:22.120
I'm downloading the ISO right now

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.120
One thing I will say is

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:26.120
I know it's like a pig in VirtualBox

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.120
Everything is

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.120
I don't blame you for that

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.120
I could make excuses for it, but

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.120
I just don't think you should run it in VirtualBox

01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:38.120
Yeah, in my opinion

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:40.120
No one should ever run anything in VirtualBox

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.120
But right now I don't have a free machine

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.120
That I can just load it on

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.120
So, VirtualBox is like

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:48.120
Oh, it's at my fingertips, so I can go ahead and do it

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:50.120
I mean, it does make for easy testing

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:52.120
I will say one thing

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.120
It is very, very, very, very fast

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:56.120
On real hardware

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.120
So, you'll find

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.120
I did most of my benchmarking on an Intel NUC

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.120
Because they're awesome, obviously

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.120
That's a good test rig

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.120
If it runs good on a NUC, it's probably going to run good on a lot of hardware

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.120
This is a Haswell i5

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:12.120
To be fair, it's got 16 gigs of RAM

01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:14.120
It's not a slouch

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.120
But it boots in 2.134 seconds

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:18.120
2.314 seconds

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.120
It's really freaking fast, basically

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.120
Aiki, thank you for coming on here

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.120
And chatting to us about a distro

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.120
That we haven't got a chance to look at a lot

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:28.120
And you're always welcome to join us

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:30.120
We have an open Mumba room

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.120
So, join us for any show

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:34.120
And give us an update on what you're working on

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:36.120
Or chat on stuff

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.120
I also would love to see other distro makers

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.120
That want to stop by and tell us what they love

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.120
About the distribution they're making

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.120
Because, take Aiki, nobody knows it like he does

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.120
He's passionate about it because he's making it

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.120
He's working on it, and it's cool to hear it from him

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:50.120
And so, if you're out there working on something

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:52.120
You're always welcome to join us, we just have to check your microphone

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.120
Make sure you're going to pass the sniff test

01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:56.120
You know what, the sniff test, Matt

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.120
That's what I call it

01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:00.120
I don't know why I call it that, because it's a sound check

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.120
It's nothing about smell at all

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.120
It sounds cool

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:06.120
Hey Matt, is there anywhere you want to send folks throughout the week?

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:08.120
As always, I've got stuff going on

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.120
With articles and whatnot

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:12.120
I always have new projects around the bend

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.120
Just as it sounds

01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:16.120
Otherwise, if you forget the URL, you type in my name

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.120
And I'm number one at the top

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:20.120
That's magic, that's magic

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:22.120
Hey, join us live on a Tuesday too

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:24.120
You can chat with Matt, you can do that too, you can chat with me

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.120
You can do it over at jbliv.com

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:28.120
Alright everybody, thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:30.120
Of the Unplugged program

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:42.120
And we'll see you right back here next week. Cheers!

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:02.120
Oh, we've got to do it all over again

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.120
Twomp in the chat room

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:06.120
Twomp in the chat room, fell asleep

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.120
So he missed the whole show, we've got to do it all over again

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.120
You know, next time, I'm just going to record the thing

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.120
And then that way he can just catch it on download

01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:14.120
That would be way smarter

01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:16.120
Why didn't I think of that one, Matt?

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.120
Well, if we're sniffing voices, we might as well have something to wake people up

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:20.120
Maybe I was sniffing too much glue

01:14:20.120 --> 01:14:22.120
Alright, let's go pick our title

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:24.120
JBtitles.com, last chance to bang

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.120
And suggest the title

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.120
And all of that goodness

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:30.120
Alright, thanks for showing up today, guys

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.120
Good show, appreciate having Roboto here

01:14:32.120 --> 01:14:34.120
And thanks Wimpy for showing us all up with your audio quality

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.120
That was good too

01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.120
You're welcome

01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.120
It's just amazing

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:42.120
Evolve your OS isn't bad, that's not a bad title

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.120
That's pretty good

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.120
Yeah, I like that

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.120
Linux Evolved OS

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:50.120
For Evolve OS, I think we should go for something subtle

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.120
You know, like just so

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:54.120
People don't feel that it's been rammed down their throat

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.120
Like, world dominating

01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:58.120
OS should be in your front room

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.120
Go buy it now or we'll kill you

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.120
Something subtle

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.120
Yeah, something really subtle, I like that

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.120
How about Evolve OS?

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:08.120
It's better than the others

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:10.120
Well actually

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.120
We got into the whole social media thing the other day

01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:14.120
Because basically, I'm an absolute attention whore

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.120
I gotta be blunt

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:18.120
We put up a tweet

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:20.120
Just to make everyone feel comfortable

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:22.120
Everyone was like

01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:24.120
What was this one of the first tweets?

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.120
So yeah, I haven't

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.120
We haven't suddenly decided to start competing

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.120
With all the other desktops right now

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.120
Oh wait, yeah we have

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:34.120
So they kind of know

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:36.120
You're in it to win it

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:38.120
Evolve your OS is coming up at number one

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:40.120
Right now, that's not bad

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:42.120
The Kickstarter withdrawal method at number two

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.120
Systemd trolls Linux at number three

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.120
I think Evolve your OS is a pretty good one

01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:48.120
I think it's pretty good, that's where I'd go

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:50.120
Yeah

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.120
I feel kind of bad because we co-opted the show

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.120
No it's okay

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:56.120
It was actually kind of fit

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.120
We wanted to get attention

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.120
That's the whole point

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.120
That's what I love about the show actually

01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:04.120
We have the mumble room

01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.120
It's totally unexpected

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:08.120
We had stuff to talk about

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:10.120
I love having a show where we can just go with it

01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:12.120
It works out better that way I think

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:14.120
Definitely

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.120
I think honestly

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.120
If you had a lug

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.120
We'd get pretty close

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.120
And every now and then somebody brought a friend to the meetup

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.120
This is what would happen

01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.120
Very true

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.120
Aiki you're my friend

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.120
Yeah you brought a friend to the lug meetup

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.120
It's pretty cool

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:34.120
That's too official isn't it

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:36.120
Can we go for acquaintance?

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:38.120
This is too close and comfortable

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:40.120
Lover, whatever it is, I don't care

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.120
Bring them

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:44.120
We're past that

01:16:46.120 --> 01:16:48.120
This isn't being recorded anymore is it?

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.120
No of course not
