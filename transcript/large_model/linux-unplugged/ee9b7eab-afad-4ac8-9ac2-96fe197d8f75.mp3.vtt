WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
Wes, you're always trying to find new and fun things to do with good old DNS.

00:03.680 --> 00:05.360
What'd you find this week?

00:05.360 --> 00:06.360
DNS.toys.

00:06.360 --> 00:11.360
I mean, you're familiar with the tools that let you get the weather in your terminal,

00:11.360 --> 00:12.360
right?

00:12.360 --> 00:13.360
Yeah, okay.

00:13.360 --> 00:14.960
But that's like calling an HTTP API.

00:14.960 --> 00:15.960
It's so wasteful.

00:15.960 --> 00:16.960
Boring.

00:16.960 --> 00:17.960
Yeah.

00:17.960 --> 00:20.640
With DNS.toys, you can get the weather over DNS.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.640
Excuse me?

00:22.640 --> 00:29.360
Yeah, just dig Seattle.weather at DNS.toys and there you go.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.040
You can get different times, world times and time zones.

00:32.040 --> 00:37.840
You can do your unit and currency conversion and you can even print the digits of pi.

00:37.840 --> 00:38.840
That's pretty great.

00:38.840 --> 00:43.600
And you know, this just puts us one step closer to that all command line, all the time lifestyle.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.600
We'll get there.

00:44.600 --> 00:49.600
I knew it.

00:49.600 --> 01:00.160
Hello friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.160
My name is Chris.

01:01.160 --> 01:02.160
My name is Wes.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.160
And my name is Brent.

01:03.160 --> 01:04.920
Hello gentlemen.

01:04.920 --> 01:09.080
Welcome into a very special episode of the unplugged program.

01:09.080 --> 01:13.080
We're going to have a really unique guest.

01:13.080 --> 01:17.680
He helped co-invent the webcam, the VNC protocol and so many other things.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.760
He'll be joining us in just a little bit to share some of his memories of the early days

01:21.760 --> 01:25.880
of the web, computing and so many of the standards and protocols that we use today.

01:25.880 --> 01:30.000
It's just going to be a great opportunity, but first we do have a couple of items we

01:30.000 --> 01:34.040
want to update you on, then we'll round out the show with some boosts and some picks and

01:34.040 --> 01:35.040
a lot more.

01:35.040 --> 01:39.000
So before we go any further, let's do the right thing and bring our virtual log in time

01:39.000 --> 01:40.640
appropriate greetings, mumble room.

01:40.640 --> 01:41.640
Hello, hello.

01:41.640 --> 01:42.640
Good evening.

01:42.640 --> 01:43.640
Hello Chris.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.360
Hey Wes and hey Brent.

01:45.360 --> 01:48.720
I am very glad you could be here for the special prerecord this week.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.560
We don't always get the mumble room when we do a prerecord.

01:50.560 --> 01:51.560
It means a lot.

01:51.560 --> 01:59.980
Otherwise it's just a little lonely, quiet, too much, I mean, hey now, well, hey, before

01:59.980 --> 02:04.120
we go too far, should we do a meetup for folks that are going to be attending the Jupiter

02:04.120 --> 02:06.840
broadcasting London meetup in August?

02:06.840 --> 02:07.840
Yeah.

02:07.840 --> 02:12.680
I'm not sure if we have an update this week, but I think it was very important to just

02:12.680 --> 02:21.480
keep mentioning that Alex will be in London and he's planning a Jupiter broadcasting meetup

02:21.480 --> 02:27.480
that is tentatively planned for August 5th at around 6pm GMT.

02:27.480 --> 02:32.760
Now don't be confused because the meetup page tends to give all the times in JB time, which

02:32.760 --> 02:36.480
is Pacific, which would not really work out very well locally in London.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.360
So have a look at the meetup page.

02:38.360 --> 02:41.760
I think there are about 80 to 90 people signed up so far.

02:41.760 --> 02:45.320
It seems every week we get another 10 or 20, which is really great.

02:45.320 --> 02:49.680
And look for some updates on location maybe in the next few weeks.

02:49.680 --> 02:51.680
I really wish I could make that one.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.680
Hmm.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.680
Boy, oh boy.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.480
I'm really glad though that it's coming together.

02:55.480 --> 02:56.480
Jealous.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.640
Build a community over there.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.160
Maybe this is the way to do it, right?

02:59.160 --> 03:02.160
We start getting an idea of how many folks are there, what works and doesn't work, and

03:02.160 --> 03:03.160
then...

03:03.160 --> 03:04.840
Alex is going to scout out some locations this time around, right?

03:04.840 --> 03:06.600
So we'll have some ideas there too.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.600
Maybe this is how it happens.

03:07.600 --> 03:10.840
We send the pre-crew and then we'll get there, you know, next time.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.200
Like the rock stars we are.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.200
Oh wait.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.200
I just got really excited there.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.200
Like true VIPs.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.200
Yeah.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.200
Oh boy.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.200
Let's move on.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.200
For goodness sakes.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.640
Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for the details on that.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.760
Do follow it there because details could change.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.080
Flights could change.

03:24.080 --> 03:26.180
That kind of stuff.

03:26.180 --> 03:30.720
It's been a minute since we've talked about the Linux Copter flying on Mars.

03:30.720 --> 03:34.540
We do updates occasionally in Linux Action News.

03:34.540 --> 03:38.880
But this week it seems that there's been a little software update that we want to talk

03:38.880 --> 03:39.880
about.

03:39.880 --> 03:42.080
I'm just recovering this has been out there for a little bit.

03:42.080 --> 03:46.240
But as you guys will recall, Ingenuity arrived on Mars in February 2021.

03:46.240 --> 03:51.080
And along with the rover, this little helicopter we thought, well, we'd see, I don't know,

03:51.080 --> 03:53.800
I don't remember with how many flights we saw, I thought originally it was such a small

03:53.800 --> 03:54.800
number.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.320
I mean, it's just a proof of concept.

03:56.320 --> 04:00.720
But now it's turned out it's flown 21 times and it's actually provided critical data for

04:00.720 --> 04:01.720
the rover.

04:01.720 --> 04:05.800
So much so that NASA is going to continue to use these Linux Copters in the future.

04:05.800 --> 04:10.000
And for us, it just felt like such a historic milestone for Linux.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.720
And then we had an opportunity to connect with some of the folks from JPL and that was

04:13.720 --> 04:15.860
such a cool treat.

04:15.860 --> 04:18.560
And so it's neat to see software updates are going out.

04:18.560 --> 04:21.620
I guess I didn't really have anything other than I just wanted to have an excuse to talk

04:21.620 --> 04:23.320
about this little guy.

04:23.320 --> 04:27.520
They've done some upgrades to reduce navigation errors during flight.

04:27.520 --> 04:30.000
And they're now letting it fly higher than 15 meters too.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.480
It's just getting more and more capable and it keeps working.

04:32.480 --> 04:37.580
And remember, like before this thing flew, we weren't even 100% sure that the whole flying

04:37.580 --> 04:39.680
on Mars thing was going to work properly.

04:39.680 --> 04:46.800
Yeah, they said that they flew over to this Delta on Mars and they used the helicopter

04:46.800 --> 04:51.080
to determine which of the dry river channels that the copter should drive in or that the

04:51.080 --> 04:52.880
rover I should say should drive into.

04:52.880 --> 04:55.240
It's a neat idea.

04:55.240 --> 04:59.440
This patch is kind of cool too because they're inserting a small little code snippet on the

04:59.440 --> 05:04.480
flight computer that intercepts incoming garbage packets from like some faulty sensor stuff

05:04.480 --> 05:09.960
and then uses other data to reconstruct replacement packets that get like inserted into the stream.

05:09.960 --> 05:13.400
So then like downstream components just get the data that they were expecting.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.400
I can't even imagine.

05:14.400 --> 05:19.400
So not only do you come up with that patch, but then you apply the patch on Mars.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.760
Hopefully they've got that new system DAB updates thing.

05:22.760 --> 05:26.920
Actually didn't they say there was some kind of AB system they had on there?

05:26.920 --> 05:27.920
They did say that.

05:27.920 --> 05:28.920
Yeah, there is that.

05:28.920 --> 05:29.920
Hopefully they have that kind of.

05:29.920 --> 05:30.920
Hopefully an ABC system.

05:30.920 --> 05:38.360
You know, I'd love to know more about it because you got to imagine there is an identical unit

05:38.360 --> 05:44.280
on the ground at JPL, but then are they like, are they doing like a series of QA tests on

05:44.280 --> 05:45.280
this thing?

05:45.280 --> 05:48.920
Are they doing like flight tests and imaging tests?

05:48.920 --> 05:52.360
Like are they like doing software updates and then do they have some sort of facility

05:52.360 --> 05:55.480
where this thing flies inside where it's the atmosphere of Mars and then they do a bunch

05:55.480 --> 05:56.480
of testing?

05:56.480 --> 05:57.480
That's a good question.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.480
Are they putting dust on it and stuff?

05:58.480 --> 05:59.480
Right?

05:59.480 --> 06:01.560
Like are they diminishing like the solar panels capacity?

06:01.560 --> 06:05.640
Or is it kind of just a YOLO thing where they're like, well, we can only test so much.

06:05.640 --> 06:06.640
Upload.

06:06.640 --> 06:10.040
I'd love to get the answer to that, but it's pretty great to follow this and it's great

06:10.040 --> 06:11.400
to see that they're continuing to update.

06:11.400 --> 06:14.760
It's been several updates just even kind of recently on the on the 7th.

06:14.760 --> 06:16.240
I think there was a report.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.040
Go Ingenuity go.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.040
Yeah.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.040
Yeah.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.040
So neat.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.160
And even though we haven't really touched on it in a bit, we're still following it.

06:24.160 --> 06:27.440
And when there is kind of like a mission update or something like that, we do try to include

06:27.440 --> 06:30.320
that in Linux action news as well.

06:30.320 --> 06:34.960
And then I wanted to follow up on a project called Umbral.

06:34.960 --> 06:41.320
We talked about Umbral a month or two ago, and it sells itself as a personal server OS

06:41.320 --> 06:42.320
for self hosting.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.680
And I'd say that's pretty accurate.

06:44.680 --> 06:48.640
It's really seen some major updates since we talked about it last on the show.

06:48.640 --> 06:53.360
And one of those updates is to break out the Bitcoin node and the lightning node as their

06:53.360 --> 06:55.220
own separate apps.

06:55.220 --> 07:00.720
So if you weren't interested in the Bitcoin aspect of this, but maybe you were interested

07:00.720 --> 07:05.840
in running Nextcloud or a Google Photos replacement like Photo Prism or Sync Thing or Synapse

07:05.840 --> 07:09.640
to run your own matrix server, or maybe you wanted to run Vault Warden or Fulcrum.

07:09.640 --> 07:11.440
I do want to run those things.

07:11.440 --> 07:12.440
Yeah.

07:12.440 --> 07:15.220
And you didn't necessarily want to dedicate 500 gigs to the blockchain.

07:15.220 --> 07:16.340
I don't know.

07:16.340 --> 07:17.500
That seems pretty reasonable.

07:17.500 --> 07:22.160
They've now broken all of that out along with a brand new UI.

07:22.160 --> 07:27.120
And because people are having such a hard time getting their hands on a Raspberry Pi,

07:27.120 --> 07:33.320
they've now created a couple of really easy one liner type installs to get Umbral up and

07:33.320 --> 07:35.440
running on any Debian or Ubuntu box.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.640
Oh, that's great.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.680
Making that really, really straightforward.

07:38.680 --> 07:42.840
If you missed our first coverage, that's Linux Unplugged 4.47 for more.

07:42.840 --> 07:47.080
But speaking of Raspberry Pis, I actually have a little bit of good news.

07:47.080 --> 07:50.200
You've been hoarding them and you're willing to sell some of your supply to the audience?

07:50.200 --> 07:52.280
I'm waiting for the prices to go up just a little bit longer.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.280
I'm still hedging.

07:53.280 --> 07:59.320
You know, but you and I have been talking about doing a Raspberry Pi based router.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.800
Were you thinking for yourself or were you thinking for your folks or both?

08:01.800 --> 08:02.800
I can't remember.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.360
I mean, some combination of I need a new router set up.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.360
My folks need one.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.360
The studio needs one.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.360
And the studio needs one.

08:08.360 --> 08:09.360
So there's like a lot of things.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.360
Yeah.

08:10.360 --> 08:11.360
Tell the time for a shortage.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.360
Oh, yeah.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.360
I mean, you do.

08:13.360 --> 08:14.360
Brent.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.360
Yeah.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.360
That's before we even get to Brent.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.360
We all know this.

08:17.360 --> 08:18.360
I don't even have to mention it.

08:18.360 --> 08:19.360
But you just got a laptop.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.360
All right.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.680
I can only give away so many things in an episode.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.800
So this week, I actually have really great news for Wes.

08:25.800 --> 08:31.620
Listener Maximilian contacted me on Matrix recently and said, hey, I've got a Raspberry

08:31.620 --> 08:33.900
Pi for eight gigabytes.

08:33.900 --> 08:34.900
Could you use it?

08:34.900 --> 08:36.180
I haven't been using it for anything.

08:36.180 --> 08:38.480
And I said, you know, I think that Wes Payne could use it.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.080
He's looking to build a router.

08:40.080 --> 08:48.080
So Maximilian is shipping a Raspberry Pi for eight gigabytes for Wes Payne to the studio.

08:48.080 --> 08:51.120
So it'll probably arrive while I'm in Montana.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.120
That's usually how these things work out.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.400
That's just kind of typical, I suppose.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.600
Well, that way, it's something to tempt you back.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.600
Yeah, right.

08:57.600 --> 08:58.600
Well, no, it'll be for you.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.360
And then we can and I'll use my Compute Module 4 that I have set aside.

09:01.360 --> 09:02.880
I have one set aside.

09:02.880 --> 09:06.360
And you won't have to worry about a carrier board because this is a full unit.

09:06.360 --> 09:09.680
And we can get maybe that router project kicked off now.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.800
So that'll be pretty cool.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.460
And I think we were talking about it, although I don't know for sure about it.

09:14.460 --> 09:18.520
But I think we're tempted to try to build it around Nix OS and create a Linux based

09:18.520 --> 09:19.960
firewall and router.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.740
We're not opposed to things like PFSense or any of that kind of stuff.

09:23.740 --> 09:27.420
But we thought it might be fun to see what it'd be like to just build a minimum viable

09:27.420 --> 09:32.720
Linux router project that is a super tightly controlled OS.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.480
I don't know what we'll use for everything.

09:34.480 --> 09:35.480
We haven't quite discussed it.

09:35.480 --> 09:39.080
I'm sure we have a few ideas, but indeed, we don't want to spoil all the fun.

09:39.080 --> 09:43.080
Yeah, but, you know, we'll get a little reckless with it because that's what we do here.

09:43.080 --> 09:46.560
So that's cool, and I wanted to say thank you to Listener Maximillian.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.560
That's pretty great.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.560
Thank you for enabling our shenanigans.

09:48.560 --> 09:49.560
Yeah.

09:49.560 --> 09:52.160
And if you've got a Raspberry Pi or an Ubuntu and Debian box and you want to try out the

09:52.160 --> 09:54.600
new Umbral, it is pretty cool.

09:54.600 --> 10:00.400
It is a really slick way to load up a bunch of great apps on your own LAN.

10:00.400 --> 10:04.160
They write on their release announcement, this release has brought a massive underlying

10:04.160 --> 10:06.840
architectural change to Umbral's source code.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.880
One of those changes is the migration of the Umbral app store to its own dedicated GitHub

10:10.880 --> 10:14.800
repository along with a new way to easily test package and ship apps for Umbral.

10:14.800 --> 10:20.760
So the other big update, if you're already using Umbral, is they'll now have separate

10:20.760 --> 10:23.920
updates for these components outside of the overall OS updates.

10:23.920 --> 10:29.720
So you can get mid-stream app updates now, which is going to be really nice.

10:29.720 --> 10:30.800
And I like Umbral.

10:30.800 --> 10:31.800
It is still in beta.

10:31.800 --> 10:32.800
It is still early.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.800
There's always these caveats with these one-click do-it-all things, but I do think it's a pretty

10:36.800 --> 10:37.800
good project.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.800
Now, Chris, you've been running Umbral at the studio since about January when I was

10:41.800 --> 10:42.800
there last.

10:42.800 --> 10:48.760
And I was curious, I guess, how it's been going and whether or not you've updated yet

10:48.760 --> 10:51.200
or you plan too soon to this new version.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.960
I've not gone to this new version yet, but I have done every update.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.360
I'm going to do the new version when I get back.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.760
I just don't want anything to go sideways before I travel.

10:57.760 --> 10:58.760
Wow.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.000
You're being uncharacteristically responsible.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
I love the boosts.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.000
Are you feeling okay?

11:03.000 --> 11:06.120
The boosts are like my little bit of sunshine every single day.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.360
So anything to protect the boosts.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.360
Yeah.

11:08.360 --> 11:09.360
On a cloudy day.

11:09.360 --> 11:14.160
So on my side, when somebody sends in a boost, a helipad makes a great little sound, a little

11:14.160 --> 11:15.160
boost sound effect.

11:15.160 --> 11:18.800
And then there's also a confetti explosion all over it.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.800
And it's a live update.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.120
It comes right in in real time.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.040
And I tell you what, it is the best mood booster ever.

11:24.040 --> 11:27.400
And so I didn't want to break that because I'll probably, you know, if I'm frustrated

11:27.400 --> 11:31.500
or something at some point, I'll pull up tail scale on my phone and I bring up the boosts.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.500
Bad traffic.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500
Check for the boost.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.460
Well, maybe not while I'm driving, but literally I'll be having like a bad day or I'll be frustrated

11:36.460 --> 11:41.000
and I'll just tail scale up and I'll bring, oh yeah, look at these boosts.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
Okay.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
I feel better now.

11:43.000 --> 11:46.800
So I don't want to break it before I go, but it has been really super solid since January.

11:46.800 --> 11:49.120
I've done every update since then.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.520
And it does make it pretty easy to back up and get out.

11:51.520 --> 11:57.080
I mean, really under the hood, all it's doing is like updating Docker containers.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.080
It's a pretty established system.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.760
So it's pretty safe.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.480
There is of course things to consider.

12:03.480 --> 12:05.200
It is in beta.

12:05.200 --> 12:10.660
It's a 0.5 release and this is a major new version, but we've heard from several folks

12:10.660 --> 12:15.400
in our Bitcoin matrix channel that the update has gone really smooth for them.

12:15.400 --> 12:16.400
So nice.

12:16.400 --> 12:17.400
Yeah.

12:17.400 --> 12:18.400
Yeah.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.400
A big test for the project.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.400
So hopefully it keeps going well.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.140
lino.com slash unplugged.

12:24.140 --> 12:28.840
Go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account and you go there to support the

12:28.840 --> 12:29.840
show.

12:29.840 --> 12:32.840
So it's lino.com slash unplugged and that's it.

12:32.840 --> 12:38.440
It's simple as that to get that $100 MVME storage, super fast CPUs, 11 data centers

12:38.440 --> 12:40.800
around the world, best support in the biz.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.520
I mean, I could go on and on.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.520
In fact, I often do.

12:44.520 --> 12:45.520
And you know what?

12:45.520 --> 12:50.040
It's still to this day, two and a half years later when I need to deploy something, I go

12:50.040 --> 12:51.080
to Linode.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.120
I go to Linode because I've had a great experience.

12:53.120 --> 12:58.000
Honestly, the performance, it matters to me, but they're also just great citizens in the

12:58.000 --> 12:59.420
Linux community.

12:59.420 --> 13:01.600
That's actually how I found Linode originally.

13:01.600 --> 13:05.280
I was at Texas Linux Fest, which feels like a hundred years ago.

13:05.280 --> 13:09.960
Texas Linux Fest was having a bit of a rough year and most of the vendors just weren't

13:09.960 --> 13:15.800
even really trying, but Linode was there with a smile on their face and the best booth making

13:15.800 --> 13:20.660
what turned out to be one of the most influential Linux Fest in my lifetime possible.

13:20.660 --> 13:21.920
And I made a mental note.

13:21.920 --> 13:27.680
I wasn't even looking for sponsors back then, but I made a mental note that when it came

13:27.680 --> 13:29.720
time, I was going to look up Linode.

13:29.720 --> 13:31.720
And while I waited, I tried them out as a customer.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.280
I became a customer first.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.280
And I was so damn impressed.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.240
You know, they've been doing this for nearly 19 years.

13:37.240 --> 13:41.040
So it makes sense that you get it right, but that doesn't mean every company does that.

13:41.040 --> 13:44.960
And there's a lot of places you can host things, but no place quite does it like Linode with

13:44.960 --> 13:49.020
the performance, the support, and just the continuous improvement.

13:49.020 --> 13:54.800
They just expanded their managed database offering, which was just MySQL back in May.

13:54.800 --> 14:00.000
Well now they're offering Postgres and MongoDB, which is huge for us.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.920
I'm probably going to move our matrix Postgres database over to this.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.360
I mean, why not?

14:05.360 --> 14:10.360
Why not take advantage of the expertise that is Linode's staff and their infrastructure

14:10.360 --> 14:11.860
to run the database?

14:11.860 --> 14:15.680
The part of running a matrix server I kind of don't like anyways.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.600
I think it's pretty great.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.480
And I'd do it too if I was using MongoDB or MySQL.

14:20.480 --> 14:21.480
I'm ready to jump in though.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.480
I tell you what.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.800
We've also released a new e-book, which you can get for free, which helps give you a high

14:25.800 --> 14:29.960
level understanding of database and database architectures and different deployment methods

14:29.960 --> 14:34.840
and what methods might work best in the cloud possibly.

14:34.840 --> 14:40.080
Or when you're working with their crazy fast storage or their AMD epic processors, AMD

14:40.080 --> 14:43.000
really has some great CPUs and you know what?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.000
Linode was down.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
They were down.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
They put them in some of their high-end.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.840
We've got a system with AMD epic processors in it.

14:49.840 --> 14:50.840
I love it.

14:50.840 --> 14:51.840
I love the flexibility.

14:51.840 --> 14:52.840
I love the solution choice.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.120
I love the support and all of it.

14:54.120 --> 14:58.520
Plus, it's a great way for you to try something, for you to learn something, to get that $100

14:58.520 --> 14:59.520
and support the show.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.540
So just head right over to linode.com slash unplugged.

15:02.540 --> 15:07.360
Get that $100 for 60 days on a new account, kick the tires for yourself and support the

15:07.360 --> 15:08.360
show.

15:08.360 --> 15:14.080
Linode.com slash unplugged.

15:14.080 --> 15:19.120
You know, gentlemen, I was lucky enough to be able to have a brunch with Brent style

15:19.120 --> 15:26.320
conversation with a listener of ours who is a very avid listener of self-hosted and other

15:26.320 --> 15:29.920
programs here on Jupiter broadcasting.

15:29.920 --> 15:35.520
And this gentleman's name, Quinton Stafford Frazier, or Dr. Quinton, it should be, turns

15:35.520 --> 15:39.880
out is a fabulously interesting individual.

15:39.880 --> 15:45.480
I was introduced to him by Alex because they had a little exchange and Alex was like, oh,

15:45.480 --> 15:47.880
this guy's got to be a great brunch guest.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.920
So we went ahead and did that recently.

15:49.920 --> 15:57.660
Quinton is a computer scientist, an entrepreneur, part-time academic, full-time gadget enthusiast.

15:57.660 --> 16:02.280
So lots of home assistance stuff going on here based in Cambridge, England.

16:02.280 --> 16:09.280
And he is credited with inventing the webcam, which he claims is not entirely justified,

16:09.280 --> 16:11.320
but turns out the media thinks he should be.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.320
Oh, good.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.320
We have someone to blame.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.320
Right.

16:14.320 --> 16:19.000
So he's authored dozens of patents over the years that have mostly been owned by Google

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
now.

16:20.000 --> 16:25.720
His PhD is on augmented reality, which I think sounds pretty fascinating.

16:25.720 --> 16:33.640
He also ran the very first web server in Cambridge University back then when the newfangled worldwide

16:33.640 --> 16:35.660
web thing was happening.

16:35.660 --> 16:41.040
He also teased with me that he may have had something to do with inventing the very first

16:41.040 --> 16:46.040
AVNC client, which I think maybe we'll have to have a conversation about.

16:46.040 --> 16:51.360
But he describes a great deal more on his personal website, which we will link to.

16:51.360 --> 16:55.640
And in our conversation, he was pretty humble about how long that list of accomplishments

16:55.640 --> 16:56.640
was.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.600
I actually have quite a substantial personal website.

16:59.600 --> 17:03.880
And it's not that I think I'm deserving of this great monument to myself.

17:03.880 --> 17:07.940
It's just that I keep adding bits and I never get around to deleting stuff.

17:07.940 --> 17:13.600
And that's what I gathered, because some of the things, which I didn't read, mentioned

17:13.600 --> 17:16.600
like, you can hear me say hello here.

17:16.600 --> 17:21.440
And in parentheses, you state, at the time that I wrote this, that wasn't possible for

17:21.440 --> 17:23.680
all computers and all browsers.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.840
So it's neat how you've just sort of added things as you go.

17:26.840 --> 17:28.320
And I think that's actually really nice.

17:28.320 --> 17:32.800
Well, I think that that recording of me saying hello, which just says something like, hello,

17:32.800 --> 17:38.600
I'm Quentin, pleased to meet you, is probably in an audio format that it's remarkable still

17:38.600 --> 17:39.920
plays on most browsers.

17:39.920 --> 17:45.320
Because I think I recorded it on my spark station back in about, you know, certainly

17:45.320 --> 17:48.120
not this millennium anyway.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.760
Back when not all browsers could play audio.

17:50.760 --> 17:54.880
And if you actually had one that could, then you could hear me say hello.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.300
Pretty exciting.

17:56.300 --> 18:01.720
That I think gives a sense that you've, let's just say, you've been around, you've seen

18:01.720 --> 18:02.720
some history.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.720
That's pretty interesting.

18:03.720 --> 18:04.720
I'm really old.

18:04.720 --> 18:05.720
That's a nice way of saying yes.

18:05.720 --> 18:08.480
Seasoned, perhaps is a nice way to put it.

18:08.480 --> 18:09.480
That's good.

18:09.480 --> 18:10.480
I like that.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.440
But the early web, you know, for me, I'm slightly younger than you.

18:13.440 --> 18:20.360
For me, the early web, in my perspective, was dial up internet and the pains and beauties

18:20.360 --> 18:24.800
of that, you know, having a home PC was a big thing.

18:24.800 --> 18:30.340
Actually, the first computer I used was Commodore 64 that my father purchased that was quite

18:30.340 --> 18:31.340
old at the time.

18:31.340 --> 18:36.360
And, you know, he forced us to use the spreadsheet there for he would give us an allowance and

18:36.360 --> 18:37.360
we would tabulate.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.320
A man with foresight, clearly.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.320
Yeah.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.320
Yeah.

18:41.320 --> 18:44.480
So that's, you know, my early history of, you know, five and a half inch floppy disks.

18:44.480 --> 18:49.040
But you've seen a little bit before that, which really fascinates me.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.080
Well, yeah, yeah, a little bit.

18:51.080 --> 18:57.800
I mean, I do think that you and I have been very fortunate to grow up when we did, right?

18:57.800 --> 19:01.480
I think and be interested in technology.

19:01.480 --> 19:06.000
It's like, you know, growing up and being interested in cars at around the time of Henry

19:06.000 --> 19:07.520
Ford or whatever.

19:07.520 --> 19:12.600
But computing has happened so fast, and there's been all of these changes within a lifetime.

19:12.600 --> 19:19.080
I really did have to sort of solder my first computer together and I've gone from that

19:19.080 --> 19:23.120
in a very short period of time to something like, you know, the iPhones and iPads sitting

19:23.120 --> 19:26.200
on my desk are just so far away from that.

19:26.200 --> 19:30.200
And, you know, there aren't many fields, I think, in which you could have that exciting

19:30.200 --> 19:32.960
a change during your professional life.

19:32.960 --> 19:37.440
And so that being said, I'm curious, what was it about the computers?

19:37.440 --> 19:41.920
You know, you mentioned you soldered your own, yeah, maybe some pieces together.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.040
And some of us still do that these days, just for fun.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.040
Yeah, yeah.

19:45.040 --> 19:48.880
But you do it for fun, not necessarily, not because of necessity, though.

19:48.880 --> 19:49.880
Right.

19:49.880 --> 19:50.880
Not through necessity.

19:50.880 --> 19:51.880
Exactly.

19:51.880 --> 19:55.760
But I'm curious, what was it, you know, as a young Quentin, what was it that really grabbed

19:55.760 --> 19:58.600
you about this, this relatively new world?

19:58.600 --> 20:01.720
Oh, that's a really interesting question.

20:01.720 --> 20:08.720
I think, I mean, computers weren't new when I was young, in the sense that, you know,

20:08.720 --> 20:14.200
you saw them on television programs and things you saw, you may see them on the, the, you

20:14.200 --> 20:17.280
know, the deck of the Star, Starship Enterprise, but

20:17.280 --> 20:18.280
As you should.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.280
That's right.

20:19.280 --> 20:23.280
But, you know, I grew up just at the point where suddenly this was something my parents

20:23.280 --> 20:24.280
could afford.

20:24.280 --> 20:26.480
They could save up, but they could afford to give me one.

20:26.480 --> 20:31.600
And only a few years before that, I had used a computer, but it had been in a museum in

20:31.600 --> 20:34.960
London, you know, the Science Museum in London, not because it was an old thing, but the Science

20:34.960 --> 20:38.240
Museum in London has a lot of new stuff, as well as old stuff.

20:38.240 --> 20:42.000
And I remember when I first got my hands, actually, I was able to type at a keyboard

20:42.000 --> 20:46.640
and give an instruction to a computer, which was one of these things you'd only seen, you

20:46.640 --> 20:49.080
know, in sort of Hollywood movies up till then.

20:49.080 --> 20:54.360
And so that sudden shift to being something that you could sit in front of on the, you

20:54.360 --> 20:59.400
know, floor of your sitting room at home, and the only display we had was the television,

20:59.400 --> 21:02.640
we only had one television in the house, so nobody could watch TV while I was using my

21:02.640 --> 21:04.640
computer kind of thing.

21:04.640 --> 21:08.800
Again, it was all of a sudden this unknown world.

21:08.800 --> 21:13.160
I don't want to wax lyrical too early in this conversation, but I think that I've often

21:13.160 --> 21:20.800
thought that computer science, in some senses is almost the most creative subject, the most

21:20.800 --> 21:27.080
creative, almost art form, as it may be pushing it a bit, but you start when you're trying

21:27.080 --> 21:33.840
to solve something using computers, you start often just with a thought, you have a problem

21:33.840 --> 21:39.800
you want to solve, you have thoughts about how to do it, and you turn those thoughts

21:39.800 --> 21:45.240
into a solution to a problem, or maybe a game or maybe something beautiful, or maybe some

21:45.240 --> 21:52.440
but but in general, it's it's thought matter translated into something tangible, with possibly

21:52.440 --> 21:59.680
less sort of intervening stuff than than almost any other any other activity, I think it really

21:59.680 --> 22:01.920
is capturing thoughts.

22:01.920 --> 22:07.160
And anyway, that's what it felt like to me at the start, you know, they're just simple

22:07.160 --> 22:12.120
things like, I don't know, you want to make a picture of a cube rotate on the screen in

22:12.120 --> 22:16.040
front of you, you had to think about Oh, okay, so hang on, what's the coordinates of that

22:16.040 --> 22:17.040
going to be?

22:17.040 --> 22:21.560
Well, you want it rotated by this angle, so you have to work out the cosine of this angle

22:21.560 --> 22:27.120
and you know, and work out where the appropriate coordinates of this cube are going to be.

22:27.120 --> 22:30.240
And then it looks a bit funny, and you realise that's because you didn't include perspective.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.400
So you say, Oh, hang on, how does perspective work?

22:32.400 --> 22:37.060
And you know, it really was you built everything from scratch there, because when you turned

22:37.060 --> 22:41.280
your computer on, all you got was a flashing prompt at which you would have to type code.

22:41.280 --> 22:45.920
And so if you wanted this thing to do anything, you had to start being creative from the word

22:45.920 --> 22:46.920
go.

22:46.920 --> 22:51.120
And that's something, you know, that we've not largely lost in computers, we turn them

22:51.120 --> 22:54.280
on as a as a tool to do something.

22:54.280 --> 22:58.680
But you weren't forced to be creative the moment you turn it on, as you were in the

22:58.680 --> 22:59.680
past.

22:59.680 --> 23:02.800
And that's partly what the Raspberry Pi and things like that have tried to recapture,

23:02.800 --> 23:03.800
of course.

23:03.800 --> 23:10.640
Yeah, yeah, that that conversion from imagination into reality, and then just kind of exploring

23:10.640 --> 23:13.360
from there and seeing what's possible, right?

23:13.360 --> 23:14.360
Yes.

23:14.360 --> 23:18.240
And and, you know, in the past, if you wanted your computer to be able to interact with

23:18.240 --> 23:21.960
the real world, you did often have to plug things into the back and solder things together

23:21.960 --> 23:24.640
and make up the circuit boards yourself, and so on.

23:24.640 --> 23:30.560
And you know, the Raspberry Pi was started by friends of mine who felt that the computer

23:30.560 --> 23:34.200
science students that we were getting in the University at Cambridge, they were coming

23:34.200 --> 23:38.400
in with actually much less experience now than they had had in the past, because in

23:38.400 --> 23:43.600
the past, you to use computers, you sort of had to be an enthusiast.

23:43.600 --> 23:47.440
Whereas now people were coming in just thinking, oh, computers might be interesting to learn

23:47.440 --> 23:52.780
about, but they hadn't gone through that process of having to understand it so much before

23:52.780 --> 23:54.240
you could even use it.

23:54.240 --> 23:59.760
And so the idea of the Raspberry Pi was actually to give you a much more basic computer that

23:59.760 --> 24:04.360
really didn't do very much for you out of the you know, when you plugged it in and turned

24:04.360 --> 24:05.360
it on.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.080
And you had to understand a bit more about it to accomplish anything.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.840
And that was quite deliberate.

24:09.840 --> 24:14.320
The hardware is quite capable of running all sorts of stuff, and they could have provided

24:14.320 --> 24:16.480
you with a very slick experience out of the box.

24:16.480 --> 24:20.880
But part of the idea was no, actually, you need to understand that how power supplies

24:20.880 --> 24:25.840
work, and how to write code and so on, and how operating systems boot up and so on to

24:25.840 --> 24:28.200
a much greater degree to be able to use one of them.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.520
And I think that's part of why it's been such a success.

24:30.520 --> 24:35.000
You know, you mentioned you had to be an enthusiast previously to really get into computers.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.420
It seems almost the opposite these days, in that we all use computers in our everyday

24:39.420 --> 24:44.440
lives from phones to, you know, everything else, really, to your car even.

24:44.440 --> 24:50.640
And yet, the enthusiasts are the one going to these simpler machines like Raspberry Pis

24:50.640 --> 24:52.480
and the single board computers and such.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.680
And so it's almost feels like a reversal to me, which is really fascinating.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.400
Yes, I think that's probably right.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.840
It's almost more like, you know, everybody drives a car.

24:59.840 --> 25:03.640
So if you're an enthusiast, you get a classic car, or you build a car yourself, or you,

25:03.640 --> 25:08.760
you know, put beds in your car, and you have a camper van or whatever it may be, right?

25:08.760 --> 25:13.400
When something becomes a commodity, then you need to find a new spin on it.

25:13.400 --> 25:18.120
And that may be using computers to automate your home, or it may be, you know, just actually

25:18.120 --> 25:24.760
turning on a computer and, you know, sending an email with it is not something that, well,

25:24.760 --> 25:27.080
it's less of an adventure than it used to be.

25:27.080 --> 25:28.920
So we find other things to do, right?

25:28.920 --> 25:29.920
For sure.

25:29.920 --> 25:30.920
Right.

25:30.920 --> 25:31.920
And because everybody does it, right?

25:31.920 --> 25:36.320
You want to find your own niche, or you want to, you want to, if you want to make a difference

25:36.320 --> 25:40.440
to the world, or even just a difference to your local bit of the world, you have to do

25:40.440 --> 25:42.600
something different from what everybody else is doing.

25:42.600 --> 25:45.760
So I think that's part of part of the appeal.

25:45.760 --> 25:51.720
You know, part of what has worried me in the past has been exploring the idea that maybe

25:51.720 --> 25:55.680
we've gotten to the point where computers have done all the things that humanity needs

25:55.680 --> 25:57.040
them to do.

25:57.040 --> 26:01.360
And yet, when I reflect on that, just slightly more, especially in the context of you mentioning

26:01.360 --> 26:07.520
it as quite an art form, I think, well, no, we're, we're really just started, aren't we?

26:07.520 --> 26:11.640
Like, certainly, computers have taken us to the moon, and there's all sorts of things

26:11.640 --> 26:13.680
on other planets now.

26:13.680 --> 26:17.840
And yet, I think in some ways, we're just started, like, there's, do you feel like there's

26:17.840 --> 26:21.200
a lot more possibility there in this this realm?

26:21.200 --> 26:24.680
Yes, I think I think there is a great deal more.

26:24.680 --> 26:31.260
But I think, I think the rapid acceleration at the start of computing has it sort of tails

26:31.260 --> 26:32.720
off for a while.

26:32.720 --> 26:38.080
I think actually, the analogy with cars is is kind of interesting here, because between

26:38.080 --> 26:43.320
school and college, I worked for a car firm, you know, just for a year and a half for Austin

26:43.320 --> 26:46.480
Rover cars, as they were then.

26:46.480 --> 26:52.000
And it was, you know, it was a useful experience of industry, but it wasn't at all sexy.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.360
There was nothing about, you know, nothing about it that made me want to carry on doing

26:55.360 --> 26:57.480
this after I finished as a student and so on.

26:57.480 --> 27:02.280
I thought that, you know, essentially, cars had become dull, and, you know, nothing really

27:02.280 --> 27:08.440
new was happening with them, and hadn't really happened for, you know, 50 or 100 years.

27:08.440 --> 27:12.960
And then all of a sudden, you know, a few years ago, I got into doing stuff related

27:12.960 --> 27:19.480
to cars again, because you had this combination of electric vehicles, which were completely

27:19.480 --> 27:24.800
changing how cars were and could be built, and what they were like to drive, and so on.

27:24.800 --> 27:30.800
And you had this whole idea of autonomous vehicles, self driving cars, which, again,

27:30.800 --> 27:36.760
was very interesting technologically, car companies were having to become, you know,

27:36.760 --> 27:37.760
software companies.

27:37.760 --> 27:44.140
But also, you know, the whole shape of a vehicle, what does it what does a car look like?

27:44.140 --> 27:45.140
Does it have to be?

27:45.140 --> 27:49.760
Do you have to have everybody facing forwards, you know, if the car can drive itself?

27:49.760 --> 27:54.440
And all of these sort of things are thrown open for innovation again.

27:54.440 --> 27:59.040
We have vehicles that are bigger and smaller and quieter and, you know, different shapes

27:59.040 --> 28:05.640
and so on in a way that so much has been defined in the past by the basic shape of an internal

28:05.640 --> 28:10.240
combustion engine and four wheels and a gearbox and so on.

28:10.240 --> 28:15.280
And I think we're at a very exciting time now to be in the automobile industry, which,

28:15.280 --> 28:20.160
again, we haven't really had, I don't think I mean, what's changed before before this

28:20.160 --> 28:21.720
advent of electric vehicles?

28:21.720 --> 28:24.320
What's changed in the last five decades?

28:24.320 --> 28:25.560
You know, very, very little.

28:25.560 --> 28:31.520
Yeah, I think four wheel drive or all wheel drive in rally racing was really a huge innovation.

28:31.520 --> 28:34.960
But even that's quite mechanical, right?

28:34.960 --> 28:38.040
But it didn't it didn't fundamentally change the shape of cars.

28:38.040 --> 28:43.780
I mean, I guess you could say automatic automatic gearboxes, sure, sure, you know, which some

28:43.780 --> 28:48.880
people still aren't keen on, you know, so there have been various small innovations.

28:48.880 --> 28:54.320
But I still don't know how much I buy the dream of fully self driving vehicles.

28:54.320 --> 28:59.440
But it seems to me that if we even get close to that, then the way we think of and use

28:59.440 --> 29:03.200
cars could be completely different.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.160
And I have some examples I like giving of this.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.320
I mean, the thing I'm almost most exciting.

29:07.320 --> 29:13.560
I know you've done a lot of stuff with RVs in Jupiter, and, or camper vans.

29:13.560 --> 29:18.720
And I've always thought that what I really want is a self driving camper van or motor

29:18.720 --> 29:25.400
home RV, one where in the evening I could, you know, I don't have enough space to, to

29:25.400 --> 29:29.880
park it here, but I could summon it from its out of town parking area.

29:29.880 --> 29:33.680
And it would turn up at the doorstep and I would get in with my dog and my wife and a

29:33.680 --> 29:35.840
nice bottle of wine and a good movie.

29:35.840 --> 29:42.080
And I would say, Oh, Chamonix, please Chamonix being in the French Alps, and we'd wake up

29:42.080 --> 29:46.480
in the morning, you know, hundreds of miles away, you might not want to drive a big RV

29:46.480 --> 29:49.320
around when you when you got there, but that's all right, because you could just tell your

29:49.320 --> 29:52.120
car to follow you.

29:52.120 --> 29:55.940
And so you could wake up the following morning and take your dog for a walk in a different

29:55.940 --> 29:59.920
country having slept through the travel process.

29:59.920 --> 30:06.680
Or another example I like to give is, I'd really like a self driving car for when I'm

30:06.680 --> 30:07.680
walking.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.560
Tell me more.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.040
So I like hiking, right?

30:11.040 --> 30:18.040
And so much of certainly here, so much of going for a walk involves finding a nice place

30:18.040 --> 30:23.760
to park and doing a circular route, which brings you back to your car again.

30:23.760 --> 30:29.480
And what about if you're driving along a road and you see a beautiful view and you say,

30:29.480 --> 30:32.480
Hey, car stop here, let me out.

30:32.480 --> 30:36.560
And you just get out and the car carries on and you walk over the fields and you walk

30:36.560 --> 30:41.340
over the hills and you cross the rivers and at some point, which you don't have to decide

30:41.340 --> 30:45.680
in advance when you get tired, you meet up with your car again, and you have a comfy

30:45.680 --> 30:47.040
chair to take you home.

30:47.040 --> 30:51.960
But you know, the fact that you leave your car in one place and have to return to it

30:51.960 --> 30:55.840
in the same place again is something that you know, is perhaps an artifact of the past.

30:55.840 --> 31:00.080
And maybe in the future, people will say, what, you always had to do sort of circular

31:00.080 --> 31:01.940
walks to get back to your transport?

31:01.940 --> 31:04.440
That's crazy.

31:04.440 --> 31:10.160
And so yeah, it'll be really interesting to see in, I think, in, you know, five decades

31:10.160 --> 31:15.560
time, people may have a very different view of transport from what we have compared to

31:15.560 --> 31:18.040
the five decades, you know, ago, right?

31:18.040 --> 31:19.400
What was happening in the 60s?

31:19.400 --> 31:25.680
Well, you know, the cars weren't really fundamentally that, not in that kind of way, but that different

31:25.680 --> 31:27.680
from much the same, right?

31:27.680 --> 31:28.680
Yeah.

31:28.680 --> 31:29.680
Yeah.

31:29.680 --> 31:36.160
Bitwarden.com slash Linux, get started with a free trial of teams or enterprise plans

31:36.160 --> 31:41.160
at Bitwarden.com slash Linux, or try it for free as an individual user.

31:41.160 --> 31:44.600
Bitwarden is just the easiest way for an individual or for a business to store, share and sync

31:44.600 --> 31:46.600
sensitive data.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.180
Bitwarden is fully open source, trusted by millions of users.

31:49.180 --> 31:50.180
You know, we trust it.

31:50.180 --> 31:51.780
You guys know we use it as our password manager.

31:51.780 --> 31:55.600
You know that part of what made me choose that is Bitwarden's open source is what Weston

31:55.600 --> 31:59.440
I used to manage our passwords, our two factor codes and other sensitive data.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.980
And we're finally getting Brent on board, too.

32:01.980 --> 32:03.940
You know, we've achieved something there.

32:03.940 --> 32:06.420
And I love the support that Bitwarden offers.

32:06.420 --> 32:09.720
If you get stuck, if you have a family member or friend that you recommended to Bitwarden,

32:09.720 --> 32:10.960
they got you covered there.

32:10.960 --> 32:13.360
On top of that, they're always rolling out new features.

32:13.360 --> 32:16.160
They just added a new quick account switcher to Android.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.960
This is absolute fire, you guys.

32:17.960 --> 32:21.360
You're sitting there trying to fill out a password, oh crap, that's a business log in,

32:21.360 --> 32:22.360
not a personal log in.

32:22.360 --> 32:23.360
Oh, you know what?

32:23.360 --> 32:24.640
Tap an icon, switch over to the other account.

32:24.640 --> 32:25.640
Boom.

32:25.640 --> 32:26.640
Now you're filling that out.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.560
They've recently introduced a new username generator.

32:28.560 --> 32:32.120
So that way you're using a unique username and a unique password when you're signing

32:32.120 --> 32:34.480
up for a site or a service.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.980
Man, is that not super great?

32:36.980 --> 32:42.680
And they've also now begun working with certain email relay services like Firefox Relay or

32:42.680 --> 32:44.740
a non Addy or simple login or more.

32:44.740 --> 32:47.140
You can just put in your API key.

32:47.140 --> 32:50.560
And then when you go create an account now to service, you know, like an app or a website

32:50.560 --> 32:53.340
or whatever, it'll generate the password.

32:53.340 --> 32:56.800
It'll generate the username and it'll give them a unique email address and it makes sure

32:56.800 --> 32:57.800
you get all that stuff.

32:57.800 --> 33:01.160
You keep track of all that stuff and it all still gets back to you.

33:01.160 --> 33:04.140
That right there, killer feature right there.

33:04.140 --> 33:08.940
And you guys know this, but maybe someone you know, maybe a family, a friend, maybe

33:08.940 --> 33:14.240
the place you work, maybe they really haven't gotten the religion of good password hygiene.

33:14.240 --> 33:19.180
And I just, I got to just say, like, there are so many things you could do, but there's

33:19.180 --> 33:23.300
really one thing you must do to protect yourself online and that is using a unique password

33:23.300 --> 33:26.300
at every website, every service, every app.

33:26.300 --> 33:29.980
And now you can combine that with a unique username and a unique email address and keep

33:29.980 --> 33:33.040
it all in Bitwarden and get access to it super quick.

33:33.040 --> 33:35.360
On my iPhone, I have it set up with face ID.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.900
So when it's time to fill out a password, I pull my phone up, it scans my damn face,

33:38.900 --> 33:39.900
puts it right in there.

33:39.900 --> 33:40.900
Boom.

33:40.900 --> 33:41.900
You know what?

33:41.900 --> 33:42.900
Next thing you know, I've unlocked the site or whatever.

33:42.900 --> 33:43.900
It's so easy.

33:43.900 --> 33:44.900
I can't believe people aren't doing it all the time.

33:44.900 --> 33:49.500
I feel like I want to like parachute down and give people Bitwarden to save them from

33:49.500 --> 33:52.620
some password mess they're probably living in.

33:52.620 --> 33:55.380
Maybe it'd just be easier if everybody went to Bitwarden.com slash Linux and tried it

33:55.380 --> 33:57.900
out for themselves or your business.

33:57.900 --> 34:01.840
You know, maybe you got an open source team that could use some good password hygiene.

34:01.840 --> 34:06.220
Any of that, go try it out, share it with a friend, tell somebody about it and support

34:06.220 --> 34:07.220
the show.

34:07.220 --> 34:10.220
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

34:10.220 --> 34:15.940
I'd like to say thank you so much to Quentin.

34:15.940 --> 34:17.300
We had a great chat.

34:17.300 --> 34:23.340
He joined me on a Friday evening with some sherry in hand, and as you might imagine,

34:23.340 --> 34:27.180
that ended up going to a bunch of fascinating topics together.

34:27.180 --> 34:33.500
A topic we touched on was how the patent system compares to the open source approach, which

34:33.500 --> 34:35.560
was really great exploration.

34:35.560 --> 34:40.260
The origins of the T9 mobile phone keyboard system, which his friend Martin basically

34:40.260 --> 34:46.100
invented, and they co-founded another business together because of that.

34:46.100 --> 34:51.420
We talk about how keyboards are archaic and how that tech just won't let go, and some

34:51.420 --> 34:52.780
early computer vision stuff.

34:52.780 --> 35:00.740
So if you want to have a listen to more than just that excerpt, please go to extras.show.

35:00.740 --> 35:06.160
There's a Brunch with Brent with Quentin there, and there may even be more coming in the future.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.160
Quite the tease.

35:07.160 --> 35:12.900
Now, Chris, we did get a lot of feedback on the Intel situation, which I think we should

35:12.900 --> 35:14.020
recap here.

35:14.020 --> 35:18.220
So could you give us a little brief recap, and then we'll jump into some great ideas

35:18.220 --> 35:19.220
around our feedback?

35:19.220 --> 35:20.220
Yeah.

35:20.220 --> 35:25.140
So on a recent episode of Linux Unplugged and Linux Action News, we talked about the

35:25.140 --> 35:32.300
upcoming Intel's software-defined CPUs and the fact that support for licensing and enabling

35:32.300 --> 35:37.500
the software-defined features in a CPU landed in Linux 5.18, and we kind of had a discussion

35:37.500 --> 35:43.740
if we thought that was how we felt about the idea that you'd buy a CPU and it has all these

35:43.740 --> 35:46.820
features, but perhaps they're locked behind a license file.

35:46.820 --> 35:51.980
And in there, we discussed that in terms of implementation, there's essentially two new

35:51.980 --> 35:58.260
devices or spots on the file system that get created by this, one that defines the features

35:58.260 --> 36:03.460
and one that defines the license that enables them or not, roughly speaking.

36:03.460 --> 36:07.520
This has provoked a lot of discussion with our audience, and I think we have continued

36:07.520 --> 36:12.020
to get feedback about that, and so we just wanted to cover some of it and just recap

36:12.020 --> 36:15.460
so that way everybody knew what we were talking about since it's been a few weeks now.

36:15.460 --> 36:22.260
Yeah, Jan wrote in with some great insights into current licensing practices of Intel.

36:22.260 --> 36:27.660
Jan writes, just listen to episode 4.6.0 of Linux Unplugged and want to let you know some

36:27.660 --> 36:30.020
stuff about CPU licensing.

36:30.020 --> 36:36.260
Intel has done this in the past with its Itanium lineup, which has died meanwhile.

36:36.260 --> 36:43.060
It's also a very common thing on IBM's ZOS mainframes, where you basically buy CPU time,

36:43.060 --> 36:48.240
even though you might have more CPUs installed physically in your box to run them on.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.540
This does allow certain features.

36:50.540 --> 36:56.020
You only pay X, and if you really do need the extra performance, say for a month, you

36:56.020 --> 37:00.420
can get a temporary license, run the extra workload, and switch it off again for the

37:00.420 --> 37:01.420
old price point.

37:01.420 --> 37:07.500
I see a valid user case in the enterprise world, but for consumers, I do hope it doesn't

37:07.500 --> 37:09.140
come to bite us in the butt.

37:09.140 --> 37:12.940
Yeah, I think the most compelling argument I have heard has been, how does it affect

37:12.940 --> 37:13.940
resale?

37:13.940 --> 37:18.540
And we've been trying to figure out how that would work, like if you wipe an OS.

37:18.540 --> 37:23.980
The insight that I kind of noticed here in James's email is, it does seem like the customer

37:23.980 --> 37:28.500
activates it somehow with Intel servers in the previous system.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.940
So maybe that exact infrastructure would be used.

37:31.940 --> 37:35.940
Something similar, same infrastructure, same plan of attack.

37:35.940 --> 37:39.340
I have been surprised the way they're handling all of this.

37:39.340 --> 37:45.140
In terms of a company that is getting eaten on both ends by both AMD and by Apple right

37:45.140 --> 37:48.420
now, you'd think they'd be on their messaging game.

37:48.420 --> 37:49.420
You'd think they'd be out there.

37:49.420 --> 37:52.420
I can't even really tell you the benefits of the 12th gen Intel.

37:52.420 --> 37:56.040
I know they're more power efficient, but I can't really articulate them.

37:56.040 --> 38:02.060
I don't know what their reasoning is, or positioning is, or what they claim the use case is for

38:02.060 --> 38:03.220
the software defined features.

38:03.220 --> 38:04.220
I mean, I've heard some of it.

38:04.220 --> 38:08.520
If we didn't follow mailing list news about the kernel, we probably wouldn't even be talking

38:08.520 --> 38:09.520
about this right now.

38:09.520 --> 38:10.700
That's just it, right?

38:10.700 --> 38:11.980
It's really weird.

38:11.980 --> 38:17.780
I know we have listeners at Intel, and they're not trying to get us the download information

38:17.780 --> 38:18.780
or nothing like that.

38:18.780 --> 38:24.460
It's like they're just not talking about it, other than the very manufactured bits of information

38:24.460 --> 38:25.460
we have gotten so far.

38:25.460 --> 38:26.460
Small blurbs and such.

38:26.460 --> 38:27.460
Yeah.

38:27.460 --> 38:28.460
But we'll follow it.

38:28.460 --> 38:30.620
And I think we'll keep reading your feedback on it.

38:30.620 --> 38:36.900
So do keep sending it to linuxunplug.com contact because I think it's going to be a big deal,

38:36.900 --> 38:37.900
but it's just not there yet.

38:37.900 --> 38:39.660
And I think we have a little bit of time.

38:39.660 --> 38:44.100
So I'd love to understand it before it actually arrives.

38:44.100 --> 38:47.540
And now it is time for the boost.

38:47.540 --> 38:50.860
Now for Chris's favorite part of the show, where he gets to wake up in the morning and

38:50.860 --> 38:52.220
read all your boosts.

38:52.220 --> 38:56.300
Marcel wrote in again five days ago with 1,969 sats.

38:56.300 --> 39:00.940
Chris, have you figured this one out yet?

39:00.940 --> 39:01.940
1969.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.420
Well, the message gives this one away.

39:03.420 --> 39:08.140
I was thinking of the year, but actually I picked this number because of the song.

39:08.140 --> 39:10.420
Mostly I just like picking random numbers to hear Chris guess.

39:10.420 --> 39:11.660
I love making you guess too.

39:11.660 --> 39:12.660
I'm down for that actually.

39:12.660 --> 39:13.700
I do enjoy it.

39:13.700 --> 39:14.700
It's actually-

39:14.700 --> 39:16.700
That's what you get for your boost fee.

39:16.700 --> 39:18.320
I do actually like it.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.220
I think you might have to guess some more down the line here.

39:21.220 --> 39:23.040
Yeah, it looks like it.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.220
We did get a boost in from Koss Peeland.

39:25.220 --> 39:30.580
You know, also just aside, Koss has been supporting a lot of podcasting 2.0 compatible that take

39:30.580 --> 39:31.580
the boosts.

39:31.580 --> 39:36.060
And that's one of the really cool things about this community is sometimes I'm listening

39:36.060 --> 39:39.620
to a completely different podcast and a totally different genre.

39:39.620 --> 39:42.980
And I hear some of these same names come up and you guys are really the rock stars out

39:42.980 --> 39:43.980
there.

39:43.980 --> 39:44.980
So thank you so much.

39:44.980 --> 39:47.780
So Koss writes in there, thanks for the show and the Seuss adventures.

39:47.780 --> 39:50.020
Brent, why don't you give us an update?

39:50.020 --> 39:51.140
How did the Seuss stuff go?

39:51.140 --> 39:52.900
Did you end up sticking with Seuss?

39:52.900 --> 39:54.100
Did you do something different?

39:54.100 --> 39:55.100
What's the story?

39:55.100 --> 40:00.620
Well, I ended up deciding to keep it on this podcasting appliance laptop that I have here

40:00.620 --> 40:04.540
because I'm just curious how it's going to go even more long term.

40:04.540 --> 40:09.940
I know that I gave you sort of the six month update or maybe that was more like eight months.

40:09.940 --> 40:12.620
And I think we should give it another six months.

40:12.620 --> 40:14.220
So far, so good.

40:14.220 --> 40:16.660
Things look like they've improved for me.

40:16.660 --> 40:19.220
The applications that weren't working are working just fine.

40:19.220 --> 40:24.240
There is one little lingering package that hasn't solved itself, but maybe I'll get inspired

40:24.240 --> 40:26.540
and fix that or maybe it'll just vanish.

40:26.540 --> 40:27.540
We'll see.

40:27.540 --> 40:30.220
Is this the machine I'm seeing you on or is this the machine I'm hearing you on?

40:30.220 --> 40:32.500
Yeah, the one right in front of you.

40:32.500 --> 40:36.860
So the one I'm hearing you on, though, that is a new Fedora install that's using pipewire

40:36.860 --> 40:37.860
now.

40:37.860 --> 40:43.680
Yeah, just recently I threw Fedora on there because you almost didn't give me a choice

40:43.680 --> 40:50.380
and we wanted to try pipewire in the in our whole audio sort of pipeline.

40:50.380 --> 40:52.020
Maybe that's the appropriate way to say it.

40:52.020 --> 40:54.100
And so far, it's been working great.

40:54.100 --> 40:56.460
We haven't had the hiccups that we've had previously.

40:56.460 --> 41:01.540
I think pulse was just getting tired on my previous install and I think it's going to

41:01.540 --> 41:04.100
enable us to do a bunch of really fancy stuff.

41:04.100 --> 41:08.140
So I would love to hear from you guys what I should be throwing at really.

41:08.140 --> 41:11.940
Well, can I just say that this is one of the things I love about Linux and a lot of times

41:11.940 --> 41:15.620
we get pretty worked up about fragmentation and too much choice.

41:15.620 --> 41:22.420
But here you were with a pretty solid long time to install and you were having I mean

41:22.420 --> 41:27.940
during office hours, I think pulse crashed on you six times in that like two hour stream.

41:27.940 --> 41:33.120
You having problems, which, to be fair, was a relatively new behavior, right?

41:33.120 --> 41:35.380
Why it was happening, we didn't discover.

41:35.380 --> 41:40.900
But I proposed that it was possible because it was a new behavior and because it was happening

41:40.900 --> 41:45.280
more and more and more, I thought it was possible this was a hardware issue.

41:45.280 --> 41:49.300
And so I said, you know, I just want you to be prepared for you may switch distros and

41:49.300 --> 41:50.940
still have a problem.

41:50.940 --> 41:56.340
However, we have been live for three hours and 20 minutes at this point right now and

41:56.340 --> 41:59.220
you have not had a single audio server crash, right?

41:59.220 --> 42:00.220
Yeah, it's true.

42:00.220 --> 42:05.220
There was a moment earlier when you guys just weren't hearing me, but it turns out you had

42:05.220 --> 42:07.620
me muted and it wasn't anything on my end.

42:07.620 --> 42:11.900
So I got afraid there for a moment, but it turns out everything's fine.

42:11.900 --> 42:13.020
It's been really solid.

42:13.020 --> 42:20.260
And I you know, we've mentioned this before, pipeline has been sort of a dream of finding

42:20.260 --> 42:23.260
stability pretty quickly in a relatively new stack.

42:23.260 --> 42:28.740
And this is sort of proof in the pudding feels like we'll we'll see.

42:28.740 --> 42:31.620
I'll run it for a few more weeks and really battle test it.

42:31.620 --> 42:34.100
But I'm feeling pretty hopeful on this one.

42:34.100 --> 42:40.460
B O O S T crimson rabbit boosted in three days ago with 5000 sats.

42:40.460 --> 42:44.100
Is there any chance for Chris to come to London?

42:44.100 --> 42:46.620
I would donate more sats to the cause.

42:46.620 --> 42:47.620
Everyone else should too.

42:47.620 --> 42:48.620
Oh, man.

42:48.620 --> 42:50.980
We've all been called out by the rabbit over here.

42:50.980 --> 42:51.980
So

42:51.980 --> 42:52.980
Wow.

42:52.980 --> 42:53.980
Yeah.

42:53.980 --> 42:54.980
Okay.

42:54.980 --> 42:55.980
How do I how do I?

42:55.980 --> 42:56.980
Okay.

42:56.980 --> 42:57.980
I really want this to happen.

42:57.980 --> 42:58.980
I really do.

42:58.980 --> 43:01.120
But I would really like it if if it wasn't just me if it was also you guys.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.700
So there's that that that adds a layer of complexity.

43:03.700 --> 43:05.540
I acknowledge.

43:05.540 --> 43:09.380
But could you imagine if the three of us can all go to London together how fun that would

43:09.380 --> 43:10.380
be?

43:10.380 --> 43:11.380
Yeah, that would be fabulous.

43:11.380 --> 43:12.380
Really?

43:12.380 --> 43:13.380
Isn't that the way to do it?

43:13.380 --> 43:14.380
I've never been.

43:14.380 --> 43:15.380
Have you guys been?

43:15.380 --> 43:16.380
No.

43:16.380 --> 43:17.380
I've had I've had a layover in Heathrow.

43:17.380 --> 43:18.380
And that's about it.

43:18.380 --> 43:20.140
Yeah, I've been through Heathrow on my way to the Netherlands once.

43:20.140 --> 43:22.660
And that's not enough of London.

43:22.660 --> 43:25.100
I will admit I've never even been on a flight that long.

43:25.100 --> 43:27.540
That is I think I could rock it though, because I just did it.

43:27.540 --> 43:30.460
I did a six hour when I went to go visit Alex.

43:30.460 --> 43:31.460
Fine, man.

43:31.460 --> 43:32.460
Yeah.

43:32.460 --> 43:35.020
So I honestly will booze you up.

43:35.020 --> 43:36.020
We'll get you some good headphones.

43:36.020 --> 43:37.020
You'll be fine.

43:37.020 --> 43:39.900
One of my core skill sets is sitting on my ass all day.

43:39.900 --> 43:42.260
And like it turns out I can do that in front of a computer.

43:42.260 --> 43:43.260
I can do it on an airplane.

43:43.260 --> 43:45.980
So you know, like I was good.

43:45.980 --> 43:51.580
You know, Chris, the transcontinental airline experience is a whole upgrade compared to

43:51.580 --> 43:52.800
this domestic stuff.

43:52.800 --> 43:57.300
So I feel I feel like you're in for a treat.

43:57.300 --> 43:58.520
I need the experience.

43:58.520 --> 44:01.700
Like I feel like that's a box check for sure make Brent meet us here, right?

44:01.700 --> 44:03.940
So then we could just like get the whole road to ourselves.

44:03.940 --> 44:04.940
Yeah.

44:04.940 --> 44:05.940
Oh, yeah.

44:05.940 --> 44:06.940
This year is not going to work for me.

44:06.940 --> 44:10.060
Just like, you know, costs are super high at the moment.

44:10.060 --> 44:13.300
We have a road trip planned for like mid September.

44:13.300 --> 44:14.780
We got a couple other things planned.

44:14.780 --> 44:17.940
And so like, I budgeted right and I really can't go beyond that this year.

44:17.940 --> 44:19.580
I really have to be careful.

44:19.580 --> 44:25.260
But I would very, very, very much like to try to make this happen in 2023.

44:25.260 --> 44:29.580
And the fact that we're going to have a meet up in August.

44:29.580 --> 44:32.540
It's right now it's about 80 people, but I'm sure it'll be 100 by the time the meet

44:32.540 --> 44:33.540
early.

44:33.540 --> 44:34.540
Yeah.

44:34.540 --> 44:35.620
That is great.

44:35.620 --> 44:38.760
Because I want to try to do North Carolina more often, too.

44:38.760 --> 44:43.180
We went down to North Carolina and I realized we had, you know, 200 person crew down there

44:43.180 --> 44:47.360
that is willing to do meet ups with us and they were awesome indeed.

44:47.360 --> 44:50.740
So I think we may get that signal from this London meet up too.

44:50.740 --> 44:54.840
And then we can kind of start to plan and it's funny, you know, it's one of those things

44:54.840 --> 44:57.420
where it just kind of builds incrementally.

44:57.420 --> 45:00.860
And a lot of times it starts with the community as far as I know.

45:00.860 --> 45:05.220
This started as a conversation in Discord between Alex and self-hosted community members.

45:05.220 --> 45:06.220
That's great.

45:06.220 --> 45:07.220
It really is.

45:07.220 --> 45:11.500
You know, Chris, for this year, are you willing to ship a cardboard cutout of yourself with

45:11.500 --> 45:14.780
maybe a Raspberry Pi with a speaker and a microphone?

45:14.780 --> 45:15.780
I like that.

45:15.780 --> 45:16.780
That's a nice.

45:16.780 --> 45:17.780
Good work.

45:17.780 --> 45:18.780
I like the whole Raspberry Pi aspect to it.

45:18.780 --> 45:20.780
That that would be a fun project for the show.

45:20.780 --> 45:21.780
Let's be honest.

45:21.780 --> 45:22.780
Come on.

45:22.780 --> 45:23.780
A little speaker right in my mouth.

45:23.780 --> 45:24.780
I'll just like, you know.

45:24.780 --> 45:27.040
I mean, we're about to have one.

45:27.040 --> 45:28.040
That's true.

45:28.040 --> 45:29.140
That is true.

45:29.140 --> 45:31.240
User seventy four twenty three boosted in.

45:31.240 --> 45:33.540
That's usually when they're when it's like a number like that.

45:33.540 --> 45:36.420
It's just they haven't set their profile in Fountain.

45:36.420 --> 45:37.940
They boosted with a thousand sats.

45:37.940 --> 45:41.400
Hey, have you guys checked out the Nix Bitcoin node?

45:41.400 --> 45:43.340
And also you guys are the best, Jimmy.

45:43.340 --> 45:45.080
I had no idea this was a thing.

45:45.080 --> 45:46.080
Please inform us.

45:46.080 --> 45:51.900
I think Wes knows this, but this is how we started talking about Nix again.

45:51.900 --> 45:55.860
Wes and I were trying to figure out when to do our next Nix segment.

45:55.860 --> 45:57.340
What do you think, Wes?

45:57.340 --> 45:58.340
Five years?

45:58.340 --> 45:59.340
It's been a long time.

45:59.340 --> 46:00.940
I mean, four or five years.

46:00.940 --> 46:03.700
Yeah, at least we've been trying to figure out when we're going to do Nix.

46:03.700 --> 46:06.500
I know it was before the Linux Academy acquisition.

46:06.500 --> 46:09.700
Yeah, it's been a really definitely during that time.

46:09.700 --> 46:10.700
Yeah.

46:10.700 --> 46:11.700
During that time.

46:11.700 --> 46:12.700
And now after.

46:12.700 --> 46:15.340
And it's like how all this stuff works, right?

46:15.340 --> 46:18.100
It's not until you have a project.

46:18.100 --> 46:19.100
And you actually try it.

46:19.100 --> 46:20.100
It's like Reaper, right?

46:20.100 --> 46:21.100
Some stakes on the line.

46:21.100 --> 46:22.100
Right.

46:22.100 --> 46:23.100
It's like switching audio editors.

46:23.100 --> 46:27.220
We couldn't really take Reaper seriously until we had a new project where we could just try

46:27.220 --> 46:28.980
starting from scratch in Reaper.

46:28.980 --> 46:37.620
Well, this is how I came to Nix is the Bitcoin node stuff, because I am a huge nerd for decentralized

46:37.620 --> 46:38.620
computing.

46:38.620 --> 46:39.760
Just frickin love it.

46:39.760 --> 46:45.320
And they have a really good like Nix Bitcoin node package that you can just get going.

46:45.320 --> 46:46.720
And it's solid.

46:46.720 --> 46:50.940
And now that I'm really into the boost and all this stuff, I kind of think maybe I should

46:50.940 --> 46:52.320
have gone that route.

46:52.320 --> 46:55.260
But I ended up going Umbral just because I was trying a bunch of different stuff and

46:55.260 --> 46:56.740
Umbral got me going so fast.

46:56.740 --> 46:58.320
That's just what we stuck with.

46:58.320 --> 46:59.320
But it's a pretty cool project.

46:59.320 --> 47:00.320
Yeah.

47:00.320 --> 47:01.320
You know, you can see something.

47:01.320 --> 47:04.980
Maybe if you redid some stuff or wanted a little more robust of a setup or something

47:04.980 --> 47:07.640
for the long term, more minimal could be a great option.

47:07.640 --> 47:11.980
That's kind of what I think is there probably will be a point, maybe not.

47:11.980 --> 47:12.980
Maybe I won't ever need to.

47:12.980 --> 47:19.060
But there may be a point where I migrate to a more robust Nix based Bitcoin node, maybe

47:19.060 --> 47:23.780
on, you know, more robust hardware and stuff like that, because this is this is running

47:23.780 --> 47:30.300
on a older Dell, but it's a really nice high end like Xeon ECC memory, older Dell.

47:30.300 --> 47:33.120
And it's running on Ubuntu 20.04.

47:33.120 --> 47:34.120
And those are all fine.

47:34.120 --> 47:35.120
Right.

47:35.120 --> 47:37.940
Those are all fine things, but not really how I would probably do it today.

47:37.940 --> 47:39.940
So it's in the back of my mind.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.860
I have a follow up question there.

47:41.860 --> 47:44.940
I'm curious if you know what it's doing under the hood.

47:44.940 --> 47:50.420
Is this some Docker containers, the same kind of ideas Umbral under the hood, or is it just

47:50.420 --> 47:51.420
doing it natively?

47:51.420 --> 47:52.420
Wes, have you dug into this?

47:52.420 --> 47:53.420
That's a great question.

47:53.420 --> 47:54.860
No, I haven't actually looked at the implementation.

47:54.860 --> 47:58.660
I seem to recall it's Podman when it does use containers.

47:58.660 --> 48:01.740
But typically with these next stuff, there's really, you know, the beautiful thing is you

48:01.740 --> 48:02.740
don't really need a container.

48:02.740 --> 48:03.740
Right.

48:03.740 --> 48:04.940
And that was the route I was going.

48:04.940 --> 48:10.140
I was really trying to I was I have been thinking more and more about container free infrastructure.

48:10.140 --> 48:12.500
And I think that's how I ended up at the next node stuff.

48:12.500 --> 48:17.100
Yeah, it does look like a lot of just stuff all packaged up some extra modules and options

48:17.100 --> 48:18.100
in here.

48:18.100 --> 48:21.620
Well, Brent, I think maybe you'll just have to try it and play with it.

48:21.620 --> 48:23.380
I might be the best way to find out.

48:23.380 --> 48:24.860
Oh, I saw that coming.

48:24.860 --> 48:25.860
I saw that.

48:25.860 --> 48:28.420
Sounds like I'll have some extra laptops laying around.

48:28.420 --> 48:30.420
I could just throw this on.

48:30.420 --> 48:31.420
We'll see.

48:31.420 --> 48:32.420
All right.

48:32.420 --> 48:36.900
We have a special pick this week because it's a news relevant pick.

48:36.900 --> 48:42.220
This is a release, one of those special releases that's been in the works for a year.

48:42.220 --> 48:50.140
Jellyfin 10.8.0 has been released, a unusually long development cycle for Jellyfin, a bunch

48:50.140 --> 48:51.700
of GPU acceleration stuff.

48:51.700 --> 48:52.700
Yeah.

48:52.700 --> 48:55.460
I know you've been over there trying to get your personal Jellyfin server upgraded.

48:55.460 --> 48:56.460
How'd it go?

48:56.460 --> 48:57.460
Just fine.

48:57.460 --> 49:01.060
Back up and operational, pulled down the new Docker image, restarted it.

49:01.060 --> 49:03.300
And yeah, now I'm back to watching TV.

49:03.300 --> 49:07.580
And it's exciting because a while ago we tried out that new like watch together sync play

49:07.580 --> 49:08.580
stuff.

49:08.580 --> 49:09.740
That's seen a lot of fixes in this.

49:09.740 --> 49:13.860
If you use DLNA, that's got a bunch of nice fixes, all kinds of streaming fixes.

49:13.860 --> 49:17.860
And then yeah, as you mentioned, the hardware acceleration story just gets better and better.

49:17.860 --> 49:22.060
Plus if you have it like trying to read from like a plain folder setup or you got info

49:22.060 --> 49:25.420
files, that's a whole bunch better for parsing and integrating with that better subtitle

49:25.420 --> 49:28.500
stuff all around a lot of nice things to see.

49:28.500 --> 49:30.460
And yeah, it shouldn't be a big issue to upgrade.

49:30.460 --> 49:32.580
I think you'd probably agree with this statement.

49:32.580 --> 49:38.140
So you know, who knows, but I feel like we've reached that inflection point where the trend

49:38.140 --> 49:44.340
line on Jellyfin and its rate of improvement is like greater than Plexus, right?

49:44.340 --> 49:47.180
And Plexus is kind of on a little bit of the decline.

49:47.180 --> 49:52.500
I say that with a lot of respect for Plex, but I think as they try to establish a business

49:52.500 --> 49:55.980
model around streaming a little bit more and they have to focus on that stuff, they're

49:55.980 --> 49:59.380
never really going to, they're not really going to get any more open, right?

49:59.380 --> 50:01.940
They're not going to really get any more focused on your local stuff.

50:01.940 --> 50:02.940
Yeah, yeah, you're right.

50:02.940 --> 50:05.700
Like there's definitely still a lot to like about Plex obviously, and there's doing some

50:05.700 --> 50:09.940
things that Jellyfin probably may never be able to compete with it in some regards.

50:09.940 --> 50:15.580
But if you are focused on your local collection, you want free software, Jellyfin has been

50:15.580 --> 50:16.840
getting really nice lately.

50:16.840 --> 50:21.420
So 10.8.0, we'll have a link in the show notes, go check it out.

50:21.420 --> 50:24.740
There's a post in there specifically to highlight all the new features.

50:24.740 --> 50:27.460
I of course saw the GPU stuff and that's what I got excited about.

50:27.460 --> 50:30.000
But I know there's a lot of other things in there too, including just nice performance

50:30.000 --> 50:32.860
and bug fixes and all that kind of stuff.

50:32.860 --> 50:35.260
Gentlemen, we did it.

50:35.260 --> 50:36.900
This brings us right here to the end.

50:36.900 --> 50:37.900
We did it.

50:37.900 --> 50:38.900
Congratulations guys.

50:38.900 --> 50:40.800
So we just recorded two episodes back to back.

50:40.800 --> 50:46.140
In theory, I'll be back from Montana and we'll have a regular live stream next Sunday.

50:46.140 --> 50:50.180
So I get to actually officially say, see you next week.

50:50.180 --> 50:53.420
Same bat time, same bat station.

50:53.420 --> 50:54.420
That's right.

50:54.420 --> 51:00.980
JBlive.tv or of course all their live productions now at Jupiter.tube on our own PeerTube instance

51:00.980 --> 51:05.540
in the federated universe where you can use a free software stack to watch your favorite

51:05.540 --> 51:06.540
Linux content.

51:06.540 --> 51:08.280
How great is that?

51:08.280 --> 51:10.640

And of course, don't miss Linux action news at linuxactionnews.com.

51:17.180 --> 51:19.380
There's a lot going on every single week.

51:19.380 --> 51:23.100
It's the companion right here and links to what we talked about linuxunplug.com slash

51:23.100 --> 51:25.100
four six three.

51:25.100 --> 51:28.920
Alright everyone, thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode of the unplugged

51:28.920 --> 51:56.220
program and we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

51:58.920 --> 52:10.340
Brian, that was such a great conversation.

52:10.340 --> 52:11.660
Thank you for sharing that with us.

52:11.660 --> 52:12.660
You're welcome.

52:12.660 --> 52:19.000
I think I unfortunately realized when I was listening back that we hardly touched on any

52:19.000 --> 52:23.540
of his deep breadth of, you know, experience because he has so much.

52:23.540 --> 52:27.660
We kind of like picked one or two and then went into these really amazing philosophical

52:27.660 --> 52:32.460
discussions around technology and how humans should interact with technology and stuff.

52:32.460 --> 52:36.280
So I think we should probably have him back for another conversation at some point.

52:36.280 --> 52:37.280
You're probably right.

52:37.280 --> 52:40.860
Although I will say that some of the some of the topics I love on brunch the most.

52:40.860 --> 52:41.860
So sorry.

52:41.860 --> 52:42.860
Now where it's going to go.

52:42.860 --> 52:45.880
Yeah, as far as a brunch chat goes, there's no menu.

52:45.880 --> 52:48.260
It's just whatever the chef feels like cooking that day.

52:48.260 --> 52:50.520
That's right choice.

52:50.520 --> 52:54.380
We should say for sure, like the whole chat going to be worth listening to.

52:54.380 --> 52:58.240
And if the timing works out, I get to listen to it on the way back, I think, right on my

52:58.240 --> 52:59.240
drive back.

52:59.240 --> 53:00.240
Oh, nice.

53:00.240 --> 53:02.780
Oh, you plan this well for yourself.

53:02.780 --> 53:03.780
Well done.

53:03.780 --> 53:05.820
That'll be that'll be nice.

53:05.820 --> 53:06.820
Yeah.

53:06.820 --> 53:28.100
You can go to brunch.show for that.
