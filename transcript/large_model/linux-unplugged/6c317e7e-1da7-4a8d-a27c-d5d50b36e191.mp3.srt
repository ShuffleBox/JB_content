1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,340
I am legitimately I think I didn't realize it but I have like some sort of weird Linux

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:08,360
fest sleep hangover happens every year but I sat down and I actually forgot to even get

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,360
in the mumble room.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,820
Have we ever even done the show without a mumble room?

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,820
Does it make sense even?

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,820
It's Linux Unplugged.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,780
You got to cough the mumble rooms here.

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,360
That is probably what it is yeah both of you guys are here and so that is it that's a good

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,620
portion at least but sounds like sounds like Wes has a pick me up before we get started.

10
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:30,680
Yes well okay we both been watching the very same show and you've reached something of

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,680
an important juncture.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,680
Oh really?

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,160
So I just thought you're gonna be done soon it's always hard when you finish a show you

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,360
know it's all it's all over you miss the characters.

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,360
Here we go.

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,360
I got you something to remember it by.

17
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:47,160
Oh okay all right here we go here we go ladies and gentlemen oh my god no no.

18
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,160
It's all the songs.

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,200
It's a CD of Vic Fontaine from D Space Nine.

20
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Absolutely.

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,680
The worst thing about D Space Nine now on his own CD oh the only the only thing that's

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,160
gonna make this better is you know I'm gonna put this in the car and put this on when I'm

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,240
in with Hadia and see how long it takes her to notice.

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,800
I would think maybe we could rip it and get some soundboard clips.

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,920
I can't believe you found this I can't believe are any of the songs from the show on here?

26
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,440
Yeah that they're all songs from the show.

27
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,040
Oh yeah Saturn doll I'll be seeing you oh wow I'm getting angry just thinking about

28
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,720
it I'm getting there there you go I feel much better now thank you Wes.

29
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:36,520
This is Linux Unplugged episode 299 for April 30th 2019.

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:41,320
Well hello there and welcome to your weekly Linux talk show that's just made it back from

31
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,340
a huge Linux fest Northwest.

Everything but barely.

37
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,440
Did you get some rest?

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:54,040
A little bit I mean I approached a full night's sleep but it's about the only one in the past

57
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,040
yeah one day well okay well we have a lot to talk about today not just Linux vest but

58
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:37,400
we have some really really big news to start out with fedora 30 is out right now as we

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,040
record and we're taking a look at the fedora 30 workstation which ships with gnomes three

60
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:49,060
dot three two completely refreshed icon themes new consistency across the desktop way snappier

61
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:55,080
performance the new application panel the control permissions for flat packs and a lot

62
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,020
more of course there's also the silver blue release and the cloud edition release but

63
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,960
I regrettably because of all the Linux fest stuff did not quite get this installed before

64
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,920
the show wanted to take L out to lunch before she had a flat that's nice I know did you

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,880
get a chance to give it a look hmm you know it took a while I think their CDNs are pretty

66
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,860
popular a lot of people downloading this release which is a good sign yeah I got it installed

67
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:24,280
in a virtual machine and booted into the live CD and it's I mean it's nice every time fedora

68
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,280
comes out it's always a little hard because it's not it's not a radical change right it's

69
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,840
a small iterative improvement but I've been looking forward to their release of gnome

70
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,560
three dot three two because I've been enjoying it so much in 1904 and that flicker free boot

71
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,840
oh it's shiny oh man we've been looking forward to that for a while okay I mean it's honestly

72
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,760
I hardly ever reboot my computer except for like a kernel upgrade so I don't see it a

73
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,940
lot it's not something I really care about but as someone who grew up some of the first

74
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,600
hacking I did on a computer you know a wee little lad breaking my windows my parents

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,160
windows workstation was changing how the boot screen appeared and finally Linux users get

76
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:08,960
first class decent looking boot now you need a flicker free kegs yeah maybe someday I tease

77
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,040
there's there's numerous improvements throughout fedora and gnome three three two pretty much

78
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,440
worth it just for that update alone but I'll give you more thoughts later on as I get a

79
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,160
chance to kick the tires congratulations to the team and hopefully we'll get a chance

80
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,680
to do a little comparison and performance did you have any early impressions between

81
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,920
the Ubuntu 1904 implementation of gnome shell and the fedora 31 I mean there's always a

82
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,840
little you know they don't have the Ubuntu style theme but otherwise performance wise

83
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,240
they both just felt really snappy it's always nice to have a fresh fedora installed with

84
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,640
good classic gnome I didn't do any tweaking so it wasn't I would say it doesn't come out

85
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,980
of the box quite as pretty as 1904 but yeah you can style it to your taste yeah yeah exactly

86
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,680
and some people do prefer the more standard-looking no and it's perfectly usable you know like

87
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:59,320
you may not like the default theme but it works just fine sure sure Alex I'm curious

88
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,600
did you hear any of the purism scuttlebutt while we were at Linux fest Northwest I had

89
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,040
some things I'm not sure I'm allowed to repeat oh I'm going to repeat them I will I wasn't

90
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:15,480
going to necessarily but then we have a pretty big announcement today from purism and I don't

91
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,880
know if you guys have seen this but it is the era of services and they have launched

92
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:29,640
the Librem one a quote growing bundle of ethical servers services they have five hundred and

93
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:35,200
thirty out of five thousand backers yes this is another crowd funder from purism this one

94
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:43,360
now for services and it includes a range of apps Librem chat Librem social Librem mail

95
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:50,320
and Librem tunnel yeah chat is an end-to-end encrypted VoIP chat using matrix Librem mail

96
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:56,200
is a rebadged mail client I understand Librem tunnel is I think private internet access

97
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,620
white label and Librem social I think is also a rebadge of mastodon and things like that

98
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:07,820
but it's it's self-hosted private labeled privacy first focus as they say no ads no

99
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,300
tracking and quote we respect you have you seen how many options there are on these

100
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,560
packages it's quite a bit yeah there's must be 15 20 different options here what do you

101
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,960
think of the pricing so like the basic pricing is you described it as a as like a crowdfunding

102
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,400
thing but generally I think of a crowdfunding program as something you pay up front of like

103
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,620
a you know you pay one cost here though they're all talking and they say like the full monthly

104
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:38,940
bundle $7.99 a month they also have a couple of weird ones like a $20 one-time or $5 monthly

105
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,660
donation so there's like different options where you can just and the way they write

106
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,500
it is it's kind of interesting Purism is a social purpose company if you'd like to donate

107
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,680
to the cause of social good and technology and want to see more products and services

108
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,060
from Purism well we welcome it so just send us some money but at this point it's going

109
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,740
to be cheaper in the long run to invest in your own self-hosted thing is it not and just

110
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,720
as privacy focused I do think it's an interesting space to explore because we're all all right

111
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,740
I mean right people people that use Dropbox or other things there are many managed services

112
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,360
that we like to use we have complaints about their the privacy of the implementation of

113
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,240
what's going on behind the scenes and I've been kind of wondering why don't we see more

114
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,820
of this you know taking the open source software that we can run for ourselves and not really

115
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,320
developing it anymore maybe they're adding back to it but just running it for you compare

116
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,980
a digital ocean droplet at five dollars a month running next cloud with this service

117
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:40,540
for eight dollars a month you know you look at the feature list here you know vpns documents

118
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,480
mail all the rest of it and there's pretty much nothing you can't self-host yourself

119
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,620
for five dollars a month that they're offering here for eight absolutely but for three dollars

120
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,680
more so like I pay I think like two dollars a month for someone to host my mail server

121
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,220
not that I couldn't I just don't want to and I think mail's on the on the other end of

122
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,160
that spectrum mail I would agree because of the whole spam thing but everything else like

123
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,820
next cloud is so good now that's true especially with the with the snap version that they have

124
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,200
it is easy to install I just wonder I mean are there people who like the philosophy but

125
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,400
don't have an admin experience or just don't have the time to want to bother with a digital

126
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,520
ocean droplet yeah I think there is likely a customer base for this kind of stuff or

127
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,680
else things like slack wouldn't be as popular as they are people want convenience of push

128
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:29,720
button get a service the the scuttlebutt that I heard and what is concerning because if

129
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,600
you just look into it if you know the people involved it is apparently true people received

130
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,080
layoff notices from purism Saturday evening over the weekend some of the people like in

131
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,840
their sales department Sheree from gnome and others were let go Saturday they went home

132
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,400
Friday thinking they had a job on Monday and Saturday evening they got an email saying

133
00:09:50,400 --> 00:10:01,440
you let go and now we are pivoting to services which seems to be the popular brace yourselves

134
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,960
kids because we're gonna get a lot more of this over 2019 and 2020 hey I need a reoccurring

135
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:13,480
revenue stream turns out selling and shipping to a free software market is hard to monetize

136
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,800
so let's go for reoccurring and let's figure out how we can rebadge some open source services

137
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,040
and do this fundraiser style initiative now my issue here is having been a previous backer

138
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,840
of purism products is the previous products have not necessarily been 100% delivered on

139
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:33,560
the laptops didn't necessarily meet the original commitments now they have iterated on that

140
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,600
over time the Libram 5 is currently the development edition is slightly delayed unlikely to ship

141
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,040
in July as promised that's also a crowd raise product and now we have services that are

142
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,680
also crowd funded while they're kind of quietly letting staff go on a Saturday night how many

143
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,840
people are involved in this in this project behind the scenes right what's the company

144
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,440
look like well this is what I wanted to get to so purism is an interesting beast because

145
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,320
they're a social purposes company established here in Washington State now they're they're

146
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,240
a corporation in California like they're a business out of California but their social

147
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:16,520
purposes status is out of Washington State and God bless them I think this is an interesting

148
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:25,360
idea especially if let's just say things really line up well the Libram 5 ships the Libram

149
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:33,480
15 and those laptops do well PureOS gets a large user adoption and you start having devices

150
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,160
that are phones laptops and tablets all running PureOS you combine it with this Libram one

151
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,960
service and all of a sudden you're starting to see kind of an Apple iCloud model very

152
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:50,840
much so you can see the logic in it that does not make it a reality and the thing that really

153
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,360
bothers me as a former sysadmin is just like we've seen with these streaming services like

154
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:03,560
CBS all access companies that don't have this as their core focus think it's easy to just

155
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,920
stand up a service real quick oh I'll just you know what we'll get into services we'll

156
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,120
build some servers we'll rebadge some software we'll invest in security we'll get a couple

157
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,880
really smart people on our team and we'll really build out a really scalable secure

158
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,640
infrastructure and we'll start offering services to answer Alex's question on their their core

159
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:28,160
team page there's currently about 22 people listed and that really bothers me because

160
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,440
companies with 22,000 employees can barely provide infrastructure grade reliable services

161
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:44,240
companies like YouTube and ESPN have invested decades in their streaming infrastructure

162
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,360
and in their storage infrastructure and so for a company that's making laptops and now

163
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:56,680
attempting to make a phone and topple Android also wanting to get into services while having

164
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,640
a small employee base that's essentially the size of my team to make podcasts nearly is

165
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:09,160
crazy, it's crazy. Does anybody remember Mobile Me with Apple? That was a hot mess and if

166
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,840
Apple can't do it and you know canonical struggle with Ubuntu Touch with a lot more people and

167
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,840
a lot more money I think this guy's on cloud nine isn't he? Well you know you got to have

168
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,000
a you know you do need to have a visionary somebody who's willing to be bold Todd is

169
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,820
a bold visionary character and that draws a lot of people in. It helps if the vision

170
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:35,400
is realistic though. Well here's what the issue is and this is see we are I think because

171
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,440
I hear from the audience all the time about this is we're the minority on this issue is

172
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,640
what we're really facing here is I think the limitations of humanity. Seriously the problem

173
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,160
is is that we are all tribal monkeys that want to be signaling constantly to each other

174
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,200
I agree with you I belong in your tribe I agree with what you believe I want to be in

175
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:00,280
your tribe and so we do that by promoting things that seem great ideas that reflect

176
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,960
our ideals and our beliefs like software freedom like the ability to turn off your webcam the

177
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,380
ability to load your own operating system on your own phone that kind of stuff is things

178
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,680
we believe in and so we want to see that propagate we want to see that continue so we want a

179
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,220
virtue signal that we think that's great so we tend to just talk about this stuff and

180
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:25,880
lacker over all of the obvious issues because deep down we're all a bunch of optimists and

181
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,320
we want to see this stuff be successful we want to believe there's a big enough market

182
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,840
to buy free software phones we want to believe a company like purism can come around and

183
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,260
change an entire entrenched industry that nearly goes back now a hundred years of legacy

184
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,840
we want to believe that's possible and because we don't have the hands-on experience we have

185
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:48,780
no idea how complicated of a job it is we frankly don't understand any of the dynamics

186
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,560
involved in carrier agreements and getting something certified for a carrier network

187
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,680
we have no insights into any of that we have no idea what it takes to manufacture a phone

188
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,560
or to stamp out a motherboard or to write drivers for a modem we have no concept of

189
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,960
any of that and so we sit back and go that seems possible yeah that seems like that's

190
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,240
some that should be really easy how hard could it be well I sure hope they can get it well

191
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,540
let's give them another fundraiser let's raise more money because obviously it's gonna go

192
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,840
somewhere because I believe in this idea and god forbid you don't believe in it because

193
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,960
if you don't believe in it then you don't love free software you don't respect privacy

194
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,840
don't do you want the NSA listening to your phone calls West how could you not believe

195
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,600
in five there's something wrong with you because you're skeptical and that propagates

196
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,400
shysters and crazy ideas because we love ourselves a great big moral idea and if you got a company

197
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:44,180
here like purism who will tell you every three paragraphs that they're the moral authority

198
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,680
in their blog seriously they go here they list out the business models of purism Facebook

199
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,800
Google all of them are horribly evil companies that want to track you and control you except

200
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,740
for purism which quote benefits society then at the bottom of this post there's a bunch

201
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,780
of random quotes that don't really have anything to do with the product like there's quotes

202
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:08,720
in there from Stallman and other people but the top quote the top quote is from Todd Weaver

203
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:15,960
and the top quote says society's technology genius is not lacking but it's moral genius

204
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,600
is because Todd's going to be our moral authority and he's going to guide us with

205
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,800
his social purposes company into free software and hardware now if you don't like free software

206
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,880
and if you don't like privacy and you don't respect users control over their computers

207
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,800
then why would you care something about Libra why would you back this but if you do care

208
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,240
if you don't want them privacy if you don't want them spying on you and invading your

209
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,000
junk well then you should probably back this and because I'm saying that they're a tiny

210
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,040
company who isn't built to do something like this and who should be focusing on what they

211
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,440
can do and I'm the lunatic I'm the crazy person I'm the bad person we all know this

212
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:00,240
to be true gets me crazy I think what you need to do is is fund a much more grassroots

213
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,920
level approach to solving this problem so the talk that I gave at Linux Fest Northwest

214
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:10,040
for example was about writing your own firmware for your own home home assistant related home

215
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:17,800
automation stuff if you if you enable people smart people to write their own firmwares

216
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:23,440
or you know 56k modem firmwares we have no concept of how difficult they are to write

217
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:29,920
if we make all of the bits that go into a phone open then we've we've seen over the

218
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,900
years that open source will do amazing things with that technology the baseband in the purism

219
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,600
phone I have no idea how that works but the baseband in my Android phone is a completely

220
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,140
separate operating system that is a black box that the NSA probably have a backdoor

221
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:52,280
right into so my question really is how how can we audit what Libras purism are doing

222
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,880
how can I as a an open source advocate how can I sit here and say yes what they're doing

223
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:04,240
is actually legit I think this is the problem like I was saying earlier we have no context

224
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:12,080
we have no concept of like even how hard it is to get the corner plastic pieces of the

225
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:17,040
phone molded we don't even know we don't how long how long does it take to mold the corner

226
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,880
pieces of Libra and five does anybody know who have they contracted to do that we don't

227
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,640
know any of this information we're just told don't worry I just take care of it we have

228
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,120
a vision I just got my pixel 3 in the mail today so it's sitting at home waiting for

229
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,320
me which I'm excited about but even then right Google just admitted they were having how

230
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,660
all the problems they've been having with that line and they're a huge business who

231
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:40,840
already has some of these deals in place and they still can't get a phone as cheap as they

232
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:46,600
want it to be so exactly how are we supposed to yeah now I am curious one option would

233
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
be that we just shouldn't fund this sort of thing because it's not realistic well and

234
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,120
this is just gonna be one of many there's gonna be other are there ways that they could

235
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,280
communicate more so maybe you know maybe at some of the issue I think we're having is

236
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,540
the unrealistic expectations and that there are a lot of people who don't know that and

237
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:04,800
are then funding it right are there ways that a business like this or a project like this

238
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:09,160
could be a more upfront about that say like listen we want your money do we know we're

239
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,200
doing maybe kind of we want to explore this buyer beware you know what I think I think

240
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:23,560
no because I think what makes a company like purism successful is by rolling hard into

241
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:29,200
the freedoms aspect of it and the privacy aspect of it and by positioning themselves

242
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:37,480
as a moral authority because they they respect and and and try to enable user privacy right

243
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,680
there they're setting themselves as a moral authority leader and when you're coming when

244
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,000
you're when that's your brand there's really no higher ground right there's you there is

245
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,300
no way to talk about this stuff in sort of a humble way because you've already just crossed

246
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,640
that out by the way that you're branding and marketing yourself right so I suspect there

247
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:01,000
is no going back and I also know from my own personality that I'm the type of person that

248
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,520
when you get rid when you get high on the hyperbole scale when you get rid of you know

249
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,480
what I'm like what's a good way to put that like when you get really high on the lake

250
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,600
PR yeah yeah it's just I start it starts to trigger me it just really does and I but

251
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,680
I also appreciate that to really reach the market they're trying to reach they have to

252
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,960
hit those notes really hard this is going to be a model in a sense yeah I think you're

253
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,520
going to have distributions that try to do things like this to try to monetize the user

254
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:33,080
base you look at what Apple's doing with iOS they've looked at this okay well we're having

255
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,660
a hard time selling more iPhones but we got a billion active iOS devices let's start monetizing

256
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,200
that user base with services so they're launching TV streaming services they're going to launch

257
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,840
all this crap everybody's going to do that it's all going to be about the reoccurring

258
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,760
eight bucks they can get out of you and we're just this is the beginning of many what kind

259
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,280
of bothers me about this one and this is really petty because this is open source free software

260
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,320
but they've lifted two of the icons for their apps the mail app and the chat app and I'm

261
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,840
I know the mail app the mail app is the Geary icon that's Gary mail straight up they just

262
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,120
straight up lifted it's probably a free it's probably a free icon but I don't know she's

263
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,520
what they like does that bother you like it bothers me I mean you know they have they

264
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,200
could be working with the dev for all we know right maybe it is here and they could leave

265
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,280
her mail is Gary no because if these are all Android apps I should point out these are

266
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,560
all Android iOS apps are not Linux apps right so you know maybe they're working with the

267
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:31,440
team or maybe they at hopefully they ask the team that'd be really shitty thing to do to

268
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,480
just lift an icon for something else which I mean people do all the time it's not like

269
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,720
it doesn't happen all the time or not like Brent hasn't had a million of his photos taken

270
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,960
in the other stuff right so I mean it happens everywhere whether it's in you know the open

271
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,800
source world or not you know the whole thing man I see it's it's interesting how they're

272
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:58,920
they're trying to provide a services type plan but you know didn't Google one time say

273
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,620
don't be evil yeah right like where do we where do we draw the line and how do we trust

274
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:10,000
how do we trust purism to be that company I think there are other companies out there

275
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,560
that are doing similar things the pine guys and they're just here's a piece of hardware

276
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:21,760
you know this is for the community this is for you guys use it try it out break it you

277
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,680
know it's inexpensive yeah and at this point I feel like to some degree it's a race to

278
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:33,680
market between these two and so while maybe this was something that purism was going to

279
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,600
do later they decided to drop it earlier to create more buzz before because I really think

280
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:43,800
these two companies in particular are racing to get out to market with something if anything

281
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:48,360
just for the the links in the open source community where's that recurring revenue gonna

282
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,600
come from so Apple we just said you know struggling to sell devices I mean that they're putting

283
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,080
things on sale for the first time practically ever all the time if you know like the pine

284
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,160
guys you know here's a piece of hardware like you said what where does where does that upgrade

285
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,200
cycle where does that revenue to sustain the company come from if they don't go into services

286
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,360
that's but I think that's the that's the real question how do you sustain an income and

287
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,760
well I think that's when they they they come up with a with another device they keep iterating

288
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:22,880
on that product if they can keep it in a in a price range that's reasonable you've got

289
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,680
to finish there would be no yeah there's a smaller scale too right like we might expect

290
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,440
the big guys be able to make a new phone every year every two years but that's gonna that's

291
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,880
gonna be a challenge those big guys those those annual phones are generally only fairly

292
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,920
iterative yeah right or Samsung who throws out just all the all the crap that they possibly

293
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,280
can and you know there's entire youtubers that make careers out of saying is it worth

294
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,600
upgrading if you have to ask that question no it's not right right I think I think what

295
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,360
I come back to is my core concern is I have a fundamental and maybe it's out date but

296
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,360
I have a fundamental belief that if you are going to offer data storage services like

297
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,560
chat like mail and VPN tunneling where you're where you are also either white labeling or

298
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,600
standing up VPN infrastructure it is my outdated belief I guess that you need to be a specialist

299
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,560
in services you need to know how to run servers it needs to be what you do now that said if

300
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,840
I was gonna pay a monthly money for something like this I suppose I like the option of being

301
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,080
able to use stuff that's all based on open source software it's funny if this was the

302
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,360
only thing that they were doing yes I would believe they could started with this yes absolutely

303
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,240
yeah that's what's so weird is if they started with this I would not be nearly as skeptical

304
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,520
but because it seems like it kind of seems like flailing around a little bit we're gonna

305
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,280
do a tablet we're gonna do laptops we're gonna do this they can't even get the SSL set for

306
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,880
their VPN domain right oh is it still screwed up as of now yeah that's been since Saturday

307
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,760
yeah yeah I know I thought maybe I thought maybe by the time they announced it they'd

308
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:52,320
have it fixed yeah I have not tried that I trust them now is it possible that they're

309
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,160
just really good at selling ideas and not so good at carrying them through that's kind

310
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,240
of what we've seen in the last few years is that their their ideas are are actually quite

311
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,480
sound however the the bringing to market is where things are falling apart a little bit

312
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,460
ideas are sexy and tempting and easy to write on a web page uh-huh it's much easier to say

313
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:15,480
I'm going to do this than actually doing this right and I think I'm a big believer that

314
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,120
actually shipping is is the difference between professionals and amateurs like actually getting

315
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,560
it shipped out there in a something that you can you can feel good about is harder than

316
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,160
coming up with the idea and the last 10% so cliche but the last 10% is the hardest part

317
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,920
it's like a number of people that say I'm gonna do a podcast and then yeah yeah don't

318
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,320
ship every week like you do yeah or all kinds of things right people get and that's fine

319
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,020
you know for some people it's just uh really it's that they are billed that we are billing

320
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,320
them as this big name with a big project an idea that's really important that we should

321
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,800
support and there are aspects that like you said the philosophy that we agree with but

322
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,200
we just we need to be realistic about yeah the scale and expectations and um given enough

323
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,600
time and given enough resources they may be able to get there but right now I'm just I'm

324
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,680
not I'm not a big fan of the look of the constant fundraiser thing either it's concerning to

325
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,920
me that they're not at a sustainable point now I know you could argue well there are

326
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,560
social purposes company and so blah blah blah they give money back blah blah I don't buy

327
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:20,360
it simply don't buy it yeah I think it introduces a large amount of uncertainty in their finances

328
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,800
and that I'm sure makes it hard to plan for on their end which only makes it even harder

329
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:28,360
for us to have any idea what's actually going on yeah so what's the alternative then let's

330
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,560
play devil's advocate for a second if if you were Todd and you wanted to build a sustainable

331
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:38,040
company around this stuff what other choice does he have well going back to Wes's point

332
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:42,840
sorry to interrupt but going back to Wes's point I think um I think they would have started

333
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:48,640
with services I think part of it is I've never really believed the tablet and phone hype

334
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,720
that they've they've had and that has always since they've since they've gone down that

335
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,840
route they've really kind of dropped down in credibility in my book because not only

336
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:05,320
is it a insurmountable problem it is a problem that is solved we should be figuring out the

337
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,740
next major platform and getting open source and free software there first for once instead

338
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:18,120
of spending five six years a decade after the fact trying to catch up and even come

339
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:25,080
barely close to feature comparative it just seems like a fool's errand because even if

340
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:30,780
you get there the market isn't standing still and it eventually by the time you get a competent

341
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:39,120
product the next wave be it wearables or VR headsets or implants or whatever it is will

342
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,080
be here will be arrived like that it'll be the people that are working on that or will

343
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,480
have started so we'll just be missing that boat now correct me if I'm wrong isn't that

344
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,280
why Ubuntu Touch ended up in the way it did was that you know that the pace of the market

345
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:58,320
is such that unless you are Apple or Google it's almost impossible to keep up yeah I heard

346
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,720
this weekend from people who were familiar with the matter that looking at the videos

347
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:09,880
like the videos that developers have released and that purism is released that there were

348
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,480
canonical was about four years ago which was about two years from like getting deals with

349
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,200
BQ and whatnot so we'll see and so what happens if you've contributed to this this crowdfunding

350
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,680
thing and it doesn't ship well then you can you contributed to a good cause okay I wonder

351
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,440
if a different business model might be helpful and I have an idea to grow on what you were

352
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,880
just talking about so I'm glad you interrupted me because it grew my idea a little bit gave

353
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,280
me a little bit of time I wonder if they might be you know since their their strength is

354
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:48,680
ideas and vision it seems or at least some moral high ground that is a lot of people

355
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:54,200
appreciate I wonder if it might be a good idea to instead of concentrating on products

356
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,200
which is where their weak point seems to be on shipping products I wonder if there might

357
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:03,440
be almost like a patreon style funding for their business if they're gonna be what they're

358
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:08,280
doing isn't it yeah but they're tying it to a specific product so what if you are instead

359
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:13,480
funding them to grow ideas and be almost a think tank to try to get open source ahead

360
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,160
of the curve maybe just be more honest like because that's probably I mean probably these

361
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,360
fundraisers do go to keep the company going of course it's pretty obvious crowdsourced

362
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,920
VC funding that's what yeah all right well we spent way too much time it'll be interesting

363
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,960
to see where it goes you know that's this is the ultimate this is one of our this is

364
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,400
one of our more ponderous stories the ultimate pondries ponderous story for the last few

365
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:41,040
years just last point apparently they've quietly dumped the tablet yeah yeah yeah yeah all

366
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:46,720
right well few things to talk about looks like L joined us in the mumble room she's

367
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,240

371
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,080
pain field right now you guys know how it's awesome I've been talking about pain field

372
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,760
the whole weekend I'm just so jealous all the locals are jealous of you so yeah yeah

373

00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,440
docker con time yeah decker con party people should join me there absolutely absolutely

375
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,560
how should they find you look for the hair follow you on Twitter yeah just look for the

376
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,960
hair or just ask somebody I hate to say it but somebody will have seen my hair they know

377
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,600

380
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:51,360
pretty good well I'm glad you're able to give us a on location pain field report L safe

381
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,120
travels but Wes has dared me to go and preach the gospel of LXD so we shall see if it's

382
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:04,720
safe travels or not wow I believe in you into the wolf's den with that one did you put her

383
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,660
up to that oh yeah I mean I saw her for all of I don't know 10 seconds while she was hopping

384
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:14,320
out from the studio to go catch this flight yeah yeah of course yeah good um next week

385
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,200
Red Hat Summit Wes Cheese and I will be at Red Hat Summit Alex are you going to Red Hat

386
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,160
Summit the Red Hatter is not going to Red Hat Summit that's ironic silly isn't it I've

387
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,080
just not found anyone's budget to put the expenses again right yeah yeah you just start

388
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,600
making the expenses and they'll tell you where to put it that's how it works yeah my bank

389
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:38,560
account probably yeah yeah very very fair I totally understand there's a lot of competition

390
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,840
internally for people to go to Red Hat Summit so I bet you have to submit a talk or you

391
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,420
have to be actually associated with one of the products does anything get done around

392
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:50,560
Red Hat the weeks before the summit yeah a lot I mean there's a lot of people doing an

393
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,440
awful lot of work to crunch together I mean there's an awful lot of open shift announcements

394
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,840
coming up at the summit this year so there's a lot of work been happening for months if

395
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,560
not years to prepare for this because it's a big release coming up so oh yeah oh well

396
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,280
I'm glad we're going oh yeah yeah one of the reasons I'm sad I'm not is because by open

397
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,680
shifts the products I work most closely with and it's going to be a big big announcement

398
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:29,280
hmm hmm now one last little bit of housekeeping before we skadoots have you ever heard me

399
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:34,520
ever say skadoots I just heard you about four times skadoots maybe if it was the name of

400
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,280
a project that you were trying to pronounce yeah yeah and it would be a total mispronunciation

401
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:45,140
all right so I just wanted to mention that Linux Academy was getting a bunch of great

402
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:50,280
feedback on the promo of the $2.99 yearly promo normally the price is $4.49 it's $2.99

403
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,400
right now they've extended it for just another five days that's a great deal that's like

404
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:00,120
a 33% that's actually exactly a 33% discount so Linux Academy calm go take advantage of

405
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,440
that because that's crazy that's crazy that's a mighty fine is a mighty fine deal as someone

406
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:12,040
who had has paid the full price before being associated at all yeah that seems nice there

407
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:19,080
you go there right there that was the the keeping of the house we're all done very nice

408
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,200
we got through that nice and quick got that got that through really good well as I said

409
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:29,920
we're all back from Linux Fest Northwest and cheese just got in last night yeah yeah last

410
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:38,000
night around 1030 1045 so that's late but dogs went crazy ballistic well cheese what

411
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:42,760
did you think as your first Linux Fest Northwest was it worth or not that's not the way I want

412
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,640
to put it was it everything we've been talking about for years on the air absolutely yeah

413
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,880
did not disappoint did not disappoint boy because we've been hyping it a lot yeah I

414
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,240
mean it you know I was kind of going into it expecting you know a conference of fest

415
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,640
you know just a kind of a small one but I did not realize how much it just it actually

416
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,840
felt more like a giant family reunion than than anything else even with like that one

417
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:18,000
crazy aunt like it was still this this giant family reunion yeah who's the crazy aunt that's

418
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:26,600
why I want to know hmm who was the I don't know Noah I have to think he was he did get

419
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:32,760
kind of crazy yeah we'll get there we'll get there don't worry oh it's there I got a story

420
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,480
I agree with you cheese by the way family reunion and a lot of these people had never

421
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,160
met Chris once before but I never met wears or like half the crew I'd never met before

422
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,280
and yet because their voices have been such a part of my life for so many years it felt

423
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,480
like a family reunion yeah really nice way to put it this year more so I think than ever

424
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,320
it really did it was like I think it was really interesting too because you could tell especially

425
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:57,840
at the studio when we had just a you know group of us hanging around just all of the

426
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:02,920
voices it was super surreal because all the voices that you hear on the podcast everyone's

427
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,560
in a conversation talking here there it was it was definitely interesting with you know

428
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:16,240
bodies and heads when I met Joe he he looked at me kind of strange when I said oh hey I'm

429
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,800
Brent nice to meet you Joe and he said oh you're not what I expected and I had to ask

430
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,280
him well is that a good thing or a bad thing because you're not what I expected either

431
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,400
I thought that about Joe Joe looked nothing like I expected right yeah he looked nothing

432
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,320
like his picture yeah you have that moment and then and then it passes and then it just

433
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,080
kind of becomes normal because you fuse the voice with the person which is good surprisingly

434
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,760
quickly in almost all cases you know and it is a little different some people are look

435
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,120
very different but geez we had also not met and I feel like meeting you it was it was

436
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:54,020
just great I mean I had seen your picture but it really was like brothers or something

437
00:35:54,020 --> 00:36:00,040
like hey oh cool yeah you got some beers awesome yeah where else that happens with people you

438
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,780
know maybe people you've known from podcasts but even just other people at Linux fest right

439
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:08,000
you just strike up conversations you don't have to make awkward small talk you have all

440
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,200
the things you have the same vocabulary you know and like the same things so it's not

441
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:17,560
just the it's not just us on air it's that's it's like that for everybody it really is

442
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:22,760
and this year was was our biggest Linux fest in in several ways the one thing that we really

443
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,840
did big time this year there was a massive success that we've never done before and I

444
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,840
think now we have to do it every single year is there was a Jupiter track a room that was

445
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:38,800
just loaded full of Linux Academy and community members that had talks and Wes had the privilege

446
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,920
of giving the very first talk very early in the Jupiter room as everyone doing today happy

447
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:51,080
Linux fest Northwest I don't know about you guys but 930 is just about the earliest possible

448
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:56,880
time I think conference talk should be scheduled yes you had a packed room that was everybody

449
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,280
had a packed room I was it was very humbling the number of people that came to our room

450
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,520
it was just incredible I'm not joking I had two different people tell me they were emotionally

451
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,080
moved by else talk this on the second day I wanted to go see you know like my co-host

452
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,320
Jim I wanted to go see his talk I couldn't know it's full by the time I got there you

453
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,720
couldn't even go into Alan's talk because they just closed the room they put a sign

454
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,120
up that said no more people it's crazy some of us just walked past the sign I sat down

455
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:24,080
anyway right the live stream wasn't full so I got in there you know that's always open

456
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:27,000
yeah we did have we did try to get the audio on the live stream we'll try to get the audio

457
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,360
posted up on our site and the slides up on github or something pretty soon once we get

458
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,400
everybody and once everybody's done traveling I know I was really nervous about her talk

459
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,080
and I thought she did a great job I thought you know I thought the feedback are you still

460
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,820
there what do you think how did it go because I thought the feedback for your talk was particularly

461
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:45,440
good out of all the talks um well I've always loved doing the container talk because that

462
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,000
one's always really fun people get really excited and I love it when people actually

463
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,640
turn in the homework I give them but the mentoring talk was the hardest one this time because

464
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:58,880
it is telling my story and I was really happy to see how many people came to a community

465
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,640
based talk at a technical conference that was just really heartwarming to me yeah it's

466
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,040
something people are taking seriously that is good to see and I think I think links fest

467
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,360
Northwest in particular has a lot of that vibe I've noticed over the years a number

468
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:14,480
of talks that that will focus around that you know it is because it is a community driven

469
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,480
event people are thinking about it already I really liked your talk on Linux audio you

470
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,400
got into like even the science of how sound moves around a room and the different microphones

471
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,960
were yeah it was great it was really nerdy and Alex your talk was packed on home automation

472
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,000
people were even sitting on the floor in front of the projectors and stuff it was a bit daunting

473
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,080
yeah somebody told me 83 people or 88 people or something wow yeah we just gotta get a

474
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:40,680
bigger room in a room for 30 years the class of normal classroom size yeah I think it was

475
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:45,640
87 in Alex's talk yeah 87 is what I counted that's a lot of people yeah I like how like

476
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,920
toward the end they just had to start putting you know like on Alan's talk no more because

477
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,800
because we were cramming as many people as possible in there and we also got rid of a

478
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,440
ton of the vintage swag in there too yeah we had the old we were given a lot of that

479
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,640
people love that stuff you know I've been most amazed by since the talk is the interactions

480
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,880
on Twitter since people have been actively seeking me out and you know people I've never

481
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,680
met or talked to you are just like hey you know like your talk how do I find out more

482
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,680
information so there is a blog post I wrote about it which I'll get when you throw in

483
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,160
a show notes yeah yeah for the home automation stuff which is so cool yeah the other talks

484
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,000
were there were some other popular ones too I think one that I'll have a link for in the

485
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:30,600
show notes because it was a great one was mad dogs 50 years it was unbelievable it could

486
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:36,320
have been 50 but it was a long history of X and you know in fact I have a clip right

487
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,480
here of just the intro where I think he says it you know play a little bit of it welcome

488
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:48,760
this is talk is the 50 years of X a computer Odyssey and it's not just a rumination of

489
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:54,680
history about Unix and things like that but I want to explain some things maybe to some

490
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:58,960
of the younger people and maybe to some of the older ones who keep this information in

491
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,680
the back of their head and I'm gonna bring it back out to the frontal lobes I just didn't

492
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,540
think 50 was possible but it is that whole talks great for the entire talk is linked

493
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:12,200
in the show notes also in the show notes if you want although I don't know why you would

494
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:19,240
our entire eight hour stream from Linux vest which kicked off with a bang we are here at

495
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:24,560
Linux best they just opened the doors about eight minutes ago of course there was a lot

496
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:31,280
of people waiting to get their badges which this year are plantable did you guys try that

497
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,160
did anybody try planting their badge well not yet no it's recycled paper with seeds

498
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,800
in it I saw Alan's there earlier I'm gonna take it home they these badges look like crumpled

499
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,720
toilet paper yes they were the strangest badges I've ever seen well the first day on the second

500
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:50,800
day they were looking extra a lot fell apart did they start disintegrating yeah yeah degradable

501
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,960
in a day where the neck like what do you call that the hole the hole punch for yeah yeah

502
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:00,760
the hole punch where you would clip it in was would just rip out yeah yeah I noticed

503
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,400
on the second day they started taping that before they would give it to the person yeah

504
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,080
like tape over with it to reinforce it a bit yeah then you gotta rip the tape off before

505
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:15,320
you plant it nice bit of plastic on your biodegradable badge and so I sat down on the stream for

506
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,000
a while with Angela and yourself Chris but then Dylan popped up for a while and that

507
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,560
kid knows his Mario music yeah he does my goodness yeah that was fun I that's about

508
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:29,480
halfway through the stream chase starts quizzing Dylan on different Mario tunes to see if he

509
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,400
can to nail him that is his specialist subject if ever he goes on a quiz he is all about

510
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,440
that in Minecraft the most fun I mean I'm really trying to trying to think of what it

511
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,400
could be because there was there was great road adventures we went on we went on a hike

512
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:55,240
to a lake there was sightseeing there was so many good meals but it would be sort of

513
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:01,960
negligent on my part not to spend a little bit of time talking about our parking lot

514
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,660
barbecue right I got of all the stories I could share yeah this is I think with our

515
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:12,640
limited time the one I have to share wow well lesson learned we're gonna need more barbecues

516
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,100
we're gonna need a lot more grills sounds like pretty soon you'll need a bigger parking

517
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:25,800
lot too it was it was unbelievable cheese and the Bruce aka Brandon saved the day it

518
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:32,480
was a massive scale operation way beyond anything we planned over 300 people showed up to get

519
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:39,560
fed all of two grills to one I come out yeah no yeah the the the little grill I mean that's

520
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,920
just laughable yeah like so we walk up from that line yeah the Texans Chris would give

521
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,640
me lots of feedback on the size of your grill yeah oh you need a trailer to fit a whole

522
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,520
hog in next time it hasn't been an issue in the years past but this this year it went

523
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:59,000
big and the beauty thing that happened is cheese and Brandon like fell into this system

524
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,920
the only only way to do this when you're trying to feed 300 people is to have a system I had

525
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,520
no system if I hadn't gotten injured during the cooking process I smacked myself in the

526
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:14,320
nose with a spatula then we would have been listen to their system here listen this is

527
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
great

528
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:29,600
brought to the front of the line that's cheese right there as it should one more time because

529
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:40,080
it's it's I got to play that last part because it's so great oh yeah it was good times man

530
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:44,880
and you know whenever it came down to it and I think if he's in the mobile you should jump

531
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,960
in here too but you know I asked him I was like hey what do you want to do do you want

532
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:53,560
to cook it or do you want you know you want me to prep it and he's like I'll cook so all

533
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,680
right man I just started busting out of the hamburger patties I was throwing them on the

534
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:00,880
grill he's flipping them we're cooking as quick as we can yeah we ran out of charcoal

535
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,320
twice like we had to keep going for charcoal runs and then eventually we went for supplementary

536
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:13,160
pizza runs to like to read to alleviate the lines and then it was good time though as

537
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,360
the party sort of settled you know the people that have been drinking kind of held stayed

538
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,560
back so they could sober up or kept drinking some of us retired into the RV and played

539
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:31,040
ukulele a little bit and others decided to cross dress like like oh man like Noah Chalaya

540
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,600
and I happened to catch the moment when Noah decided to put on Emma's bathing suit from

541
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:52,160
system 76 here's what's happening right now is Noah's putting on Emma's bathing suit which

542
00:44:52,160 --> 00:45:15,760
got a little crazy it just got a little and then Noah was running around in a bathing

543
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,200
suit for a little bit it's good times I just feel bad for Emma I mean is she gonna I assume

544
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,960
she'll just throw that one away and get yeah so that's it would never be the same again

545
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,360
will it well if you if you listen to the very the very first of that clip in the background

546
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:34,560
you can hear Noah say oh I think I just ripped the leg hole yeah yeah yeah yeah that happened

547
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,160
oh we had Jeff up from California the guy that helped do the wiring for your RV and

548
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,700
he was flying some drones around that was fun one of the best moments of the barbecue

549
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:46,480
actually because Jess what are those called what are those what are those drones called

550
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,760
the Jeff had FPV drones very fast yeah and he had the goggles so you could put on like

551
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,200
VR goggles plus he had an auxiliary display screen so other people could watch and we

552
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,320
were playing around for quite a while and Levi starts to get hip to the fact that there's

553
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,720
a thing flying around that's like an insect and maybe that should get out of my backyard

554
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,360
he starts to think to himself so he spends a couple of hours chasing the drone until

555
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:13,640
one beautiful moment when Levi manages to catch the drone in his little dog mouth and

556
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,160
he catches it such that the camera faces outwards so you then get a point of view from Levi

557
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:25,480
as he does a celebratory run around the parking lot just totally pleased with himself for

558
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:30,880
cap finally capturing this as he should be present dog view and then you look over the

559
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,840
people with the VR headsets on just laughing because they're they're seeing the world from

560
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:39,640
Levi's point of view and boy does that dog move yeah just booked around it's a big party

561
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,320
he's a cutie that was he loves that he loves that barbecue he loves it because he gets

562
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:49,120
to get all kinds of scratches and scraps it's perfect for him there's a lot of fun and thank

563
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:52,580
you to everybody who made it out it was great to see you didn't get a chance to chat a lot

564
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,160
with everybody but tried to shake as many hands as possible I mean it was an amazing

565
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,320
diversity of people I think we got you know lots of regular and lots of people who might

566
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,760
just be now learning about the network Linux Academy and everyone involved yeah I just

567
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,080
saw a great amount of mixing you know like you would you'd have groups that would form

568
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:15,000
but then new people would come in others would leave yeah there was a lot of that yeah and

569
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,440
people weren't too creepy about lady jupes though this year that was nice it was good

570
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,960
yeah the awkward part is you do have your home here right next door good toilet that's

571
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:26,760
a kid it didn't work out it worked out other than the fact that the toilet got overflowed

572
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,280
boy that's another story and I just have to drive people's poops down the highway yeah

573
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,200
yeah I am still carrying their poops around it lady jupes that that is also true but I

574
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,840
think thank you to system 76 to me yeah oh jeez wow so so awesome the barbecue would

575
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:48,360
uh just straight up would not have been possible without them and man when Emma saw the crowds

576
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:53,440
that we were getting they went out and did another meat run and uh she also set aside

577
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,800
a couple of sirloins for those of us in the crew that were hanging out late so after things

578
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,560
kind of died down a little bit when the coals were still going just a little quick salt

579
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:05,560
and pepper on the old sirloin threw them on the grill and we had ourselves a little more

580
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,440
a little more meat I ate a bit of cheeses meat and it was delicious yeah yeah he's got

581
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,880
some good meat he really does was there some bacon on there no no it was just steak and

582
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:19,380
that's all that steak that steak sans bacon was good enough yeah yeah yeah they did they

583
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:24,440
also grabbed a bunch of chairs and just a ton of stuff so system 76 was just above and

584
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,960
beyond went above and beyond with the barbecue and uh Emma just left the studio a couple

585
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,280
hours ago she went out to breakfast there with Brent and uh they went out and tried

586
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,240
to try to restaurant that I used to go to as a child the Bluebird Cafe Bluebird Cafe

587
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:43,040
Emma um impressed me because she ordered two very large blueberry pancakes and then proceeded

588
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:49,280
to order um a cup of ice cream and uh ate all of the pancakes with the ice cream I had

589
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,480
never seen that before she earned it she had a hell of a day I think poppy and wimpy would

590
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,880
have really enjoyed that experience it was so good seeing them so good so good seeing

591
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:01,800
we have so many stories I want to share on the Friday stream I just I think we some of

592
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,440
like the non-linux related stories we'll put there but I'll wrap up this Linux Vesta review

593
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:13,680
by saying hell of a year great great talks great crowd great exhibit hall people were

594
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,080
into the raffle this year and we just blew the doors off the barbecue and the Jupiter

595
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:23,880
track was so much more successful than I would have thought like I thought we'd have attendance

596
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:28,280
I just didn't think we would have that much attendance it was especially because I mean

597
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:32,160
there were a lot of other really interesting talks at the conference like it's not like

598
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,760
we had the all the good stuff yeah yeah although we had some pretty great we had some great

599
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:40,760
stuff oh absolutely the one the only I will I will try to work with as many people as

600
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:45,580
possible to get um to get those up online we'll have a link to Alex's talk we'll try

601
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:49,920
to get some of the audio posted I recorded nearly all of them in audio we weren't doing

602
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,520
video but I think we might try to get like a video of the of the slides next year but

603
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,680
we will at least have the source slides up on github eventually in a week or so it was

604
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:02,520
really lovely actually so my mom and dad were listening in England to the audio stream

605
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:06,680
and they text me both text me both afterwards saying that was that was fun so thank you

606
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:10,960
for making that that's great yeah also we heard from people that had to leave the fest

607
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,240
early but got to keep streaming as they're on their way to the airport that's also really

608
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:20,960
cool definitely I had to chase for making that just make that making oh yeah that was

609
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,920
awesome yeah great great point yeah geekgamer.tv to check out what he's doing and you walked

610
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:29,880
away with a bit of a plasma success story too that's I mean if that's not something

611
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,400
I mean yeah worth it right worth flying so many people out here oh for that yeah I was

612
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,120
I was attending a really interesting talk about um it was like a live coding demo and

613
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,960
someone was you know my little hobby language of Clojure there's a javascript version they

614
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,960
were making a minesweeper game just like live right there in the browser didn't need any

615
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,440
supplies their laptop wasn't working working so well so some of the some of the other staff

616
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,520
and volunteers had have been trying to get things set up on another laptop I guess that

617
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,720
room had been having projector problems and we should say like there's a lot of rooms

618
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,840
it is a complicated setup especially with the live streaming and the mixing and the

619
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:08,840
recording so there was another um another district there with the with the green logo

620
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:13,800
I won't mention by name and you know it just couldn't it just couldn't cut it on the couldn't

621
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:18,480
cut it on the projector really like it wasn't detecting it yeah what was the desktop environment

622
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:22,800
was it it was linux mint that's what it was it was actually I'm actually was I thought

623
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,600
it was susa did you think susa when he said green there aren't many with green logo absolutely

624
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:33,120
I thought yeah I had mint did you okay nothing against it yeah yeah yeah so it's cinnamon

625
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,920
then it was like it wasn't finding it and then eventually it did but have you seen that

626
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,480
where like the it's just shifted so you have like multiple desktops that you can see where

627
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:45,320
the desktops end to begin wasn't going to cut it for the presentation but I had just

628
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:49,200
given a presentation that morning so you know it's going to be it's going to work right

629
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:53,160
I got a laptop I don't need it I was here for the talk anyway so I just go and volunteer

630
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:59,320
stick my laptop up there plug it in windows key p choose you know mirror the things no

631
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:04,680
problem worked perfectly and no credit to me it was I was just really glad that plasma

632
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:08,640
is so dependable it works so well in that sort of setting it does so good with projectors

633
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,160
it really does and that meant I actually got to enjoy the talk oh that's great that is

634
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:17,920
a nice win I also will say I mean so there's a there's a plasma success story I have a

635
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:24,040
bit of an XFC success story and it's out Joe I know right yeah don't let don't don't let

636
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,040
anybody else hear this I didn't bring my power cord because I'm lazy I mean I had it because

637
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:36,240
it's USB-C so lazy about power cords I hate power cords ran my laptop my t480 both days

638
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:40,960
recording all of the talks except for like the last couple of talks of the Sunday all

639
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:45,040
from battery the entire time wow I just left it in the room overnight sleeping came in

640
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:52,600
the next day fired about I mean just all from the XFCE sips my my experience is limited

641
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:59,840
still but when plasmas on I've got a t480s ThinkPad and you know you can feel that thing

642
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,040
when it's running plasma you can feel it under your fingers is a few degrees warmer than

643
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,560
your hands yes yes XFC is actually cooler and the fan turns off completely yeah it's

644
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:13,480
for it's a big difference yeah not pushing the GPU as much as I imagine all right well

645
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,840
so I think we have enough time I think we're gonna try to slip in we have a brand new segment

646
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:23,020
for the show very very excited about this ladies and gentlemen Jason Evangelo and L

647
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:28,120
Marquez both have commitment issues when it comes to picking a distribution so instead

648
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:35,320
of suffering they have decided to make a new segment called the distro hoppers and they

649
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:42,760
kick it off with a new random distribution they've picked and that am I building the

650
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:51,880
tension yet just get on with it man and that distribution is Linux Lite you know I was

651
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,880
actually really afraid I was gonna I was afraid that we were gonna end up with something really

652
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,280
weird like you know a NAS specific you know Linux distribution so when I click the button

653
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:06,440
and Linux Lite OS popped up it was it was actually kind of relieving because I was like

654
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:12,040
okay I can do this I can look at this OS and actually give honest feedback to what it would

655
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:17,860
be to somebody who's new to Linux I want to start with the minimum recommended specs for

656
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:24,060
this distro because it's it's billed as really lightweight and all you need for it is a one

657
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:31,380
gigahertz processor and 768 megabytes of RAM and I think even the recommended requirements

658
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:37,120
are something like a 1.5 gigahertz processor and two gigs of RAM that's recommended so

659
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:42,040
that's like when it will really scream Linux Academy recently sent me some USBs to give

660
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,560
away and these things are like two gigs in size they're tiny there's nothing you can

661
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:50,700
actually do with them so I have a bunch of them sitting around and I put Linux Lite on

662
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,960
it and I put it into the computer and I could actually run off of it like you could have

663
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:02,560
a functional OS on a 2 gig USB that you can now use that was amazing to me because I can't

664
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:07,480
even burn most ISOs on something under eight gigs at this point did it run well with the

665
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:12,300
live USB honestly yeah I did my daughter has this little bitty laptop that we bought on

666
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:17,140
sell on back Friday that I just regret because that thing runs like mud with you know real

667
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:22,980
specs to it it's the Lenovo something pad like the oldest version possible Linux Lite

668
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:29,360
was running off of this USB faster and more user friendly than that laptop has ever run

669
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:34,480
so did you get around to doing an actual native install on to the hard drive okay so this

670
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,100
one I kind of started getting out of my comfort zone because on that laptop I was running

671
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:44,920
fedora and because I give it to my kids I like having it as secure as possible so I

672
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:50,800
ended up leaving you at EUFI actually enabled on it and no problem with fedora but I couldn't

673
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:57,420
even get it to read the USB or boot up to Linux Lite OS without going back to legacy

674
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:02,620
boot so I don't know if that is a concern for some people I you know it really goes

675
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:07,240
back to how much work are you doing that requires security but I ended up going ahead and going

676
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:12,140
to the legacy going through the boot process you had told me that this was very similar

677
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:17,860
to the Ubuntu process I haven't gone through that so I can't speak to that but it was really

678
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:23,380
native it was very simple the English in which it asked how I'd like my install to happen

679
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:28,820
was very user friendly like somebody off the street who generally doesn't even really mess

680
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:34,100
with installs or even computers could understand what it was asking you know are you sure that

681
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:39,220
you actually want to erase everything on this drive and then you click yes and it says specifically

682
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:44,260
these are the areas that are going to be deleted if you accept this yes and it's like what

683
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:47,860
keyboard would you like and even gives you a little bar at the bottom so you can test

684
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:51,540
to make sure that your keyboard is functioning with the option that's chosen so you don't

685
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:56,260
go through the entire process and then find out later that you made a mistake the fact

686
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:00,860
that it prompts you to ask you about third-party drivers and Wi-Fi before you even get into

687
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:05,620
the mix I think eliminates a lot of the issues that people who are brand-new run into when

688
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:10,740
they kick an OS yeah so it uses the Ubiquiti installer which is the same installer that

689
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,540
Ubuntu uses and it's just as simple it may have some slight language tweaks like you

690
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:22,020
pointed out but yeah it's basically click next click next click next let's talk about

691
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:28,380
the first boot let's talk about your first experience did you spend any time in the Linux

692
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:33,020
Lite OS welcome screen I did and that's because this is kind of interesting so when I was

693
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:37,020
going through the boot process there was a little option that said you know do you want

694
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:41,460
to go ahead and install updates so I said yes I do you know why not do it all at one

695
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:46,140
point then it goes in and the little welcome screen shows up and it's like first thing

696
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:50,220
it says is to install updates and I'm thinking well I already did that but let's you know

697
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:54,220
hey I'm test driving this and I click the button and I was really surprised that there

698
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:58,540
were packages there that needed to be updated so I'm not sure what the disconnect is there

699
00:57:58,540 --> 00:58:02,580
did you happen to see that I didn't actually notice that because I did the same exact thing

700
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,480
but I skipped down because there's like four steps and I basically ignored that because

701
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,140
I had updated already and I went through the remaining steps but then so I was going through

702
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:15,540
the welcome screen and just kind of looking at all the different options and I do like

703
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:20,180
how you're picking as you're picking them it actually has information to what it is

704
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,220
that you're doing it doesn't just assume that if you're running updates or that if you're

705
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,700
choosing another one of the options that you are already going to know what that's going

706
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:32,060
to do does that make sense yeah it does it's very I found the language on this OS to be

707
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:40,580
very explicit it's very clear and it it assumes that you are new to Linux and I really love

708
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:47,580
that and this welcome screen probably my favorite welcome screen since Ubuntu Budgie's welcome

709
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:52,540
app because what this does it just guides you through every step it's you know install

710
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:58,140
updates install drivers set a restore point that's another cool thing is that it actually

711
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:03,700
suggests to you hey set a restore point so that you can have a backup down the road it's

712
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,340
like it knows you're going to screw it up at some point and then there's links to you

713
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:13,300
know all their support pages and forums and social media and they even have this hardware

714
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:18,620
compatibility database that's just for Linux lite OS there's thousands and thousands of

715
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:22,900
reports on there from people who have volunteered their their hardware information kind of similar

716
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:29,180
to what you get with the steam hardware survey so in your case like if you were you know

717
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:34,700
booting up that live USB you could click that hardware compatibility database and see if

718
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:40,060
your components or your system is perfectly supported by Linux lite I don't know if you

719
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:43,580
had a chance to open up the terminal when you did this but I find it interesting that

720
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,900
as soon as you open up the terminal there's actually a link to that same support guide

721
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:51,700
right there and I saw that throughout like you down the menu and they give you the support

722
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:56,700
docs so they're making the option of support like first and foremost through your entire

723
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:02,180
experience in the OS well if my support docs were this good I would want to link them everywhere

724
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:09,640
too the documentation for Linux lite is so good it's all super detailed and it's really

725
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:16,260
easy to follow there are visuals actual screenshots of everything you could possibly imagine you

726
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:21,500
know one of my qualms with so many Linux distros is that there's this lack of education about

727
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:26,540
all these different drivers that are out there for AMD and Nvidia and this breaks it down

728
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:31,820
in really simple language and it even has this section where it's like okay if you

729
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:36,460
want to if you don't know what graphics card you have do you have AMD do you have Nvidia

730
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:42,380
open up a terminal and type this and then there's tutorials on customizing it how to

731
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:47,420
use a VM how to use time shift to create and restore backups there's troubleshooting tips

732
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:56,260
and it's so well done and I flipped over to Zubuntu in a VM because I wanted to see okay

733
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:03,420
what's kind of the big XFCE based distro that would compete with this so I fired up

734
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:09,420
Zubuntu and I went into their documentation and it's just it's laid out very cleanly

735
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:14,620
but it's all text I don't think we can make light or even just kind of glaze over the

736
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:20,380
fact that how documented there are screenshots are I would argue that you could actually

737
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:25,320
take the text out of most of those support guides and still be able to know exactly what

738
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:30,160
you're supposed to be doing by going through those screenshots okay did you did you happen

739
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:36,760
to dig into the menus and notice something called light tweaks I did and that's because

740
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:41,560
so I actually went looking for it simply because whenever I opened up settings and configuration

741
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:46,420
files I don't know if you noticed but there's no minimize bar so I just assumed that I had

742
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:52,260
to go in and install it the way that I had with elementary OS so I was looking for that

743
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:57,940
setting and then suddenly realized that my computer and other options do have the minimize

744
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:02,540
bar it's kind of hit and miss on which ones do but that's how I ended up finding that

745
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:09,420
option so I really like this it's not the most attractive app but it's super useful

746
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:15,840
it's got I don't know 12 15 different tweaks that you can run you can fix your boot process

747
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:22,600
you can locate large files you can clean the Firefox cache it'll show you how much space

748
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:28,180
you'll clean out if you you know execute this tweak or this tweak what's really neat about

749
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:36,420
it is it shows you before you execute the tweak would you like to clean out 63 megabytes

750
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:41,860
of Firefox cache would you like to clear seven recent entries from your favorites menu and

751
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:45,580
so it's updating that in real time and I think that's really cool because when you're on

752
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:49,860
Windows you have to you know go into the you know right click the disk and hit properties

753
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:55,620
and then hit some other thing and and then run it and analyze it until finally it tells

754
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:59,540
you this is how much space you'll clear the light tweaks menu is the first time that I

755
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:04,180
saw something on this OS that I'm going okay this is targeted to more than just new people

756
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:09,420
because I don't know if you notice it actually has some higher level kind of Linux user experience

757
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:15,500
like installing new kernels removing new kernels things that I would say that I would always

758
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:20,180
do on the command line because I can't imagine a GUI running for me and then it grades like

759
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:24,700
how severe is this action is it something safe and I really can't hurt my system or

760
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:29,300
you know proceed with caution it's possible you're gonna break everything because I can

761
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:33,500
imagine somebody coming in here just be like oh what's a kernel I don't need it and removing

762
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:42,020
their kernel yeah so I mean you get the sense that they really thought about both beginners

763
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:47,220
but also power users I think this would be the first time that I've really thought that

764
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:51,980
of a Linux distribution that they're just like you know we're gonna include things that'll

765
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:57,340
be easy and make life easier for all of our users not just a specific category yeah it's

766
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:04,060
really it's it's a little confusing because when I see the words Linux Lite the image

767
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:10,060
that forms in my head is this lightweight stripped-down distro not a lot of apps installed

768
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:15,020
just you know bare minimums right Linux Lite bare minimums that's that's what I get in

769
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:19,620
my head but there's a lot of software even you know all the stuff that you mentioned

770
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:25,460
plus there's a lot of software that's pre-installed there's a GIMP and VLC and LibreOffice and

771
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:31,140
a bunch of other utilities and accessories that as you mentioned power users could really

772
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:37,060
take advantage of I was told you earlier that I was running pop OS and as much as I've loved

773
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:40,840
it one of the things that I had to do when I went in was go in and configure Firefox

774
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:45,420
so that I could actually watch certain videos on sites that I go to for training then in

775
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:48,500
this one that was one of the first things I did I'm like okay how much configuration

776
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:53,360
do I have to have on this to make it work out of the box and I clicked Firefox I went

777
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:58,660
to the site and the video is just loaded everything was already installed which is just confusing

778
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:03,820
to me on something that says it's a light install yeah it really makes me wonder you

779
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:08,600
know I don't know anything about Linux Lite's popularity or usage numbers or anything like

780
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:14,780
that but it may have it may actually suffer the same problem that I think XFCE suffers

781
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:20,740
is it it doesn't have that first impression that it needs you know with XFCE you get these

782
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:26,940
gray screenshots and it looks like it's from like the early 2000s and then you have a you

783
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:33,980
know Linux Lite based on Ubuntu 1804 and so immediately you think well is it is it just

784
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:38,500
a stripped down Ubuntu why would I want to use this I was imagining something like puppy

785
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:42,340
OS that's really what I was imagining when we first decided that we're gonna do this

786
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:47,340
challenge and I'm like okay Linux yeah all right I I'm going to have a hard time being

787
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:52,460
able to really get this up and running so that I can work off of it so that's kind of

788
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:56,180
why I went so many different ways trying to figure out how to install it and how to really

789
01:05:56,180 --> 01:06:00,740
provide feedback on it and I was blown out of the water I was really wrong with my first

790
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:05,140
impressions on it and I have to point out something here regarding the appearance when

791
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:11,560
you go into the customization options there are like 30 different desktop styles to choose

792
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:16,960
from built-in I was having fun with that just going down and be like there's XFCE winter

793
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:22,460
and XFCE purple I'm like all right let's just try all of these yeah that was a lot of fun

794
01:06:22,460 --> 01:06:27,640
and I love that I love that they include that many options without having to you know get

795
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:32,980
on the internet and download themes and make those tweaks on your own well I think we better

796
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:39,840
get out of here but we have one more thing to do what is next all right let me get the

797
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:46,740
screen up don't don't don't I'm gonna cross my fingers the winner is oh you have to stay

798
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:50,240
tuned to find out what distro they're going to pick next so the whole idea is they run

799
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:55,540
a rando spinner it picks a distro and then they give it a go oh so try probably trying

800
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:58,740
some things I would not have tried yeah things you and I were never gonna try on the show

801
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:05,060
now we get a chance to give them a go now I really hope they get Gentoo right out of

802
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:10,380
the gate is it is it actually called the rando spinner because if not it should be well we

803
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:13,140
should yeah I don't know actually don't know if I've gotten the name of it from them but

804
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:17,240
I like the idea so I think we'll be hearing from them in the future and if you have any

805
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:22,460
suggestions or feedback go to Linux unplug calm slash contact and let us know in there

806
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:27,020
let us know what you think I enjoyed it I think I was right I was right along with L

807
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:33,260
I thought it'd totally be like a puppy small like damn small Linux that's what I was expecting

808
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:37,780
that's what I was expecting anyways we have reached the end of our program and before

809
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:42,940
we get out of here I wanted to point you to an article that mr. bacon has worked on over

810
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:46,300
on the Linux unplugged website we'll have a link for this in the show notes as well

811
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:51,300
but you can also just go to Linux unplug calm slash articles and it is some behind the scenes

812
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:56,540
photos of our Linux fest events including the Friday stream in the studio which we had

813
01:07:56,540 --> 01:08:01,120
a great crowd in the studio you can see some pictures of mr. chase who's just looking incredible

814
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:06,180
these days he's lost 140 pounds I literally did not recognize the man until he opened

815
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:11,780
his mouth yeah and I heard the voice was like oh that's chase you kidding me amazing look

816
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:15,280
at that group there's some pictures of Alex in there chase work in the booth and of course

817
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:21,300
some of the rooms a letter talk Alex at his talk and some behind the scenes photos from

818
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:26,220
the barbecue as well all up on the website Linux unplug calm slash articles or there'll

819
01:08:26,220 --> 01:08:29,980
be a link in the notes wherever you consume those show notes we usually say the website

820
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:33,500
URL but then I realized most people listening they're checking on their phone app that's

821
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,780
really where they're looking at the notes is in the phone app because now we have it

822
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:40,720
in the feed because that's how we do now that's right well gentlemen thank you very much for

823
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:44,980
making it into studio it was great to have you so good to be here mumble room thank you

824
01:08:44,980 --> 01:08:49,440
guys for making it and mr. bacon is there any parting words we need to give people before

825
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:55,180
we get out here like a baby a plug for the Friday stream or something yeah Friday Friday

833
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:55,140
links subscriptions all of that and I hope to see you right back here next Tuesday

834
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:02,140
get it out of here

835
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:08,620
for people who like to mess with computers I do like to mess with computers thank you

836
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:16,060
episode 300 next oh boy whoo I haven't expected yeah I remember 300 or less and that was a

837
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:21,500
big deal yeah yeah yeah it's it's like you know it's not the first time he's got the

838
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,900
300 so it's like it's getting less of a big deal it's like the third or fourth time I've

839
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:32,220
gotten to 300 you blink and just sort of burp out 300 like come at me when I get to a thousand

840
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:41,020
you know burping out podcast there's another one so I next year we're gonna have to uh

841
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:46,220
race uh our little tiny hawks right oh yes oh yeah definitely Jeff Jeff yes is that what

842
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:50,060
they're called tiny hawks yeah the model is that specific model is yeah I have to buy

843
01:10:50,060 --> 01:10:53,900
some I mean these just seem aggressive so I warn you now a drug habit will be cheaper

844
01:10:53,900 --> 01:11:01,580
than fpv yeah so the drones themselves are 150 or so okay um then you need the batteries

845
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:06,300
which can be 10 to 20 bucks a pop and they have a flight time of two to three minutes

846
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:11,980
so you need five or ten of them geez to have any kind of you know Jeff had three for example

847
01:11:11,980 --> 01:11:16,060
and he had lots of downtime in between yeah which can be annoying um and then you need

848
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:20,780
the radio which is 200 and then you need the goggles which can be two to five hundred dollars

849
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:25,340
so you know proper hobby then you need to you need to set aside at least a thousand

850
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:28,540
to get into it and then you're going to want another quad for when the first one breaks

851
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:32,940
sure of course or some dog gets it well the uh the emax tiny hawk has a little bundle

852
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:37,260
it's uh right around 200 bucks comes with everything but it's not uh not a hobby grade

853
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:43,500
radio not hobby grade goggles but it'll get you started okay I think I probably uh I won't

854
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:54,220
I won't say I spent more money than I told my wife I spent yeah yeah every every time

855
01:11:54,220 --> 01:11:58,540
but uh yeah so there's the little tiny ones like Jeff had but then there's also the five

856
01:11:58,540 --> 01:12:04,220
inch racing drones which you can build yourself um out of components from China and and that's

857
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:08,540
for me I learned a lot of my electronic skills through doing that um when you plug a 12 volt

858
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:12,620
thing into a five volt thing and it goes bang and lets out the magic smoke it stops working

859
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:18,060
yeah okay that is a good that is a good way to learn if maybe just a little bit expensive

860
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:23,820
but a point which you made very well in your talk was that's why in your travels you have

861
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:28,860
found components that you can assemble that you are willing to have blow up on you so

862
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:33,660
that way instead of losing a 60 dollar part you're losing a six dollar part correct yes

863
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:39,740
so the most expensive component on an FPV drone is probably at most 30 each you know

864
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:44,300
each each motor is about 20 the flight control is probably the most expensive at around 30

865
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:50,380
or 40 dollars at most so if any if any single component goes bang then it's not that annoying

866
01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:53,900
if you fly your drone off into a lake then you've lost three four hundred dollars and

867
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:58,300
that that is annoying it's like what Alex always says I mean this is he's famous for

868
01:12:58,300 --> 01:13:13,660
saying this uh if you can think it you can do it yeah you just have to know how
