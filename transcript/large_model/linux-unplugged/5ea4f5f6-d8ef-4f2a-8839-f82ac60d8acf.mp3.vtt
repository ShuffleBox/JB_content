WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:10.240
You know, I have been on a steady march to make things more hardware-based, and I just,

00:10.240 --> 00:19.720
for the first time, found a four-port HDMI switcher that does green screen and multiple

00:19.720 --> 00:25.060
cameras, multiple feeds with transition fader bars and everything, all hardware-based.

00:25.060 --> 00:30.660
A lot of the camera-switching functionality that we use in Wirecast, all hardware-based

00:30.660 --> 00:32.200
for $1,000.

00:32.200 --> 00:38.280
Now when I first started podcasting, the same unit with only two HD, they weren't even HDMI,

00:38.280 --> 00:43.240
the same unit with two HD inputs was $15,000.

00:43.240 --> 00:47.720
That sucker now at $1,000, that might happen next year.

00:47.720 --> 00:53.400
I might eventually get that, and then that is going to be such a key piece to replacing

00:53.400 --> 00:57.120
the Wirecast machine, not only that, but also to have something like that on the road would

00:57.120 --> 01:00.640
be amazing, because, you know, I don't know if you guys probably all noticed if you watched

01:00.640 --> 01:06.140
the video version, but we used OBS this week, or OBS as they call it.

01:06.140 --> 01:12.120
We used OBS to do the live broadcast of Linux Action Show and the live event on an Ubuntu

01:12.120 --> 01:19.600
14.04 system 76 rig, and, you know, we got bit by lip sync issues that were kind of a

01:19.600 --> 01:20.600
bummer.

01:20.600 --> 01:27.760
But one of the things, when you don't do video production, that you don't realize is an issue

01:27.760 --> 01:30.640
until someone tells you, and you're like, oh yeah, obviously that's an issue.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.240
But you don't think about it until you do video production.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.040
But if you've got a box, say a PC, right?

01:35.040 --> 01:37.360
And it's got three cameras coming into it.

01:37.360 --> 01:42.640
One is a 1080p or 720p, doesn't matter, let's just say it's a 720p.

01:42.640 --> 01:50.560
One is a 720p Logitech webcam coming in at 30 frames per second exactly, 3.0 FPS exact.

01:50.560 --> 01:55.360
Another camera coming into your rig is an HDMI capture card.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.520
That's 1080i interlaced even, right?

01:58.520 --> 02:01.080
And it's coming in at 60 frames per second.

02:01.080 --> 02:05.320
Actually not 60, it's coming in at 59.94 frames per second.

02:05.320 --> 02:10.840
And then you've got a desktop shot that's coming from a PC that is a 1080p picture at

02:10.840 --> 02:14.640
exactly 29.97 frames per second.

02:14.640 --> 02:19.000
And then you've got a chat room shot that is on the same machine as the Wirecast machine

02:19.000 --> 02:22.600
that is exactly coming in at 30 frames per second at variable resolution depending on

02:22.600 --> 02:24.280
how you size the window.

02:24.280 --> 02:28.880
And Wirecast very intelligently brings all of this together plus an independent audio

02:28.880 --> 02:34.100
source, manages to try to figure out the timing on them the best possible, automatically mixes

02:34.100 --> 02:37.040
all of that together and records it and sends it out.

02:37.040 --> 02:43.640
And it is truly black magic because each camera and each device are all operating at different

02:43.640 --> 02:47.760
times, at different resolutions, at different frame rates, and then at the same time it's

02:47.760 --> 02:52.200
bringing that all together with an audio interface which is, you know, zero latency, right?

02:52.200 --> 02:56.520
So you've got USB which has inherent latency because those web cameras have an H.264 encoder

02:56.520 --> 02:57.800
in them which adds latency.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.320
And then you have the bandwidth limitations of the USB bus, right?

03:00.320 --> 03:04.400
And then you're also between that switching to an HDMI camera which is sitting on the

03:04.400 --> 03:09.160
PCI Express bus coming in as fast as that HDMI port can blast the data into the PCI

03:09.160 --> 03:12.360
Express bus which is way faster than that USB web camera.

03:12.360 --> 03:16.240
And then you have that coming in to a screen cap which is going to be variable based on

03:16.240 --> 03:21.000
the CPU load of the machine that's doing the screen cap.

03:21.000 --> 03:25.000
And it brings it all together so seamlessly that we forget that you have to fight problems

03:25.000 --> 03:26.720
like lip sync and issues like that.

03:26.720 --> 03:32.820
So when you sit down and use OBS, you know, you basically lose seven years of black magic

03:32.820 --> 03:35.440
and you kind of have to manually punch those.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.560
So you know for 15 minutes before we started the live stream, 20 minutes or whatever it

03:38.560 --> 03:45.800
was, we're sitting there adjusting the millisecond delay and then asking people and production

03:45.800 --> 03:48.720
like Rekai back here at the studio, okay, what did you hear first?

03:48.720 --> 03:49.720
The clap or the sound?

03:49.720 --> 03:51.880
Did you hear the sound first or did you see the clap first?

03:51.880 --> 03:55.560
And then they tell us and then we adjust it another 10 milliseconds.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.480
Can you imagine what an animal you feel like when you're doing that?

03:58.480 --> 04:01.440
Versus Wirecast where you just plug it all in and it just does it all.

04:01.440 --> 04:02.440
Wow.

04:02.440 --> 04:03.440
Yeah.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.440
So I mean there's still a huge gap.

04:04.440 --> 04:08.800
So I'm looking at this hardware mixer that would handle these kinds of things and $1,000

04:08.800 --> 04:09.800
and I'm done with a Mac.

04:09.800 --> 04:10.800
Right.

04:10.800 --> 04:11.800
Woo!

04:11.800 --> 04:12.800
I'm excited about that.

04:12.800 --> 04:13.800
I think that's going to be a 2016 purchase for J.B.

04:13.800 --> 04:14.800
That's really exciting.

04:14.800 --> 04:15.800
Yeah.

04:15.800 --> 04:16.800
Yeah.

04:16.800 --> 04:17.800
Yes.

04:17.800 --> 04:18.800
But would Stallman approve of the hardware mixer?

04:18.800 --> 04:19.800
Yeah.

04:19.800 --> 04:20.800
I don't know.

04:20.800 --> 04:21.800
I mean you could always...

04:21.800 --> 04:22.800
So happy hacking.

04:22.800 --> 04:23.800
You can hack it, right?

04:23.800 --> 04:24.800
So that's cool.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.800
I think Stallman just feels in general...

04:25.800 --> 04:28.920
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.560
Now I don't want to put words into his mouth but I have a feeling he's probably said that

04:31.560 --> 04:32.560
before.

04:32.560 --> 04:33.560
Yeah.

04:33.560 --> 04:34.560
Probably.

04:34.560 --> 04:35.560
Probably.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.800
I wanted to see, boy, you know, it's too bad Wimpy's not here today.

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
I know.

04:38.800 --> 04:42.080
He's probably busy doing Wimpy things but...

04:42.080 --> 04:43.080
Making those distributions.

04:43.080 --> 04:44.080
Yeah.

04:44.080 --> 04:47.160
So maybe he's so busy responding to this ultimate new competition.

04:47.160 --> 04:50.600
I don't know if you heard about this, UUmate is a respin of Ubuntu Mate 15.10.

04:50.600 --> 04:51.600
Whoa.

04:51.600 --> 04:52.600
Only it aims to be better.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.600
Better.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.560
I think we'll let our audience be the judge of that.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.560
Yeah.

04:56.560 --> 04:57.560
So here's what it does.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.640
And actually, since Wimpy's not here, I'm going to just say this.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.720
I kind of do like these additions but I'm not sure.

05:01.720 --> 05:06.000
You could just do it to a regular Mate install but the highlights of UU Mate include Google

05:06.000 --> 05:07.560
Chrome as the web browser.

05:07.560 --> 05:08.560
Right.

05:08.560 --> 05:09.560
Right.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.560
Right.

05:10.560 --> 05:11.560
You've instantly got Chris right there.

05:11.560 --> 05:12.560
Yep.

05:12.560 --> 05:13.560
Yep.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.560
So you're going to be watching them on Netflixes.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.400
KDN Live video editor.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.880
Now here's the thing I thought was neat.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.080
Peer Guardian privacy oriented firewall built in.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.080
Wow.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.080
That's pretty heavy.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.080
Steam included.

05:24.080 --> 05:26.960
Now Wimpy's got these things with one click away with the welcome screen so it's not a

05:26.960 --> 05:27.960
little bit.

05:27.960 --> 05:28.960
Yes he does.

05:28.960 --> 05:29.960
Yes he does.

05:29.960 --> 05:30.960
Sync thing automatically set up.

05:30.960 --> 05:31.960
Hey, I like that.

05:31.960 --> 05:32.960
Team viewer remote control software installed and ready to go.

05:32.960 --> 05:38.080
Wine 1.7 Comp is turned on as well as numerous sound effects enabled by default.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.080
You know what?

05:39.080 --> 05:40.080
Not sure how I feel about that last one but...

05:40.080 --> 05:41.080
You know what?

05:41.080 --> 05:42.080
If they're Star Trek sounds I'll do it.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.080
Yes.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.080
or nothing.

05:44.080 --> 05:45.080
Yes, there you go.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.320
That's why I hate the Windows sounds.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.320
It's not Star Trek.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.320
Yeah, right.

05:48.320 --> 05:51.120
So the UU-Mate competition is on.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.120
It is fierce.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.120
I don't know.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.640
We'll see if maybe Wimpy shows up.

05:54.640 --> 05:55.640
We can get his take on it.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.440
I think it's going to be a battle royale.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.360
Yeah, with the users as the winners.

05:59.360 --> 06:00.360
That's right.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.360
That's West, man.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.740
That's freaking poetic.

06:03.740 --> 06:20.000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 119 for November 17, 2015.

06:20.000 --> 06:24.800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, episode 119 of Jupiter Broadcasting's weekly Linux talk show.

06:24.800 --> 06:28.700
It's hoping that we don't get blown away by this crazy windstorm.

06:28.700 --> 06:29.700
My name is Chris.

06:29.700 --> 06:30.700
My name is Wes.

06:30.700 --> 06:32.240
Now, Wes, it is ridiculous.

06:32.240 --> 06:35.240
I've been getting reports from all over the area.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.800
And right now, as we're sitting here recording this show, I would not be surprised, honestly,

06:37.800 --> 06:38.800
if the power goes out.

06:38.800 --> 06:39.800
No, I wouldn't either.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.800
That's what I woke up to this morning.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.800
Yeah.

06:41.800 --> 06:42.800
So it's really a luxury to have power now.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.680
Now, here's the great part is the way that video codecs work is there's pretty much no

06:45.680 --> 06:49.240
chance we'll be able to save this file if the recording is lost.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.760
If the power goes out, we'll lose the recording.

06:50.760 --> 06:51.760
So it's just going to be the live people.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.760
Well, I'm streaming.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.760
You're lucky today.

06:53.760 --> 06:54.760
All right.

06:54.760 --> 06:57.480
Well, coming up on today's episode of Linux Unplugged, yes, I'm back from Colorado.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.420
I went to System 76.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.360
And we have a great show planned for you today.

07:01.360 --> 07:05.920
And we're going to start with something I've been mulling around for a little bit.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.840
And maybe, sure, true, could be that Alan Jude chat room.

07:08.840 --> 07:09.840
Ping Alan Jude right now.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.960
Tell him we're about to talk about Docker.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.840
See what he thinks about that.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.920
So Docker is obviously a phenomenon.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.060
In fact, DockerCon just happened.

07:18.060 --> 07:21.560
And there's a lot of different people out there that are trying to solve a whole ass

07:21.560 --> 07:25.960
ton of issues that we have ran into now that Docker is a thing.

07:25.960 --> 07:28.920
And mostly, it's around security issues.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.720
There are rampant security problems with Docker containers.

07:31.720 --> 07:37.360
In fact, if you look at just Heartbleed, there's still a massive percentage of Docker containers

07:37.360 --> 07:39.160
that are vulnerable to Heartbleed.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.160
That's embarrassing.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.160
We created ourselves a huge mess.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.560
We're going to talk about that today on Linux Unplugged.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.000
And then, SteamOS is getting off to a rocky start.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
A lot of bad reviews.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.320
Ars Technica has said it is the worst performer out there.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.420
Is SteamOS doomed?

07:51.420 --> 07:53.440
Or maybe have they gotten it a little wrong?

07:53.440 --> 07:57.240
And then last but not least, our Mumble Room is going to check in with their report on

07:57.240 --> 07:59.880
using OpenSUSE Leap for a few weeks.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.880
We're going to get it straight from the horse's mouth.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.200
We got a whole flock of horses.

08:04.200 --> 08:05.200
Is that what you call them?

08:05.200 --> 08:06.200
Lovely, lovely flock of horses.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.200
Is that what you call a bunch of horses?

08:07.200 --> 08:08.200
Oh, that's what we call them.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.200
A flock?

08:09.200 --> 08:10.200
Yep.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.200
Is that right?

08:11.200 --> 08:12.200
Nope.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.200
Not at all.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.200
OK.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.200
All right.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.200
We're going to talk about that in today's episode of Linux Unplugged.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.200
So let's bring in that virtual lug.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.200
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.200
Hello.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.200
Hello.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.200
Hello.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.200
Hello.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.200
Hello.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.200
Oh, jeez.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.200
Holy crap.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.200
All right.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.200
Everybody stop pinging Alan in the chat room.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.200
Maybe too good.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.200
That's too much.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.200
Alan, we're sorry.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.200
We're sorry, Alan.

08:31.200 --> 08:32.200
I love you.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.200
I'm sorry.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.200
Double tech snap tomorrow.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.200
All right.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.200
So coming up.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.200
All right.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.200
So all right.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.560
So coming up now, we've got to talk about Docker because this is I'm not I don't want

08:40.560 --> 08:43.760
to have one of these episodes where we kind of rant and rave too much.

08:43.760 --> 08:45.480
But it is getting ridiculous.

08:45.480 --> 08:46.480
You guys.

08:46.480 --> 08:49.480
I mean, my inner curmudgeon is screaming these days.

08:49.480 --> 08:50.480
Guys.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.480
What?

08:51.480 --> 08:52.480
What?

08:52.480 --> 08:53.480
You like that?

08:53.480 --> 08:54.480
You like that my curmudgeon is screaming?

08:54.480 --> 08:55.480
That's what half the people are here for.

08:55.480 --> 08:56.480
I know, right?

08:56.480 --> 08:57.480
All right.

08:57.480 --> 09:00.560
And so let's start with a couple of big news items.

09:00.560 --> 09:04.960
The daddy of Debian is joining the unstoppable Docker crusade.

09:04.960 --> 09:08.240
Ian Murdoch has joined the Linux container shop Docker.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.040
He founded Debian in 1993.

09:10.040 --> 09:13.160
He led the project for three years during his birth.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.840
And he's taken up a position as a member of Docker's technical staff.

09:16.840 --> 09:18.080
Story number one.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.600
And I illustrate that story to just give you an idea of the hype surrounding this Docker

09:21.600 --> 09:22.600
thing.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.600
The momentum that has really.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.600
Yeah.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.600
Thank you.

09:25.600 --> 09:29.840
So starting today from the core OS project, which we've talked about a lot on Linux unplugged,

09:29.840 --> 09:33.120
they have launched Claire.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.400
Claire is an open source tool for monitoring container security.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.320
Now you go, oh, that seems like a good idea, right?

09:39.320 --> 09:40.320
Probably want to monitor.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.320
Yes, it does.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.320
Sure.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.320
I like monitoring security.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.320
Is my security secure?

09:44.320 --> 09:45.320
I don't know.

09:45.320 --> 09:46.320
You got to have good security.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.320
I need Claire.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.320
Exactly.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
You got to have clarity.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.320
Oh, yes.

09:50.320 --> 09:51.320
They should hire you on to do jingles.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.320
They totally should.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.320
Core OS says that over eight.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.880
Now, I'm not I'm not making this up.

09:54.880 --> 09:59.840
Eighty percent of Docker images are still vulnerable to the heartbeat.

09:59.840 --> 10:00.840
Heartbleed.

10:00.840 --> 10:01.840
Bug.

10:01.840 --> 10:02.840
Geez.

10:02.840 --> 10:03.840
Hello.

10:03.840 --> 10:04.840
You can't even say that.

10:04.840 --> 10:05.840
That's how vulnerable you are.

10:05.840 --> 10:06.840
Heartbleed bug.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.840
Heartbleed.

10:07.840 --> 10:13.360
And this, you know, I don't even I don't even have to say it, but honestly, this is egregious.

10:13.360 --> 10:15.160
It is disgusting.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.160
And I can see how this would happen.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.160
Yep.

10:18.160 --> 10:23.120
And somebody who who's a little lazy, you know, I have a couple of Docker images laying

10:23.120 --> 10:26.360
around that I honestly haven't updated since the first day I deployed them.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.760
I think that happens a lot.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.320
A lot, a lot.

10:29.320 --> 10:35.080
And here we are deploying Docker like crazy, just like we've deployed home routers and

10:35.080 --> 10:38.640
all of these other little Internet of Things devices that we don't actually know how they

10:38.640 --> 10:39.640
work.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.640
And so you don't even bother.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.640
You don't even think about it.

10:41.640 --> 10:42.640
Right.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.440
In fact, the whole appeal to Docker is, well, it's a static environment.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.760
You don't have to peek inside.

10:45.760 --> 10:46.760
It just works.

10:46.760 --> 10:47.760
Yeah.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.760
They configured it for you.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.360
I can update my host OS, but the static little container doesn't change.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.360
That's the whole appeal to Docker.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.360
Yes, it is.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.360
Right.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.240
Which is another way of saying, this is this little area of my machine I'm never going

10:56.240 --> 10:57.240
to update.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.240
Yep.

10:58.240 --> 10:59.240
That's what you're saying.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.240
I'm not worried about it.

11:00.240 --> 11:01.240
It does what it does.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.240
And it becomes a deployment methodology.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.240
Right.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.240
It becomes a way to manage risk.

11:04.240 --> 11:05.240
Right.

11:05.240 --> 11:06.380
You never hear about making Docker containers.

11:06.380 --> 11:08.000
You just hear about downloading them.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yes.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Or keeping them up to date.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.260
And I wonder, like, what's the plan here?

11:13.260 --> 11:14.840
What are we going to do here?

11:14.840 --> 11:20.440
And it feels like everybody is scrambling to come up with an answer to this problem.

11:20.440 --> 11:24.360
In fact, even Docker themselves, they are looking at this particular issue.

11:24.360 --> 11:27.400
Docker has added a hardware signing feature.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.400
You ready for this?

11:28.400 --> 11:29.400
Remember how you were saying about buying one of these?

11:29.400 --> 11:30.400
Yes, I was.

11:30.400 --> 11:31.400
Yubikey.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.400
Hey.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.400
Yubikey.

11:33.400 --> 11:37.520
A device that we all are very familiar with here on the show.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.160
And this is their solution.

11:39.160 --> 11:42.960
Docker has already implemented the update framework, a method of confirming that a digital

11:42.960 --> 11:46.720
signature applied to a container image in a repository matches the signature of code

11:46.720 --> 11:48.760
arriving at the enterprise's Docker system.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.260
So they finally have signing.

11:50.260 --> 11:51.260
This is good.

11:51.260 --> 11:52.260
This is good.

11:52.260 --> 11:53.260
Now, Yubikey.

11:53.260 --> 11:56.600
With Yubikey 4, this is where you could have two-factor authentication that requires the

11:56.600 --> 11:59.800
device to recognize the user's fingerprint before it will issue the identification.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.720
I don't quite understand how they're going to work this in.

12:01.720 --> 12:05.800
But Docker, this happened at DockerCon, they announced a new layer in code and identify

12:05.800 --> 12:07.880
a confirming process.

12:07.880 --> 12:13.800
Developers and system administrators can use a keychain, a keychain fob, like the Yubikey

12:13.800 --> 12:14.800
4.

12:14.800 --> 12:15.800
It's got to be the Yubikey 4.

12:15.800 --> 12:16.800
It cannot be an earlier version.

12:16.800 --> 12:21.600
They have to go to the USB port on a laptop or a workstation to upload their unique identifier

12:21.600 --> 12:23.240
to the container and authenticate.

12:23.240 --> 12:27.560
As the code moves along its journey to a production system, the identifier continually ensures

12:27.560 --> 12:31.700
the recipient that only the identified hands have touched the code.

12:31.700 --> 12:35.800
So it verifies the entire chain and at the end with the Yubikey.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.520
Pretty fascinating stuff.

12:37.520 --> 12:44.760
But one of the demos from DockerCon was that the developer had a set of private keys that

12:44.760 --> 12:50.280
were generated from a root Yubikey in the developer's shop.

12:50.280 --> 12:55.060
The developer then decided in their wisdom to commit those private keys to the public

12:55.060 --> 12:56.060
GitHub.

12:56.060 --> 12:57.060
Oh, joy.

12:57.060 --> 12:58.060
As a backup.

12:58.060 --> 12:59.060
Yeah, yeah, sure.

12:59.060 --> 13:00.060
That was the demo.

13:00.060 --> 13:04.720
So what they showed in the demo was that with the Yubikey, they were able to rotate the

13:04.720 --> 13:11.060
master keys and turn off those developer's private keys and therefore make it in so that

13:11.060 --> 13:13.160
he wasn't able to push to the hub.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.160
No kidding.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.400
The hub just by rotating those keys.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.480
So some really nice features.

13:19.480 --> 13:26.240
Also they announced something called Project Nautilus and that was, I think, the reason

13:26.240 --> 13:28.440
that CoreOS have open sourced Clare.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.360
Ah, you think it was a response to Nautilus?

13:31.360 --> 13:34.940
I reckon they knew about it and thought, right, we've wasted all this time, let's just make

13:34.940 --> 13:36.740
it open source.

13:36.740 --> 13:39.520
I'm not a cynic, I promise.

13:39.520 --> 13:42.520
So what's Project Nautilus?

13:42.520 --> 13:50.440
Yeah, what Project Nautilus does is it gives you a very cool dashboard and it analyzes

13:50.440 --> 13:56.480
the layers and it does static binary analysis in each Docker container.

13:56.480 --> 14:02.160
So it'll look at the version of curl, you've got the version of open SSL and it will say

14:02.160 --> 14:07.700
against a vulnerability database that Docker maintain themselves.

14:07.700 --> 14:11.800
They were quite hazy on these details, which are obviously very important when it comes

14:11.800 --> 14:13.720
to security.

14:13.720 --> 14:19.960
But they maintain this database themselves of vulnerabilities and what they were saying

14:19.960 --> 14:26.660
to me earlier was that if there's a vulnerability in upstream, for example, and that's the container

14:26.660 --> 14:35.480
I've based off of, what will then happen as a child container, I will get a notification

14:35.480 --> 14:40.860
saying, hey, your container is now vulnerable because of this upstream vulnerability.

14:40.860 --> 14:46.240
It's okay, we fixed it, but you now need to kick off a new build on your machine.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.240
Of course, right.

14:47.240 --> 14:48.240
Yeah, you would.

14:48.240 --> 14:58.800
So it's not going to automatically fix the 80% of images, which are vulnerable.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.300
But it's a good start.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.400
So I'm just going to drop a link into the chat of the interface.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.400
Thank you.

15:04.400 --> 15:05.400
Yeah.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.920
I put it in the IRC too if you're logged in because that'd be really handy.

15:06.920 --> 15:07.920
What did you find there, Wes?

15:07.920 --> 15:08.920
What's that?

15:08.920 --> 15:09.920
You digging around on that?

15:09.920 --> 15:10.920
Oh, there you are.

15:10.920 --> 15:11.920
You're digging around on it right now.

15:11.920 --> 15:12.920
Yes, I am.

15:12.920 --> 15:13.920
Cool.

15:13.920 --> 15:14.920
Yeah.

15:14.920 --> 15:15.920
I'll put a link to this in the chat room too.

15:15.920 --> 15:16.920
That is actually really good to hear.

15:16.920 --> 15:17.920
And thank you.

15:17.920 --> 15:18.920
You know what?

15:18.920 --> 15:22.880
It is really kismet on the timing there that he went to DockerCon and showed up.

15:22.880 --> 15:23.880
It really is perfect.

15:23.880 --> 15:24.960
That's what I love about our virtual lug.

15:24.960 --> 15:28.280
If you go to a conference or an event like this or even your lug and want to come and

15:28.280 --> 15:29.400
share with our lug.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.400
We would love that.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.400
Yeah, we would.

15:31.400 --> 15:32.400
Yeah, we really would.

15:32.400 --> 15:37.120
I'm sat in my hotel room in Barcelona waiting for my flight tomorrow and I had nothing better

15:37.120 --> 15:38.120
to do.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.120
Thank you.

15:39.120 --> 15:43.800
We really do because it was in Spain this year and we were just talking a little bit

15:43.800 --> 15:44.800
ago.

15:44.800 --> 15:51.080
It's going to be in Seattle in 2016 on June 20th to the 21st and I'm already kind of thinking

15:51.080 --> 15:53.360
why do I do that, dude?

15:53.360 --> 15:54.360
I don't know.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.360
Wes and I.

15:55.360 --> 15:56.360
I take it as a compliment.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.360
After about a year, I'll get it.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.360
We'll get it right.

15:58.360 --> 15:59.360
Yeah.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.160
Wes and I, I really think Wes and I are going to go to this.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.280
If you can get it from work.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.280
Yes, absolutely.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.280
You think?

16:04.280 --> 16:06.680
I think whatever, six months is plenty of time to do it.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.360
June 20th to the 21st in Seattle.

16:08.360 --> 16:12.800
Maybe you can come meet Wes and I and we'll go down there and walk around and go to DockerCon.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.720
This year it was in Spain, so it was not very practical for us to go.

16:15.720 --> 16:16.720
I like Spain.

16:16.720 --> 16:20.880
Yeah, so thank you very much for going there and giving us kind of the report on that.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.520
That was pretty cool.

16:23.520 --> 16:31.560
I was thinking back on why I started using Scale Engine to host Jupiter Broadcasting.

16:31.560 --> 16:39.040
So it started as, the thing about a podcast is sometimes certain episodes are very popular.

16:39.040 --> 16:43.960
And so all of a sudden you have a huge spike in CPU and bandwidth and all of that transfer.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.960
At times that you probably can't really predict.

16:46.960 --> 16:47.960
Right.

16:47.960 --> 16:51.560
And so I kept getting screwed.

16:51.560 --> 16:52.560
This is before DigitalOcean.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.200
I just kept getting so screwed.

16:54.200 --> 16:55.800
When you paid for a fixed amount a month.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.760
And even paid for CPU usage.

16:57.760 --> 17:04.040
And so Alan came along and I remember at the time thinking his pricing was unbelievable.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.980
How could it be so low?

17:05.980 --> 17:06.980
What is he like?

17:06.980 --> 17:08.120
Can he really deliver?

17:08.120 --> 17:09.120
Is this over served?

17:09.120 --> 17:10.600
And do you know how he did it?

17:10.600 --> 17:11.820
His jails.

17:11.820 --> 17:16.960
Because he could give you metal performance at really low cost to him.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.680
He didn't have to spin up a virtual environment.

17:18.680 --> 17:24.580
An entire operating system that emulates virtual hardware or tries to use a hypervisor that

17:24.580 --> 17:27.560
translates between physical and virtual hardware.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.200
He just did a jail.

17:29.200 --> 17:36.000
And honestly it's the same exact thing that makes Docker so appealing to Linux users.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.920
Is you can create a Docker container.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.800
And it is an isolated environment.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.800
And all of these things.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.680
So you want to have a certain version of PHP?

17:42.680 --> 17:43.680
Have that at Haas.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.680
You can have your specific version.

17:44.680 --> 17:45.680
It doesn't conflict.

17:45.680 --> 17:46.680
Yeah.

17:46.680 --> 17:47.680
Exactly.

17:47.680 --> 17:48.680
So that I remember.

17:48.680 --> 17:51.440
Now honestly though FreeBSD had that years ago.

17:51.440 --> 17:52.440
Yeah.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.440
It's been stable.

17:53.440 --> 17:58.120
What Docker did though, and I think it's such an important thing for us to understand.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.000
And I think if you're curious about this at all.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.760
What Docker did is they closed that 10%.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.640
And I like to say this on other shows.

18:06.640 --> 18:09.240
They closed the uncanny valley.

18:09.240 --> 18:14.480
In CG they have the uncanny valley on movies where you can kind of tell it's CG but it's

18:14.480 --> 18:15.480
like really close.

18:15.480 --> 18:16.480
It's a little too.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.480
It makes you...

18:17.480 --> 18:18.480
It's just freaky.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.480
It's weird.

18:19.480 --> 18:20.480
It makes you uncomfortable.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.480
Yeah it does.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.480
Totally.

18:22.480 --> 18:25.840
It's like between where Jails was and Docker is.

18:25.840 --> 18:26.840
Maybe Zones.

18:26.840 --> 18:27.840
Solaris Zones did that too.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.840
Yes.

18:28.840 --> 18:29.840
Totally.

18:29.840 --> 18:30.840
Absolutely it does.

18:30.840 --> 18:34.000
And so Docker closed that uncanny valley with that like GitHub like approach of publishing

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
images.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.360
It very fits in today's deployment development culture.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.280
And that was all it took right.

18:39.280 --> 18:43.880
Just like Apple famously will, oh my gosh it's so revolutionary what Apple's doing.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.880
When in reality like us nerds are like, dude other people have been doing that for years.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.480
They just put the pieces together at the right time.

18:49.480 --> 18:51.960
And a lot of us nerds are like, well I'll put the pieces together myself.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.520
It's no big deal.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.920
But they will close that gap.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.260
And that's what Docker did.

18:56.260 --> 19:00.680
And so container technology was not totally new.

19:00.680 --> 19:05.600
I mean even Chirude environments existed under Linux and LXC containers.

19:05.600 --> 19:09.240
But Docker came along and just put it all together in this nice package.

19:09.240 --> 19:15.140
And the problem with that is it also made it way more accessible and way more deployable.

19:15.140 --> 19:17.840
And so you've got guys like me who go deploy smoke ping containers.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.320
Don't really know what they're doing.

19:19.320 --> 19:20.320
Yeah.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.320
What this Linux thing doesn't...

19:21.320 --> 19:25.200
You know I go to play a smoke ping Docker container and then I don't touch it for a

19:25.200 --> 19:26.200
year.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.200
Right.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.200
And now it's sitting out there.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.200
Living there in the public.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.200
Yeah.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.200
Public facing.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.200
Yes.

19:32.200 --> 19:33.200
And so that I don't know where to take this.

19:33.200 --> 19:36.920
And I wonder Wes do you figure is this one of these issues that just sort of sorts itself

19:36.920 --> 19:39.960
out over time or is this...

19:39.960 --> 19:45.160
What I worry about is will Linux become known as the platform that hosts a bunch of outdated

19:45.160 --> 19:46.160
shit.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.160
Right.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.160
What do you think?

19:48.160 --> 19:49.160
I mean in some senses we are already.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.160
Right.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.160
I mean there are those communities.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.160
I think a lot of the...

19:52.160 --> 19:53.160
Yeah.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.160
A percent of Docker containers are vulnerable to heart bleed that have open SSL.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.760
I think there's a lot of enterprises that are working on removing a lot of older Debian

19:57.760 --> 19:58.760
hosts in particular.

19:58.760 --> 19:59.760
Older Ubuntu installations.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.760
Yeah.

20:00.760 --> 20:01.760
Right.

20:01.760 --> 20:03.260
And you get stuck on these things.

20:03.260 --> 20:04.480
Same true with Windows.

20:04.480 --> 20:05.480
Same as...

20:05.480 --> 20:06.480
Yes.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.480
Very much so.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.480
So it's not just a Linux problem.

20:08.480 --> 20:09.480
Like the Windows 3.1 that brought down France last week.

20:09.480 --> 20:12.360
My work runs Oracle...

20:12.360 --> 20:16.240
My work runs Oracle Linux 5 and they want to use Docker.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.540
Wow.

20:17.540 --> 20:19.120
Oracle Linux 5 would be what?

20:19.120 --> 20:26.300
on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, I guess, which would be three versions old now, which would

20:26.300 --> 20:35.380
be almost seven years, I think. I don't know exactly. Wow. Wow. That is really something.

20:35.380 --> 20:39.040
I do think, though, that there's been a lot of very good attention recently to both Linux

20:39.040 --> 20:45.240
community and in Docker, you know, that that we need to have at least, you can't force

20:45.240 --> 20:50.880
what people do. It's definitely an issue they're taking seriously. They devoted at

20:50.880 --> 20:56.240
least half their sessions today to security. They're aware of it. They're on it. I think

20:56.240 --> 21:00.060
it'll take time. I think we also have community players, like CoreOS in particular, that really

21:00.060 --> 21:03.400
do take security very seriously. And they're pushing Docker. Right. They're pushing Docker.

21:03.400 --> 21:08.800
They're pushing containerization. But I think they're doing it in a very open way and helping

21:08.800 --> 21:15.160
provide the community tools that they can use. Yeah. It's actually, it is a great example

21:15.160 --> 21:19.720
of how you can have legitimate competition in the open source world, but yet every frickin'

21:19.720 --> 21:26.760
buddy is benefiting. And I look at this and I think, man, I wish more people were current

21:26.760 --> 21:30.560
on this issue. I wish more people knew all the nuances and were following this because

21:30.560 --> 21:33.940
this is such a brilliant example of how open source can be competitive yet cooperative

21:33.940 --> 21:38.280
at the same time. Yes. And in such an area that's so critical to the future cloud, quote

21:38.280 --> 21:41.720
unquote, sphere. Right. I feel like right now we're kind of shaping what the next ten

21:41.720 --> 21:47.480
years of deployed code will look like. Yeah, I agree. All right. So before we move on to

21:47.480 --> 21:52.840
some feedback, any other thoughts? Yeah, go ahead. Sorry. Go ahead. No, go ahead. Yeah.

21:52.840 --> 21:59.120
One other cool thing that came across was I saw a demo today of someone sharing the

21:59.120 --> 22:05.800
X11 socket from inside a Linux OS to inside the container. And with that, they were able

22:05.800 --> 22:11.360
to run whichever desktop application they wanted in a Docker container. And that's nice.

22:11.360 --> 22:18.480
And where they took that was they then they clicked a button and they launched a whole

22:18.480 --> 22:24.680
Eclipse IDE environment in a browser. It sounds like maybe in the future we could have something

22:24.680 --> 22:31.200
like Cube's OS but with like Docker or LXC instead of Zen. Yeah. Huh. Huh. That is kind

22:31.200 --> 22:36.000
of like that. Now that is web computing. All right. I just wanted to point out before we

22:36.000 --> 22:41.080
move in to the rest of the show, we went to System76 this week. That was a lot of fun.

22:41.080 --> 22:48.360
It looked like. Yeah. I had a blast. Had challenges. I forgot the most important piece of equipment

22:48.360 --> 22:52.680
that we could have, you know, I mean there's not a more critical piece of equipment I forgot.

22:52.680 --> 22:57.080
That was awesome. I stayed in a hotel room that felt like a palace. That was pretty cool.

22:57.080 --> 23:02.400
And I got to play with an augmented reality sandbox. That was awesome. So check out Roverlog.

23:02.400 --> 23:08.300
Check out the Roverlog episode 15 of my trip to System76. It was a freaking blast. Colorado

23:08.300 --> 23:13.640
is. It sounds like you got some walking in too, Chris. Wes, I'm not. So you're feeling

23:13.640 --> 23:18.240
healthier than ever now that you're back. Wes, I did not put this in the video but there

23:18.240 --> 23:21.540
was a night where I legitimately went and laid down in bed, had to put a pillow under

23:21.540 --> 23:28.580
my knees and all of my legs ached. And I thought to myself, $380 a night and alls I want right

23:28.580 --> 23:35.220
now is a freaking bathtub. It was. No bathtub? It was just so bad. It was so bad. I hurt

23:35.220 --> 23:38.960
so bad because we walked around so much. Here, I'll play the first few seconds of the Roverlog.

23:38.960 --> 23:43.440
I want you to go check out Roverlog 15 though. It was a lot of fun. Oh, I don't hear it.

23:43.440 --> 23:48.280
Hold on. It's mostly Chris talking about how nice the hotel is. That's like 80%. But it's

23:48.280 --> 23:52.720
worth it. It's great. It's definitely at least a solid 30%. I don't know about 80 but yeah,

23:52.720 --> 23:58.820
check out the intro here. We're here in Denver, Colorado to go to System76. It's their super

23:58.820 --> 24:15.120
fan contest and we're going to go in there and see what they have to show us. Let's go.

24:15.120 --> 24:19.620
So they had a whole steam room set up which was super, super nice. I bet you were getting

24:19.620 --> 24:23.080
plenty fine performance in that room. Yeah, it was really cool and they had a whiteboard

24:23.080 --> 24:30.000
paint up so you could draw and stuff on there. It was really cool. So Roverlog 15, it literally

24:30.000 --> 24:33.720
was down to the wire to get that episode of Linux Action Show and you can find out more

24:33.720 --> 24:39.080
by watching episode 15 of the Roverlog. Go to JupiterBroadcasting.com to find that. You

24:39.080 --> 24:46.280
can also find a few other things over Jupiter Broadcasting. So that trip, it was so funny.

24:46.280 --> 24:51.440
We're sitting there just having a nice casual conversation and I can't even remember how

24:51.440 --> 25:00.240
it came up but it comes up that Noah switched a few people to Linux. Just a hobby really.

25:00.240 --> 25:04.320
And Emma is sitting there, she's an employee of System76. I love Emma, she's been a long

25:04.320 --> 25:10.560
time friend of the show. She says, I switch more people to Linux than you do. Gold. Mind

25:10.560 --> 25:16.660
you this is our first day there and we're still kind of doing that phase where I know

25:16.660 --> 25:21.840
you professionally, I followed everything you do. You don't quite know where the human

25:21.840 --> 25:26.340
boundaries are, how to connect on that level. Within 30 seconds of that conversation starting,

25:26.340 --> 25:35.360
there was four f-bombs dropped. It was odd. Wow, this got human. These two, Emma and Noah,

25:35.360 --> 25:40.520
take switching people to Linux so seriously. Thank God those people are out there though.

25:40.520 --> 25:44.860
She threw down, I had mad respect. So she came on the Linux Action Show and we talked

25:44.860 --> 25:48.240
about that a little bit and her and Noah are going to have a massive competition. I don't

25:48.240 --> 25:54.800
know how Noah is going to do this because he's also in the process of moving. He runs

25:54.800 --> 26:02.880
his own business, he's got two kids and they're moving houses right now. But he couldn't help

26:02.880 --> 26:07.240
himself, he throws down with this competition. And so what I love about it is over on the

26:07.240 --> 26:13.540
subreddit, there was a thread started by russen88, Noah versus Dr. Emma switching people to Linux.

26:13.540 --> 26:18.280
The competition rules, there's already 14 comments and it's heated, it is passionate,

26:18.280 --> 26:23.720
it is so funny. So if you want to throw down on what your idea should be around this competition

26:23.720 --> 26:32.120
between, and both of these people, they legitimately switch people to Linux all the time. You don't

26:32.120 --> 26:37.040
know until you've been with Noah, but I went to a burger place with Noah. I went to go

26:37.040 --> 26:40.880
get a bacon cheeseburger and some fries. I feel like you're the embarrassed wife in

26:40.880 --> 26:45.400
this situation. We're like, not right now, we're just trying to have dinner, please.

26:45.400 --> 26:49.640
I am an advocate for the Linux platform. We are standing in line at five guys getting

26:49.640 --> 26:53.440
a burger and fries and Noah is switching this dude to Linux and he's like, here, take this

26:53.440 --> 26:58.420
thumb drive, go install this. And this guy's like, alright, I'm going to do it. And before

26:58.420 --> 27:06.160
we order our burger, Noah has this guy switching to Linux. It was so good and to see those

27:06.160 --> 27:09.600
two go at it was so great. And if you haven't watched this week's episode of Linux Action

27:09.600 --> 27:12.960
Show, you got to go watch it. It was a really funny throw down. So we're going to have a

27:12.960 --> 27:15.760
competition coming up and I really actually do legitimately want Rose because I have to

27:15.760 --> 27:19.980
play judge. I got to judge this thing and I need to know. I got to determine what the

27:19.980 --> 27:22.800
parameters are so we have a link in the show notes if you guys. I think this might warrant

27:22.800 --> 27:28.500
like a T-Spring shirt or something. Oh, yeah. Noah the switcher. I don't know. And Emma

27:28.500 --> 27:35.080
the closer. That's good, Wes. We should really make something out of this. And you know,

27:35.080 --> 27:37.640
if we had more time, because we were just there for a couple of days, if we had more

27:37.640 --> 27:41.400
time I would have just we would have gone out down on the street down a man on the street

27:41.400 --> 27:45.120
kind of thing and just have them start switching because both of them and think about like

27:45.120 --> 27:50.160
the like the social norms you have to completely reject to do what they do. They literally

27:50.160 --> 27:54.320
walk up to strangers and start profiting to them. Are you changing your operating system?

27:54.320 --> 27:58.800
Can I tell you about your savior Linux? Yeah, exactly. It's just ridiculous. And so and

27:58.800 --> 28:02.760
it is so much fun to watch switcher versus closer. You guys got to go watch this week's

28:02.760 --> 28:06.480
episode of Linux Action Show to see what I'm talking about. All right. So before we move

28:06.480 --> 28:11.080
on because there's so much to cover this week, I want to talk about Digital Ocean. I love

28:11.080 --> 28:14.840
Digital Ocean. They always have come in at just the perfect moment. You can start in

28:14.840 --> 28:19.800
less than 55 seconds to build your own Linux rig with one click deployment or really fine

28:19.800 --> 28:26.760
tuning it. And think about that. 55 seconds. I mean, you can't even get a live CD booted

28:26.760 --> 28:31.160
in 55 seconds and pricing plans start at only five dollars a month. You can't even get a

28:31.160 --> 28:37.160
burger for five dollars and this is five dollars a month. A month for a Linux rig up in the

28:37.160 --> 28:41.520
cloud with a crazy fast connection. They'll get you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte

28:41.520 --> 28:47.160
SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer. But what I love about Digital Ocean is their

28:47.160 --> 28:51.520
availability of locations. They got a brand new one in Toronto that's called the FUNSA

28:51.520 --> 28:55.480
data center. But they also have a great one in Germany. They have ones in New York, San

28:55.480 --> 29:01.600
Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and even London. But it's that interface. It's that

29:01.600 --> 29:09.200
interface. It is so good. It is so intuitive and it doesn't suck. Like it lets you do snapshots.

29:09.200 --> 29:12.680
It lets you destroy machines. It lets you transfer between virtual servers. It lets

29:12.680 --> 29:17.520
you one click deploy applications in a Docker container. It doesn't suck. And they have

29:17.520 --> 29:23.640
a straightforward API that makes it totally usable and because that API rocks, there is

29:23.640 --> 29:29.320
a crap ton. I mean like a crap ton of really good open source code that makes you look

29:29.320 --> 29:32.760
like a pro you can go take advantage of right now. You can just go grab it right now. You

29:32.760 --> 29:35.560
can integrate it in with your smartphone, integrate it in with your toolbar, get a gnome

29:35.560 --> 29:38.760
extension up in that biz. I don't care. There's tons of code.

29:38.760 --> 29:42.840
It's all about enabling you, right? Like between that and all of the tutorials which cover

29:42.840 --> 29:49.040
like oh my gosh, even if you aren't using Digital Ocean, I mean, that's the dirty secret.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.040
That's the dirty secret.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.840
But it is so good because like you're just deploying standard Linux distributions.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.360
It's the new ArchWiki, really.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.360
It really is, dude.

29:56.360 --> 29:57.360
Don't tell them that.

29:57.360 --> 30:01.840
And it is good because the thing they have kind of against like I don't mean to knock

30:01.840 --> 30:06.080
on the ArchWiki because, dude, I go to it all the time, but they pay the people, right?

30:06.080 --> 30:10.840
They pay you to write up tutorials. And then they have full time editors on staff. And

30:10.840 --> 30:14.440
you know, little side story here, and by the way, I haven't said this yet. I probably should

30:14.440 --> 30:18.480
have because this is the only way this show survives. DO unplugged. Probably should have

30:18.480 --> 30:24.840
said that at the beginning because if you don't use that promo code, the show doesn't

30:24.840 --> 30:25.840
go on.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.840
So I probably should have said that at the beginning, but I get excited.

30:28.840 --> 30:33.240
So you know, I look at this and I think, Wes, imagine what we've been talking about. We've

30:33.240 --> 30:37.400
been talking about Docker. We've been talking about deploying things. There are ways to

30:37.400 --> 30:43.680
use Docker that are smart. And you and I, before the show, we were talking about a Python

30:43.680 --> 30:47.320
thing that you're working on to take like an extra bit of work you've gotten and kind

30:47.320 --> 30:50.660
of parse it all up and put it in a spot for you that's easy to read and it's using this

30:50.660 --> 30:51.660
Java intermediate.

30:51.660 --> 30:55.440
It's just like this long, complicated thing you're doing, right? And I look at that and

30:55.440 --> 31:00.600
I think, geez, you know, once you've developed that, if you did all that in a Docker container,

31:00.600 --> 31:06.320
it's like one, two, three clicks. Actually, they're not clicks. It would be, I'm looking

31:06.320 --> 31:10.320
at the command, four commands to have this deployed on a Docker container. And just boom,

31:10.320 --> 31:14.600
you have this up, then you create the DigitalOcean droplet, and then one command after that

31:14.600 --> 31:16.200
and you have it running on a production.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.480
Things deployed. It's just going.

31:17.480 --> 31:21.480
So in four commands, you've got it containerized, you've got it ready to go, published up to

31:21.480 --> 31:25.280
the Docker hub, and then one command after that, you've got it deployed on your DigitalOcean

31:25.280 --> 31:26.760
droplet.

31:26.760 --> 31:27.760
That sounds really nice.

31:27.760 --> 31:31.320
I mean, that is a huge appeal. That is, it is really something. Or, you know, there's

31:31.320 --> 31:36.160
a bunch of other stuff you can take advantage of. Just go try something like frickin' own

31:36.160 --> 31:38.400
cloud sync thing.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.520
Sync thing, yeah.

31:39.520 --> 31:43.760
Definitely sync thing. Definitely sync thing. Just go try something like that. Minecraft,

31:43.760 --> 31:49.400
go to your own Minecraft server, Mumble server. There are, MB, there are so many different

31:49.400 --> 31:56.520
ways I use Docker, Docker and DigitalOcean. And MB is running in a Docker container on

31:56.520 --> 31:59.760
a Fedora 23 DigitalOcean droplet.

31:59.760 --> 32:00.760
Right now.

32:00.760 --> 32:01.760
Wow.

32:01.760 --> 32:02.760
Yeah.

32:02.760 --> 32:03.760
It really can't get easier than that.

32:03.760 --> 32:04.760
Right? That's how I'm rollin' these days.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.360
But it's the good kind of easy, where you know that it's stable.

32:06.360 --> 32:07.360
Here's how I did it.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.360
It's production grade.

32:08.360 --> 32:14.760
In 55 seconds, I deployed a Fedora 23 DigitalOcean droplet. Then, I installed Cockpit.

32:14.760 --> 32:15.760
Oh, I love it.

32:15.760 --> 32:20.280
Which was one DNF command on the command line, using the HTML5 console that DigitalOcean

32:20.280 --> 32:25.960
gives me. And then, I logged into my Cockpit instance, and in there, they have a whole

32:25.960 --> 32:34.360
container section, and I deployed MB. So, I deployed Fedora 23 droplet, installed Docker,

32:34.360 --> 32:37.080
installed Cockpit, one-click deployment of MB.

32:37.080 --> 32:42.200
So, you could give this job to interns, whoever. You can just get it done.

32:42.200 --> 32:45.960
So, there's things that happen. I'm like, you know what? I'll just log into my droplet,

32:45.960 --> 32:48.480
get this show on MB, and I just watch it on the rover. It is...

32:48.480 --> 32:49.480
That's amazing.

32:49.480 --> 32:52.440
It is amazing. And you can use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED to get started. Just go check

32:52.440 --> 32:57.520
it out, and you'll support the show. DigitalOcean.com. Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED. It is a Linux

32:57.520 --> 33:02.440
rig up in the cloud, crazy fast access, SSDs throughout. I mean, you can figure it out.

33:02.440 --> 33:07.280
Go do it. DigitalOcean.com. Try it out, and make something awesome, because hashtag just

33:07.280 --> 33:08.280
saying.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.280
Just saying.

33:09.280 --> 33:17.200
Okay. So, on November 10th, Steam Machines hit the internets, went out, and people started

33:17.200 --> 33:24.680
getting their really super awesome, you know, designed for gaming Steam Machines. And, as

33:24.680 --> 33:29.240
always, people got to do their reviews. They got to do their benchmarks.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.240
We're going here.

33:30.240 --> 33:36.240
Yeah. You know what? Before we get into this, I should do the official opening of our segment.

33:36.240 --> 33:45.440
Yeah. There we go. That's better. And, according to ours, the takeaway here is that cross-platform

33:45.440 --> 33:53.160
3D games face a 21 to 58% frame rate dip.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.640
Ouch. I don't like those numbers.

33:54.640 --> 34:01.440
No. On the same exact hardware, you're dual-booting between Windows and SteamOS, 58% drop.

34:01.440 --> 34:04.720
It is what you might call, Wes, I don't know, devastating.

34:04.720 --> 34:05.720
Devastating.

34:05.720 --> 34:06.720
And it's sort of confusing.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.760
You like that DF command in the background there?

34:08.760 --> 34:09.760
Yeah, that is nice.

34:09.760 --> 34:10.760
Look at that.

34:10.760 --> 34:11.760
Yeah, look at that.

34:11.760 --> 34:12.760
At least they're doing the Linux part right. I appreciate that.

34:12.760 --> 34:17.640
Yeah, too bad it's retrying crap like that. It's, you know. So, to start their test, they

34:17.640 --> 34:21.600
dragged out a dual-boot SteamOS Windows machine. This is on ours. They built two years ago,

34:21.600 --> 34:27.560
this was a little old, but not that bad, and got all the OSs up-to-date on both sides.

34:27.560 --> 34:29.480
They ran a whole bunch of tests.

34:29.480 --> 34:33.280
What was the, did they have, I know they had a lot of graphics cards, but...

34:33.280 --> 34:36.280
What was the specific graphics card that they used on this particular rig?

34:36.280 --> 34:37.280
Yeah, I'm just curious.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.000
Is that what you were asking me right now, Wes?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.000
That's exactly what I'm asking.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.360
Are you asking me that right now? I believe it was an...

34:42.360 --> 34:43.360
Go on, go on. I'm sorry.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.040
No, no, no. That's a good question, actually. I believe it was an NVIDIA card, but I don't

34:46.040 --> 34:47.440
actually think they listed it here.

34:47.440 --> 34:48.440
Okay. Just because that's a...

34:48.440 --> 34:55.440
Oh, they did. I'm sorry. I'm a dummy. It was the GTX 660. Are you serious? With the NVIDIA

34:55.440 --> 34:58.840
driver 35891. Now, are you S-ing me?

34:58.840 --> 34:59.840
Is that current?

34:59.840 --> 35:01.680
That's a really good question. So, here you are on the...

35:01.680 --> 35:02.680
I'm not sure.

35:02.680 --> 35:07.360
On the Bonobo. No, it's not current at all. On the Bonobo, let's see here. I am on 355

35:07.360 --> 35:12.040
because I haven't updated for like two weeks, but I'm trying to figure out what is my...

35:12.040 --> 35:17.960
What's the video card in this Bonobo? Because it's a G4. So, they basically tested it on

35:17.960 --> 35:25.440
a machine that is less powerful than my Bonobo, and my Bonobo is three years old.

35:25.440 --> 35:26.440
I have a...

35:26.440 --> 35:27.440
It's still impressive that Windows was able to...

35:27.440 --> 35:34.480
I have a 680M. Dude, I have a 680M in my three-year-old Bonobo, and they're sitting here... You know,

35:34.480 --> 35:41.040
can I just take a second? I mean, we'll get into the rest of this as we go, but I sure

35:41.040 --> 35:47.920
as shit would never come on air. I would never in a million years come on air and dare to

35:47.920 --> 35:53.400
tell you the performance of games under Windows or Linux with such shit hardware. I wouldn't

35:53.400 --> 35:57.960
dare do it because I would be torn apart by my audience because they're smart. They're

35:57.960 --> 36:06.220
not a bunch of dumbasses. I cannot believe R's published this just on... Okay, anyways.

36:06.220 --> 36:11.240
But that's not the takeaway because the numbers are what matter, but it is literally... If

36:11.240 --> 36:14.840
you're gonna be R's technica and you're gonna make this huge ass publishing, you're gonna

36:14.840 --> 36:21.720
do this huge ass article, if some podcaster wouldn't even bother doing this because his

36:21.720 --> 36:26.320
hardware's so out of date, you gotta think about that. Give that some thought. I mean,

36:26.320 --> 36:27.320
that is...

36:27.320 --> 36:28.320
Yeah.

36:28.320 --> 36:29.320
Right?

36:29.320 --> 36:32.320
It's a little... I don't know.

36:32.320 --> 36:36.920
Like, install the latest driver, at least, if you're gonna use that hardware, which...

36:36.920 --> 36:39.160
Wait, are these the stats on the side here?

36:39.160 --> 36:40.400
That's the hardware. That's the hardware there, yeah.

36:40.400 --> 36:41.400
That they're using?

36:41.400 --> 36:42.400
Yeah, Windows 10.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.400
What is the CPU there?

36:43.400 --> 36:45.080
The CPU is, well, three gigahertz.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.080
Does that say Pentium?

36:46.080 --> 36:54.640
G3220. Will you look up the G3220? It's the G3220. But like, R Brown is... R Brown, go

36:54.640 --> 36:58.320
ahead. You don't have to say in the chat. You're in the mumble room. Go ahead. Make

36:58.320 --> 36:59.320
your point.

36:59.320 --> 37:05.320
Yeah. Well, the thing I was thinking, though, is if they're using hardware that's old...

37:05.320 --> 37:10.520
I mean, surely all of the effort, all of the optimization for these Linux drivers are targeting

37:10.520 --> 37:14.720
newer hardware. I mean, I've definitely seen it with some of the older Nvidia stuff. They

37:14.720 --> 37:19.160
just drop that support completely out of the Linux drivers sooner or later. So if ours

37:19.160 --> 37:24.720
have gone back and used an ancient card, yeah, maybe it does suck compared to Windows, but

37:24.720 --> 37:28.000
I'd like it to see a relatively recent one.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.520
Yeah. Yeah. I agree. So what'd you find?

37:30.520 --> 37:37.160
Well, I will say that the recommended customer price for the CPU box... Well, for the tray,

37:37.160 --> 37:38.720
which is the more expensive, $64.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.720
Oh!

37:39.720 --> 37:44.400
Yeah. So it's definitely a bargain basement. I mean, and all of this, it still remains

37:44.400 --> 37:48.320
the point, why is Windows performing better? That's still totally relevant. It's just kind

37:48.320 --> 37:51.560
of surprising. I feel like I saw other reviews where they're like, oh yeah, we bought the

37:51.560 --> 37:53.800
newest Skylake and here we were trying, but...

37:53.800 --> 37:58.000
It feels like if Chris went and scrapped together a few spare parts in the JB1 Studio and then

37:58.000 --> 38:03.680
did a SteamOS review. That would be bullshit. And my viewers would think I was an uneducated

38:03.680 --> 38:04.680
idiot.

38:04.680 --> 38:08.280
And I thought when I was reading it, I just assumed that, okay, they bought the Alienware

38:08.280 --> 38:11.000
or like one of the commercial options and they installed Windows.

38:11.000 --> 38:13.720
I was going to say, the reason why I went with this, because the fact of the matter

38:13.720 --> 38:18.560
I was going to say was, it doesn't really... What matters was how the difference performance

38:18.560 --> 38:20.000
Delta was between the two OSs.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.000
And that is important.

38:21.000 --> 38:26.640
Still the case, but like R. Brown is saying is, it very well could be that the newer GPUs

38:26.640 --> 38:33.480
specifically, I mean, that's been three and a half years. Nvidia has changed its tune

38:33.480 --> 38:37.720
about Linux considerably in three and a half years. SteamOS was announced since then.

38:37.720 --> 38:41.200
Not that it's relevant to this review, but I'm sure the same thing would apply for AMD,

38:41.200 --> 38:42.200
you know, given their recent...

38:42.200 --> 38:52.240
Totally, right? Absolutely. But here is the devastating part. And honestly, what is really

38:52.240 --> 38:58.300
disappointing and it's really too bad is it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because

38:58.300 --> 39:01.240
R's technica is saying SteamOS is slower.

39:01.240 --> 39:04.720
So let me tell you what they're saying about SteamOS. That is actually the takeaway. All

39:04.720 --> 39:09.340
that matters unfortunately in 2015 is somebody scrolled past that headline on their smartphone.

39:09.340 --> 39:10.440
And that is the reality of it.

39:10.440 --> 39:13.600
They were thinking about getting Linux, they were thinking about buying a Steam machine

39:13.600 --> 39:16.720
and now they're like, well, no, I'll just build another Windows gaming rig.

39:16.720 --> 39:21.920
This did surprise me. Valve's own Source Engine games show the same performance hit when compared

39:21.920 --> 39:26.920
to their Windows versions, Portal, Team Fortress 2 and Dota 2. All took massive frame rate

39:26.920 --> 39:33.160
dips on SteamOS compared to their Windows counterparts. Only Left 4 Dead 2 showed comparable

39:33.160 --> 39:37.760
performance, comparable performance between Windows and Linux.

39:37.760 --> 39:38.760
That's pretty devastating.

39:38.760 --> 39:43.280
There was no indication of the frame rate performance improvements that Valve cited

39:43.280 --> 39:48.420
a few years ago. That is a little bit of a bummer. Right now it seems like choosing SteamOS,

39:48.420 --> 39:52.800
this is according to R's, this is their wrap up. Choosing SteamOS over Windows box means

39:52.800 --> 39:58.680
sacrificing a significant amount of performance on many, if not most, graphically intensive

39:58.680 --> 40:03.600
3D games. That's a pretty big cost to bear, R's says, considering that Alienware sells

40:03.600 --> 40:08.760
its Windows powered console style alpha boxes at prices at only $50 more expensive than

40:08.760 --> 40:11.360
identically outfitted SteamOS machines.

40:11.360 --> 40:15.800
That's not to mention the fact that Steam, on Windows, currently has thousands of games

40:15.800 --> 40:20.280
that aren't even available on SteamOS, including most AAA recent releases. While SteamOS has

40:20.280 --> 40:24.800
similar exclusives to recommend over Windows, hopefully Valve and other Linux developers

40:24.800 --> 40:28.720
continue to improve SteamOS performance to the point where high end games will be expected

40:28.720 --> 40:31.920
to at least run as comparably between Linux and Windows.

40:31.920 --> 40:32.920
Ouch.

40:32.920 --> 40:33.920
Yeah, ouch.

40:33.920 --> 40:40.560
That's not how you want your first launch to go. What do you think? Is this a problem

40:40.560 --> 40:45.200
or is this just, is this sort of like how a early generation thing goes and the consumer

40:45.200 --> 40:47.840
market understands or?

40:47.840 --> 40:51.800
It's not great. I mean, I feel like we're still in the waiting phase to see how all

40:51.800 --> 40:56.280
of the Steam launch stuff plays out. You know, maybe after a quarter we'll see kind of what

40:56.280 --> 40:59.600
are the retail, you know, how many, how many were picked up, how many people did actually

40:59.600 --> 41:04.200
buy them, especially over the holiday period. But it is disappointing that we can't come

41:04.200 --> 41:08.880
out the gate and say like, even, especially on titles where Valve has, you know, ramped

41:08.880 --> 41:12.480
up support that we can't say like, look, you can play them on Linux and it's just as good.

41:12.480 --> 41:13.480
We can't even say that.

41:13.480 --> 41:18.800
And I want to add a little context to this conversation. For door, for door developer,

41:18.800 --> 41:24.440
gnome developer, he, I think he works on G streamer Christian scaler. He writes for us

41:24.440 --> 41:28.320
in the Linux community, these machines are more than that. They're an important part

41:28.320 --> 41:31.720
of helping us break into a broader market by paving the way for even more games and

41:31.720 --> 41:38.260
more big budget games coming to our platform. Playing computer games is not just a niche.

41:38.260 --> 41:42.000
It's a mainstream activity these days and not having access to games on our platform

41:42.000 --> 41:45.440
has cost us quite a few users and potential contributors over the years. I agree.

41:45.440 --> 41:49.920
I agree with that. Yeah. I have an ins I have, for instance, met a lot of computer science

41:49.920 --> 41:55.000
students who ended up not using Linux as the main OS during their studies, simply due to

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
the lack of games on the platform. This is really, I think this is a really accurate

41:58.000 --> 42:05.000
point. Instead, Linux got deregulated to that thing in a VM. And you only needed it when

42:05.000 --> 42:10.080
you had to have that assignment to complete. That does kind of right. I mean, I've met

42:10.080 --> 42:13.960
those people. Yeah, you know, I mean, it's not against them. It's like, Windows is the

42:13.960 --> 42:17.960
operating system that works. You don't question it. Well, Linux is your development thing.

42:17.960 --> 42:23.160
You know, so, you know, let's say you got you know, you got let's say you got $500 slosh

42:23.160 --> 42:27.080
a month. And you got it, you know, you save up a couple of months and you buy $1,000 laptop.

42:27.080 --> 42:30.960
Well, now that laptop not only is the way you're getting your schoolwork done, but that's

42:30.960 --> 42:34.160
how you're getting your gaming done. Right. Maybe it has optimist graphics, maybe, you

42:34.160 --> 42:37.480
know, all of these little things. That is literally all that matters is that it took

42:37.480 --> 42:42.140
you two, three months just afford this thing or to make the payments on this thing. It

42:42.140 --> 42:45.320
better be able to play games. And if that's the difference between Windows and Linux,

42:45.320 --> 42:49.000
you're going to go Windows. And it came probably came with a Windows license. You know, I was

42:49.000 --> 42:54.760
talking to a student at System 76, one of the super fans, and she said that she was

42:54.760 --> 42:59.960
running Linux because she was in computer engineering. But gaming wasn't a big issue

42:59.960 --> 43:05.120
for her. Right. And so it wasn't it wasn't a barrier. Right. And but for she said, you

43:05.120 --> 43:08.360
know, other students, that's that's the number one differentiator. That was just a couple

43:08.360 --> 43:11.220
of days ago. Somebody told me that it's in school right now. So that actually really

43:11.220 --> 43:16.480
rings extremely true for me. He goes on to say, remember, he works on G streamer. He's

43:16.480 --> 43:20.720
a developer, which I got to say G streamer has been doing some pretty impressive stuff.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.920
I don't know if you've seen that, but I have been following that. I'm very, very excited

43:23.920 --> 43:28.920
about that. I think this was on blogs.nome.org. He says steam for Linux and steam OS can be

43:28.920 --> 43:34.080
an important pieces of breaking through this steam OS and steam machines are also important

43:34.080 --> 43:37.920
for the Linux community for another reason. They can help funnel more resources from hardware

43:37.920 --> 43:42.360
companies into Linux drivers and support. I know, for instance, that all three major

43:42.360 --> 43:49.000
GPU vendors have increased their Linux drivers investments due to steam OS also rings true.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.520
This is why steam OS is important. And the success of steam OS is also kind of important.

43:53.520 --> 43:57.200
He said, by the way, a side note, also working on a few features in fedora workstation to

43:57.200 --> 44:01.340
make it better for steam and steam games. This includes our work on the GL dispatch

44:01.340 --> 44:05.040
and optimus support has covered in a previous blog, which will have linked in the show notes

44:05.040 --> 44:18.800
and lib ratbag is a new library for handling gaming mice under Linux to make it even better.

44:18.800 --> 44:20.880
And they're finally, they're working on bugs to support and make it even better to host

44:20.880 --> 44:23.360
the steam client related to the C++ ABI issues.

44:23.360 --> 44:26.460
I'm glad that they've gotten the sort now because I don't want to deal with that.

44:26.460 --> 44:30.320
Do you think it's important steam OS, steam gaming? Really, honestly, do you think it's

44:30.320 --> 44:31.480
important?

44:31.480 --> 44:36.280
I think that the last point there about putting stress, yes, to develop more, I mean, like,

44:36.280 --> 44:40.900
we see it, you know, obviously, like, Pixar, and the really industry specific things are

44:40.900 --> 44:44.200
doing it, but they have so much stuff that they end up replicating themselves or, you

44:44.200 --> 44:47.920
know, building stacks to do their high end stuff on Linux. I think we need more of that

44:47.920 --> 44:51.280
consumer spectrum to be pushed and developed. And obviously, we have a lot of big changes

44:51.280 --> 44:56.400
coming with Wayland and Vulcan and all of that. So we'll see where that goes. Right.

44:56.400 --> 45:00.960
But I think it's important even now to begin putting that stress on there and be like,

45:00.960 --> 45:04.500
Linux is perfect. We've seen it in other industries. Right. And if we can get more

45:04.500 --> 45:08.720
of that, maybe getting gaming companies to see that they can take Linux and shape it

45:08.720 --> 45:13.560
into what they want. Really, what we have to do is we have to bet that Windows continues

45:13.560 --> 45:17.740
to suck balls. Yes. And then that makes them want something else. And that the store threatens

45:17.740 --> 45:21.480
gaming industries, you know, that kind of stuff. In fact, it'd be good for Linux in

45:21.480 --> 45:25.120
some ways in gaming if the Microsoft Store did kind of well. Too bad it sucks so bad.

45:25.120 --> 45:28.520
Yes. And then you're right, because they could do this, they push on, they go, oh,

45:28.520 --> 45:30.920
man, this is why we need Vulcan. This is why we got to support Vulcans. We're getting

45:30.920 --> 45:34.480
behind Vulcan. Right. This could be really good in the long run. Because the thing about

45:34.480 --> 45:38.720
Linux is like, you know, if you if you're focused on your product, you can take Linux

45:38.720 --> 45:42.520
and you can build it to just do that. You can make it excellent. Yeah. Mumble Room,

45:42.520 --> 45:47.420
any thoughts on this particular topic on Steam Machines or Vulcan or gaming under Linux or

45:47.420 --> 45:50.840
maybe why ours got it wrong? The floor is open. I'll give you a couple of seconds to

45:50.840 --> 45:56.380
jump in if anybody wants to. I got one. Yeah. So I was actually looking at these numbers

45:56.380 --> 46:03.120
here. And I did mention in the chat room earlier, any number over 60 frames per second is literally

46:03.120 --> 46:10.160
going to be imperceivable to the human eye. Any number over 30, you're going to have a

46:10.160 --> 46:17.800
hard time. I'm seeing here for most of these numbers here on the ours technical article,

46:17.800 --> 46:23.280
Linux still performs over 30 frames per second. So for most people, you're not going to have

46:23.280 --> 46:28.840
a perception problem there. Right. The other thing that ours should have done, and this

46:28.840 --> 46:32.200
is why I wanted to talk about this, I want to do a little debunking, is they should have

46:32.200 --> 46:35.920
benchmarked all of these at 1920 by 1080, because that's the highest resolution the

46:35.920 --> 46:42.600
SteamOS machines running at. Right. And if you think about that, 1920 by 1080 is a really

46:42.600 --> 46:48.200
easy benchmark. Now a 668, a 660 and a 680, they should be able to do that no problem.

46:48.200 --> 46:52.120
They should be able to do that 30 frames per second, no problem. 1920 by 1080 is not a

46:52.120 --> 46:57.040
big deal. And everything should have been baseline to that. They did a couple of different

46:57.040 --> 47:03.520
resolutions. One of them was 1792 by 1120, not ideal for gaming. Yeah, that is a great

47:03.520 --> 47:07.260
point, right? Because the SteamOS machines only have to push at the max that your crappy

47:07.260 --> 47:09.880
HDTV can do that you bought on sale.

47:09.880 --> 47:13.400
I will also say that the article, it touches on it and it does mention it, but I feel like

47:13.400 --> 47:17.760
there wasn't enough emphasis placed on what's the end user experience. Like can you buy

47:17.760 --> 47:24.000
this or run this and have an enjoyable gaming experience for a large selection of the games

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
that you can use.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.920
Because a Steam machine is about that living room, big picture experience. And a Windows

47:27.920 --> 47:33.200
Steam machine is about that traditional Steam client experience, sitting at the desk, gaming.

47:33.200 --> 47:38.160
Right. And if you're the user that spends $2,000 and makes a custom gaming rig, that's

47:38.160 --> 47:42.040
a different marketplace than like, I spent $400 at the store and I want to be able to

47:42.040 --> 47:45.760
play last year to maybe this year's titles at reasonable settings.

47:45.760 --> 47:49.280
Wimpy, you want to jump in on the Vulkan point?

47:49.280 --> 47:58.160
Yeah, so if you look at the demonstrations that have been done demoing games using OpenGL

47:58.160 --> 48:06.160
and Vulkan to show the performance increase, on Linux you typically see OpenGL performance

48:06.160 --> 48:13.440
sort of IO bound to a single thread on a single CPU core. And then when you see the same type

48:13.440 --> 48:19.240
of switch to Vulkan, you see that workload spread across all the cores and the load come

48:19.240 --> 48:25.800
down and the frame rate go up significantly. So while I don't want to appear an apologist

48:25.800 --> 48:30.480
for Linux's performance versus Windows in this case, I think we need to have one eye

48:30.480 --> 48:36.360
on the future and that future is Vulkan. And that does perform very nicely with Steam.

48:36.360 --> 48:43.280
Yeah, I agree. I actually agree a lot. I wonder if we'll start to see, you know, Vulkan ship

48:43.280 --> 48:46.040
in 2016. I don't know when we're going to actually start to see it as end users.

48:46.040 --> 48:53.280
I'm so excited just for Vulkan and Wayland and both of those together as the future.

48:53.280 --> 48:57.960
So when Vulkan launches, does this mean we're going to all have to get new hardware as well?

48:57.960 --> 49:00.560
Maybe although I guess current hardware today …

49:00.560 --> 49:02.960
Sorry, I missed that. What was that?

49:02.960 --> 49:03.960
I know something.

49:03.960 --> 49:06.880
Yeah, go ahead. I think today current hardware does support it. Go ahead.

49:06.880 --> 49:18.960
I believe the GTX 500 series and above will support it and then the newer R series AMD

49:18.960 --> 49:19.960
graphics may support it.

49:19.960 --> 49:20.960
Okay.

49:20.960 --> 49:21.960
Okay.

49:21.960 --> 49:22.960
So at least some of it.

49:22.960 --> 49:26.920
How about the HD 4000 for Intel?

49:26.920 --> 49:33.080
Intel, I believe there are already drivers being built, but I don't know about Intel's

49:33.080 --> 49:34.080
unfortunately.

49:34.080 --> 49:41.960
Huh. I'm imagining. Yeah, I'd imagine they make that work, but it is funny. I don't

49:41.960 --> 49:46.080
feel like we have … Specifically for this area, we have never really been to a point

49:46.080 --> 49:50.000
where we've been like, well, next year or in two years. Like there's a lot of times

49:50.000 --> 49:53.520
in Linux where we do say, well, soon it's going to be a lot better or no one's going

49:53.520 --> 49:56.920
to get this or the Linux kernel or … You know, all this stuff we keep saying is going

49:56.920 --> 50:02.320
to be … But this legitimately is actually happening and there's a lot of interested

50:02.320 --> 50:06.360
parties and it legitimately is going to change things. And I'm very excited about it. I'm

50:06.360 --> 50:12.320
very excited about it. And this R-Technica article, what it really did is it underscores

50:12.320 --> 50:18.360
the need for Vulkan and why we want this. But Wes so very, very acutely pointed out

50:18.360 --> 50:23.360
that if even in the lowest conditions, you know, you're getting 61 frames per second,

50:23.360 --> 50:28.640
you're probably going to be okay on a console hooked up to your HD television that may or

50:28.640 --> 50:33.840
may not even support 60 frames per second. And so, that's really the market for SteamOS.

50:33.840 --> 50:39.040
I'd also like to say, it's pretty cool that here we are in a widely read publication

50:39.040 --> 50:44.120
that ours is. You know, they're talking about like, here's the graphs. Here's like a widely

50:44.120 --> 50:49.160
deployed thing and Linux is front and center. I mean, it's SteamOS, right? Linux is always

50:49.160 --> 50:51.880
rebranded. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that is actually also

50:51.880 --> 50:57.120
something to kind of take away from this. Yeah. So, Rekai, by the way, is touching in

50:57.120 --> 51:00.480
on the Intel thing in the chat room. He says, developed and showcased a Linux driver for

51:00.480 --> 51:07.400
Intel which enabled Vulkan compatibility on the HD 4000 series integrated graphics. So,

51:07.400 --> 51:12.680
there you go. So, you got back to the 500 series of the NVIDIA cards and the 4000 series

51:12.680 --> 51:14.840
of Intel graphics. That's a pretty good way.

51:14.840 --> 51:19.020
That is pretty damn good for Vulkan. That is really good. So, when that actually starts

51:19.020 --> 51:21.400
to make more sense and it's something you might actually see on your machine, we're

51:21.400 --> 51:24.840
going to talk a lot more about it and why it's a big deal. But right now, I'm going

51:24.840 --> 51:28.320
to talk about Linux Academy because that is a big deal and a sponsor of the Linux Unplugged

51:28.320 --> 51:32.440
show and a great opportunity for you. Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to get our

51:32.440 --> 51:38.120
discount and to support the show. Keep us on the air. linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

51:38.120 --> 51:42.960
They got step-by-step video courses, comprehensive study guides. What do I think is really, really,

51:42.960 --> 51:46.480
really cool? You can jump in, you know, you can start training yourself, you can use your

51:46.480 --> 51:51.040
own time, be your own boss, learn on your own schedule and then if you get stuck, they

51:51.040 --> 51:55.560
got instructor help. And that is really nice because these instructors are super bright.

51:55.560 --> 51:58.680
They are a bunch of Linux and open source enthusiasts and they have decided, well, let's

51:58.680 --> 52:04.800
create a training platform. What a brilliant freaking idea. What a brilliant freaking idea.

52:04.800 --> 52:09.060
Genius! Why didn't all the, like, look at, I shouldn't even say it, look at freaking

52:09.060 --> 52:14.640
Linda, right? What a joke! What a joke compared to Linux Academy. Their courseware is a joke.

52:14.640 --> 52:18.200
They are an embarrassment. Go to Linux Academy and see the difference when you have people

52:18.200 --> 52:21.780
that are actually passionate about Linux. People that know what Vulkan is and Docker

52:21.780 --> 52:26.240
is and the difference between Linux and a kernel and a distribution. Like, maybe they

52:26.240 --> 52:29.520
know what the GNU tools are. That would be a great thing to know if you are going to

52:29.520 --> 52:33.480
start writing course material. So imagine people that are so crazy passionate about

52:33.480 --> 52:37.480
Linux that they get the stupid idea to go create a website to train people how to use

52:37.480 --> 52:41.200
it. And that is where you start with Linux Academy. But instead of being dumb about it,

52:41.200 --> 52:44.760
they are like, well, alright, let's pair with educators. Let's pair with developers. Let's

52:44.760 --> 52:49.680
pair with industry professionals. Let's build something unique, create a platform.

52:49.680 --> 52:53.800
And you can tell they eat their own dog food, right? Like, they use Linux every day. It's

52:53.800 --> 52:56.920
so tied into this.

52:56.920 --> 53:01.760
I frequently communicate with the guy that runs Linux Academy and trust me, he is a die-hard

53:01.760 --> 53:06.260
Linux user. And what is so brilliant about what they have done is they have taken something

53:06.260 --> 53:12.000
that is so often a checkbox, a feature on all of the other training platforms and they

53:12.000 --> 53:16.280
have created an entire platform out of that. Virtual servers on demand, you have SSH access

53:16.280 --> 53:20.520
to, DNS makes it super easy to log in to. They can choose from 7 plus distribution,

53:20.520 --> 53:25.240
so your virtual server matches that, your courseware matches that. You can be like listener

53:25.240 --> 53:29.160
Ryan and totally get all of your downloadable comprehensive study guides and listen to them

53:29.160 --> 53:32.760
while you are in the shower, or Seth does in the shower. I mean, there are different

53:32.760 --> 53:36.320
ways. Or while you are driving, instructor help available on demand. They actually know

53:36.320 --> 53:39.680
what the hell they are talking about. They are watching the open source development and

53:39.680 --> 53:42.520
they are saying, okay, this is something we need to start creating courseware from. They

53:42.520 --> 53:47.080
had courseware on Docker before you knew what Docker was. The Linux Academy is tuned in

53:47.080 --> 53:51.660
and passionate about this stuff. That is that uncanny value that I talked about. They close

53:51.660 --> 53:54.480
that gap. I want you to go there and try them out because they are always getting better

53:54.480 --> 53:58.820
at adding new courseware, including new features. Man, in October, it was crazy at all the stuff

53:58.820 --> 54:02.940
they rolled out. They have some really good stuff, including real-time progress checking,

54:02.940 --> 54:07.760
some great professional development courses, better expanded nuggets, including, including,

54:07.760 --> 54:11.960
oh, man, the live events have been so great because you can sit there, you can be stuck

54:11.960 --> 54:14.800
on something, ask them the questions, and then get the answers. And then if you get

54:14.800 --> 54:19.280
like a little bit of down, the community is stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting community

54:19.280 --> 54:20.280
members.

54:20.280 --> 54:21.280
Yeah, and we are the best.

54:21.280 --> 54:22.280
I agree.

54:22.280 --> 54:23.280
Very encouraging.

54:23.280 --> 54:29.600
I really do. And they also have all the stuff sort of attached to Linux. AWS and all of

54:29.600 --> 54:33.280
like Nginx and Python and Ruby and all that kind of stuff.

54:33.280 --> 54:37.200
I think that AWS one is really big, too, because that is one thing you see a lot. Enterprises

54:37.200 --> 54:38.200
love AWS, right?

54:38.200 --> 54:39.200
Yeah, more than ever.

54:39.200 --> 54:41.600
But it's kind of, the pricing structure is a little confusing, especially if you're like

54:41.600 --> 54:46.240
a small end person or just trying to learn it at home. Linux Academy completely controls

54:46.240 --> 54:47.240
that cost for you.

54:47.240 --> 54:48.240
They manage all of it for you.

54:48.240 --> 54:49.240
Right? It's amazing.

54:49.240 --> 54:51.480
It's just part of the subscription. You go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug. They just

54:51.480 --> 54:54.920
roll it right in there. The virtual machines they spin up, if they're on AWS, if they're

54:54.920 --> 54:58.640
on their own infrastructure, doesn't matter. They're honey badgers. Man, they just take

54:58.640 --> 55:03.760
care of it for you. And you get whatever distro you chose at the beginning of your course,

55:03.760 --> 55:07.120
that's the system you get. It makes a ton of sense. Even if you want to get into Android

55:07.120 --> 55:08.120
stuff.

55:08.120 --> 55:12.000
And then last but not least, if you're ready to go get those Red Hat certifications. There

55:12.000 --> 55:16.600
are the few certifications, after all of my years in the IT industry, that I feel is the

55:16.600 --> 55:20.960
Cisco certs and the Red Hat certs that make people go, what? Oh, you actually got that?

55:20.960 --> 55:21.960
Oh.

55:21.960 --> 55:22.960
You know what you're talking about.

55:22.960 --> 55:29.160
Yeah. Those are the certs, right? Man, they have so many great courses on the Red Hat

55:29.160 --> 55:33.480
stuff. It is part of their bread and butter. And I get a lot of great emails from people

55:33.480 --> 55:36.960
that have gone there, taken the Red Hat stuff, and gotten the certifications.

55:36.960 --> 55:40.840
It's kind of becoming the one go-to link. People are like, how do I learn Linux? I'm

55:40.840 --> 55:44.840
really interested, but what do I do? You're like, Linux Academy, man. Just check it out.

55:44.840 --> 55:49.360

55:49.360 --> 55:54.880
you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program. LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

55:54.880 --> 56:01.160
All right, Wes, are you ready to... Oh, and by the way, a special mention to the bad news

56:01.160 --> 56:02.160
about ours.

56:02.160 --> 56:03.160
Bad news.

56:03.160 --> 56:07.680
The bad news about Steam Machines is spreading. It does have some impact. VentureBeat has

56:07.680 --> 56:09.640
a story about how Falcon PC is...

56:09.640 --> 56:10.960
This one gets close to home, too.

56:10.960 --> 56:14.000
I know. They've canceled their Steam Machine. They've canceled it.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.560
Falcon Northwest and an Oregon company.

56:16.560 --> 56:23.160
Yeah. Oh, literally cuts... Yeah. That does. It hurts, Wes. It hurts. So it is having some

56:23.160 --> 56:27.360
impact. The bad press is... We talk about it from like, oh, this isn't good. Well, it

56:27.360 --> 56:31.640
actually is making a bit of a difference, at least. So yeah, we'll have links to all

56:31.640 --> 56:34.840
of that stuff, all of that shenanigans in the show notes if you guys want to go read

56:34.840 --> 56:35.840
about that.

56:35.840 --> 56:40.280
But I want to shift gears for a moment and have a chance for our listeners in the Muppet

56:40.280 --> 56:45.800
Room to jump in. Last week, we said, well, let's kind of get an idea of how Tumbleweed

56:45.800 --> 56:49.320
is landing amongst the audience. So we put a call out there and said, if you've been

56:49.320 --> 56:53.840
running Tumbleweed and want to come on to her show, give us your ideas.

56:53.840 --> 56:59.080
And so here we are, one week later, and we've got a good assembly here in our room. And

56:59.080 --> 57:04.720
we've even got a good thread going in the Linux Action Show subreddit. Electrical... Electrician.

57:04.720 --> 57:07.040
Electrical Magnition. I don't know how you say that. How do you say that?

57:07.040 --> 57:10.240
Electrician? I'm not sure. But regardless, the feedback's great.

57:10.240 --> 57:11.240
You sound like an idiot.

57:11.240 --> 57:12.240
Electrician.

57:12.240 --> 57:13.240
That's me. That's me.

57:13.240 --> 57:14.240
There you go.

57:14.240 --> 57:15.480
But there's no M in there.

57:15.480 --> 57:17.680
I know. No, you've just got to emphasize the...

57:17.680 --> 57:20.160
Electrician? I don't know. I'm going to give up.

57:20.160 --> 57:23.640
No, what you do is you double down on that G. All right, so you just checked in on the

57:23.640 --> 57:27.800
latest episode of Linux Unplugged and were stoked to see a segment on my distro of choice.

57:27.800 --> 57:33.320
And we have 26 comments coming in on this thread. And I'm actually kind of excited to

57:33.320 --> 57:38.640
say I want to start with Mr. Brown, R. Brown, from the SUSE project. Kind of get an idea

57:38.640 --> 57:42.600
of how Leap has been received from the end users. And then jump in from the rest of the

57:42.600 --> 57:47.480
Mamba room there. So Mr. Brown, tell me about... What are we? Two weeks? Three weeks in

57:47.480 --> 57:51.280
from the Leap release? I can't remember now. What's the reception been? Any gotchas? Any

57:51.280 --> 57:54.240
surprises? And any interesting tidbits to share with us?

57:54.240 --> 57:59.120
Yeah, it's been 14 days. It's been really good, actually. So I mean, this is all a bit

57:59.120 --> 58:03.360
of an experiment for us, you know. Treading new ground, mixing an enterprise distro with

58:03.360 --> 58:09.920
a community one. And the feedback's been great. The community has been really receptive. Lots

58:09.920 --> 58:14.720
of people trying it. Lots of good feedback. Lots of good feedback from the press. I haven't

58:14.720 --> 58:19.640
read a bad review yet. And now I've said that, someone's going to write one.

58:19.640 --> 58:27.040
Right, yeah. So, you know, 14 days into it is not too long, but has anything sort of

58:27.040 --> 58:31.400
caught you by surprise? Or has anything already kind of been like, okay, we're going to have

58:31.400 --> 58:35.040
to address this? Any kind of like, might have to shift strategy here?

58:35.040 --> 58:36.040
Real life adjustments.

58:36.040 --> 58:41.800
Yeah, it's been interesting with the feedback with our choice of versions for things like

58:41.800 --> 58:48.520
GNOME and KDE, where there's some people who are really happy with KDE 5.4 in there. Some

58:48.520 --> 58:54.200
would prefer to have KDE 4. Some are wondering, like, when are you going to have 5.5? There's

58:54.200 --> 58:59.760
that whole question of like, how fast are we going to move that stuff? And I haven't

58:59.760 --> 59:03.920
got a straight answer for it. I mean, there's so many different moving parts of like, how

59:03.920 --> 59:09.720
fast will the base system move? How much does the community want to maintain it? How much

59:09.720 --> 59:16.120
do we replace in the base system? All that kind of fun stuff. So that's going to be a

59:16.120 --> 59:20.720
good discussion point for 42.2. Same goes for GNOME. I mean, we had a lot of feedback

59:20.720 --> 59:24.760
of like, why did you guys put 3.16 in there instead of 3.18?

59:24.760 --> 59:28.160
Yeah, yeah. I mean, everybody wants the latest and greatest GNOME.

59:28.160 --> 59:29.160
Always.

59:29.160 --> 59:33.320
Always, yeah. Very good. So Gabriel, I know I've been watching you in the subreddit for

59:33.320 --> 59:37.800
a while now. I know you've been a user of OpenSUSE and jumped on the leap since the

59:37.800 --> 59:42.240
beta milestone. So what have been your impressions, Gabriel?

59:42.240 --> 59:50.880
Oh, yes. So my impression is very good. I've started from beta and I saw the review you

59:50.880 --> 59:52.800
made on the show.

59:52.800 --> 59:54.800
A few weeks ago, yeah.

59:54.800 --> 01:00:05.920
Yes, it was very good. I've tried both KDE and GNOME. On KDE, just a couple of freeze

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:15.040
at the beginning but after the first few updates, everything was very good. GNOME is good too.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:23.860
So I'm pretty happy. As you know from everybody knows, I'm a supporter of OpenSUSE. So I like

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:32.400
it very much. I'm using it since one year ago. Probably this is the reason why for me,

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.560
leap is awesome.

01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:42.000
So what's the main thing about leap that's awesome?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:51.240
The stability. I like the idea of having a project that has a professional-maintained

01:00:51.240 --> 01:01:00.000
core plus a community that is giving the, let me say, new things. It's not as new as

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.400
Tumbleweed or Arch but it is new.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:12.320
Yeah, and Tyler, you've been using leap for a past week and so, what are your thoughts

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:15.600
on the KDE version?

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:21.520
So far, I've been really enjoying Plasma 5. I've had a couple of issues I've run into.

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:27.640
There are things about Plasma 5 that still feel a bit incomplete compared to 4. I did

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:33.400
actually have an issue where an update actually made the policy kit quite restrictive on the

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:34.400
desktop.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:38.280
Oh, that's a little troubling. Tell me about that.

01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:44.240
So after an update, I had an issue where the policy kit would not allow the applets to,

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:48.760
let's say, go check for updates or I couldn't just use the applet to change my network.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:54.920
I actually had to go and change the policy kit myself to allow myself to do that.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:55.920
That is probably...

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.920
Those are the things you don't...

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.800
Might be a bug. Might be a bug. Wimpy, you've been running leap for the last week. Tell

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.800
me about that.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:12.240
Yeah, I installed leap on my test machine, which is a fairly old ThinkPad T61P. And I

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:20.520
found a lot about leap to like. I particularly like the way the default installer sets up

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:30.520
the disk partitioning with the root file system using a rather complex structure of B3FS sub-volume

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:31.520
volumes.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.440
It's very impressive what they do by default.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:43.600
I think that's a really smart move. And I imagine is what is powering Snap... Is it

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:44.600
Snapper?

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:45.600
Yeah.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:52.320
So as you do your package installs and package updates, you get these snapshots before and

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:58.520
after and you can what have you. So I really like those features. I think that's very elegantly

01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.520
integrated.

01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:04.680
I also installed the KDE version. So I know traditionally KDE has sort of been the desktop,

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:11.800
the showcase desktop for OpenSUSE. And I haven't really run KDE much. And I really like the

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:19.000
way that that's presented in OpenSUSE because from my point of view, it's a very sane, usable

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:26.360
KDE setup. You know, it's instantly familiar, usable and unconventional.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:34.240
And I ran into a few sort of things that made me look at it sideways a couple of times,

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:41.000
but nothing awful or horrible. I was really very impressed. I thought it was quite elegant.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.280
Now Heavens asks a good question. I want to come back to this for a second. But Barbara

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.000
Wobble in the chat room says he's been using Leap on his home server with a few Docker

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.680
containers running W and Jesse in the container. And he's happy with it so far. He says that

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.360
one of the nice things is that the Ncurses interface to Yast makes it great for headless.

01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:56.640
Yes, I love that.

01:03:56.640 --> 01:04:00.680
Yes, I really do too. Here's Heaven's question. And I'm wondering if anybody in the Mumble

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:07.040
Room has any thoughts on this. And maybe Wimpy, I can start with you. How would you say, Wimpy,

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:12.160
how would you say Leap is for brand new users, like new or newest users to Linux? Do you

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:16.000
think it's a suitable desktop OS?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.160
Once it's installed, it is. But if you've got to install it yourself, maybe not.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:27.760
Why do you say that?

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:33.660
For somebody that's familiar with Linux installers, then you're not going to have any difficulty

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:41.080
with this. It's going to be largely familiar. But for example, when I started the install,

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:46.800
I've got Intel wireless something. I forget what model of chipset. But in the installer,

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:51.560
the Intel firmware for the wireless chipset is not available. So it sort of nags you that

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:57.960
the firmware isn't available. So I just sort of, you know, skip by that and ignore it.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.760
But then that's strange on a four gig ISO that the firmware is not available in the

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:06.360
live session. But then when you've installed the OS, the firmware is clearly there because

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:12.240
the Wi Fi works perfectly post install. But some of some of the way you navigate through

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:19.680
the installer isn't super intuitive. You know, if you've not done a Linux install before,

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:24.160
I think you'd feel a bit out of your depth if you've done any sort of Linux install.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.640
I think I would agree with that. I would be comfortable with it.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.960
I would say that even just I was trying to download it earlier in the week, and it took

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:33.720
a good like three click throughs to get to a page where I could actually download it

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:37.360
easily off the Suse website as well, which was a little like, if you're dedicated, if

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:41.680
you want to do this, it's fine. But yeah, it's not like the one click link. Yeah, yeah,

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.680
that makes sense.

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:43.680
We fixed that.

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.680
Okay.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.680
That's perfect.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.680
Good. Thank you.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:47.680
Two clicks is much better.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.680
I can handle two.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:53.200
Yeah. And I think 33% less clicking.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.200
Exactly.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.200
Exactly.

01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:00.680
33% less matters. Yeah, I wonder I wonder if that actually stops some people from downloading

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.400
it might have, I suppose, in the past.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.240
Just because I'm used to like Ubuntu, right? It's like right on the screen. You're like,

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.520
Oh, click download. It's great.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:10.040
So Kitson, you you kind of like the installer, though, don't you?

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:16.560
I like the installer. I've always liked the OpenSuse installer. I've actually found the

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:23.280
Ubuntu installers and whatnot to be too simplistic. And some of their options I've noticed have

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:29.400
been dangerous. For instance, let's say you have an existing LVM encrypted setup on the

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:35.760
disk and you don't want to wipe it with Ubuntu too bad, you're probably going to have that

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:41.880
wiped. With OpenSuse, I could set that up. I could give it the password. It'll mount

01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:47.160
it. I could say I want to wipe this partition in that partition, but I want to leave everything

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:51.120
else the same. And I think that that's a big difference there.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:56.960
Do you think you can do that on Ubuntu? You can. There are manual partitioning options.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.360
But if you if you just go next, next, next, finish. Yeah, you might have a bad time if

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.800
you had something that you really wanted to keep.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:10.800
Yeah. I wonder, is it really? I feel like I feel like the OpenSuse installer lets you

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.600
go more out of the box if you want. But if you're willing to stay within certain parameters,

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.280
all the installers are kind of a wash.

01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:17.280
Yes.

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:20.280
Yeah. Wimpy, you wanted to comment on Yast.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:25.720
Yeah, I mean, it's been such a long time since I've installed OpenSuse and seriously taken

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:31.240
a look at it. Yast has actually changed considerably. I think it's been rewritten. That probably

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:38.520
gives you an idea how long it is since I last looked at it. And I think where OpenSuse shines

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:46.380
is some of those Yast modules for configuring things like your NIST client or authenticating

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:52.480
with a Windows domain controller. That that's where you see the sort of Yast credentials

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:57.940
coming through on the desk. And there's lots of little things like that that you don't

01:07:57.940 --> 01:08:04.440
find in the other distributions as readily. Certainly not so much sort of out of the box

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:10.800
install features. So there's a lot of good stuff tucked away in Yast. It's a little bit

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:15.480
of a mixed bag still. You know, there's some of the Yast modules are a little bit confusing

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:20.800
to look at and then other modules are just amazing. I forget which one what it's called,

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:25.720
but there's one that you can view your your disks and your partitions and your layouts

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:30.840
in a in a whole load of different ways. And there's one that maps the the physical devices

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:35.840
and the partitions to the volumes. And I just thought that was terrific. You know, and that

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:40.980
actually is very useful for a new user to actually get an easy to understand visual

01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:45.960
representation of how their data is laid out on their disk. So I thought Yast was pretty

01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:51.400
cool. Yeah, I agree. I that's that's a real area where you can underscore it to also setting

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:57.720
up like Xen or KVM. Yep. Super easy. Yeah. Yeah, that was that was really nice, actually.

01:08:57.720 --> 01:09:01.880
Yeah. And then the nice butterfs support with the virtualization. Like those two go hand

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.880
in hand with snapper built in. So when you install a package, you're getting snapshots.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.800
I mean, it's real slick. It's real slick. Yeah. And that's something about the btfs

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.360
support quickly. Yeah, it was it was something that we kind of forgot to talk about a lot

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:18.080
with with leaps release. Someone mentioned it already with the different sub volumes

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:23.800
that were setting up by default. Part of that is to shield stuff from snapper. So things

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:27.640
like your home directory don't get eaten up into all those snapshots. Yeah. But we've

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:34.820
also started using the non copy on write attribute for certain key areas. So things like your

01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:39.960
database folders, libvote folders, all that kind of junk where they can have big files

01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:47.760
with lots of nasty IO, you can still use that on btfs, it won't do copy on writes the performances,

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:53.560
you know, ext4, like, yeah, it really seems like the benefits of openSUSE, a sort of embracing

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.920
butterfs before everybody else are paying off. I really appreciate that they are doing

01:09:56.920 --> 01:10:01.240
this to their show. Yeah, showcasing how you can write there's some places where it's not

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:05.800
ready. Yeah, it is where it is. It is something I touched on specifically. I remember I spent

01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:09.560
some time talking about this on my review on the Linux action show is that it is I think

01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:13.920
the most intelligent breakdown of sub volumes like I mentioned in the chat room that Postgres

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:17.320
is broken out to another example where maybe copy on write isn't doesn't make a lot of

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:21.080
sense or your virtual machines copy on write doesn't make a lot of sense. And it is the

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.440
number one thing that can hit your performance on a butterfs file system. And so the fact

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:28.360
that SUSE has thought about that, I think very much shows that they've been, you know,

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:31.680
they've been trying this for a little while. And Wimpy, in that kind of sense, I agree

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.720
with you. It's not necessarily a new user. I mean, it can be a new user's distro, but

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:40.400
it also can be a power user's distro, too. Yeah, I think so. I know if you're if you're

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:48.080
a an admin, more more an admin than a developer, I would say I think open SUSE is a is a nice

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:52.080
distro. Yeah, it seems like a great place to host some hosts and deployments. Yeah,

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:57.440
I'm wondering if we'll start seeing it take off in like the VPS and cloud sphere as much

01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:04.440
that would really be big. Yeah, yeah. We already have some hosts already offering leap as part

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:07.820
of the hosting package. Yeah, leap, especially, it seems like yeah, you kind of got the stable

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:12.680
is about once a year, I can handle a refresh, right? But like, I don't, maybe I don't need

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:17.640
to micromanage it more. Right. But it gets, you know, security spot. Yeah. Dasani, you've

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.600
been using tumbleweed and stable. And they are sharing the same home directory. Tell

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:29.160
me about that. And has it blown up in your face yet? Nope, not yet. Yeah, for the home

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:38.520
directory, or actually, what's the one you use for the robust one? XFS? Yes, that one.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:44.640
I use XFS in the home directory and I share. So tumbleweed can get however unstable I know

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:51.680
I can always roll it back. Or if it gets corrupted, I can always kill it. But also I have BTRFS

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:59.600
running my stable, I guess leap is what it's called now. And that is got all my games on

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:06.080
it. So the kernel stays stable, the proprietary drivers, unfortunately, but yeah, they stay

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:14.600
the same. And so I can play Borderlands 2 on stable and runs beautifully. And I can

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:20.440
if I want to play with like, builder, it will run beautifully as well. And I don't have

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:24.840
to wait till next year. Yeah, that's a good point. And Wimpy, you had a great question

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:32.920
for our Brown about rolling distros. I'd love to hear it. Yeah, I saw the Linux voice, voice

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:37.800
of the masses, the question asking about I think it was something to do with rolling

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:44.920
releases, I can't remember was it containerization. But I saw Richard comment on there that he

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:51.560
had a feeling that rolling release was sort of vital to the future of Linux distro at

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:56.960
that point. Yeah, that was from one of my slide decks. I have a lovely slide that I

01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:01.320
kind of throw in there to troll people where it says, yeah, rolling releases of the future

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:05.720
of Linux, but I do honestly believe it. I mean, if you look at the pace of how upstream

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:11.240
stuff is changing, the old distribution model just can't keep up, you know, with kernel

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:17.240
changes, base system changes, everything just moving too fast. And in many cases, like a

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:22.480
lot of the, if you look at things like system D, gnome, etc, you know, you need to move

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:29.160
the base system in order to move the user space. So long term, and I'm in cases of,

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:33.440
you know, enterprise, maybe we're talking a decade from now, in other cases, maybe five

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:41.400
years, whatever. But I really think rolling releases, moving everything at a faster pace,

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:46.160
and then worrying about things like integration and testing and containerization and whatever,

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:50.920
is how we're going to see distros having to evolve, because otherwise, we just can't keep

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:55.960
up. We're out of date by the time we ship. Yeah, very much. I completely agree. Yeah,

01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:01.760
I do too, actually. Popi, do you want to expand on that? No. Yeah, I don't really need to

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.120
either. I completely agree as well. Like, I mean, we just heard from the beginning of

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:07.880
this conversation, why are you shipping gnome 316? Even Microsoft is doing that with the

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:12.760
new Windows 10, right? Yeah, I think the new expectation is, well, I've heard about this

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:16.640
really awesome thing on that blog, and now I want it. I want it. Why can't I get it?

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:21.720
I want it. I want it right now. And yeah, that's, yeah. So that's the Linux community

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:26.760
in a nutshell. Well, you know, I mean, that's sort of put in the worst light. But the reality

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:31.480
is there is really smart people making really awesome code that's available for free that

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:36.280
makes your life better. And yeah, you do want it. Because it makes crap easier, and it makes

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.000
crap better. And you don't want to have to deal with installing a whole bunch of stuff

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.600
or dealing with conflicts. You just want it. And you know, you look at XGD app, and you

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.880
look at Docker, and you look at all this different stuff that is talking about shipping applications

01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:51.080
and containers, and it seems like that's already a foregone conclusion as well. And that sort

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:56.040
of isolates you from the touch and go of a rolling release. So we're kind of coming upon

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.560
this problem with two different solutions at the same time. And I think that Tumbleweed

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:05.420
is a, you know, it's a very specific, unique approach to this particular problem. And it's

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:09.200
one that I've kind of fantasized about for years. So it's really cool to see it actually

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.960
ship. So yeah, anybody else before we wrap up have any other comments on OpenSUSE Leap

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.360
or things of this nature?

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:23.200
Yeah, one thing that I really do like about OpenSUSE as well that I've noticed is that

01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:27.980
pretty much you can customize it from the get go to be your own distribution. Yeah,

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:33.480
look at the way the software manager works and everything. You can get the network installed.

01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:37.880
You could click GNOME, for instance, as your default desktop. Then you can click software

01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:43.520
at the summary, and you can go in and you could say, I don't want this, but I want this,

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:49.040
that, and that. And then all that stuff gets uploaded there, and it's, you know, you're

01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:51.800
not wasting any bandwidth or anything like that.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.560
Yeah, you know, and it's funny because that's how it used to be. So you used to do it in

01:15:55.560 --> 01:16:01.280
distros. I want the KDE desktop environment. I want the web browsing packages and all of

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.280
that stuff.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:03.920
I can imagine the old Debian menu right now.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.760
Right. And then Ubuntu came along, and it's like, well, we'll just pick all the best stuff

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:10.480
for you by default. And that kind of became the trend for a while. And now there's like,

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:14.480
oh, I kind of like being able to choose. I mean, there's a middle ground there, too.

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:17.440
And I was going to say, I thought what you were going to mention was the build studio

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.600
because that's really where you can customize. Yeah. If you guys out there listening to episode

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.960
119 and want to share your thoughts on Leap, go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com or go to

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:29.480
jupyterbroadcasting.com. We really do check it. Please do.

01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:34.160
And it's been interesting to see. I specifically think they're doing something right here,

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:39.540
them being the OpenSUSE project, because without question, without question, it has gotten

01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:45.740
more and more attention in our community over the last year. And there was a point in time

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:48.200
where we were not talking about it very much anymore, OpenSUSE.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.200
It's kind of the unmentioned third player.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:57.640
And I think this is regearing in a way that much more matches the expectations and desires

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:02.720
of today's Linux user. I think it's fascinating. And I think it's also something that OpenSUSE

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:06.580
was in the best position to deliver on. Arch can't do it. They're too far into the very

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:10.080
rolling release. Ubuntu can't do it. They've got their system. Fedora can't do it. They're

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.080
trying to reform it, but they can't quite do it.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.800
And really, you look back at it now, and it almost seems like, well, yeah, of course it

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:20.000
had to be OpenSUSE. But at the time before they made this leap, you couldn't see it.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.600
But now you look back on it and go, oh, they're in the perfect position. They have the perfect

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:26.200
tool set. And they're ready to go. I feel like it hits that sweet spot, too, where you

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.440
have people, maybe they're in our community, they use Arch at home. But at work, they've

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:34.280
got CentOS or RHEL deployed, and they're a little like, oh, this is so old. I keep having

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:38.320
to deploy my own, configure things from source because it isn't in my repo. And they'll be

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:42.520
like, when we refresh our server, what's the next thing we're using? Maybe it's OpenSUSE.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:48.720
Maybe. Maybe. You get that live kernel patching in there. You get that, you know, whoo-wee!

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.160
I like that. I like that. All right. Well, okay, last chance. Are there any closing statements

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:59.160
from the Mumba Room on OpenSUSE and Leap going once? Yeah, go ahead.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:01.520
Leap is now track...

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:06.160
Yeah, go ahead. No, go ahead. Go ahead.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:12.000
Leap is now being... is now tracking SUSE, which is the thing why they're calling it

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.760
Leap now. So that's the thing. You can now cleanly... Leap is the ambition. Transition

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.240
from Leap to straight up SUSE, if you want.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.080
Yeah. And I know there's one other person trying to jump in there. I didn't catch who

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:27.000
it was, but go ahead.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:36.520
So yeah, Gabriel. So one of the good things I like in OpenSUSE Project is that we have

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.520
both.

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.520
Right.

01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:46.520
Stable and rolling together. So in a few clicks, I can move from stable to rolling using zippered

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.520
up.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.520
Yeah, it seems to be...

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.880
That's a very good point, actually, because it's the only distribution doing that.

01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:55.640
Yeah. And I don't want to give the impression that you're going to have zero problems when

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:59.280
you make that transition. Like, you know, your NVIDIA driver might start complaining,

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:04.080
but it is pretty damn neat. It is pretty cool. And if that kind of stuff doesn't matter to

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:12.480
you, it is an incredible ability to make that switch. It is worth mentioning. Yeah. And

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:15.880
I don't think anybody else is quite doing it like this with the complete picture. So

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.440
it's pretty exciting to see it happen.

01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.400
And with the pedigree that they have.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.880
That too, right? That's also a really good point.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:22.880
It's not an upstart.

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.880
And the brand.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:24.880
Yeah, right.

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:27.400
Yeah, right. Yeah, yes. It's not some distro that nobody's running.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.960
That won't be here in a year or two years, right?

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:34.520
Yeah, very much so. Very much so. Yeah, R Brown, you want to make a quick comment on

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:37.040
the migration. Go ahead. I'm curious about that.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.740
Just hopping from leap to tumbleweed. When you're doing it with just the official repositories,

01:19:41.740 --> 01:19:47.100
we test that as like a standard OpenQA thing. So like every time there's a tumbleweed update,

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:51.560
we see that you can get from leap to there and back. And in fact, back we don't test

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:55.320
that much, but we know Zippa does it with its eyes closed, or you can just use Snap

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.320
it.

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:57.320
Nice.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:00.480
You can always hop over, try it, roll it back, and everything's wonderful and done.

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.480
Easy peasy.

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.640
Ooh, that's really cool. That is really cool.

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:04.640
You almost take it for granted.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:05.640
You almost do, right?

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.320
And we've got a few things from the SLE guys. If some of the stuff they're slipping in their

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:14.480
new service packs, which I'm really keen to throw into 42.2 to make that even slicker.

01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.640
What would it take to make that actually happen? Is it just somebody saying, I'll do it? Or

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.920
what? Does somebody get assigned that job? How does that happen?

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.840
That's just going to be figuring out a few differences between how our infrastructure

01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.480
works and how the enterprise infrastructure works. Because there's things like repo metadata

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:37.640
where they can say, okay, this release can upgrade to that release and that stuff. And

01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:41.520
we haven't got that stuff plumbed into our new service yet.

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:45.800
What does it feel like to you, being a bit out on the edge, saying, here's the distro,

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:49.760
it's released, now we have thousands of people using it, but we don't actually have that

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:53.520
particular question answered yet?

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:54.520
Which particular question?

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.520
Sorry.

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:59.960
How exactly you might take something from Sles, SUSE Enterprise Linux Server, a great

01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:05.320
feature, and move it down to Leap. It seems like that's going to be a cornerstone feature

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:09.600
of Leap, but maybe not something that's totally been figured out yet, even though it's now

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:15.240
out there for users. Does that feel sort of like, well, we're just kind of going by the

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:17.840
seat of our pants and we're just going to figure it out as we go, because we know that's

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:22.880
the best way to do it? Or what is your impression sitting there in the project when there's

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:26.120
real questions about how do you migrate something like that, like a piece of technology from

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:31.560
Upstream or Sles, and push it out to Leap? And you know you want to do it, and you've

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:36.120
even kind of publicly committed to doing it, but there's not actually a process or a plan

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.680
to do that thing.

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:43.000
99 times out of 100, SUSE are doing that as part of the daily job anyway. So even when

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:48.200
they're working on SLE, they, you know, engineering at SUSE, work on Tumbleweed at the same time.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:52.640
If they're doing a new thing in SLE, in fact, I think it's still a policy in many cases

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:57.160
where like their internal commit to SLE will get rejected if there isn't a matching one

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.160
to Tumbleweed.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:59.160
Wow.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.160
Okay.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:06.000
So that, you know, Upstream first is a common policy. In the case of Leap or stuff like

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.480
this where it's kind of falling through the cracks because it's not a code thing but kind

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:17.240
of an infrastructure thing, we'll figure it out. I mean it's just a case of timing, syncing,

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:20.280
talking to each other. I'm sure we'll come up with a solution.

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:25.600
Yeah. Yeah. It is an interesting time. Well, I'm glad that, thank you everybody who showed

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:29.080
up to chat about this. Thank you R. Brown and everybody who's been talking about this.

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:32.880
It is really, really, really cool to see this kind of, see a lot more passion and interest

01:22:32.880 --> 01:22:33.880
pick up.

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:34.880
There's some great momentum here.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.280
I want to tell you about something else that's got some great passion. Ting, my mobile service

01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:41.320
provider and mobile that makes sense. Go to linux.ting.com. Why? Because you like putting

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:44.400
Linux in your history bar. I know you got RedTube in there and stuff like that. Now

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:50.800
you can put Linux in your history bar. linux.ting.com. Get $25 off your first Ting device or $25 in

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.020
service credit if you bring your own device like I did. And $25 paid for my first month

01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:59.520
of Ting right off the top. It was nuts. Ting is mobile that makes sense because you just

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:06.760
pay for what you use. There's no contract, no determination fee, boomsies and even because

01:23:06.760 --> 01:23:10.720
they hate contracts with a passion will help you get out of your existing contract with

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:15.680
their ETF relief program. I love that. That's sweet. Go to linux.ting.com right now to support

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:20.120
this show. Keep us on the air please and also get yourself that discount. Take a look at

01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:23.320
some of their different devices there. They have a bunch of good stuff and also when you

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:26.600
go to linux.ting.com, I want you to try out their savings calculator. Plug in your stuff

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:30.160
and see if it makes a good sense. Literally, does it make sense? Are you going to save

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.480
some sense? Try it out. I got an email today. I wonder if he's in the chat room. I don't

01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:38.160
see him in there. I don't see him in there but I got an email today where he's like,

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:44.760
you know I had a carrier charging me a ton of money. My bill was over $80 after taxes.

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:48.880
Switched to Ting, $30. Same with me. I got three lines about the same story. It's really

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:52.320
nice. Go to linux.ting.com to get started. They got two different networks, GSM and CDMA.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:56.240
You can choose from some more devices than ever you can bring. And when you bring your

01:23:56.240 --> 01:24:01.720
own device, then it's really incredibly, incredibly valuable. But if you go to linux.ting.com,

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:05.680
you can also get $25 off a brand new device that's unlocked. No contract. You pay for

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:09.920
what you use. They got an awesome dashboard and really awesome customer service. And Ting's

01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:16.600
all about it. They're not just about bucking the trend on contracts and early termination

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.080
fees. They're also about cutting the cord and all that kind of stuff. They have some

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:22.960
great posts about cutting the cord recently and keeping the content. Cut the network but

01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:29.000
keep the content. They got a post about that. And then you got to love Kyra. You got to

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.280
love Kyra. She's posting up app pics over on the Ting blog and she's got one for your

01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:35.760
faces right now. It's called Swappa. What's your phone worth? I'm Kyra and this is the

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:44.160
Ting app of the week. Swappa is an online marketplace where you can buy and sell used

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:47.560
devices. If you've ever wondered how much you'd get for your phone if you were to sell

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.560
it, this is the app that will tell you. While you can't buy or sell directly through the

01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:56.320
app, it's a perfect price checker and the first of its kind. Just tap to get a realistic

01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:01.320
valuation of your used smartphone. Here you can select a specific model and view a pricing

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:05.640
chart of your phone over its lifetime. Tap the orange circle in the bottom right to check

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:10.400
out other devices too. You can use the search bar or search by manufacturers and providers

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:14.160
like Ting. If you're thinking about an upgrade or just wondering how much you could get for

01:25:14.160 --> 01:25:18.600
your smartphone, Swappa price is worth checking out. Grab the app for free on Android. You

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:22.520
can find the link in the description below. Thanks for watching and see you soon.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:23.520
Thank you, Kyra.

01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:29.280
Linux.ting.com. Thank you, Kyra. That's right. Linux.ting.com. Go there and try it and support

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.560
the show just by checking them out. Linux.ting.com. It's pretty cool. And those are some good

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:37.400
apps and we've had some previous ones before and Kyra's always, I always enjoy having Kyra

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.960
come on. I wanted to have the 12 days of Kyra in December but I haven't been able to make

01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:44.560
it work out yet. Yeah, but I haven't tried it yet.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:48.080
Linux.ting.com. Go check out Ting. It really is mobile that makes sense. You support this

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:53.280
show and you finally get out of that really crappy contract where they totally own you.

01:25:53.280 --> 01:26:01.080
Linux.ting.com. Wes, I am so effing hoping that in a couple of weeks I'll be sitting

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:06.720
here giving you a review of my Libre or Librem. I don't even remember anymore. Librem. Librem

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:15.960
Prism 15. The Librem Prism 15. Purism. Purism. Thank you. Thank you. 15 will be shipping

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:20.760
in phases. 10 pieces of light gray. What is that? 10 PCs? Really? Only 10? Already shipping

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:26.360
another 10? Either way, I should be getting my Librem or Purism or whatever it is. I can't

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.400
even remember because I bought it so long ago. Someday. I should be getting my ultimate

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:38.240
Linux laptop soon to review. This is exciting. I actually am not that super excited anymore.

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:42.440
I was even as... You don't even seem like you believe it's happening. I don't. Because

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:47.560
it's been delayed twice now and I actually needed it. The first time I got delayed, the

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:51.720
first delay was I desperately needed a new laptop because of a work thing we were doing

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:58.120
and I didn't. I like how you say work. We don't know what it is you do for work. Like

01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:03.680
a work thing, not this radio station. You know, podcasting. I know, right? Yeah. Well,

01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.580
the thing about it was, because I've just been thinking about it, my window of opportunity

01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:14.400
for getting this laptop has passed and I kind of regret... Now you're getting an Oryx, so...

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:19.120
Right. I want... Actually, now I want an Oryx. Exactly. And I kind of regret funding this

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:23.960
thing. I mean, I wanted to fund and I wanted to get behind something that was the ultimate

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:28.260
Linux laptop. Nice, a MacBook competitor that you can install a bunch of distros on, had

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:33.440
physical switch buttons for the webcam and things like that. You know what, though? It's

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:39.160
going to be the end of the year soon and I've moved on and I'm really kind of bummed that

01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:43.080
I got caught up in this. I wanted to do this for a review and so I'm hoping that once this

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:48.360
thing shows up, my enthusiasm returns, but at this point... At this point, it's a little

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:55.200
hmm. Yeah, it really will depend on what shows up at your doorstep and how you like it. Wimpy,

01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.080
I have not read the recent reviews. What have you seen? I'm not going to say. I'm going

01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:05.040
to let you read them for yourself. Oh, no. Secret, secret. It's not secret. If you search

01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:11.720
around you'll find it. I just don't want to go down as a purism naysayer. Well, that says

01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:18.160
it. Despite the fact that I am. All right. See, when you say that, I think I'm going

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.720
to read the reviews and I'm going to be disappointed is what I'm taking away as an impression here

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:31.280
and I don't like that. Oh, man. All right. And I don't know. What should I have done?

01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:35.880
As the idealist Linux user, should I not have crowdfunded this? It seems like this was a

01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:42.040
good honest effort to try to fund. I think you had a duty to fund it. You know, with

01:28:42.040 --> 01:28:46.960
the weight of the Linux action show behind you, this was a big initiative, wasn't it?

01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:52.280
It was a bold statement that purism made. You had to back it. You had to get the equipment

01:28:52.280 --> 01:29:02.280
and you have to review it. The thing is, is that it was a year ago when it was first tabled

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:07.960
and you can't know a year ago how long this crowdfunding campaign is going to take to

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:14.680
turn into a reality. I think you've done the right thing in terms of, you know, for the

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:18.640
Linux action show, you've done the right thing. Whether or not it was the right thing for

01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:22.200
you to do personally or not, you'll be able to tell us when you get the unit and review

01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:23.200
it.

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:24.200
Yeah, that is exactly what it is.

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.520
Either way, I think we're going to get a really good Chris Last rant.

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:34.040
You know, I've interviewed the founder and I've met him in person. I know he even knows

01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:39.600
which laptop is mine. He knows which one is mine. I'm like, okay, I feel like I should

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:46.280
be excited here, but it was a year ago. To be honest with you, like Wimpy said, the enthusiasm

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:52.160
personally has dwindled and professionally I'm still interested. Are you amazed? I don't

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:54.240
know if people can hear it in the background right here. I'm going to turn on my microphone

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.880
just for a second. Hold on. Hold on.

01:29:57.880 --> 01:29:59.720
It sounds like a fan, really almost.

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:00.720
Yes, the wind.

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:01.720
Are you in a plane?

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:06.800
Yeah, it is really, it is really windy here. I'm amazed that we haven't been knocked offline

01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.800
yet.

01:30:07.800 --> 01:30:10.520
No, it's really, it's really windy here as well.

01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:11.520
Yeah, I know.

01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:12.520
Really, really windy.

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:16.960
Yeah, I think actually about the same speeds. It is, what about it? What was it? 110 km?

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:19.480
It was, yeah, it was really...

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.520
We do miles an hour here. You don't have to convert it.

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:25.280
Oh, you do? Okay. All right. Very nice. Impressive. I think we're about 60, 65 miles per hour

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:26.600
wind here. It is really...

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:31.000
I was so proud of myself for having the conversion.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:35.760
I was. That was impressive. You've been staring at your car dial, haven't you?

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:40.680
No, I Googled it. Yeah. All right. Well, I'll let you guys know if I get it because they're

01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:44.800
supposed to be shipping Librem 15 units with dark gray coming with 4K screens. I believe

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:46.360
mine is 1080p.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:50.280
You should just put this here where this Windows laptop is, just for my sake, really.

01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:53.240
Right. I know, really. I'm amazed that it hasn't been deactivated yet.

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.360
No, it still shows the watermark.

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:58.560
Wow. I almost feel like I want to keep... I feel like Kramer right now. I want to keep

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:00.120
going until the power knocks us offline.

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:01.840
I know, right? How long can we go?

01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:02.840
Right. I feel like we're...

01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:03.840
Love the marathon.

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:06.400
We're running on fumes right now. It's damn impressive.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.960
It's a good idea for a larger show.

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:11.480
Yeah. All right. Well, we'll wrap it up there while we... So that way we can actually record

01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:14.600
the entire episode and not lose the file. That would probably be a good idea. That would

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:18.360
probably be good because I have lost so many episodes in the past that I can't bear to

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:21.360
lose another one. But I would love to have you join us live. Go over to jblive.tv on

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:25.840
a Tuesday at 2 p.m. Pacific or go to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar, and you get this converted

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:27.320
to your local time zone.

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:28.320
It's amazing.

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:31.840
Also, I'm going to give one more plug for Rover Log 15 for our trip to System76. I say

01:31:31.840 --> 01:31:34.560
that because right now, over on the reruns machine over there, I'm looking at 391.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:35.560
Hey, look at that.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.840
Live from System76. It's very... It's well timed. You know, that was such a cool setup

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:42.200
they had for us with the illuminated desk and all.

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:46.240
It's amazing. And like the nice backing wallpaper. It looks like you're out in Hollywood.

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:52.760
It's their booth setup, and it was super cool. And, you know, this was like all live events.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:56.160
It was down to the wire to get that work, and it was a lot of fun. But a big thank you

01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:58.920
to System76 for having us out there, too.

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:02.480
So anyways, I'll wrap it up by just saying our Mumble Room is an open room. There's no

01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:06.400
secret password. There's no secret code you need to know. Just go over to jblive.tv, do

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:10.880
Bang Mumble. You'll get the Mumble server info, and then we just have mods who are awesome,

01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:12.280
and I love them, and I want to give them kisses.

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.280
Thank you, guys.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:15.480
Because I yelled at them today. I'm like, what the hell, guys? But no, now I'm saying

01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:16.480
I love them.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:17.480
He loves you. He loves you.

01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:21.080
That was in private, but in public I say they're great. That's what I do. And you can talk

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:25.040
to those mods, and they'll check your microphone and see if you can join our virtual lug, and

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:29.520
then come in and share your opinion on stuff. LinuxActionShow.Reddit.com for topics or feedback

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:33.680
or check for the thread for 119 in there. And I think, is there anything else we need

01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:34.680
to cover this week, Wes?

01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:36.160
I don't think so. I think we've hit it right on the head.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:39.880
Mumble Room, thank you guys for joining us. And of course, if there's anything we're forgetting,

01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:42.480
we'll also have the post show, which we can chat in.

01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:44.040
Or please contribute to the subreddit.

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.600
Yeah, that does really help quite a bit.

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:46.600
We'll bring it right back up.

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.600
Yeah, LinuxActionShow.Reddit.com.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:54.920
Alright, so as we are recording right now, hopefully this isn't the only show you hear,

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:57.400
because the power just went out again and the lights are flickering.

01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.400
If so, welcome, goodbye, hello, everything.

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:02.720
I shouldn't have said anything. I apologize, Linux Unplugged 119 is coming to an end right

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.160
now while we still have power. My God, I have no idea if we're going to make it. The lights

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:07.160
are flickering.

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.480
We'll see if we're here next week. We don't know.

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.360
I don't know, but thank you very much for tuning in. Go over to JupiterBroadcasting.com

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:16.160
slash calendar to get live events. JupiterBroadcasting.com slash calendar for all that stuff, and contact

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:19.960
slash contact for emails and slash live for the livestream. It's all slashes.

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:20.960
Everything.

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:21.960
Everything.

01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:22.960
Slash, slash, slash.

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:25.280
Wow. Well, hopefully this wasn't the only show we got. And thank you so much for tuning

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.280
this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:27.280
We really appreciate it. Come back next week. No power outages.

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:28.280
If we don't get blown away, we'll be here.

01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:57.000
See you then.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000
Yeah, we were unplugged.

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.360
Even the Hughes lights got reset. That's how you know it's bad.

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.440
My connection to Quossel dropped. What is this?

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:10.680
Now, before everybody writes in and says, good at UPS, listen. Listen, they add line

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:16.160
noise. If you don't want bzzz in your podcast, you don't want Chris running everything on

01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:17.440
UPS. You can fit a few in there.

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:20.400
Otherwise, we'll have to get conditioners, and it's a whole thing.

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:23.840
Now, I know our friends across the pond, they probably don't have this power issue we have

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:27.120
here in Washington, where all of our power lines are above ground.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.680
Yeah, who bury things. That's insane.

01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.680
That's nuts, right?

01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:31.680
Yeah.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:34.920
You can just string them up very loosely on the side of the road.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:38.640
Oh, wow. That was so funny. Wes and I are just sitting here looking at each other like,

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:41.040
oh, wow, we just lost power. That sucks.

01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:42.040
Seriously?

01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:46.160
Sorry, guys. Did you all know in the mom room immediately what happened? You all must have.

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:47.160
Yep.

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:48.160
Yeah.

01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:49.160
Yeah.

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:50.160
Yeah.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:51.160
We were just fooled.

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:52.160
Yeah. We were gone.

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:53.160
There was an awkward silence.

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:54.160
And then they're gone.

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:57.880
All right. Well, we should probably wrap up so we can get this file, but thank you guys

01:34:57.880 --> 01:34:59.240
very much. Great show.

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:00.240
Absolutely.

01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:03.160
Sorry we have to kind of rush out of here, but I don't want to lose the file. Hopefully,

01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:05.880
we have more than just this for the show release this week.

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:06.880
Yes.

01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:09.160
Oh, come on, Scale Engine. You have a backup. You're our only hope.

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:10.640
Chris, I've got a question for you.

01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:11.640
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

01:35:11.640 --> 01:35:15.120
In your time in the trenches helping people move away from Windows and businesses.

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.120
Down in the trenches.

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.240
What did you use? Did you have a deal with Exchange compatibility?

01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:22.440
Oh, man. That's a good question.

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:27.360
Exchange compatibility was, for myself, I'll tell you my personal story.

01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:28.360
Yes.

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:32.440
Personally, it was the thing that held up my conversion to Linux the longest on my work

01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:33.440
desktop computer.

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.440
I can see that.

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:40.240
And now, this goes back to why I have such a soft spot for Crossover, Office, because

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:46.840
they made it possible to not just be connected, but actually use a legitimate outlook.

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:52.120
I started with Evolution and the Exchange data server and all of that, and it was okay,

01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:56.680
and it was my preferred way to go, but it just... So many times, little things didn't

01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:57.680
work right.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:36:01.280
And so, for Crossover, Office to come along and give me actual outlook, even though I

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:03.000
hated Outlook, but to give me actual outlook...

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.000
A full-on outlook.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.080
Yeah. Oh, man. That was such a game-changer for me. And then, it became less important

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:17.480
after Exchange 2003, or whatever they called it, where they started to get the Outlook

01:36:17.480 --> 01:36:21.240
web access interface a little bit better, and then it became, well, I could just use

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.240
the web browser.

01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:23.240
You could just use the web browser.

01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:25.680
And then, now, today, in 2015, it is not a weird concept at all to say, well, I'll just

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:26.680
check my mail on the web browser.

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.400
Right. You already have Gmail in one tab.

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:35.080
Right. But back in 2005, 2004, 2003, you were a maniac. Squirrel Mail was like good web

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:40.800
mail, and that was what you had. And I tried so many times. I tried using Thunderbird and

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:45.920
LDAP and Kmail, and just so many different things I tried to use.

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:56.840
And so, for me, the slow but steady march of companies failing to very often upgrade

01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:02.560
their office installation, just the slow but steady pace they have there, meant that Wine

01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:05.760
compatibility was almost a guaranteed thing with the version of Outlook they would be

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:06.760
using.

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:07.760
They would have known.

01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:08.760
Yeah.

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:09.760
Right.

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:10.760
So, everywhere I went, there was almost always like, if they got to this... Well, what I

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:15.840
eventually did later on is I developed this scale. And on this scale, you could just

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:20.720
use Outlook web access. And on the other end of the scale, you had Run Wine and Outlook,

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:21.720
right?

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:22.720
Right.

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:25.640
And usually in the middle was where Evolution sat, or even a little bit towards the Use

01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:30.680
Outlook web mail scale, Thunderbird sat. And so, what I would normally do is I would suss

01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.320
up... And I'm drawing Wes a diagram here.

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:33.320
It's a beautiful diagram.

01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:34.320
Yeah.

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.320
I will attest to this.

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:37.840
What I would normally do is I normally found that most users sat in the Thunderbird to

01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:42.440
Outlook range or between Evolution, and I would actually usually just avoid Evolution altogether

01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:44.160
because I found the stability to be unpredictable.

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:45.160
I see. Yeah.

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:49.280
Now, every now and then, you had your high-ends, which had to go with your wines.

01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.280
Right.

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:51.280
And then...

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.280
They needed everything. They used all those features.

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:53.280
Yeah.

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.120
And then now, I think if I was still doing it, I would probably just have them use Outlook

01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.120
web access.

01:37:58.120 --> 01:37:59.120
Yeah.

01:37:59.120 --> 01:38:01.320
And that would probably be fine. Why do you ask?

01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:06.080
Oh, I was just playing with a tool I found that takes Exchange and translates it into

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:09.080
IMAP, CardDav, CalDav, and LDav.

01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.080
No.

01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:11.080
Yeah.

01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.080
Now, do you have to run it on the Exchange server?

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.080
Nope.

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.080
Oh, now you got me.

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:15.080
You can either run it locally or set it up as a transparent...

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.080
What's it called?

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:17.080
What's it called?

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:18.080
I'm going to write it down.

01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:19.080
DavMail.

01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:20.080
Okay. Yeah.

01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:21.080
So it makes it like a web-dav thing, huh?

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:22.080
It is Java.

01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:23.080
But I had no problem running it.

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:24.080
They have a dev and...

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:29.440
So the DavMail process goes out and connects to an Exchange server over what?

01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:30.440
OWA?

01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:31.440
Mappy?

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:34.720
It can use OWA, and then it also uses Exchange web services.

01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:35.720
Okay.

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:39.240
So you're pretty much going to get even like address book lookup and stuff like that?

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:40.240
Yeah.

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:41.240
You can do address book lookup, calendar.

01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:44.080
I haven't tested the full suite, but IMAP works really well.

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.280
So your work uses Exchange?

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:46.280
It does, yes.

01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:47.280
Yeah.

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.320
And yeah, OWA works fine, but there's some stuff where I want to set up some scripts

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:54.120
that can check and do email-related actions.

01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.120
What about things like out-of-office?

01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:58.200
Do you have to go to the webmail to set that still, or do you not?

01:38:58.200 --> 01:38:59.200
That's a good question.

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:00.200
Yeah.

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.200
I'll have to experiment with that.

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:02.200
Because that's always the thing that was totally...

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:03.200
Right.

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.200
It's those little details at the ends.

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.200
Yes.

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:06.200
Yeah.

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:10.680
Exchange has gotten a lot easier in the era of smartphones and things like that, but...

01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:16.640
And I know Office 365 even has a JSON API now, so if you go that far, then it gets better.

01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:19.920
It was really, though... Like you said back when I was in the trenches, it was really

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:25.600
that thing... And I'm specifically reflecting on Exchange 5.5, Exchange 2000, and Exchange

01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:31.280
2003, and just watching that... Watching how they had... Microsoft had such a brilliant

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:32.280
lockdown.

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:33.280
Oh, yeah.

01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:34.280
It's crazy.

01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:35.280
It's all just one big thing.

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.120
It was really an active directory solidified all of it, right?

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.120
It worked well enough.

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:40.120
Yeah.

01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:41.120
It was really interesting.

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:47.440
It was actually... Active directory was perfect, because what it was, was it was a significant

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:51.480
organizational improvement over NT4 and that paradigm.

01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:56.960
And it was much more in line with NetWare's eDirectory and others.

01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:02.880
And it managed to not only make organizationing more streamlined, but it also could accommodate

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.040
acquisitions and mergers that businesses faced.

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.040
Sure.

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:07.040
Right.

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:08.040
That was something supported.

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.040
You understood how to do it.

01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:10.040
Yeah.

01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:12.360
You could do acquisition mergers with other companies and integrate them into your active

01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:15.000
directory, which was, for the business world, that's a big deal.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:21.440
And then on top of that, they managed to... If you're going to go active directory, well,

01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:23.600
then you have to have a Windows DNS server.

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:27.440
And if you're going to go active directory, you should probably do DHCP on a Windows server,

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:30.960
because that DHCP server will automatically, dynamically update the DNS entries, which

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:31.960
is important.

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:32.960
Oh, I've been playing with that at work as well.

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:35.600
Which is important for active directory to function correctly.

01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:37.960
And if you're going to go active directory, you might as well go Exchange, because that's

01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:41.520
going to tie into all your user accounts, and that'll make single sign-on possible.

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:44.720
And if you're going to go active directory, you might as well go IIS on your internet

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:48.360
server, because then you can use single sign-on for your internet as well.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:51.600
And yeah, we'd prefer to use Apache, but single sign-on's a big deal.

01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:55.120
We don't want users to have to enter passwords, so we'll go IIS here.

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:59.000
And it's such a brilliant way to lock you in.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.760
It's totally the old model, right?

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:04.200
And it doesn't really apply anymore, and yeah, active directory's still huge and all that

01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.200
kind of stuff.

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:09.360
I mean, it just is such, it was such a stroke of genius on Microsoft's part, right?

01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.760
When Windows was going to be everywhere.

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:11.760
Yes.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:13.360
Yeah, that was something.

01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:16.600
And now today, active directory can just simply be a service on Azure.

01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:17.600
Yes.

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:20.600
And you know, the LDAP integrations and that kind of stuff, and Linux has been a lot better.

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:23.280
So you've been playing with DHCP and dynamic updates?

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:27.480
Oh, just, there's a Windows component to our network, and just playing with the living

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.080
on Linux in that environment.

01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:33.880
You know, it was, I remember when Bind actually, I don't remember if it was Bind 9 or, I can't

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:37.880
remember when Bind got it, but I remember when dynamic DNS came to Bind.

01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:41.360
And I could deploy a Bind server again on my network and have it dynamically update

01:41:41.360 --> 01:41:43.740
the DNS on a Windows server.

01:41:43.740 --> 01:41:48.040
And I didn't expect, I don't remember exactly the nature of the improvement, but I didn't

01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:50.780
expect an improvement, a noticeable improvement.

01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:55.480
What I expected was essentially no change at all from my point of view or the end user's

01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:56.480
point of view.

01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:00.920
I didn't really think moving to Bind would, I swear to God, Wes, there was an actual performance

01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:04.440
improvement in DNS resolution across all of the users, because the way we worked is we

01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:08.840
had 110 terminal servers that I was responsible for sitting in one room.

01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:13.180
And so all of your users across 40 plus branches come into one room, and then they're hitting

01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:14.180
everything at once.

01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:18.000
When they log in across all, you know, you have 700 users that log in in one spot on

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.800
one LAN all at once.

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:20.800
It really hits it, right?

01:42:20.800 --> 01:42:21.800
Yeah, definitely.

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:24.500
Especially back in the day when, you know, things were, you know, crappy processors and

01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:27.840
stuff like that, and we didn't have SSDs and any of that kind of stuff.

01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:31.320
So if you're going to have any kind of disk I.O., it's a massive SCSI array, and it's

01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:32.800
a monster to manage.

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:37.720
And so when Bind came along, just that small, I mean, Bind was around way longer than Windows

01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:41.000
DNS, but when Bind dynamic updates came along that interrupted with Active Directory, when

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:46.800
that happened, you could actually witness, like you could sit there and see desktop logins

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:49.080
happen faster, name resolution happen faster.

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.080
That's amazing.

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.280
It was just like, wow, is everything better under Linux?

01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:53.280
Like everything?

01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:56.120
I was at DockerCon in Barcelona this week.

01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:57.120
Oh, really?

01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.120
Can you tell us more?

01:42:58.120 --> 01:42:59.120
Yeah, man.

01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:00.120
It was good.

01:43:00.120 --> 01:43:05.360
But the most surreal moment of the entire conference was listening to a Microsoft rep

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:11.920
giving a talk, stood there in a red hat hat about open source and how great Linux was

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:12.920
on Azure.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:13.920
Whoa.

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:14.920
That's weird.

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:17.360
I don't know how I feel about that.

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:19.200
What was the scene like at DockerCon?

01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:22.400
Does it feel like a lot of money was spent, or does it feel like a new startup thing that's

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.760
struggling to seem big, or did it feel like it's arrived?

01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:28.480
Like, what was your vibe you walked away from DockerCon?

01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:30.040
Such a great community.

01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:33.840
The DevOps community has such a nice energy around it.

01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:37.760
It was a big conference, about 2,000 people.

01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:40.600
And there was food everywhere you went.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:45.560
And there was free beer, which obviously is great in Spain.

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:49.560
And yeah, it was a really great experience.

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:51.400
Definitely recommend going if you can.

01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:57.520
And they've announced that the next DockerCon in June will be in your neck of the woods,

01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:58.520
Chris, in Seattle.

01:43:58.520 --> 01:43:59.520
No.

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:00.520
Oh, cool.

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:01.520
Wes, we should go.

01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:02.520
We should definitely go.

01:44:02.520 --> 01:44:03.520
Hmm.

01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:04.520
Well, you know what?

01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:05.520
I'm going to look into that.

01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:06.520
I'm going to.

01:44:06.520 --> 01:44:07.520
Hmm.

01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:08.520
That's interesting.

01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:10.920
I've been thinking about scale this year.

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:11.920
So I've been thinking about different conferences.

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:12.920
I think.

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:13.920
Just toying with it.

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:16.760
I think we're not going to do scale this year, which is ridiculous, because it's one of the

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:19.000
largest Linux conventions.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:25.440
But you know, Noah and I were talking about it on this trip to System76.

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:29.000
And we honestly, there's like a threshold where they start to get too big, and they

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000
get corporate.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.000
Right.

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:32.000
And.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.080
Yeah, then it's more like an industry convention rather than like a user.

01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.160
And scale's really walking that line.

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:39.360
I think Docker is going to head that way fast.

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:40.360
Yeah.

01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:41.360
Yeah, it feels like that.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:46.000
10 years ago, you were mad if you ran a VM in production, right?

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.000
Right.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.040
Now you're mad if you don't.

01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:50.040
Right.

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:54.920
I suspect that Docker will go that way much faster because people will note the trends

01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.920
faster.

01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:59.240
You know, we're going to talk about it, but the economies of scale that Docker offers

01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.240
is just.

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:04.600
I mean, it is like, it's impossible for your CTOs to ignore.

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:05.600
Right.

01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:06.600
It's just too attractive.

01:45:06.600 --> 01:45:07.600
You mean we don't have to buy new hardware?

01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:08.600
Right.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:09.600
Keep that CapEx down.

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.360
They showed a few cool demos, right?

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:19.440
One of them was they managed their Docker containers in Minecraft, so your kid might

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:20.440
like that, Chris.

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:21.440
No kidding.

01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.440
That's wild.

01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:23.440
Dylan.

01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:34.160
And another one they showed was a thousand node cluster on AWS deploying 50,000 containers

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:35.960
in 52 minutes.

01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:36.960
Whoa.

01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:37.960
50,000.

01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:39.960
Imagine the DDoS you could start up with, you know.

01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:40.960
No kidding.

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:45.040
And the only reason they stopped at a thousand nodes was because that's all that EC2 would

01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:46.040
let Docker have.

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:47.040
Oh, really?

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.040
That's great.

01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:51.200
That is, that must have been quite the demo.

01:45:51.200 --> 01:46:11.800
Yeah, it got Apple style applause.
