WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
Well, first and foremost, it is great to have you back, Wes.

00:03.080 --> 00:03.600
Thank you.

00:03.600 --> 00:05.160
It is awesome to be back.

00:05.160 --> 00:07.440
I missed the show while I was away.

00:07.440 --> 00:08.040
We missed you.

00:08.040 --> 00:10.320
And now you're like a well-traveled man.

00:10.320 --> 00:12.560
I can be like, oh, yeah, my buddy Wes,

00:12.560 --> 00:14.400
he goes to Bali for vacations.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.560
Hey, you know it.

00:15.560 --> 00:17.560
Yeah, you can increase your coolness factor.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.360
Just latch right on.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.600
You're always welcome.

00:19.600 --> 00:23.360
Now, in your wild world travels, Wes,

00:23.360 --> 00:27.480
have you ever seen anything as wild as a Commodore 64 running

00:27.480 --> 00:28.120
Slack?

00:28.120 --> 00:28.720
Oh, my.

00:28.720 --> 00:31.200
No, I have not.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.160
Brent found this and sent it to me during the week.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.700
And he's like, you've got to see this.

00:34.700 --> 00:38.520
This is Slack running on a Commodore 64.

00:38.520 --> 00:40.600
And you've got to think, how is that even possible?

00:40.600 --> 00:43.320
Well, a Raspberry Pi is involved with a little bit of Linux,

00:43.320 --> 00:44.760
of course.

00:44.760 --> 00:47.520
You see, the C64 has an extension port

00:47.520 --> 00:50.600
called the, quote, user port, which via an adapter

00:50.600 --> 00:53.960
can communicate over RS232 serial.

00:53.960 --> 01:00.360
So this guy connected that user port to an RS232 serial USB

01:00.360 --> 01:03.560
adapter connected to, well, a Raspberry Pi.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.840
But the part that I like is the cable description.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.560
This is the cable that he used.

01:07.560 --> 01:08.520
And I think it's great.

01:08.520 --> 01:12.440
It was an artisanal, locally sourced, homemade cable

01:12.440 --> 01:14.560
with a user port connector on one end

01:14.560 --> 01:18.760
and a USB TTL RS232 converter on the other.

01:18.760 --> 01:22.000
He says the fastest he got this thing to communicate,

01:22.000 --> 01:25.800
the fastest you could use Slack, was 1,200 baud,

01:25.800 --> 01:28.400
or 150 bytes per second.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.840
That should be enough for anyone.

01:30.840 --> 01:47.520
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 257 for July 10, 2018.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.120
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk

01:50.120 --> 01:55.240
show that, unbelievably, is already live again from Texas.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.040
My name is Chris.

01:56.040 --> 01:57.000
My name is Wes.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.840
Hello, Wes.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.820
Oh my gosh, it's good to have you back,

02:00.820 --> 02:03.400
you world-traveling suave man, you.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.280
Good to have you here.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.160
It's amazing.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.960
And I get back, and suddenly you're not here?

02:07.960 --> 02:09.160
What is going on?

02:09.160 --> 02:10.200
I know.

02:10.200 --> 02:14.120
We're just two podcasters passing in the night.

02:14.120 --> 02:16.600
As my plane is taking off, your plane is landing.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.280
It's been like that since my first Texas trip.

02:19.280 --> 02:20.660
Just kind of the way it worked out.

02:20.660 --> 02:23.280
But I'm glad, after all that, we're back together again.

02:23.280 --> 02:26.040
Someday we'll see each other again in the real world.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.920
But we have the magic of technology,

02:27.920 --> 02:29.080
so we're here anyway.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.040
One day.

02:30.040 --> 02:32.400
And that event may be barbecue that brings us together.

02:32.400 --> 02:35.160
But coming up on this week's episode of the Unplugged

02:35.160 --> 02:38.360
program, a great bunch of community news you can use,

02:38.360 --> 02:41.040
including a really popular open source app that's

02:41.040 --> 02:43.120
asking for your attention.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.520
We have a couple of Firefox fast takes

02:45.520 --> 02:47.080
that you probably need to know about.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.040
And then we'll get into the Ubuntu corner.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.160
A couple of new announcements coming out of the Ubuntu

02:51.160 --> 02:53.160
project, as well as some things around them.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.840
And then holy crap.

02:54.840 --> 02:55.920
Holy crap.

02:55.920 --> 02:59.320
Wine is so old, but like in an awesome way.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.320
Now it's also going to get cheaper car insurance.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.960
We'll tell you about some new milestones for wine

03:03.960 --> 03:07.240
and some big changes that are coming to the project.

03:07.240 --> 03:09.640
New architectures, et cetera.

03:09.640 --> 03:13.480
And then, later on in the show, we now

03:13.480 --> 03:17.280
have the results from the recent Gentoo hack.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.740
We know what happened.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.920
We know what went wrong.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.280
They've posted an entire postmortem.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.780
And it's in-depth.

03:23.780 --> 03:24.880
It's detailed.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.720
And I think it's educational.

03:26.720 --> 03:27.680
So we'll cover that.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.480
We'll describe what happened.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.440
And then maybe talk about the bigger picture

03:31.440 --> 03:35.360
about Linux distributions maintaining infrastructure.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.400
Now, I will admit I may have some sysadmin bias

03:38.400 --> 03:39.480
in this particular segment.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.120
But I'm really looking forward to hearing everyone's thoughts.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.960
Like our mumble room, let's bring them in.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.120
Time appropriate greetings, virtual lug.

03:46.120 --> 03:46.800
What's up?

03:46.800 --> 03:48.160
Hello.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.080
Hello.

03:49.080 --> 03:51.960
And you may have noticed in that,

03:51.960 --> 03:54.720
I don't know what you call that, those series of voices there,

03:54.720 --> 03:56.480
there is one Mr. Brent in there.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.520
Brent is joining us via the mumble room this week.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.360
Brent, so glad to have you here as well.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.760
Hey, it's great to be with both of you this week.

04:02.760 --> 04:03.560
Absolutely.

04:03.560 --> 04:06.280
Yeah, all of us need to get together in the studio.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.560
How fun would that be?

04:07.560 --> 04:11.000
The three of us in studio doing a show, eating some barbecue.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.240
I'm salivating already.

04:12.240 --> 04:12.920
Yeah.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.440
This needs to happen, doesn't it?

04:14.440 --> 04:15.600
Didn't that happen already?

04:15.600 --> 04:17.360
Wasn't that the first experience on the show for me?

04:17.360 --> 04:19.360
That's why we know it needs to happen again, Brent.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.120
We know it works.

04:20.120 --> 04:20.620
Obviously.

04:20.620 --> 04:23.600
Every single week it should happen, I think.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.560
That'd be great.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.400
Yeah, we'll just get this huge budget,

04:27.400 --> 04:30.200
and we'll just fly you out every single week for the show,

04:30.200 --> 04:33.080
like some sort of high end radio show or something.

04:33.080 --> 04:34.800
You know, I could stay for more than a week.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.520
There you go.

04:35.520 --> 04:38.000
Now you're thinking, yeah, we could just set you up

04:38.000 --> 04:39.240
a little room in the studio.

04:39.240 --> 04:40.840
I've got the space.

04:40.840 --> 04:44.020
Decent connection, decent Wi-Fi, all the things you need.

04:44.020 --> 04:46.320
I did sleep in the studio last time, if you remember.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.240
That's right.

04:47.240 --> 04:49.440
Yeah, that's how our barbecues go.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.800
And if you're lucky, a little Levi comes and snuggles

04:51.800 --> 04:54.240
with you.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.800
Man, I tell you what.

04:55.800 --> 04:58.240
That is the hardest part about traveling is that dog.

04:58.240 --> 05:00.520
I miss that dog already.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.480
All right, well, let's get into the community news

05:02.480 --> 05:03.560
that you can use.

05:03.560 --> 05:07.280
Let's start with KDN Live's significant refactoring

05:07.280 --> 05:10.000
that they're doing that they're asking for testing.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.360
I feel like this is a really big deal because this,

05:12.360 --> 05:16.080
at least in my view, is open source's most

05:16.080 --> 05:19.000
potential Final Cut killer.

05:19.000 --> 05:19.920
Let's put it that way.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.760
It's really coming along.

05:21.760 --> 05:24.120
And they've added a couple of new features

05:24.120 --> 05:27.320
that I think are really handy, including

05:27.320 --> 05:30.320
proper slow motion video support, massive improvements

05:30.320 --> 05:33.280
to their timeline, the ability to automatically separate

05:33.280 --> 05:35.720
clips that have both video and audio tracks, which

05:35.720 --> 05:41.320
is very handy when you're trying to remove what we have is

05:41.320 --> 05:43.560
what we call is scratch audio on the camera.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.040
So you record scratch audio on the camera, and then you

05:46.040 --> 05:50.040
record the actual source audio using a professional microphone

05:50.040 --> 05:51.720
going into a professional recorder.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.600
And it's really handy to be able to just drop

05:53.600 --> 05:55.200
the audio from the video, separate it out,

05:55.200 --> 05:56.680
and then get rid of your scratch audio.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.200
So that's coming in there now.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.400
Support for generating lower resolution video

06:00.400 --> 06:02.200
in the timeline preview, which means

06:02.200 --> 06:04.240
it makes it easier to work with something like 4K

06:04.240 --> 06:08.600
video on a machine that maybe can't render 4K in real time.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.280
They're changing the layout of the keyboard.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.880
Yeah, and it's a lot of stuff.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.560
And just a bunch of other enhancements.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.920
So it's available now as an app image

06:15.920 --> 06:17.200
if you want to help them test it.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.000
And they're trying to get the word out there.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.720
They've been contacting a few media outlets

06:21.720 --> 06:22.920
and saying, hey, can you spread the word

06:22.920 --> 06:23.960
that we need people to test this?

06:23.960 --> 06:25.560
We really need people to test this.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.720
Time to bring back the video version of Last Then,

06:27.720 --> 06:28.200
isn't it?

06:28.200 --> 06:30.600
Just kidding.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.440
You know what's funny is when I saw this story,

06:32.440 --> 06:33.560
I'm like, oh, that's so nice.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.880
I'm glad that this is really improving.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.920
And there was a version of me that

06:37.920 --> 06:41.120
would have been almost hyperventilating with excitement.

06:41.120 --> 06:45.040
But since we've spun down some of the video stuff,

06:45.040 --> 06:47.360
I've really taken a break from video editing.

06:47.360 --> 06:48.920
It's been easier on my body.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.240
My RSI issues have started to clear up a little bit.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.440
And it's just.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.040
You've been less depressed, happier,

06:54.040 --> 06:56.600
and maybe if you're lucky, by the time

06:56.600 --> 06:58.600
you come back around and are doing video again,

06:58.600 --> 06:59.920
Linux will be the best of the lot.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.280
I would be amazing because it sure is for audio production.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.640
I tell you what, it really is.

07:03.640 --> 07:06.240
And that's the thing about where I'm at with audio production

07:06.240 --> 07:09.040
is I enjoy it.

07:09.040 --> 07:09.840
I like it.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.360
I feel good about it on Linux.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.200
I want to do it on Linux.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.880
I don't have to force myself to do the audio production

07:15.880 --> 07:16.560
stuff on Linux.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.400
I want to do it on Linux because it's, in my opinion, the best.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.160
It's just actually a good tool set.

07:21.160 --> 07:22.040
Yes.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.200
And so that's where I would love to see video get to.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.760
And part of what's really helped me switch my workflow over

07:27.760 --> 07:29.720
is also at the same time switching my workflow

07:29.720 --> 07:32.160
on the desktop over to the Plasma desktop.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.400
And so I've been following the desktop's developments

07:34.400 --> 07:35.520
pretty closely.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.920
And there's some new features that

07:36.920 --> 07:39.200
are coming to future versions of Dolphin

07:39.200 --> 07:40.960
that I think are really slick, especially

07:40.960 --> 07:42.640
if you're a Telegram user.

07:42.640 --> 07:46.920
And it's built around this new framework called Purpose.

07:46.920 --> 07:50.040
And it's got its own dedicated blog post.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.440
I'll try to put a link in the show notes

07:51.440 --> 07:53.120
if you guys want to know more about it.

07:53.120 --> 07:56.440
But the idea is it's an extensible framework

07:56.440 --> 07:58.840
to fulfill the developer's purpose

07:58.840 --> 08:00.920
while providing abstraction.

08:00.920 --> 08:01.800
Yeah, I know.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.560
Right now, they really don't have much going on other

08:04.560 --> 08:08.480
than this new Share menu that's coming to Dolphin.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.520
And if you've been following the weekly usability posts,

08:12.520 --> 08:15.640
there has been some talk about this new Share menu.

08:15.640 --> 08:17.760
When you right click on a file, it

08:17.760 --> 08:20.440
does a lot like you would expect to do, say, on a mobile device.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.920
You can share it to KDE Connect.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.840
You could share it to a Bluetooth device.

08:24.840 --> 08:26.640
And they're collapsing some of the stuff that's

08:26.640 --> 08:28.600
in the menu into this new Share menu.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.680
But you could also do things like Telegram

08:30.680 --> 08:32.800
because the system will detect what applications you

08:32.800 --> 08:36.800
have installed, or like Nextcloud, another example,

08:36.800 --> 08:38.600
or maybe Imgur or Twitter.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.600
There's a lot of extensions you could put in there.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.200
And then you can right click on a file.

08:42.200 --> 08:44.240
There'll be a built-in Share menu, built-in Plasma.

08:44.240 --> 08:47.360
Anything that uses that framework can get access to it.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.520
So soon, on your Linux desktop, if you're

08:49.520 --> 08:51.360
using the Plasma desktop, you could right

08:51.360 --> 08:53.320
click on the document, select Telegram,

08:53.320 --> 08:54.880
then choose the contact, just like you

08:54.880 --> 08:56.400
do on your mobile device.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.360
And right now, it's in development.

08:58.360 --> 09:00.200
And they just put up a blog post answering

09:00.200 --> 09:01.800
some of the questions about, like, what

09:01.800 --> 09:03.480
about adding more clutter?

09:03.480 --> 09:06.840
Or what about accidentally sharing a file and all

09:06.840 --> 09:07.840
of that kind of stuff?

09:07.840 --> 09:09.840
He has answered all of those questions.

09:09.840 --> 09:14.080
And it's worth calling out, if nothing other than to talk

09:14.080 --> 09:17.560
about the rapid improvement that we're

09:17.560 --> 09:20.040
seeing on the Plasma desktop, even though there's recently

09:20.040 --> 09:22.200
been some complaints about communication

09:22.200 --> 09:24.440
between developers and the visual design group.

09:24.440 --> 09:29.120
Actual Plasma itself is progressing extremely fast.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.960
And we've really now entered a flip-flop situation

09:31.960 --> 09:38.200
where, generally, GNOME is considered the slower, heavier,

09:38.200 --> 09:42.000
more less stable, I'll put it nicely, desktop.

09:42.000 --> 09:46.120
And Plasma has become the fast, lean, efficient desktop

09:46.120 --> 09:49.120
that has all these new things coming to it.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.480
I feel like they've flip-flopped in a bit.

09:51.480 --> 09:54.760
And you really see that the Plasma desktop is moving

09:54.760 --> 09:57.400
forward fast with some of these new features.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.880
The Share menu is great.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.040
And I recommend reading the link in the show notes

10:01.040 --> 10:02.680
if you're curious about the implementation.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.920
It's one of these small things that really, I think,

10:05.920 --> 10:09.880
draws a contrast between Plasma and Gnome Shell.

10:09.880 --> 10:13.800
Files over the years has gotten simpler.

10:13.800 --> 10:17.680
For better or for worse, it's gotten simpler and simpler.

10:17.680 --> 10:21.800
Whereas Dolphin has managed to get simpler by default

10:21.800 --> 10:24.040
but more powerful when you need it.

10:24.040 --> 10:28.440
And that is the balance that I find myself to prefer.

10:28.440 --> 10:32.760
They do seem to sometimes err on the side of features,

10:32.760 --> 10:36.680
but they get back to that usability balance over time.

10:36.680 --> 10:39.480
I love this kind of stuff and this kind of communication.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.360
That's part of it, Wes, like this clear communication

10:42.360 --> 10:44.360
about this is why the project is doing this,

10:44.360 --> 10:47.200
this is how it's going to work, it's coming down the road,

10:47.200 --> 10:48.040
prepare yourself.

10:48.040 --> 10:49.120
I love that kind of stuff.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.120
I think that's huge.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.240
And it really seems like Plasma team

10:52.240 --> 10:54.760
has done a lot of slower efforts over the years

10:54.760 --> 10:57.840
that we're now seeing with solid foundations laid

10:57.840 --> 11:01.600
with some clear purpose, if I can say that.

11:01.600 --> 11:03.760
They can iterate fast, they can change things,

11:03.760 --> 11:05.440
and as long as they communicate clearly,

11:05.440 --> 11:06.520
we're not left in the dark.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.120
So we don't have to speculate, oh,

11:08.120 --> 11:09.840
which feature is going to disappear next?

11:09.840 --> 11:11.520
What horrible thing are they going to add?

11:11.520 --> 11:12.240
They've thought about it.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.600
It's clear that they're thinking about a wide range of users.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.480
So you and I might love all these features.

11:17.480 --> 11:19.520
But as you say, there's tons of ways

11:19.520 --> 11:21.000
to disable it if you're never going to use it.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.720
And it doesn't add a whole bunch of clutter for everyone.

11:23.720 --> 11:24.920
Yeah, it's interesting that they're

11:24.920 --> 11:26.280
including the option to disable it.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.440
Like, oh, you don't ever just want this at all to show up?

11:28.440 --> 11:29.760
All right, you can just turn it off.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.720
Instead of just, no, it's baked in now.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.440
You can just use it.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.440
I do think I have gotten really used to doing that on Android,

11:36.440 --> 11:38.240
you know, just be able to send it right to an app

11:38.240 --> 11:40.200
and have that all work after I've installed it.

11:40.200 --> 11:44.040
So I will be using this in Telegram probably from day one.

11:44.040 --> 11:47.040
Yeah, Telegram, Slack, Imgur too.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.800
I mean, how handy would it be to quick screenshot,

11:49.800 --> 11:52.040
right click, upload to Imgur, although you can actually

11:52.040 --> 11:54.040
do it within Plasma's screenshot tool.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.040
But the whole point, right, is that maybe you

11:56.040 --> 11:57.600
started a new image hosting platform.

11:57.600 --> 12:01.880
You're not as popular as Imgur, and this can work for you too.

12:01.880 --> 12:03.840
Yeah, that is very nice.

12:03.840 --> 12:05.560
So let's talk about the AUR for a moment.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.960
We've recently had stories about a crypto miner

12:08.960 --> 12:10.720
that made it into the Snap store.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.520
We also talked about some crypto miners

12:12.520 --> 12:15.320
that made it onto Docker Hub for quite a while.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.080
It was really pretty embarrassing.

12:17.080 --> 12:21.160
And now, almost as if we could just check them off a list,

12:21.160 --> 12:25.360
we now have a story about the Arch Linux AUR repository

12:25.360 --> 12:26.920
containing malware.

12:26.920 --> 12:27.600
Don't panic.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.760
It's already been resolved, and it's already been cleaned up.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.760
But it is interesting.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.560
It seems to be a trend we see.

12:34.560 --> 12:36.800
Now, the thing about the Arch user repository

12:36.800 --> 12:39.640
is from the very beginning, they warn you

12:39.640 --> 12:41.680
that it is user-submitted software,

12:41.680 --> 12:43.760
that you should double check all of it.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.560
And when you follow the Arch guide,

12:45.560 --> 12:47.560
like the first time you're getting started with Arch,

12:47.560 --> 12:51.120
they have you build things from the AUR by hand.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.880
So that way, you learn how the package build files work.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.320
You can see what URLs it's calling, things like that.

12:56.320 --> 13:00.760
So in Arch's defense, they do warn the user

13:00.760 --> 13:01.960
as much as possible.

13:01.960 --> 13:04.440
But I'm surprised this almost hasn't happened before.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.240
There's been a full investigation now

13:06.240 --> 13:08.840
that shows that a malicious user with the nickname Xactor

13:08.840 --> 13:13.120
modified, on June 7, an orphan package that

13:13.120 --> 13:15.400
didn't have an active maintainer, something called

13:15.400 --> 13:19.920
AcroRead, hmm, Acrobat, I don't know, never heard of it.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.600
The changes included a curl script

13:21.600 --> 13:24.400
that downloads and runs a script from a remote site.

13:24.400 --> 13:25.920
It then installs persistent software

13:25.920 --> 13:29.840
and configures systemd to start it up from time to time.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.760
I love it when systemd is involved.

13:32.760 --> 13:36.760
Now, there was two packages total that were modified.

13:36.760 --> 13:41.200
They were both modified by the same person.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.920
And the investigation reveals that the executed scripts were

13:44.920 --> 13:49.120
just doing data harvesting about your machine, your machine ID,

13:49.120 --> 13:54.240
the output of uname a, the CPU information, the PacMan

13:54.240 --> 13:58.680
output of information, and the output of systemctl list units.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.160
The harvested information was then

14:00.160 --> 14:03.160
transferred to a pastebin document.

14:03.160 --> 14:05.520
And the AUR team discovered that the scripts contained

14:05.520 --> 14:08.200
a private API key, which shows this was probably

14:08.200 --> 14:11.800
done by an inexperienced hacker, because you can track that down

14:11.800 --> 14:13.200
to somebody.

14:13.200 --> 14:16.200
But the purpose of gathering that system information

14:16.200 --> 14:18.080
remains unknown.

14:18.080 --> 14:21.880
Just doing like a system scan, you know?

14:21.880 --> 14:23.000
Isn't that funny?

14:23.000 --> 14:26.040
And using systemd, too, to make sure it starts.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.080
I really do kind of wonder what, well, I mean,

14:28.080 --> 14:30.000
systemd is just so reliable, Chris.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.640
That's a natural choice.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.760
It does definitely seem like sort of inexperienced

14:33.760 --> 14:35.640
in that if you wanted to do damage,

14:35.640 --> 14:36.960
you could do a lot more damage.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.840
You could also probably get more sensitive information

14:38.840 --> 14:40.280
if that's also what you wanted.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.040
So it is kind of peculiar.

14:43.040 --> 14:47.040
And you're also right that we all use helpers, or at least

14:47.040 --> 14:49.560
most of us, but to the AUR's credit,

14:49.560 --> 14:51.600
package builds are actually pretty simple.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.720
And so if you do have the time, especially if you don't use

14:53.720 --> 14:57.080
that much AUR software, it's pretty reasonable to go look

14:57.080 --> 14:58.520
at least before installing something.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.640
Just go scan the package build.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.000
It's pretty easy to see, does this

15:01.000 --> 15:02.160
point to the real Git sources?

15:02.160 --> 15:04.360
Does this point to an HTTPS website hosted

15:04.360 --> 15:06.960
by the organization that maintains this project?

15:06.960 --> 15:08.200
That will help a lot.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.920
Yeah, especially for the system you're putting in production.

15:10.920 --> 15:15.360
I think there's a definite room for improvement around GPG key

15:15.360 --> 15:16.560
handling, though.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.960
So I can't remember what the package was,

15:18.960 --> 15:21.560
but sometimes you see these pinned comments

15:21.560 --> 15:25.040
at the top of the AUR that say, oh, just copy paste this key

15:25.040 --> 15:28.040
into your key ring, and it will be fine.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.360
Yeah.

15:29.360 --> 15:29.960
Yeah.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.120
That's a great point, Alex.

15:31.120 --> 15:34.320
There is some room for improvement there, isn't there?

15:34.320 --> 15:37.560
It was caught pretty quickly, it seems, and taken care of,

15:37.560 --> 15:39.520
and a full investigation was done.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.680
So on the other end of this, it's pretty well handled.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.040
What are your thoughts on it, Brent?

15:44.040 --> 15:48.040
Well, I have to say I'm a relatively new AUR user,

15:48.040 --> 15:51.120
so it's amazing.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.720
I call myself relatively new, but there's

15:52.720 --> 15:55.840
a surprising number of packages I'm pulling from there.

15:55.840 --> 15:59.680
But I was taught very early on in the process

15:59.680 --> 16:01.480
from some forums and things like that,

16:01.480 --> 16:04.960
that actually you should really look at the package builds.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.560
And they're super simple, I've been looking at them.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.280
And I did catch actually something

16:10.280 --> 16:13.960
last week that was a little bit curious to me,

16:13.960 --> 16:17.240
and so it just allows you to do a little bit of extra homework.

16:17.240 --> 16:21.520
And in this case, it was my lack of maybe technical knowledge,

16:21.520 --> 16:24.320
and it allowed me to learn a little bit more

16:24.320 --> 16:26.040
about how it all worked.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.840
But I really think that's essential for everyone

16:28.840 --> 16:31.400
to be extra cautious, let's put it.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.960
Yeah, really, the rule of thumb is

16:33.960 --> 16:36.760
if it's user-submitted software, well, really, hell.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.560
I mean, even the stuff that's, quote unquote,

16:38.560 --> 16:42.480
curated by Fortune 500 companies or whatever they are,

16:42.480 --> 16:45.200
it still has crap in it, so it's tricky.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.120
But definitely more caution is needed

16:47.120 --> 16:51.400
when it's a user-curated or user-submitted, quote unquote,

16:51.400 --> 16:52.200
app store.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.520
Yeah, it's a good reminder.

16:53.520 --> 16:54.120
Yeah.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.680
All right, let's do a couple of Firefox fast takes,

16:56.680 --> 16:58.600
just a couple of little things to know about.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.520
Firefox for Android is entering a maintenance phase

17:01.520 --> 17:03.800
as the team is preparing to completely replace it.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.600
So if you're a user of Firefox and Android,

17:05.600 --> 17:07.840
which I have been for a little bit,

17:07.840 --> 17:09.240
it's entered a maintenance phase,

17:09.240 --> 17:10.480
meaning that they're not going to give

17:10.480 --> 17:14.240
any updates for the foreseeable future except for major bug

17:14.240 --> 17:16.240
fixes and security updates will still come down.

17:16.240 --> 17:20.680
That's according to Emily Kager, the mobile engineer at Mozilla.

17:20.680 --> 17:22.280
It sounds like Mozilla is working

17:22.280 --> 17:25.280
on an entirely new browser based on open source

17:25.280 --> 17:27.360
components in Android.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.720
And Android components, quote, is the actual name of it,

17:29.720 --> 17:31.880
is a collection of Android libraries

17:31.880 --> 17:35.200
that can be used to build browsers or browser-like

17:35.200 --> 17:36.240
applications.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.120
Something tells me they're probably not going

17:38.120 --> 17:40.680
to be using Gecko, though, they'll probably

17:40.680 --> 17:45.320
be using the Chromium backend stuff in WebKit.

17:45.320 --> 17:46.800
What do you think, Wes?

17:46.800 --> 17:48.800
Is that a bit of a loss to have another?

17:48.800 --> 17:49.680
I mean, this has kind of been the way

17:49.680 --> 17:51.600
it's been going for Firefox and mobile for a long time,

17:51.600 --> 17:53.040
though, so I suppose not.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.840
I suppose it's not really much of a loss.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.800
I mean, in a historical sense, it might be.

17:57.800 --> 17:58.680
I get that.

17:58.680 --> 18:00.840
I mean, Gecko's been rendering my things

18:00.840 --> 18:04.640
for so long now on a number of platforms.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.720
But it does seem like this is also maybe a sign of them

18:07.720 --> 18:11.400
taking Android as more of a primary platform.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.880
I think so many people use Chrome or other browsers there.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.480
I, too, have been using Firefox and Android,

18:15.480 --> 18:16.420
and honestly, I really like it.

18:16.420 --> 18:18.680
It's one of my favorite mobile browsers,

18:18.680 --> 18:20.280
and if they can make something even better,

18:20.280 --> 18:24.000
even more tightly integrated and focused on that platform,

18:24.000 --> 18:25.080
I'm excited to see it.

18:25.080 --> 18:26.240
Yeah, you know, I started using it

18:26.240 --> 18:31.000
to sync bookmarks and passwords, but for iOS users,

18:31.000 --> 18:33.680
there seems to be another solution.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.200
And I think they just launched this.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.080
You found this, Wes.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.840
It's the Firefox Lockbox.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.760
And this is the password management component

18:41.760 --> 18:45.760
of Firefox broken out as a standalone mobile application.

18:45.760 --> 18:49.360
The idea, I would assume, the use case idea

18:49.360 --> 18:52.760
is you have all of your websites and passwords saved

18:52.760 --> 18:54.360
on Firefox on your desktop.

18:54.360 --> 18:56.080
And then you go to your mobile device,

18:56.080 --> 18:57.960
and you don't have access to any of them.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.880
So Lockbox gives you access to those passwords.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.240
It uses their back-end sync.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.680
It's 256-bit encrypted, it says.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.740
And you sync down your usernames and passwords

19:07.740 --> 19:09.480
using this Lockbox app.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.800
And I was talking with Wes about this,

19:11.800 --> 19:14.120
and I was like, Wes, what do you think the use case is

19:14.120 --> 19:16.320
for this, which is when you point out for people

19:16.320 --> 19:17.920
using it on their desktop.

19:17.920 --> 19:21.600
And I remembered that Noah used to do this.

19:21.600 --> 19:24.160
I don't know if you recall, but he used to use Firefox

19:24.160 --> 19:26.920
as his primary password manager for a long time.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.620
Yeah, he was looking at us kind of funny.

19:28.620 --> 19:29.840
He was like, what are you guys doing?

19:29.840 --> 19:31.200
My browser has all my passwords.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.760
It's already right there.

19:32.760 --> 19:36.980
I think he was sort of eventually had

19:36.980 --> 19:39.080
to replace it with a Homeworld solution,

19:39.080 --> 19:40.960
just in part because mobile.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.120
So Lockbox is only for iOS today,

19:43.120 --> 19:44.640
and they just launched it today.

19:44.640 --> 19:46.880
They may be rolling out an Android version soon.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.340
But it's kind of interesting to see where all this is going.

19:49.340 --> 19:51.560
And then one last Firefox fact for you.

19:51.560 --> 19:52.920
A little fast take here.

19:52.920 --> 19:57.360
There is a big update for you Ubuntu users running Firefox.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.120
Firefox 61 is now available today,

20:00.120 --> 20:02.100
as we're recording, in the repo.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.800
Now, that's a nice update.

20:03.800 --> 20:07.440
And it's even available for you LTS users, I believe.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.480
So go out there and get your upgraded Firefox.

20:09.480 --> 20:14.480
So you'll get Firefox 61, which includes several new features.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.440
And it's nice to see that the LTS is

20:17.440 --> 20:19.820
getting the latest versions.

20:19.820 --> 20:22.320
It is actually really nice, because the latest versions

20:22.320 --> 20:23.160
are great.

20:23.160 --> 20:25.660
Now, if you do want to stay a little more up to date,

20:25.660 --> 20:28.000
I will say just downloading the tarball of Firefox

20:28.000 --> 20:29.460
and sticking it somewhere in your home

20:29.460 --> 20:32.480
here and adding that to your path also works very nicely.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.960
Yeah, that is a good way to do it, isn't it?

20:33.960 --> 20:35.840
Yeah, that's what I do on most of my platforms.

20:35.840 --> 20:37.240
And no failures yet.

20:37.240 --> 20:40.760
I kind of stopped getting all worried about the version

20:40.760 --> 20:42.800
after Quantum shipped.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.260
Then I kind of was like, OK, well,

20:44.260 --> 20:46.080
I got the major version once I got to 60.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.040
But it'd be nice to get to 61.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.160
It's good to see.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.960
All right, well, if that's the Firefox fast takes,

20:51.960 --> 20:53.080
is what I was calling them.

20:53.080 --> 20:53.600
You like that?

20:53.600 --> 20:54.480
Fast takes, Firefox fast takes.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.480
It's so fast now, right?

20:55.480 --> 20:56.680
Quantum fast.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.000
Yeah, exactly.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
You got it.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.120
Let's do the Ubuntu corner.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.520
Speaking of Ubuntu, they launched this week

21:02.520 --> 21:05.720
the minimal Ubuntu, which is not the same thing

21:05.720 --> 21:10.560
as the minimal install or the server install.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.680
It's minimal Ubuntu.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.640
I don't understand why you're confused on what

21:13.640 --> 21:15.040
the problem is.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.440
But the idea is pretty slick.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.020
It's a small footprint of Ubuntu that's

21:20.020 --> 21:22.480
meant for fast virtual machine provisioning.

21:22.480 --> 21:25.880
So imagine an AWS infrastructure that

21:25.880 --> 21:29.120
has to spin up 1,000 instances at once.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.640
You think I'm exaggerating.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.120
I'm not.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.220
They really, really care about the spin up time.

21:35.220 --> 21:38.000
I heard this from an AWS engineer directly.

21:38.000 --> 21:41.520
They are constantly pushing back on Canonical and Red Hat

21:41.520 --> 21:43.400
to shave down the boot time.

21:43.400 --> 21:47.680
Because you multiply that by 1,000 in some cases.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.840
And so if you can shave down the boot time

21:49.840 --> 21:52.680
and shave down the image size, it really matters.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.840
It might not matter for us on our laptops,

21:54.840 --> 21:57.800
but it really matters for really large cloud deployments.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.360
And that's exactly what these are for.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.600
This is really Ubuntu designed to be

22:03.600 --> 22:06.120
deployed by machines, not humans.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.880
So think of it in that context.

22:07.880 --> 22:08.600
Yeah, exactly.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.280
I'm really excited for this.

22:10.280 --> 22:13.800
Just because for many cases, Ubuntu server is great,

22:13.800 --> 22:17.380
but it's still kind of stuck in the era of bare metal servers.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.220
I remember the argument when system B came out

22:19.220 --> 22:20.680
and everyone was like, well, why do we

22:20.680 --> 22:22.080
need servers to start fast?

22:22.080 --> 22:24.240
You start it once and you reboot it, maybe never.

22:24.240 --> 22:27.560
But in the days of clouds and functions

22:27.560 --> 22:29.900
as a service and all the different sorts of containerized

22:29.900 --> 22:31.940
options we have today, you're starting stopping

22:31.940 --> 22:33.400
immutable deployments.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.160
Everything moves very quickly.

22:35.160 --> 22:38.480
And if you can get this down in an image everywhere,

22:38.480 --> 22:39.520
it really scales.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.400
Plus, I don't know about you, but when I'm making images

22:42.400 --> 22:44.960
for other people to use, I want to customize that.

22:44.960 --> 22:47.600
And I want to start with as lean a base as possible.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.120
I don't have to go in and remove or disable services

22:50.120 --> 22:52.280
that I don't need or no one knows what they do.

22:52.280 --> 22:54.600
This just starts as a super lean core,

22:54.600 --> 22:56.800
add on everything you want, do some customization,

22:56.800 --> 22:59.080
make a new AMI, and you're good to go.

22:59.080 --> 23:01.680
Yeah, especially in the context of quote, unquote,

23:01.680 --> 23:02.720
serverless computing.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.520
Serverless computing, it just means

23:04.520 --> 23:06.400
they're taking care of the server.

23:06.400 --> 23:09.180
They're standing up an entire Linux instance

23:09.180 --> 23:11.260
and then tearing it down once the processing's done.

23:11.260 --> 23:12.340
They need that to be fast.

23:12.340 --> 23:14.760
But Brent, you're pointing out there's

23:14.760 --> 23:17.120
other aspects besides the speed of the boot

23:17.120 --> 23:18.600
when you minimize like this.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.680
There's other advantages.

23:19.680 --> 23:22.920
Yeah, I had, I guess, kind of a little bit of a question.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.240
There's a section there that says minimal security

23:25.240 --> 23:27.960
cross-section comes with this minimal Ubuntu.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.920
And I just wondered if anybody from the community

23:29.920 --> 23:32.960
or maybe Wes has any thoughts on that.

23:32.960 --> 23:35.440
Yeah, well, less attack surface means

23:35.440 --> 23:39.960
it's by default less likely to get exploited.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.340
Now, it's still something you attach to the network, right?

23:42.340 --> 23:44.240
It's still running a full Linux stack.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.080
I mean, it is Ubuntu.

23:45.080 --> 23:47.120
You can install any package you want on it.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.640
I think that's it right there.

23:48.640 --> 23:51.800
It's not some magic layer of security.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.980
It's just that when you install the default Ubuntu server,

23:54.980 --> 23:57.120
there are a lot of things which are super handy

23:57.120 --> 23:58.480
and make it really easy for users

23:58.480 --> 24:01.120
to get started with that are just enabled by default, right?

24:01.120 --> 24:04.040
So the Snap service is running.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.320
LXD might be running.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.720
But if you don't use those things, you don't need it.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.680
And unfortunately, not everyone, even some sysadmins,

24:10.680 --> 24:12.760
know enough to go how to go prune that,

24:12.760 --> 24:15.300
how to disable the services, how to check for those things.

24:15.300 --> 24:18.160
So if you can just start from a really clean minimal base,

24:18.160 --> 24:19.200
it's better for everyone.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.800
There's some real numbers here, too.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.480
They say that the images are less than 50%

24:23.480 --> 24:26.360
of the size of a standard Ubuntu server image.

24:26.360 --> 24:30.160
And they boot up to 40% faster than standard Ubuntu.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.800
But that doesn't mean they're necessarily the fastest.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.040
Does it, 10-bit?

24:34.040 --> 24:35.680
No, I was checking for Onyx.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.400
And Michael did some tests.

24:38.400 --> 24:42.160
And Clear Linux was the big winner.

24:42.160 --> 24:43.640
Minimal Ubuntu is definitely better.

24:43.640 --> 24:46.200
But Clear Linux was still four times.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.800
That's a great point.

24:47.800 --> 24:48.840
There's still other.

24:48.840 --> 24:50.640
Many people are still going to run Docker containers

24:50.640 --> 24:51.440
with Alpine.

24:51.440 --> 24:54.560
Or if you have particular needs, there are a lot.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.040
What I think Ubuntu makes a special impact here

24:57.040 --> 25:00.240
is that you still get all of the comfort of using Ubuntu

25:00.240 --> 25:01.680
like you do on any other platform.

25:01.680 --> 25:02.720
All the things are there.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.680
You can still install devs that you need to.

25:04.680 --> 25:05.600
It'll just work.

25:05.600 --> 25:06.880
Whatever happened to unikennels?

25:06.880 --> 25:07.680
Do you remember them?

25:07.680 --> 25:08.880
Yeah, that's a good question.

25:08.880 --> 25:09.840
I haven't heard as.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.120
I mean, they're interesting.

25:11.120 --> 25:12.520
I haven't heard very much.

25:12.520 --> 25:14.760
There's been less buzz these past two years.

25:14.760 --> 25:18.040
I don't know if that's just because serverless and Lambda,

25:18.040 --> 25:19.680
et cetera, have taken over that space.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.200
Or maybe it's just incubating in the background.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.560
Now, Badger, weren't you thinking

25:23.560 --> 25:26.920
that maybe Atomic from Fedora makes this a bit less relevant?

25:26.920 --> 25:31.200
Yeah, I think so startup time is one thing.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.280
And I guess I hadn't really thought about the scale

25:33.280 --> 25:36.200
Amazon run at.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.440
I go around to a lot of different customer sites.

25:38.440 --> 25:43.560
And I see people with 400, 500 EC2 instances in just

25:43.560 --> 25:45.000
their test environment alone.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.240
It's pretty crazy.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.600
And you multiply that across all the different companies

25:48.600 --> 25:49.320
across the world.

25:49.320 --> 25:54.080
The scale that Amazon are running at is mind boggling.

25:54.080 --> 25:59.760
But then for me, I think if you look at an Atomic OS

25:59.760 --> 26:01.440
has a read-only file system.

26:01.440 --> 26:04.440
And so there's a lot less tinkering

26:04.440 --> 26:05.520
needs to actually occur.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.600
So you can almost basically boot from a known state.

26:08.600 --> 26:12.520
And it's kind of like how Apple deal with hardware.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.480
So they know exactly what's under the hood.

26:14.480 --> 26:16.480
So they don't have to do a whole bunch of checks

26:16.480 --> 26:18.240
like a PC BIOS would or something.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.120
So it's that similar sort of principle.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.400
Yeah, yeah, just if you don't have

26:23.400 --> 26:25.320
to worry about the drive changing at all,

26:25.320 --> 26:27.760
you could launch as fast as you can

26:27.760 --> 26:29.720
initialize the hardware support you can launch.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.520
That's right, yeah.

26:31.520 --> 26:33.280
Yeah, that is a good point.

26:33.280 --> 26:37.400
I feel like the broader context for this, too, is containers.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.440
Because this isn't just for spinning up VMs.

26:39.440 --> 26:42.440
It's also for spinning up an Ubuntu inside it

26:42.440 --> 26:45.720
a container so you can start with something minimal

26:45.720 --> 26:48.720
and build your container environment around it, I think.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.120
There's other solutions for that,

26:50.120 --> 26:52.120
but I feel like this would be a pretty good one.

26:52.120 --> 26:55.200
And because it's just an app getaway,

26:55.200 --> 26:56.880
you can get anything else loaded in there that you need,

26:56.880 --> 26:58.240
which is really convenient.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.040
Yeah, I think you hit it on the head right there, right?

27:00.040 --> 27:01.760
Like that you don't, it may not be the best

27:01.760 --> 27:04.480
if you have particular needs, then maybe look elsewhere.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.160
But if you were just already using Ubuntu,

27:06.160 --> 27:08.000
it got a little bit better today.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.200
Yeah.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.640
Now they just got to work on the branding

27:10.640 --> 27:13.560
because there's too many minimals at this point.

27:13.560 --> 27:16.400
And you know, it's tough when you have an OS that

27:16.400 --> 27:20.640
runs on IoT devices, it runs on cloud devices,

27:20.640 --> 27:24.520
it runs on laptops and desktops, and now apparently

27:24.520 --> 27:27.080
on floating AIs that will go up into space.

27:27.080 --> 27:31.520
Ubuntu is also running on an astronaut AI.

27:31.520 --> 27:36.160
It's called Simon, C-I-M-O-N, and Joey has a great write up

27:36.160 --> 27:38.360
over at OMG Ubuntu all about it.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.040
And it's one of six experiments.

27:40.040 --> 27:43.280
It was recently launched to the International Space Station

27:43.280 --> 27:45.720
as part of the ESA's International Space Station

27:45.720 --> 27:48.640
program, the Horizon Mission.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.400
It's not science fiction though.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.920
It is an autonomous AI powered assistant

27:52.920 --> 27:57.000
that can see, hear, and understand and speak

27:57.000 --> 27:58.240
with the astronauts.

27:58.240 --> 27:59.760
And it's got a touch screen on it.

27:59.760 --> 28:02.200
When you minimize the Simon application,

28:02.200 --> 28:03.600
there is an Ubuntu desktop.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.280
It's just like right there.

28:05.280 --> 28:07.880
And you can open up files and browse the file system

28:07.880 --> 28:10.520
on this floating robot.

28:10.520 --> 28:11.880
And it's really cool.

28:11.880 --> 28:16.600
It's about the size of a beach ball with one side of it

28:16.600 --> 28:22.840
flat that has an LCD screen and a somewhat freaky face,

28:22.840 --> 28:24.080
I'll be honest.

28:24.080 --> 28:26.800
And I just love the concept of this.

28:26.800 --> 28:28.600
There's so many things they can use it for.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.680
As we go out deep into space, it's

28:30.680 --> 28:33.000
much easier to send robots than it is humans.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.580
But the other thing you have to consider

28:34.580 --> 28:37.320
is this isn't something that's going

28:37.320 --> 28:38.640
to turn on your smart lights.

28:38.640 --> 28:42.160
This can be very, very purpose built

28:42.160 --> 28:45.120
to know very, very deep knowledge

28:45.120 --> 28:47.920
about the particular experiments they're working on.

28:47.920 --> 28:51.000
It's not going to answer when Walmart down the road opens up.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.200
It's not going to know that.

28:52.200 --> 28:54.200
But if you need to know the molecular structure

28:54.200 --> 28:57.080
of this rock, it's going to know that in and out

28:57.080 --> 28:58.840
and be able to display that on the screen.

28:58.840 --> 29:01.880
If you think about how useful having a smart home with data

29:01.880 --> 29:03.800
about your house or about your car is,

29:03.800 --> 29:07.200
you take that to the next level here, wow.

29:07.200 --> 29:08.640
You're right about the face, though.

29:08.640 --> 29:09.840
The face is creepy.

29:09.840 --> 29:13.000
And I'm just imagining a Hal-style moment there.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.760
And the face, you know, the smile turns into a frown.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.520
And oh, Podbe Dois, whoops.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.240
Yeah.

29:19.240 --> 29:23.480
Yeah, uh-oh, yeah, it gets angry all of a sudden.

29:23.480 --> 29:25.560
All right, well, here is one of the scientists

29:25.560 --> 29:27.240
who's been working on it, explaining how

29:27.240 --> 29:28.760
this works better than I can.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.120
My name is Till Eisenberg.

29:30.120 --> 29:31.760
I'm from Friedrichshafen, the project manager

29:31.760 --> 29:32.880
of the project Simon.

29:32.880 --> 29:35.600
Simon weighs about five kilograms

29:35.600 --> 29:38.520
and has a diameter of 32 centimeters.

29:38.520 --> 29:43.080
He has a velocity of about one meter per second,

29:43.080 --> 29:44.840
which is rather slow.

29:44.840 --> 29:48.480
But it's quite comparable with the normal movement

29:48.480 --> 29:49.560
of a crew member.

29:49.560 --> 29:52.840
He's equipped with a display of eight inches, which

29:52.840 --> 29:55.440
was chosen because this gives the ability

29:55.440 --> 29:58.800
to display a complete face.

29:58.800 --> 30:02.440
Simon stands for Crew Interactive Mobile Companion.

30:02.440 --> 30:07.160
And it's meant to be a social interactive free-flying object

30:07.160 --> 30:10.920
who shall assist the crew during extensive tasks

30:10.920 --> 30:12.040
and to reduce stress.

30:12.040 --> 30:15.760
Simon will assist Alexander Guest during his next mission.

30:15.760 --> 30:18.960
He will assist him during two different tasks.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.720
So we will be able to provide him

30:20.720 --> 30:24.800
with the good advices during complex procedures,

30:24.800 --> 30:27.520
as well as assist him in social interaction

30:27.520 --> 30:31.960
or by social interaction, and will provide additional data

30:31.960 --> 30:34.560
to the science group, like video data,

30:34.560 --> 30:38.280
or during complex tasks to validate the exact process.

30:38.280 --> 30:40.000
They go on, too, to talk about how

30:40.000 --> 30:41.480
if they're working somewhere where

30:41.480 --> 30:43.600
they have decent connectivity, they're

30:43.600 --> 30:47.200
going to still use offloaded cloud processing to help

30:47.200 --> 30:48.880
with Simon's intelligence.

30:48.880 --> 30:51.640
And when they're somewhere where they don't have connectivity,

30:51.640 --> 30:54.680
which I guess there is connectivity in parts of space,

30:54.680 --> 30:57.520
but when they're somewhere where they don't have connectivity,

30:57.520 --> 30:59.160
it can work offline.

30:59.160 --> 31:01.920
The majority, though, right now, of the AI work

31:01.920 --> 31:05.680
is taking place on IBM's Watson Cloud Service.

31:05.680 --> 31:08.720
And the language comprehension is being done by that,

31:08.720 --> 31:10.960
although they're working on some local language processing,

31:10.960 --> 31:12.240
but they don't talk about what technology

31:12.240 --> 31:13.560
they're using for that.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.600
And they say the earthly link may

31:15.600 --> 31:19.600
seem antiquated by comparison, but it has its upsides.

31:19.600 --> 31:23.520
He can download new software, and they can improve things

31:23.520 --> 31:24.720
in batch processing.

31:24.720 --> 31:27.960
So he can come up with solutions like offload it to the cloud.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.360
It'll chew on it, and then they'll

31:29.360 --> 31:31.480
send it back to him, depending on the bandwidth.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.800
And then he can give the results to the astronauts

31:33.800 --> 31:34.800
working at the station.

31:34.800 --> 31:37.400
I know this is early days, but I will be very curious to see,

31:37.400 --> 31:39.400
after six months or a year, or however

31:39.400 --> 31:42.280
long this project runs, how useful is it?

31:42.280 --> 31:43.800
Do they get real benefits?

31:43.800 --> 31:45.560
Because if so, I assume this will

31:45.560 --> 31:50.600
be the first of a long line of AI assistants in space.

31:50.600 --> 31:54.120
Yeah, the first AI assistant in space is pretty, pretty neat.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.560
Let's bring it down to Earth, though,

31:55.560 --> 31:58.200
and talk a moment about the Gnome desktop.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.800
A lot of love these days from us for plasma.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.640
But things over in the Gnome camp

32:02.640 --> 32:04.920
are slowly but surely getting better.

32:04.920 --> 32:07.560
A lad on Twitter tweeted that we could look forward

32:07.560 --> 32:09.280
to some serious performance improvements

32:09.280 --> 32:11.360
and included a picture of a slide

32:11.360 --> 32:14.840
from Gwadek, which just wrapped up the Gnome conference.

32:14.840 --> 32:17.680
And there was a lot of talk about improving

32:17.680 --> 32:19.500
the performance in Gnome.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.240
And in the slide, too, I noticed they specifically

32:22.240 --> 32:24.600
call out those jerks at Canonical

32:24.600 --> 32:27.360
for all the good work they're doing to actually help

32:27.360 --> 32:30.140
get really deep into the performance issue and solve it.

32:30.140 --> 32:33.360
So it looks like the kumbaya of Canonical and Gnome

32:33.360 --> 32:36.520
continues because they give them a particular call out

32:36.520 --> 32:38.160
of thanks in this slide.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.840
And it seems that we may see even more performance

32:40.840 --> 32:43.140
improvement announcements soon coming from the Gnome project

32:43.140 --> 32:45.480
because they're touting them at Gwadek this year, which

32:45.480 --> 32:48.120
I am very happy to see.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.880
So don't become a plasma user just yet, Wes.

32:50.880 --> 32:51.680
Yeah, I know, right?

32:51.680 --> 32:54.800
I think this is also just another good case of a bunch

32:54.800 --> 32:57.000
who is used in so many ways.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.720
And I think it's pretty easy.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.240
The way I use Gnome, I don't care as much

33:01.240 --> 33:02.800
about the performance for 90% of them

33:02.800 --> 33:05.000
because I have a web browser, and I have a terminal,

33:05.000 --> 33:06.160
and maybe I'm developing something,

33:06.160 --> 33:07.880
and the rest doesn't matter too much.

33:07.880 --> 33:10.320
But let's say you're a video editing professional using

33:10.320 --> 33:12.840
Ubuntu on your powerful workstation.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.480
Suddenly, that matters a lot.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.000
So I think the focus of end user deliverables

33:17.000 --> 33:18.640
that Ubuntu can bring is just going

33:18.640 --> 33:20.200
to keep these improvements coming.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.080
Well, I look forward to it.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.840
And it's a whole group effort now.

33:24.840 --> 33:27.200
There's so many major distributions

33:27.200 --> 33:29.240
that are shipping Gnome that hopefully we

33:29.240 --> 33:30.280
will start to see some.

33:30.280 --> 33:31.620
That's what we've all been hoping,

33:31.620 --> 33:34.160
is that when everybody kind of focuses on it, not everybody,

33:34.160 --> 33:36.400
but when so many desktops focus on it,

33:36.400 --> 33:37.960
maybe we'll get real results.

33:37.960 --> 33:39.560
That might be what we're seeing now.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.100
And it's a whole group effort, but it's

33:41.100 --> 33:43.600
really great to see Canonical sticking with it.

33:43.600 --> 33:45.840
Now, I got to tell you, we had a story

33:45.840 --> 33:47.840
that I decided not to include, but now I kind of

33:47.840 --> 33:49.680
wish we did because it was about setting up

33:49.680 --> 33:50.960
enterprise-grade Wi-Fi.

33:50.960 --> 33:52.040
Holy smokes.

33:52.040 --> 33:52.720
Holy smokes.

33:52.720 --> 34:00.120
If anybody out there has solutions for like home,

34:00.120 --> 34:03.000
what am I looking for here?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.640
Not like a DDWRT solution, but what

34:05.640 --> 34:09.520
is the latest in Linux solutions for Wi-Fi?

34:09.520 --> 34:11.140
This isn't a question for the audience.

34:11.140 --> 34:15.760
What is the latest in firmware replacement on a router device

34:15.760 --> 34:18.960
or even better, ones you build with like a PC or something?

34:18.960 --> 34:20.520
I'd love to know.

34:20.520 --> 34:23.560
I've been living in Wi-Fi hell for about three days.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.160
Things are looking better now.

34:25.160 --> 34:30.080
I was so worried today because I'm down here at Linux Academy.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.960
And today was the first of several, I think,

34:32.960 --> 34:36.040
five live streams they're doing to announce

34:36.040 --> 34:38.320
all this new content that they're launching in July.

34:38.320 --> 34:43.360
And I got here on Saturday, had a nice chill morning,

34:43.360 --> 34:47.560
got in here around 9 AM Sunday morning,

34:47.560 --> 34:50.600
started setting up for Linux Action News.

34:50.600 --> 34:55.040
And I pretty quickly discovered that I was dropping packets.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.800
And it was really hard for Joe to even understand

34:57.800 --> 34:58.840
a word I was saying.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.600
I mean, harder than normal, right?

35:00.600 --> 35:02.920
Not just because you're mispronouncing things.

35:02.920 --> 35:04.200
Yes, exactly.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.480
I didn't know what it was.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.720
Was it Wi-Fi?

35:07.720 --> 35:09.000
Was it something on the network?

35:09.000 --> 35:12.720
You know, on a Sunday, 9 AM, 10 AM, I'm the only one here.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.800
So it's not like it's somebody torrenting stuff.

35:14.800 --> 35:15.760
Nobody's here.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.400
Most of the machines aren't even here.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.920
Most of them are laptops.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.440
So I started going through all of these old school

35:22.440 --> 35:24.480
troubleshooting processes that I used to go through.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.440
Can I ping the router?

35:25.440 --> 35:26.960
Am I dropping packets here?

35:26.960 --> 35:28.200
Am I dropping packets when I go here?

35:28.200 --> 35:31.240
Can I do all these trace paths and all that kind of stuff?

35:31.240 --> 35:34.760
Started running around with a dongle and a spool of ethernet,

35:34.760 --> 35:37.560
trying different jacks to see if anything was live.

35:37.560 --> 35:41.520
But the folks here at Linux Academy, about a year ago,

35:41.520 --> 35:43.280
refurbed the building a bit.

35:43.280 --> 35:47.320
And at that time, they deployed what's called, like,

35:47.320 --> 35:51.200
a common generic term, enterprise-grade Wi-Fi,

35:51.200 --> 35:56.320
as if there's some committee that reviews and measures Wi-Fi

35:56.320 --> 35:58.320
to determine if it's enterprise-grade or not,

35:58.320 --> 36:01.840
stamps it, like the USDA-grade beef.

36:01.840 --> 36:03.600
I assume it's one of those things where that's

36:03.600 --> 36:05.560
what the vendor says, and you pay enough for it

36:05.560 --> 36:06.960
that that's the title you get.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.640
Yeah.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.360
I think that's exactly what it is.

36:11.360 --> 36:13.240
Everybody you pay said it's enterprise-grade,

36:13.240 --> 36:14.640
so therefore it is enterprise-grade.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.920
I mean, that's what you tell the boss, right?

36:15.920 --> 36:17.760
And they're like, oh, yeah, good work, IT.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.280
Yeah, and that is true.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.600
I tell you, that is so true.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.440
And I'm sitting here going, well, Wi-Fi is still Wi-Fi,

36:23.440 --> 36:24.880
and I'm doing VoIP.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.720
And any kind of disruption really

36:26.720 --> 36:28.280
messes with the VoIP call.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.560
And so we did a bunch of troubleshooting.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.680
Stefan, their network engineer, he helped me out, too.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.640
At least I assume he's their network engineer,

36:35.640 --> 36:37.340
because the man really knows his stuff.

36:37.340 --> 36:39.900
And we actually still haven't tracked it down.

36:39.900 --> 36:41.880
I don't know exactly what it is, and of course,

36:41.880 --> 36:43.620
I'm the only jerk that's having an issue,

36:43.620 --> 36:45.200
because I'm the only jerk trying to do

36:45.200 --> 36:49.000
a live, high-quality, high-bitrate VoIP call.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.800
Everybody else is browsing the web, doing email,

36:51.800 --> 36:53.720
and they're all on Wi-Fi, because they're just

36:53.720 --> 36:54.560
on laptops.

36:54.560 --> 36:57.280
And most laptops that they buy now

36:57.280 --> 36:59.560
don't even have ethernet ports.

36:59.560 --> 37:01.620
So everybody's on Wi-Fi.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.960
The Wi-Fi network's just got all of these machines on it.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.540
So I'm like, no, I want to go ethernet.

37:05.540 --> 37:08.560
Did you see the post on Ars Technica over the weekend

37:08.560 --> 37:09.360
about Wi-Fi?

37:09.360 --> 37:10.300
Is that what you're talking about?

37:10.300 --> 37:11.520
Yes, yes, that's the one.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.480
I thought it was a great read.

37:13.480 --> 37:16.000
It's like six pages long and doesn't

37:16.000 --> 37:17.360
have a huge amount of detail.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.520
Well, it has some detail, but yeah, I've

37:19.520 --> 37:22.400
used ubiquity gear at home for the last two or three years,

37:22.400 --> 37:25.720
and it's been genuinely pretty flawless.

37:25.720 --> 37:28.400
You just set it and forget it, which is exactly what you want

37:28.400 --> 37:29.520
from Wi-Fi.

37:29.520 --> 37:31.400
And they have PS Sense on the front end.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.280
That's great.

37:32.280 --> 37:34.880
See, I think that's what they have here, but not the PS

37:34.880 --> 37:37.640
Sense on the monitor at all.

37:37.640 --> 37:38.800
But Stephanie's coming out.

37:38.800 --> 37:39.560
He's going to bring a spool.

37:39.560 --> 37:41.000
We're going to wire me in a jack,

37:41.000 --> 37:42.280
because there's no jacks that are hot,

37:42.280 --> 37:45.560
because everything's on enterprise ethernet,

37:45.560 --> 37:47.120
or Wi-Fi ethernet.

37:47.120 --> 37:49.320
You still can't beat a cable, can you?

37:49.320 --> 37:50.280
No, no.

37:50.280 --> 37:52.460
But ironically, the solution was, really,

37:52.460 --> 37:54.720
the only solution was I had to get outside the network.

37:54.720 --> 37:55.840
It's a particular challenge, too,

37:55.840 --> 37:57.260
because normally when I come down,

37:57.260 --> 38:01.280
when I go places to do the shows, I always take the RV.

38:01.280 --> 38:04.840
And I've done it so many times, and it's kind of expensive.

38:04.840 --> 38:07.760
So I was starting to really question

38:07.760 --> 38:09.600
the practicalness of that.

38:09.600 --> 38:13.160
Really, do I need to take an RV, a 40-foot-long RV,

38:13.160 --> 38:14.360
every time I go somewhere?

38:14.360 --> 38:16.160
That is too much.

38:16.160 --> 38:19.200
It is way more efficient to fly down there and just

38:19.200 --> 38:22.080
do the shows from one of the recording booths for a week,

38:22.080 --> 38:24.200
or more, maybe.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.880
Potentially, actually, two weeks.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.840
So whatever I could fit in my backpack

38:28.840 --> 38:30.040
is what I brought with me.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.040
And then everything else got ordered from Amazon

38:32.040 --> 38:32.920
by Linux Academy.

38:32.920 --> 38:36.520
And all of the gear that Wes and I use and Noah

38:36.520 --> 38:38.880
use in our mobile setups, they pre-bought and had it

38:38.880 --> 38:39.640
here for me.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.640
I get everything all hooked up, got all my gear,

38:41.640 --> 38:43.520
same exact software setup, same software

38:43.520 --> 38:46.840
I used on the last trip with my XPS 13.

38:46.840 --> 38:48.600
Really, I thought I had it all dialed in,

38:48.600 --> 38:50.020
and I started having these issues.

38:50.020 --> 38:52.520
And I start thinking, you know, if I was in the RV,

38:52.520 --> 38:54.480
I would have three cellular networks.

38:54.480 --> 38:57.040
I would have three laptops I could switch between.

38:57.040 --> 38:58.760
I have Wi-Fi I could connect to.

38:58.760 --> 39:01.960
And plus, I have a booster on the top of my RV

39:01.960 --> 39:05.760
that can pick up Wi-Fi signals from two miles away.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.120
It's insane.

39:07.120 --> 39:09.080
It has this little tiny device that

39:09.080 --> 39:10.640
is just this incredible booster.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.020
So there's a lot of flexibility.

39:12.020 --> 39:14.240
Plus, I can move, and I can just go somewhere else

39:14.240 --> 39:15.440
that has better connectivity.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.840
That has saved your butts a number of times.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.520
Yeah, and so this trip, I'm like, oh, boy.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.520
So what can I do?

39:21.520 --> 39:22.880
Because I don't have the RV.

39:22.880 --> 39:24.600
I don't have any other equipment with me.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.180
And I need to get outside the network.

39:26.180 --> 39:28.200
So I went and I got a MiFi.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.120
I went and got a MiFi.

39:29.120 --> 39:31.840
I might return it within 14 days.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.480
But you know, it's another device

39:34.480 --> 39:36.880
with another payment and all that kind of stuff.

39:36.880 --> 39:39.880
But it was what you have to do to do the show.

39:39.880 --> 39:42.920
And so now, it seems to be holding up mostly.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.600
Do you guys not have tethering over there?

39:44.600 --> 39:46.400
Because over here, I just switched my phone

39:46.400 --> 39:48.080
into a hotspot, and off I go.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.240
Yeah, the issue is the room I'm in,

39:50.240 --> 39:53.160
which is in the center of a very large building,

39:53.160 --> 39:57.560
and then it's a thick wall with sound insulation.

39:57.560 --> 40:02.880
And so the only thing that gets signal in here is Verizon.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.440
So I had to get a Verizon MiFi.

40:04.440 --> 40:07.640
Otherwise, I would just use my, that's what I've done before,

40:07.640 --> 40:11.120
is I just turn on tethering on my Nexus.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.320
But that's the way it goes sometimes.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.720
Maybe can we buy like a second one of those boosters

40:15.720 --> 40:17.480
and just sort of strap it to your back.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.440
You can walk around with that at all times.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.080
Dude, a podcasting backpack.

40:21.080 --> 40:21.840
Yeah, right?

40:21.840 --> 40:22.480
Right?

40:22.480 --> 40:24.080
Yeah, and just put like a Linux box in there.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.600
So that way, we can say it runs Linux.

40:25.600 --> 40:26.920
Yeah, a little nook sitting at the bottom.

40:26.920 --> 40:27.840
It'll be perfect.

40:27.840 --> 40:30.760
Then you're going to look like the guys in Silicon Valley

40:30.760 --> 40:33.760
walking around the convention and trying to hack everyone.

40:33.760 --> 40:34.720
Oh, yeah.

40:34.720 --> 40:35.960
Oh, I already do.

40:35.960 --> 40:38.320
I have been out on the street, and it's

40:38.320 --> 40:40.280
like if I'm with a couple of people,

40:40.280 --> 40:41.560
this has happened a few times.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.680
I think it's even happened when I've been around you, Wes.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.280
People will stop and go, hey, what are you guys doing?

40:45.280 --> 40:45.760
What's going on?

40:45.760 --> 40:47.280
Is there a computer convention?

40:47.280 --> 40:48.880
Is there some sort of computer convention in town?

40:48.880 --> 40:50.160
Yeah, exactly.

40:50.160 --> 40:51.840
But you just get enough of us in one room,

40:51.840 --> 40:53.560
and I guess it is a computer convention.

40:56.600 --> 40:58.160
I guess we just look it.

40:58.160 --> 41:00.520
So yeah, it's been a bit of an interesting problem.

41:00.520 --> 41:02.720
But man, if the guys here haven't been awesome to work

41:02.720 --> 41:05.360
with trying to track it down and troubleshooting stuff

41:05.360 --> 41:07.840
and turning off all the packet inspection

41:07.840 --> 41:09.560
to make sure if that's not it and that kind of thing.

41:09.560 --> 41:11.080
So the live stream went pretty well.

41:11.080 --> 41:13.200
It didn't disrupt the live stream much.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.160
There's a couple of dropouts because of it,

41:15.160 --> 41:16.960
but it was a little more tolerant.

41:16.960 --> 41:17.720
So that was nice.

41:17.720 --> 41:20.040
And the big launch, we had lots of people

41:20.040 --> 41:23.520
show up and watch the live stream, so that was cool.

41:23.520 --> 41:26.520
You can probably find it on Linux Academy's YouTube channel

41:26.520 --> 41:27.480
if you want to check it out.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.040
We had a fun little bit in the beginning,

41:29.040 --> 41:31.600
and I was there for the whole stream, so that was fun too.

41:31.600 --> 41:34.240
And now I'm just kind of hanging out here

41:34.240 --> 41:35.080
for a couple of days.

41:35.080 --> 41:36.920
They have one more on Thursday.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.720
I haven't booked a return flight,

41:38.720 --> 41:41.560
so I'm thinking about hanging out until the weekend

41:43.480 --> 41:45.400
and then being here for the Thursday stream too.

41:45.400 --> 41:48.400
Oh yeah, you should, just a little week in Texas, why not?

41:48.400 --> 41:49.240
It's nice.

41:49.240 --> 41:53.920
Plus it's like, I just have this total nightmare vision

41:53.920 --> 41:55.160
of me flying out of town,

41:55.160 --> 41:57.480
and then that's when something goes wrong with the Linux box

41:57.480 --> 41:59.240
or the OBS machine.

41:59.240 --> 42:00.280
Something's gonna happen

42:00.280 --> 42:01.960
because I just got them all switched over.

42:01.960 --> 42:05.320
You need to protect the reputation of Linux, Chris.

42:05.320 --> 42:08.640
If there's one point to your entire existence, this is it.

42:08.640 --> 42:11.280
Well, the thing too is the guy that's in charge here

42:11.280 --> 42:14.920
of the live stream, he's a photographer

42:14.920 --> 42:16.120
and a videographer and a good one too,

42:16.120 --> 42:17.680
but he's never used OBS before.

42:17.680 --> 42:19.400
So it's been of a training process and all of that.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.720
So I may be here till at least then,

42:21.720 --> 42:25.120
but pretty happy the first one went through pretty well.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.520
And if we track down this network issue,

42:26.520 --> 42:28.440
I think the next one will be really smooth.

42:28.440 --> 42:30.160
And it's a process.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.880
It reminds me when you're the one person

42:32.880 --> 42:34.520
having issues with the network,

42:34.520 --> 42:38.480
it is what you were asking for is a leap of faith

42:38.480 --> 42:40.600
by the people that you were asking for their time

42:40.600 --> 42:41.440
to troubleshoot it.

42:41.440 --> 42:44.480
Like I felt constantly like I had to continue to prove

42:44.480 --> 42:46.160
that really I know what I'm doing,

42:46.160 --> 42:47.240
there really is an issue here.

42:47.240 --> 42:48.080
Do you know what I mean?

42:48.080 --> 42:49.000
Like when it comes to the network.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.560
It's up to you to prove that it's not just your problem,

42:52.560 --> 42:54.960
that it's actually a systemic network wide problem.

42:54.960 --> 42:56.440
And of course, because network engineers

42:56.440 --> 42:57.800
are bothered all the time, right?

42:57.800 --> 42:59.120
Everyone loves to blame the network.

42:59.120 --> 43:01.680
So of course, that's a natural defensive position.

43:01.680 --> 43:03.200
Plus from what it sounds like,

43:03.200 --> 43:04.120
if you're just browsing the web

43:04.120 --> 43:06.360
or doing various office related tasks,

43:06.360 --> 43:09.040
that is so different than any sort of real time

43:09.040 --> 43:10.400
video streaming protocol.

43:10.400 --> 43:12.240
So it's just a different use case too.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.080
Yeah, so true.

43:14.080 --> 43:19.040
And it's like way more intolerant of outages and breakups

43:19.040 --> 43:22.480
where like a web browsing session or Slack chat

43:22.480 --> 43:25.840
won't even notice a, I'll give you an example.

43:25.840 --> 43:27.200
So it's not that bad.

43:27.200 --> 43:32.200
I would say, so I'll ping Google DNS, say 800 times.

43:32.480 --> 43:37.480
And in that 800 times, I may drop 0.5% of the packets.

43:40.120 --> 43:41.400
You know, it's really small.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.880
It's like a very small amount.

43:43.880 --> 43:48.880
But what it equates to is about every minute or so,

43:49.200 --> 43:51.160
maybe every 30 seconds or so,

43:51.160 --> 43:53.560
there is about a second or so of my speech

43:53.560 --> 43:54.800
that's completely lost.

43:54.800 --> 43:57.080
And you have no idea what I'm saying.

43:57.080 --> 43:58.680
We just had to kind of grind through land

43:58.680 --> 44:00.200
and code a radio the last couple of days.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.280
So I knew it had to get fixed.

44:01.280 --> 44:05.000
But tracking that down has sent me like down

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
the old Google's searching for like tools on Linux

44:08.000 --> 44:11.840
to like send bandwidth checks and like try to figure out

44:11.840 --> 44:13.720
where I might have a lot of latency

44:13.720 --> 44:15.600
or try to figure out where something's dropping packets.

44:15.600 --> 44:18.720
Like it's kind of been a fun adventure again.

44:18.720 --> 44:21.760
And getting to talk to lingo to the network guy,

44:21.760 --> 44:23.760
talking to him about drop packets

44:23.760 --> 44:25.520
and going to the patch panel,

44:25.520 --> 44:28.080
seeing if I can't patch in my ethernet to the switch.

44:28.080 --> 44:30.160
You're back on the front lines.

44:30.160 --> 44:31.560
The whole lingo has been fun.

44:31.560 --> 44:33.760
All right, let's keep going though.

44:35.400 --> 44:38.840
A lot of you, at some point,

44:38.840 --> 44:41.200
have tried to get something working with wine.

44:41.200 --> 44:44.120
And maybe you were successful, maybe you weren't.

44:46.840 --> 44:51.840
But the 4th of July marked wine's 25th frigging birthday.

44:51.840 --> 44:56.320
25 years since the first stable, not a Windows emulator.

44:56.320 --> 44:59.440
The first year brought the all-important support

44:59.440 --> 45:01.160
for Microsoft Solitaire.

45:01.160 --> 45:04.960
And by 1996, the wine developers managed to get Word

45:04.960 --> 45:06.440
and Excel to run.

45:06.440 --> 45:09.200
It, however, would be another 12 years

45:09.200 --> 45:12.040
before the software was declared stable.

45:12.040 --> 45:15.360
Version 1.0 was released in 2008.

45:15.360 --> 45:18.040
And in the intervening years, the wine team bounced around

45:18.040 --> 45:20.800
to several different licensing models for code,

45:20.800 --> 45:22.720
starting with BSD style,

45:22.720 --> 45:25.440
before eventually landing on a limited GPL,

45:25.440 --> 45:27.440
followed by a number of flame wars

45:27.440 --> 45:29.120
that lasted for a long time,

45:29.120 --> 45:31.160
which you can still find archives of.

45:31.160 --> 45:34.200
As wine slogged its way towards its first stable release,

45:34.200 --> 45:36.920
a brief period of commercial support from Corel propped up

45:36.920 --> 45:39.400
for a bit that eventually faded away

45:39.400 --> 45:42.360
when the Canadian company departed from it all in 2001

45:42.360 --> 45:44.440
to focus on its slow decline.

45:44.440 --> 45:46.040
Windows came around,

45:46.040 --> 45:49.520
which promised to offer easy Windows applications

45:49.520 --> 45:51.600
while switching over to Linux.

45:51.600 --> 45:55.040
Microsoft noticed that the name was close to Windows,

45:55.040 --> 45:56.600
took issue with that,

45:56.600 --> 45:59.280
and started the process of suing them.

45:59.280 --> 46:01.440
They went to court in 2002.

46:01.440 --> 46:03.160
Lindos lost.

46:03.160 --> 46:05.640
But Microsoft did something interesting.

46:05.640 --> 46:07.880
They opted for a retrial

46:08.880 --> 46:12.600
and ended up paying Lindos $20 million

46:12.600 --> 46:14.320
to purchase the trademark.

46:14.320 --> 46:17.120
And then Lindos was renamed to Linspire,

46:17.120 --> 46:20.800
which has actually just recently come back to life

46:20.800 --> 46:22.760
when it launched under new ownership earlier this year.

46:22.760 --> 46:27.120
I did a review of their release, one release ago.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.920
You may remember Transgaming got in the mix for a while.

46:29.920 --> 46:31.960
And Transgaming did something interesting.

46:31.960 --> 46:35.240
They really got a fork of wine that focused on DirectX.

46:35.240 --> 46:39.520
And that ended up kind of really pushing forward

46:39.520 --> 46:42.280
wine as a project in the direction of DirectX,

46:42.280 --> 46:44.080
which has been huge for wine.

46:44.080 --> 46:45.520
And has developed in its current form

46:45.520 --> 46:47.720
for wine and has developed and has continued.

46:47.720 --> 46:51.800
They've just recently released 3.11, which is stable.

46:51.800 --> 46:55.880
Yesterday, they released 3.14 testing,

46:55.880 --> 46:58.000
or I'm sorry, 3.12 testing.

46:58.000 --> 47:02.080
And they have also big news from WineConf.

47:02.080 --> 47:05.560
They're beginning progress on arm support.

47:05.560 --> 47:06.400
What?

47:06.400 --> 47:07.520
For wine.

47:07.520 --> 47:08.840
Yeah.

47:08.840 --> 47:11.720
That's, it's like using, I don't, I mean,

47:11.720 --> 47:13.120
this is really something,

47:13.120 --> 47:15.240
but this is actually what Microsoft is doing too.

47:15.240 --> 47:19.200
It's using x86 on arm emulation

47:19.200 --> 47:24.200
to run 32 bit and 64 bit binaries on arm.

47:24.280 --> 47:25.760
So I don't even, not only do I not need

47:25.760 --> 47:27.440
to actually run that operating system,

47:27.440 --> 47:29.280
I don't even need that architecture.

47:29.280 --> 47:30.320
What a world.

47:30.320 --> 47:31.640
Yeah, that's hilarious.

47:31.640 --> 47:34.040
In fact, it really makes me just respect wine even more.

47:34.040 --> 47:37.440
It may be slow, but as arm CPUs get faster,

47:37.440 --> 47:38.760
it may, you never know.

47:38.760 --> 47:42.240
Also, it looks like there has been some solid progress

47:42.240 --> 47:47.200
on wine on the Tegra-based Shield,

47:47.200 --> 47:49.720
which is running Android as well.

47:49.720 --> 47:51.760
On the NVIDIA Shield running Android,

47:51.760 --> 47:55.760
they showed Notepad++ and Age of Empires

47:55.760 --> 47:58.560
running under wine on Android on the NVIDIA Shield,

47:58.560 --> 48:00.840
which I love the NVIDIA Shield, it's been pretty great.

48:00.840 --> 48:02.600
And they also talk about Vulkan support and whatnot.

48:02.600 --> 48:04.040
We'll have a link in the show notes

48:04.040 --> 48:06.680
if you guys want to read up about that.

48:06.680 --> 48:09.120
And one other little note in there,

48:09.120 --> 48:12.960
and I've been a long time advocate of crossover office,

48:12.960 --> 48:17.040
they mentioned that CodeWeavers is still,

48:17.040 --> 48:20.360
for a long time now I believe, employing about 50%

48:20.360 --> 48:21.960
of all of the wine developers.

48:21.960 --> 48:22.800
Wow.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.520
It's a big deal, yeah.

48:24.520 --> 48:26.440
And I just noticed they had a new version out

48:26.440 --> 48:29.720
that I haven't bought yet, that I was kind of on the fence

48:29.720 --> 48:31.840
because I don't really need it anymore,

48:31.840 --> 48:33.360
but I think I'm going to do it.

48:33.360 --> 48:35.320
I mean, it's almost been worth it just to support this,

48:35.320 --> 48:37.080
right, like this is awesome.

48:37.080 --> 48:40.040
You know, I've talked to Jeremy, their CEO, a long time ago.

48:40.040 --> 48:42.200
I had a lot of respect for him when I talked to him.

48:42.200 --> 48:44.040
And then when I saw that now for a long time

48:44.040 --> 48:47.400
they've been employing over, not only do they employ 50%

48:47.400 --> 48:50.280
of the wine developers, but then they kick that stuff

48:50.280 --> 48:51.000
upstream too.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.680
It's not like they're locking it behind some sort

48:53.680 --> 48:55.280
of proprietary re-license and then

48:55.280 --> 48:56.800
you have to buy it to get it.

48:56.800 --> 48:58.640
They're still kicking that stuff upstream.

48:58.640 --> 49:00.120
They're just so confident in their product

49:00.120 --> 49:01.760
that they feel like they can sell it too.

49:01.760 --> 49:04.320
And it's a great UI that sits on top of wine

49:04.320 --> 49:07.840
that if you need business-grade wine that

49:07.840 --> 49:09.960
is really easy to walk through, it

49:09.960 --> 49:12.160
has specific profiles for each application,

49:12.160 --> 49:14.920
it sets up bottles so that way each wine configuration

49:14.920 --> 49:17.160
doesn't disrupt the other, or you

49:17.160 --> 49:18.400
can install multiple applications

49:18.400 --> 49:21.320
in a single bottle, and it has step-through wizards

49:21.320 --> 49:23.200
that will pull down installers off the internet

49:23.200 --> 49:25.280
if they're out there, it's great.

49:25.280 --> 49:27.840
And I really think that CodeWeavers is a solid company,

49:27.840 --> 49:29.400
so I think after the show I'm going to go buy myself

49:29.400 --> 49:31.040
a copy of Crossover Office.

49:31.040 --> 49:33.000
I think it's worth it.

49:33.000 --> 49:35.360
And man, more power to the wine projects.

49:35.360 --> 49:39.160
25 years in, we might not be running all of the Windows apps

49:39.160 --> 49:42.960
we thought we would 25 years into it, maybe not,

49:42.960 --> 49:45.200
but it's still pretty cool what they're pulling off.

49:45.200 --> 49:47.160
All right, we have to keep going because I

49:47.160 --> 49:50.640
want to get to the Gen 2 stuff, and we've been catching up,

49:50.640 --> 49:52.560
so we've taken a little bit extra time here.

49:52.560 --> 49:53.880
But it's just good to chat.

49:53.880 --> 49:57.160
Now it's like the old shows back together again.

49:57.160 --> 49:58.040
It's just so much fun.

49:58.040 --> 49:58.960
It's beautiful.

49:58.960 --> 50:00.280
Let's talk about Ting, though.

50:00.280 --> 50:01.120
Let's talk about Ting.

50:01.120 --> 50:02.880
Go to linux.ting.com.

50:02.880 --> 50:06.920
This is, boy, do I miss having my multiple Ting access points.

50:06.920 --> 50:09.280
This is how I do it because I have a phone on Ting,

50:09.280 --> 50:13.600
and I have two MiFi devices, a CDMA device and a GSM device.

50:13.600 --> 50:15.220
The reason why I can afford to do that,

50:15.220 --> 50:17.800
it's not because I'm some big baller here.

50:17.800 --> 50:20.000
It's because it's $6 a month for the line,

50:20.000 --> 50:22.160
and then just my usage on top of that.

50:22.160 --> 50:25.360
That's a pretty understandable business expense for what I do.

50:25.360 --> 50:28.680
$6 a month, and if I don't use them, I don't pay.

50:28.680 --> 50:29.560
Just pay for the line.

50:29.560 --> 50:30.080
That's it.

50:30.080 --> 50:31.480
That's easy.

50:31.480 --> 50:35.080
It's really simple, and that's why the average Ting bill is just $23

50:35.080 --> 50:36.280
per phone per month.

50:36.280 --> 50:39.480
It's a fair price for how much you talk, text, and data you use.

50:39.480 --> 50:41.480
And when you go to linux.ting.com, they'll

50:41.480 --> 50:45.000
take $25 off a device if you want to get one from Ting directly.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.480
If you bring one, and remember, it's CDMA and GSM.

50:47.480 --> 50:49.240
So if you want to bring a device, and there's

50:49.240 --> 50:51.920
a lot that are supported, just check their BYOD page.

50:51.920 --> 50:54.080
They'll give you $25 in service credit,

50:54.080 --> 50:56.880
which will probably cover more than your first month

50:56.880 --> 50:58.240
potentially.

50:58.240 --> 50:59.720
They have a fantastic control panel

50:59.720 --> 51:01.280
where you can see your usage at a glance

51:01.280 --> 51:02.680
and take complete control.

51:02.680 --> 51:03.680
You can set alerts.

51:03.680 --> 51:05.200
You can turn services off.

51:05.200 --> 51:07.360
You can activate devices through their website.

51:07.360 --> 51:09.320
And if you ever get stuck, they just really

51:09.320 --> 51:11.920
have great customer service, the best customer

51:11.920 --> 51:13.000
service in the industry.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.800
And that's something that Ting can focus on

51:14.800 --> 51:16.880
in a really particular kind of way.

51:16.880 --> 51:18.560
So not only do they have great prices,

51:18.560 --> 51:20.960
not only do they have a great device selection,

51:20.960 --> 51:23.680
but they make flexible usage, like the kind that I use,

51:23.680 --> 51:26.440
where I have one phone and then two different MIFIs, possible.

51:26.440 --> 51:28.200
It means that when I'm trying to do a show,

51:28.200 --> 51:29.700
I can switch between those devices

51:29.700 --> 51:33.160
just by changing my Wi-Fi network on my laptop.

51:33.160 --> 51:33.800
I love it.

51:33.800 --> 51:34.840
They also have a great blog.

51:34.840 --> 51:36.840
They just did a tiny home post a little bit ago,

51:36.840 --> 51:40.160
which I'm partial to, being that I live in one.

51:40.160 --> 51:42.640
And it's pretty cool.

51:42.640 --> 51:43.720
They really get this stuff.

51:43.720 --> 51:44.820
And that's what I love about Ting.

51:44.820 --> 51:46.280
And I'd love you to get some Ting.

51:46.280 --> 51:48.800
So go to linux.ting.com and check them out.

51:48.800 --> 51:50.800
They're a great service.

51:50.800 --> 51:53.000
Also, thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring

51:53.000 --> 51:55.560
this episode of the Unplugged program,

51:55.560 --> 51:58.320
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

51:58.320 --> 52:00.480
You go there, you sign up for a free seven-day trial,

52:00.480 --> 52:01.520
and you support the show.

52:01.520 --> 52:04.080
It's a platform to learn more about Linux, anything

52:04.080 --> 52:06.400
that runs Linux or that Linux runs on top of.

52:06.400 --> 52:09.440
And today, they just launched new Azure courseware,

52:09.440 --> 52:11.520
some Linux Essentials courseware,

52:11.520 --> 52:16.360
and, man, Wes, it's a perfect courseware for the TechSnap

52:16.360 --> 52:16.860
audience.

52:16.860 --> 52:19.960
It's a full deep dive into continuous integration

52:19.960 --> 52:21.160
and deployment.

52:21.160 --> 52:24.480
And on top of that, when you're all done with the courseware,

52:24.480 --> 52:26.800
you actually set up a whole system.

52:26.800 --> 52:29.560
You really go through and implement every aspect of it.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.560
And they've broken it out into different areas.

52:31.560 --> 52:33.000
And the thing that I learned today

52:33.000 --> 52:35.360
that I didn't know before is, so say they've

52:35.360 --> 52:38.160
itemized continuous integration and deployment courseware

52:38.160 --> 52:40.760
into eight major sections.

52:40.760 --> 52:45.440
If you just needed to brush up on the Kubernetes aspect,

52:45.440 --> 52:47.560
you could jump right to step six.

52:47.560 --> 52:49.960
It will fill in all of the required stuff

52:49.960 --> 52:51.360
and build the server infrastructure

52:51.360 --> 52:53.560
that you would have had to go through to get there,

52:53.560 --> 52:55.600
just so you can deep dive on that single topic,

52:55.600 --> 52:57.000
take it, and learn more.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.440
That is the difference when you use Linux Academy, right?

53:00.440 --> 53:02.600
Who else has thought about this this seriously?

53:02.600 --> 53:03.880
They're trying to do so many different things

53:03.880 --> 53:06.700
that they just can't have this level of polish and attention

53:06.700 --> 53:07.640
to detail.

53:07.640 --> 53:09.680
And if you want to get the next promotion,

53:09.680 --> 53:11.720
you really want to prove that you've learned something,

53:11.720 --> 53:13.040
I can think of nowhere better.

53:13.040 --> 53:13.720
That's right.

53:13.720 --> 53:15.600
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug.

53:15.600 --> 53:17.560
They're going to have another live stream

53:17.560 --> 53:21.600
on Thursday, July 12 at 10.30 Chicago time.

53:21.600 --> 53:22.520
That's central.

53:22.520 --> 53:25.320
And the word on the street, although I

53:25.320 --> 53:27.200
haven't seen the deets, but the word on the street

53:27.200 --> 53:30.080
is they have a bunch of Red Hat related announcements

53:30.080 --> 53:31.120
on the Thursday show.

53:31.120 --> 53:32.760
So check that out.

53:32.760 --> 53:34.160
And they're also hiring.

53:34.160 --> 53:37.440
I wanted to make a little mention of this.

53:37.440 --> 53:39.880
They are looking for a full stack node developer,

53:39.880 --> 53:42.280
if that's something that you might be interested in.

53:42.280 --> 53:45.720
They also are looking for a senior Ruby developer,

53:45.720 --> 53:47.920
as well as a customer support manager,

53:47.920 --> 53:51.760
Ruby on Rails developer, and a Microsoft Azure training

53:51.760 --> 53:52.680
architect.

53:52.680 --> 53:55.160
Now that's a lot of positions.

53:55.160 --> 54:01.040
So I would say there's an email address I gave out last week.

54:01.040 --> 54:02.440
And I think that's the same one.

54:02.440 --> 54:03.580
I don't remember what it was.

54:03.580 --> 54:04.400
I'm sorry.

54:04.400 --> 54:05.160
I can't recall.

54:05.160 --> 54:06.680
Brent, do you happen to remember randomly

54:06.680 --> 54:10.160
what email address I randomly said last week in the show?

54:10.160 --> 54:11.760
I'm sorry, I have no idea.

54:11.760 --> 54:13.640
No, I can't recall either.

54:13.640 --> 54:15.880
But if anybody in the chat room knows either,

54:15.880 --> 54:17.320
maybe put it in there.

54:17.320 --> 54:19.120
Because there is a lot of positions here.

54:19.120 --> 54:20.400
And it's a really cool company.

54:20.400 --> 54:22.820
I've been down there hanging out with them for a while.

54:22.820 --> 54:25.920
And I totally think that if you are in this area

54:25.920 --> 54:29.720
and you listen to the show, some of these actually,

54:29.720 --> 54:32.600
all of the ones I just listed, except for the customer support

54:32.600 --> 54:34.560
manager, are all telecommute jobs.

54:34.560 --> 54:36.480
So you don't even have to be in Texas.

54:36.480 --> 54:38.240
You can be wherever you're at.

54:38.240 --> 54:39.440
That's pretty awesome.

54:39.440 --> 54:40.200
So check it out.

54:40.200 --> 54:44.800
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged to get the deal.

54:44.800 --> 54:45.920
And you know what, do this.

54:45.920 --> 54:48.520
If you want to apply for the positions,

54:48.520 --> 54:50.320
I have a special email address that's

54:50.320 --> 54:52.320
set up just for the Jupyter Broadcasting audience.

54:52.320 --> 54:54.060
So you kind of get the hotline treatment.

54:54.060 --> 54:55.280
So if you really are interested, it

54:55.280 --> 54:57.200
may be worth listening to the sponsor section

54:57.200 --> 54:58.760
of last week's episode.

54:58.760 --> 55:01.360
But otherwise, I'll give you a little hot tip.

55:01.360 --> 55:04.080
linuxacademy.workable.com.

55:04.080 --> 55:05.320
I have them all listed there.

55:05.320 --> 55:07.360
linuxacademy.workable.com.

55:07.360 --> 55:10.320
I think if you're a listener of this show, that

55:10.320 --> 55:11.600
might put you ahead of the list.

55:11.600 --> 55:12.640
So go check that out.

55:12.640 --> 55:15.400
And if you really want the fast line,

55:15.400 --> 55:18.440
go listen to last week's episode and grab the email address.

55:18.440 --> 55:19.980
And then maybe remind me what it was.

55:19.980 --> 55:22.120
Also, a big thank you to DigitalOcean.

55:22.120 --> 55:24.360
deo.co slash unplugged.

55:24.360 --> 55:28.800
Go there to get a $100 credit at DigitalOcean when you sign up.

55:28.800 --> 55:30.720
You've got to use that URL, though, to get that.

55:30.720 --> 55:33.320
deo.co slash unplugged.

55:33.320 --> 55:35.820
You can build applications super fast

55:35.820 --> 55:38.120
on DigitalOcean's crazy quick infrastructure.

55:38.120 --> 55:41.280
Enterprise-grade SSDs, 40 gigabit connections

55:41.280 --> 55:42.720
coming into the hypervisors.

55:42.720 --> 55:44.800
Of course, they're running Linux, KVM,

55:44.800 --> 55:46.120
to virtualize it all.

55:46.120 --> 55:47.600
And they have industry-leading price

55:47.600 --> 55:49.920
to performance, predictable cost and billing.

55:49.920 --> 55:52.160
And I love these optimized compute types.

55:52.160 --> 55:55.040
While you were out, Wes, we set up a PeerTube instance

55:55.040 --> 55:58.360
on a DigitalOcean droplet using their super crazy fast,

55:58.360 --> 56:00.920
high-end Xeon CPUs, where you get two dedicated.

56:00.920 --> 56:01.760
Oh.

56:01.760 --> 56:03.000
So cool, Wes.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.080
Because I've encoded these exact videos many times.

56:06.080 --> 56:09.400
So I really get into a sense of the speed up on DigitalOcean.

56:09.400 --> 56:10.200
And it's so nice.

56:10.200 --> 56:10.960
It's just right there.

56:10.960 --> 56:12.700
They also have these mix-and-match droplets

56:12.700 --> 56:14.960
now, where you can set the different, like,

56:14.960 --> 56:16.080
maybe you want more RAM.

56:16.080 --> 56:17.620
Or you can say, you know what, I just

56:17.620 --> 56:20.880
want all in SSD, as well as block storage.

56:20.880 --> 56:22.560
It's so slick.

56:22.560 --> 56:24.600
And the whole thing is easy to manage

56:24.600 --> 56:26.920
with their fantastic dashboard.

56:26.920 --> 56:28.360
And they're easy to use API.

56:28.360 --> 56:30.280
If you just want to do it via script

56:30.280 --> 56:32.280
or use your favorite language, it's

56:32.280 --> 56:33.600
really easy to get started.

56:33.600 --> 56:35.520
And they got great documentation, data centers

56:35.520 --> 56:37.280
all over the world.

56:37.280 --> 56:39.920
This is the bar, you understand, right?

56:39.920 --> 56:42.840
DigitalOcean is the bar that everybody else in this game

56:42.840 --> 56:44.240
is trying to catch up to.

56:44.240 --> 56:47.400
The problem is, when you're ahead,

56:47.400 --> 56:48.440
you just got to stay hungry.

56:48.440 --> 56:49.600
And you can stay competitive.

56:49.600 --> 56:51.800
And that's exactly what DigitalOcean's done.

56:51.800 --> 56:55.200
Now they're offering $100 credits to try it out.

56:55.200 --> 56:56.160
That's insane.

56:56.160 --> 56:58.200
Take advantage of that before they stop doing it,

56:58.200 --> 56:59.360
because that's insane.

56:59.360 --> 57:00.220
It's so great.

57:00.220 --> 57:04.580
do.co.co.co.co and a big thank you to DigitalOcean

57:04.580 --> 57:09.480
for sponsoring the unplugged program, do.co.co.co.

57:09.480 --> 57:12.300
All right, well, last week we talked about Gen2's GitHub

57:12.300 --> 57:14.000
repo getting owned.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.920
It wasn't a massive, massive blunder,

57:15.920 --> 57:18.760
because they weren't really anything more than mirrors.

57:18.760 --> 57:22.280
But now it turns out that it was a bit of a rookie mistake.

57:22.280 --> 57:24.120
And I say that with love, much respect

57:24.120 --> 57:26.840
to some of the very, very technical people

57:26.840 --> 57:28.400
over in the Gen2 community.

57:28.400 --> 57:31.480
In fact, yeah, there's some people in the security industry

57:31.480 --> 57:33.840
that only use Gen2 because of some of the people involved

57:33.840 --> 57:34.600
with the project.

57:34.600 --> 57:37.600
So I say this with no disparity to the people involved with Gen2,

57:37.600 --> 57:40.680
but it helps me make a larger point.

57:40.680 --> 57:43.840
And that is, after looking through this

57:43.840 --> 57:46.920
and thinking about some of the other recent distro snafus,

57:46.920 --> 57:49.920
things like expiring SSL certifications,

57:49.920 --> 57:52.760
project leaders randomly quitting,

57:52.760 --> 57:57.200
leaving nobody with access to any of the infrastructure,

57:57.200 --> 58:00.080
there's just been example after example

58:00.080 --> 58:02.840
after example this year of projects

58:02.840 --> 58:04.440
getting this stuff wrong.

58:04.440 --> 58:06.640
And in the case of Gen2, they just

58:06.640 --> 58:08.520
owned up to it on their own Wiki page.

58:08.520 --> 58:10.520
They say the attacker gained access

58:10.520 --> 58:13.500
to a password of an organization administrator.

58:13.500 --> 58:15.120
Evidence suggested a password schemes

58:15.120 --> 58:16.960
was used to disclose on one site made

58:16.960 --> 58:20.000
it easy to guess the password for unrelated web pages,

58:20.000 --> 58:25.120
i.e. using the same password on multiple websites.

58:25.120 --> 58:29.120
The Wiki page also reveals that the project got lucky.

58:29.120 --> 58:30.800
The attack was loud.

58:30.800 --> 58:33.840
Removing all of the developers caused everyone

58:33.840 --> 58:37.280
to get emailed if they had been more careful and more

58:37.280 --> 58:39.080
selective, like figured out somebody

58:39.080 --> 58:43.080
that hadn't been active for a while and just removed them

58:43.080 --> 58:46.680
and then got in, it would have taken much longer for the Gen2

58:46.680 --> 58:48.040
project to notice.

58:48.040 --> 58:51.480
But the credentials were taken, and they did a noisy attack

58:51.480 --> 58:54.120
where they did something that notified all of the developers,

58:54.120 --> 58:55.600
and so it alerted them to it.

58:55.600 --> 58:57.240
And those are the things that really kind of,

58:57.240 --> 58:58.760
that was the thing that saved them.

58:58.760 --> 59:01.120
But the thing that caused the issue

59:01.120 --> 59:04.960
is a shared password as well as GitHub failing

59:04.960 --> 59:07.560
to block access to repositories via Git,

59:07.560 --> 59:11.560
resulting in malicious commits being extremely accessible.

59:11.560 --> 59:14.200
So Gen2 had to force push over as soon as these things were

59:14.200 --> 59:17.840
discovered, and credential revoking procedures

59:17.840 --> 59:19.320
were incomplete for them.

59:19.320 --> 59:21.920
And they also didn't have a backup copy of the Gen2 GitHub

59:21.920 --> 59:23.760
organization details.

59:23.760 --> 59:25.440
So that made it particularly hard.

59:25.440 --> 59:27.880
And the systemd repo turned out not to be mirrored.

59:27.880 --> 59:29.600
It was stored directly on GitHub.

59:29.600 --> 59:31.520
So there was a couple of things, oh, as well

59:31.520 --> 59:32.720
as some communication snafus.

59:32.720 --> 59:37.080
But my core point that I'm trying to make

59:37.080 --> 59:40.720
is this is clearly not the stuff that distros

59:40.720 --> 59:44.240
are super strong at, as it probably shouldn't be.

59:44.240 --> 59:46.240
You know, they're developers.

59:46.240 --> 59:47.280
They're maintainers.

59:47.280 --> 59:48.880
They're organizers.

59:48.880 --> 59:50.960
But they're not necessarily sysadmins,

59:50.960 --> 59:52.000
or maybe some of them are.

59:52.000 --> 59:55.280
But that isn't what they're spending their time doing.

59:55.280 --> 59:58.600
And I'm not trying to make a case for putting everything

59:58.600 --> 59:59.640
in the cloud here, Wes.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:01.960
But do you kind of follow my logic?

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.760
Like, I kind of come from the school of thought

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.160
that developers should develop software,

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.360
and sysadmins should manage servers.

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:11.160
And recently, the Gnome Foundation

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:14.200
just launched new positions specifically

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.880
to take off the server administrative burden

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.960
from the developers and people in the foundation.

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.080
What's the compromise here?

01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.920
Because obviously, projects don't have unlimited budgets.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.440
They can't hire people full time to do this.

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.920
And there's only so many people to do the work.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:31.680
But yet, there's obviously a certain amount

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.800
of neglect that goes when you have too many hats on.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.280
What's the solution for this?

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.520
Solve it, Wes.

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.160
Yeah, I'll solve the whole thing, and maybe world peace

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.120
while I'm at it.

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:40.840
I do think you're right.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:43.080
Like, when we talk about the split between developers

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.480
and admins, it's not about even skill sets

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:46.320
or anything like that.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.600
It's really what you're saying.

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.600
Too many hats, when you have too many jobs

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.720
and you're thinking about too much

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.840
and too many responsibilities, you get sloppy.

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:54.920
I'm sure the people involved here,

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:57.800
they probably even knew somewhere in the back of their mind

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.840
that this wasn't the best password policy.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.180
And you know what, I'll fix it next weekend

01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:03.040
when I finally have an ounce of time.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.160
I'll sit down, and I'll get this right,

01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:06.020
and I'll finally install that password manager

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:07.160
that I've been meaning to.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:09.400
But that's never going to work.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.640
And so whether you're a developer or anything else,

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.560
you really do need people that your job

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:15.960
is maintaining infrastructure.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.300
And it's not sexy, and it might not even be fun,

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.840
especially when, as you say, right,

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.400
a lot of these people, these are volunteers.

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.720
You're trying to contribute to open source

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:24.040
for the benefit of everyone.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.420
And you're excited about scratching the itch

01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:30.400
or improving the awesomeness of the build system

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.440
or whatever else it is you're interested in.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.360
And if you try to take on too many things,

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.560
it's just gonna fail.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.880
So if you can find people who are willing to be humble

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.220
and just say like, yes, I'm gonna administer.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.180
I'm gonna be an administrator.

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:43.100
I'm gonna be an overseer.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.840
I'm just gonna make sure that all the central parts

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.920
that no one else thinks of,

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.700
and it just has to run in the background,

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.800
will actually work.

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:52.100
And ideally, if you could have some sort of funding

01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:52.940
to make sure that happened,

01:01:52.940 --> 01:01:54.480
because that's probably especially hard

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.880
to find volunteers for, that would be even better.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:58.440
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:01:59.920
Brandon, what do you think of the idea

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.880
of the free and open source software community

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.040
coming together with essentially

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.120
like an open best practices,

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.200
like a comprehensive best practices

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.400
that many, many, many projects could contribute to?

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.600
What about something like that?

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:15.720
Yeah, it seems to me like these are the types of problems

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.680
that would exist with almost any project, right?

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:22.680
So I think because we have such strong community,

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.560
even if you're making quasi-competitive products,

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.000
everyone needs this infrastructure

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:29.480
to make their work happen, right?

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.160
So what if we can maybe all get together

01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:35.800
and create some kind of, this might be a dream,

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.720
but some kind of best practices,

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:41.760
I don't know if it's a document or some kind of,

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.400
maybe it's a conference or something

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.400
where everybody can just be up to date on this,

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:49.200
and some of the developers can maybe lean

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.200
on some of the projects who are a bit more expert.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.680
Or maybe what about some sort of donated auditing time,

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.640
where you could get in security experts

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.120
to go into an organization and do periodic assessments

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.160
to say like, hey, where are you at?

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.080
What can you improve?

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.740
Yeah, you would think there would be people

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:06.920
in the community that have that particular skill set

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:09.160
that could be a way they contribute,

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:11.880
but there would need to be some structure around it,

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:12.980
because otherwise you could get people

01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:14.720
just banging on doors they shouldn't.

01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:17.160
Eric, you think maybe I'm just a DevOps hater?

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.360
You say DevOps aims to solve this.

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:21.200
I say DevOps is the problem.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.840
DevOps is a philosophy, first and foremost.

01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.520
It's not a position, it's not supposed to be click-baity.

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:31.300
It's a philosophy, it's a way of doing work.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:36.300
It's with the way that the founding team folks,

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.360
it was just a bunch of people that were at a conference

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:42.640
that were sitting down talking over drinks

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.540
and basically came up with this entire philosophy.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:49.220
It's a way of doing work.

01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:52.800
You break things down into one or two week sprints.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.460
You take tasks one at a time.

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:57.680
You sit down with the developers,

01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:59.520
with the security people, with the network people,

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.800
with the business, with the systems administrators.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.800
Everybody sits down at a table and prioritizes work

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:08.920
and what can I get done this week?

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.480
What needs to get pushed to next week?

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.960
And that's where a lot of these tool sets have come in.

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.360
The CI, CD, continuous integration,

01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:20.360
continuous deployment type of an approach

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.680
comes from this DevOps philosophy.

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.360
So if you've got all of your code for your infrastructure,

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.560
for your network, for your applications

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:32.240
in a GitLab instance,

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:37.240
and that's managed by a tool like Jenkins

01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:40.040
that will automatically set up new builds

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.180
that talks to a tool like SaltStack

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:44.780
that automatically provisions and monitors

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:46.720
your infrastructure to make sure that,

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.920
well, the server crashed so I'm gonna rebuild another one

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:51.520
and tell the load balancer to point to this IP address

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.480
instead of the bad IP address.

01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.280
It's a philosophy and it only works well

01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:00.720
as the people that are implementing that philosophy.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:04.080
Yeah, and it does seem like the tools are getting better

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.680
and they're getting more complicated too,

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:07.760
but it seems like the tools around this,

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:10.080
what has been a philosophy for years now,

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.260
are actually starting to catch up with the philosophy.

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:13.400
Would you agree with that, Wes?

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.440
Yeah, I mean, it's really like anything else.

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:18.500
I think when you can have better communication,

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:21.200
better communication around shared goals in particular

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.280
and have stakeholders working closer together,

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.120
that's a benefit.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.320
Now, it's not a silver bullet, right?

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.260
So anytime you have more things to do

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.080
than you actually have manpower or time to do,

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:32.260
you're trying to do too much,

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.880
you'll still face the same problems.

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.460
Yeah, I like that you got the word stakeholders

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:38.300
that worked in there, that's well done.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:42.320
Now, Brent has an idea, maybe we just simplify this.

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.040
Something a little easier than a comprehensive guide,

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:45.880
right, Brent?

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.480
Yeah, I remember, I wish I could remember

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:50.400
what it was called, and maybe someone in the community

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:53.700
can help me out on this, but I remember Noah talking,

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.480
it might have been like even six weeks ago on Ask Noah

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.680
about exactly this, a type of checklist

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.840
that you could look at your own systems

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:05.360
and see if they were secure with basically,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.960
you didn't have to be creative to come up with a checklist.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.960
It was right there and it was being distributed

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.320
by one of the organizations, I forget what it was.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:14.880
A checklist isn't a bad way to go,

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:18.280
even if it was something that was sort of generic

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:22.040
that you could at least say we followed

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.320
this community checklist.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.280
I feel like there is something here.

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:26.560
Yeah, I mean, a checklist is good,

01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:28.560
I think you need, a checklist is helpful,

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.760
it's a start, right, but you still do need that person

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:33.320
who has enough time and focus and skill

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.240
to run through the checklist and know

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:37.560
which ones are actually checked or not.

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.760
Yeah, that is a really fair point.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:43.160
And maybe the checklist is a little bit too surface,

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.200
you know, you need to understand

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.600
what's happening below the checklist.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:48.740
Yeah, and that is sometimes what I worry is happening,

01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:50.320
and this is just me being a curmudgeon,

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:54.480
is we have, what DevOps to me really is,

01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:57.880
is it's getting software developers more empowered

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.600
to just deploy things that they need to do their job

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.360
and not have to sit around and wait for the sysadmins

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:06.200
to set the system up and then this tedious back and forth

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:07.960
where something isn't configured quite right,

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.280
and you know, the sysadmin has no idea

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.080
how the software works, and the software developer

01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.840
has no idea what the sysadmin's doing,

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.960
and the whole momentum there really caught,

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:20.440
and I guess another way to put that is

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.080
the demands to speed up software development

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:24.480
have sort of put us down this path

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:27.400
where developers are deploying infrastructure.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.520
And when I started in the IT industry,

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:34.040
those two lines were never crossed,

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.240
and they generally didn't get along super well either,

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.200
either sides of the camp were always grousing

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.760
about the other side of the camp,

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.400
so it wasn't an ideal solution.

01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:45.120
And Linux really is an operating system

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:49.240
designed for system administrators, it really is.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:51.040
If you think about it, you have to be root

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.560
to install software, well, who's root?

01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.960
The system administrator, and if you think about the repo,

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:56.800
what is the repo?

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.240
The repo is an all-knowing person

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.320
who has blessed this package

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.000
as being possible to install on your system.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.840
That's the mindset of a sysadmin,

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:11.840
and snaps and Docker and AppImage and Flatpaks and DevOps

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.160
are all about collapsing that resistance down

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:19.080
to the developer can publish and the user can install it.

01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.960
And sometimes the user is the developer.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:24.720
And that mind shift has been good

01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.640
for the pace of software development,

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:30.280
and it's led to things like incredible cloud infrastructure

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:33.400
and things like AWS Lambda and DigitalOcean

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.680
one-click deployments, which I use the hell out of.

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.360
So it's not all negative,

01:08:38.360 --> 01:08:40.960
but my core issue has always been

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.640
as we go down this path is you become less

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.640
and less of an expert.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.000
You are required to be less and less of an expert

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.120
to set up really complicated systems.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.760
Whereas in the past, your level of knowledge

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:56.080
basically had to match the level of complication

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:56.920
of those systems.

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:58.200
It was a one-for-one thing.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.640
To get that sucker working,

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:03.520
you knew exactly how it worked in and out intimately.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.120
That is no longer the case.

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:09.360
There is now a massive gap between knowledge and complexity.

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:11.080
And that's not necessarily a bad thing,

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.880
but I think it does lead us down this path

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.040
where you can over-deploy an infrastructure.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.480
You can build yourself a kingdom that traps you.

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.760
And then it's a lot to manage.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:22.000
You've got multiple people trying to get the stuff.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.720
You start sharing passwords.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:24.920
You're using three different things

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:27.000
to coordinate the team's communication.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.640
Nothing is super solid

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:32.000
because there's not one really uptight person

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.200
who is worrying about all of that stuff constantly,

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.360
saying, we need to be doing this.

01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.720
We need to be fixing this.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:40.200
And if you don't have a team or a person

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.120
or whatever to do that,

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.760
and you leave it up to just the developers

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.560
or the distributions or the projects

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:48.120
who are busy doing other things to maintain it,

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.560
I feel like this is going to be a systemic issue

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.480
that constantly plagues busy,

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:57.120
overtaxed open-source projects

01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.760
and could even, over time,

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.200
lead to a bit of a reputation as amateur

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.320
and that a lot of these projects

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.720
don't have their shit together

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:07.800
and that they constantly are having issues.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.400
I mean, going all the way back to Mint breaches,

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.640
I mean, we can just sit here and rattle off

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:16.640
mistake after mistake after mistake

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.560
that has really just boiled down to,

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.320
oops, we missed that, or we didn't really know,

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.080
or something changed that we weren't aware of,

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:25.520
or the project lead who had all the access left.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.280
And every time you just go,

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.120
you smack your head and you go,

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.520
God, that's amateur hour.

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:30.920
It's a gray area in many ways,

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:32.800
because you're right, we have so many tools.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.960
And in many ways, that's good

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:36.800
because a lot of times, if they're done well,

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.800
it means it's easier to get it right, right?

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:39.640
So if you're on Amazon

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.040
and you're deploying a load balancer,

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:43.520
it will handle all, you know,

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.560
if you have SSL on there and you have it provisioned,

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:46.840
you know, it will have the best ciphers,

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:47.680
they take care of it.

01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.040
It gets upgraded automatically.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:49.880
So that's nice.

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.840
You don't have to go learn the horrible world of SSL.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.880
At the same time, you're right that if it's so easy

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.640
to build yourself this giant, complicated mountain

01:10:57.640 --> 01:10:59.840
and no one really understands how it works,

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:00.840
that will fall down.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.480
And that's where I think maybe sometimes

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.120
it's a little bit of a fallacy that,

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:05.120
just because you've, you know,

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.520
you've quote unquote gone DevOps or whatever else,

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.160
that doesn't mean you can't have individual experts

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.440
and you can't have people that happen to know more

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.840
about a part of the system than others

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.120
or are specific domain experts.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:19.200
And at the same time, it reminds me of sort of unit tests

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.000
for software development and all the safeguards

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.160
and everything else, there's really no substitute

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:27.000
for attention to detail and caring about the software

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.720
or systems that you're crafting.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:29.840
Yeah.

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:30.800
Well, there you have it.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:32.960
I'm just putting out there that would be great

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.840
if somehow we could really come together on,

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:37.960
even if it was a checklist, that'd be fine,

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.240
that'd be a great starting point

01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:43.120
or a guide, a Wiki of best practices.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:45.160
The problem would be anything like this ever getting traction

01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:47.120
and it would take a lot of buy-off,

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:50.080
but it really seems like if we could give these folks

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.600
that are too busy to, if you think,

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.960
if you have the mindset ever

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.080
when you're managing your infrastructure,

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.920
that, oh man, this is this tedious thing

01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:00.840
that I just have to get done so that way we can do X,

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.520
you're probably not the person that should be managing that.

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:06.200
You should be the person that's looking forward

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:08.840
to setting that stuff up so that way you can do X.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:10.880
And if you're in that position where like,

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:13.240
oh man, this thing again, all right,

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:14.960
well, we gotta go get that thing set up on GitHub

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.040
so we can just do this, please,

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:17.040
so that way we can get back to work.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:18.680
If that's how you feel about it,

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.600
it's probably a sign that your team

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.080
needs somebody else doing that work.

01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.080
And so if we could make that person's job,

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:26.400
because that's not always an option,

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:29.040
if we can make that person's job and life

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:32.240
a little bit easier with a checklist or a guide

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:35.560
or some sort of community resource that says,

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:38.160
these are at least the minimums that you should be doing,

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.120
I think that would be extremely valuable.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.120
So I hope we see it, who knows?

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.480
You never know, you never know, you never know.

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:48.280
Maybe I'll travel around in my RV

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.320
and I'll advocate it on every Linux event I go

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:52.560
and one day something will happen, maybe.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:54.320
In the meantime, where should folks

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.840
get more Westpain in their life?

01:12:55.840 --> 01:12:58.240
Oh, you can find me on Twitter at Westpain

01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:02.400
or stay tuned from some exciting new TechSnap episodes

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.040
coming to a podcast near you.

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:08.840
Ooh, TechSnap.Systems slash subscribe.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.360
Brent, do you have anywhere you'd like to send

01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:13.240
the good folks any tips, tricks

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.960
to get more Brent in their life?

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.880
Yeah, sure, you can either come to Northern Ontario

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.480
and I'll tour you around or you can hit me up on Twitter,

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:25.280
Brent, at Brent Gervais, B-R-E-N-T-G-E-R-V-A-I-S

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:26.640
or BrentGervais.com.

01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:27.880
That's great, that's great.

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:30.320
Now I know if I ever go there, I'm gonna contact you.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.360
If I ever go back to New York City, I'm gonna contact XMN

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.400
and if I ever go down to Seattle, I contact Wes.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.280
I am really covered now, at least on the major coast.

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.200
You can follow me, I'm at Chris Ellis.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:42.720
The whole network is at Jupiter Signal.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.280
Links to build the community.

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.960
Well, you know what, really, if you think about it,

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.440
we have a very wide ranging network of experts,

01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.760
probably in every major city.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.680
So anywhere we wanna go,

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.240
there's probably gonna be somebody there.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.160
If you'd like to join us or get links

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.000
to anything we talked about,

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.240
we have all that stuff detailed at linuxunplug.com,

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.840
linuxunplug.com slash 257.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.800
The live show is at jblive.tv on a Tuesday

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.680
and I may be still down in Texas

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.160
by the time you hear us again.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.560
I just don't know, but thanks so much for joining us

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.600
and we will see you right back here next week.

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:25.600
is

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:52.560
Thank you, guys. That was a lot of fun. Thank you, Mumble Room. You guys were great as always.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.560
Stars, as always, that Mumble Room. Brent, the mumble worked pretty good. You sounded

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:58.960
pretty good during the whole show, too, so I'm glad that worked.

01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.720
That's kind of unbelievable. It's great. We kind of pulled that together last minute,

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.720
didn't we?

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:07.160
Yeah, yeah. And, Eric, it's good to hear that whatever was wrong with your mixer last week,

01:15:07.160 --> 01:15:10.400
the highs are a little better this week.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.600
Yeah, that was fun to find out after the fact.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:19.680
Yeah, the kids love the knobs on the mixer, man. They love the knobs on the mixer. Look

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:26.080
at that, Daddy. Security amateur hour coming in by Architect right now. The Traveling LUP

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:32.500
Roadshow, we need up-tights. That's funny. Do you have any hot travel tips to leave us

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:34.700
with, Wes, before we part?

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:37.440
Buy a Kindle and spend your whole time using it.

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.560
Oh, did you get a Kindle?

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:42.300
I did. I don't know how I didn't have one already in that I'm a pretty big reader. I've

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:45.360
just been stubborn and sticking to the old dead tree matter.

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.840
But it's an Amazon product.

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:51.400
Yeah, I was conflicted, but, boy, I was glad I had it on that 12-hour flight.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.080
I got a Switch for this trip.

01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.280
Oh, really? Oh, nice.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:00.080
Yep. Yep, I got Odyssey and Mario Kart. Man, those games at 60 bucks a pop, though, that

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:06.920
is outrageous. So I'm going to wait a little bit for the others, but so much fun. Much

01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:11.920
better than I expected. It has a kickstand on the back, so you can take the handles off

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:17.960
and it's just so much fun to play with the kids. It has been great. It is better than

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:22.760
expected. And the fact that it uses USB-C to charge is an absolute perk.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:23.760
Loved it.

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:29.240
Mm-hmm. Yeah. So I'll have some Switch time while I'm on this trip. So by the time I get

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:32.480
back, I'll probably have a pretty good take on the device and might be ready to try to

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:33.480
put Linux on it.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:45.480
Oh, do it. Yes.
