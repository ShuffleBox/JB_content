00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 42 for May 27th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:42.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's still celebrating towel day.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
My name is Chris.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
And my name is Matt.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
Hey Matt, you know it is episode 42 so it felt only appropriate to give a shout out

00:48.000 --> 00:49.000
and guess what?

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
What's that?

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Big show today.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
Big show.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Big show today.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.880
So, Liam from gamingonlinux.com and also a writer for Linux Voice joins us to discuss

00:59.880 --> 01:01.480
the Witcher 2 controversy.

01:01.480 --> 01:06.720
He took to the web, he wrote on gamingonlinux that we need to stand back and push against

01:06.720 --> 01:10.840
these kind of ports because these could harm the long term viability and perception of

01:10.840 --> 01:12.840
Linux as a gaming platform.

01:12.840 --> 01:17.320
So he's going to come on and Liam will talk to us about his opinion on why maybe the Witcher

01:17.320 --> 01:21.800
2 is a bigger problem than perhaps we were originally suspecting.

01:21.800 --> 01:25.920
And then if we get through all of that after our email and feedback as well and the follow

01:25.920 --> 01:30.120
up on the poll from last week, I have a really big announcement to make.

01:30.120 --> 01:31.120
Huge announcement.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.120
Big, big announcement.

01:32.120 --> 01:33.120
Biggest announcement ever.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.120
Maybe.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.120
Wow.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.120
I don't know, that might be overselling it.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.240
But it's probably in the top three.

01:37.240 --> 01:38.800
For forever as of yet or whatever.

01:38.800 --> 01:39.800
Yeah.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.800
Well, I'd say it's in the top three.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.800
Cool.

01:41.800 --> 01:42.800
Yeah, we'll see.

01:42.800 --> 01:43.800
We'll see if we get to it.

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
I don't know.

01:44.800 --> 01:45.800
I don't know.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.800
We got a lot to cover this week, Matt.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.800
Yeah, we just might not have time.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.800
We'll see.

01:49.800 --> 01:50.800
All right.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.560
So I wanted to start with our feedback this week.

01:53.560 --> 01:57.080
And we got a whole bunch of emails.

01:57.080 --> 02:00.400
And some people have been complaining that the feedback segment's a little long.

02:00.400 --> 02:02.000
So I've trimmed it up a little bit.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.520
So I just wanted to start with a couple of follow up items just real quick.

02:04.520 --> 02:08.600
The first one is we had Jonathan Thomas from the OpenShot Project on Linux Action Show

02:08.600 --> 02:10.200
on Sunday.

02:10.200 --> 02:13.560
And he mentioned in our interview with him that he would be doing an update on the development

02:13.560 --> 02:15.360
status of OpenShot 2.

02:15.360 --> 02:18.240
Well he has posted that update and you can find it over at OpenShotVideo.com.

02:18.240 --> 02:20.200
We got it linked in the show notes.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.520
He also gave us a shout out for his interview on episode 314.

02:23.520 --> 02:24.520
He loved our shirts.

02:24.520 --> 02:25.520
That was pretty cool.

02:25.520 --> 02:26.520
That's awesome.

02:26.520 --> 02:28.480
We all had matching shirts.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.880
So he also gives us a video preview of OpenShot 2.0.

02:31.880 --> 02:32.880
I'll play a little bit of it.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.000
It's got quite a soundtrack to it.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.360
It's looking good.

02:39.360 --> 02:44.800
So he's got about almost a two minute clip here of the new editor in action working,

02:44.800 --> 02:46.760
moving clips around.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.320
The timeline looks like it moves real slick.

02:49.320 --> 02:53.980
And then later on in the video he'll show how the UI is fully customizable.

02:53.980 --> 02:57.240
You can dock all the windows around and stuff like that.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.480
So kind of exciting.

02:58.480 --> 03:04.320
You can watch the full video over at OpenShotVideo.com and get a little preview taste of how it's

03:04.320 --> 03:05.320
coming.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.520
He says there's been 56 commits in the past 30 days.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.800
He says the OpenShot development is the most active it's been yet.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.080
Things are moving forward at a very fast pace.

03:13.080 --> 03:15.240
And he included some recently completed tasks.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.640
So if you've been following this closely you can go check it out.

03:17.640 --> 03:20.600
And one of the things that he mentioned is he was having some windows build issues.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.920
Those look like they have been mostly nailed out.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.000
And we got a comment on our YouTube page, somebody said, yeah, the reason why I use

03:27.000 --> 03:30.280
OpenShot is because I've been planning on that cross-platform compatibility that's going

03:30.280 --> 03:31.280
to make it work for me.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.280
So there you go.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.280
Good stuff.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.280
Good stuff.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.280
All right.

03:35.280 --> 03:38.160
I'm going to move into our mumble room here, our virtual lug.

03:38.160 --> 03:39.160
Hey guys.

03:39.160 --> 03:42.560
So guys, we're going to read an email here from Tennessee Frank who kind of writes in

03:42.560 --> 03:45.000
a little bit in the defense of Manjaro.

03:45.000 --> 03:49.280
I think we had like an after-show discussion where we're like, oh, Manjaro, hmm, hmm.

03:49.280 --> 03:52.040
And so I think we kind of spurred some people to write in.

03:52.040 --> 03:55.000
And Tennessee Frank says, hey, Chris and Matt, love the show and try to watch live when I

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
can.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.240
But he can't always watch live, of course.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.240
We understand.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.240
He says he wants to-

03:59.240 --> 04:00.240
Right now.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.240
Yeah.

04:01.240 --> 04:02.240
Oh, well, hello, Tennessee Frank.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.240
He says, I wanted to stand up for Manjaro.

04:03.240 --> 04:06.480
He says, I know a lot of Arch users don't really like, they kind of hate on it.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.480
They say it's not Arch.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.600
And granted, they do have their own repos now.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.000
And there aren't quite as cutting edge as a pure Arch install would be.

04:13.000 --> 04:17.160
But for those of us who don't have a PhD in Arch, it gives us a way to access all the

04:17.160 --> 04:22.520
Arch goodness and the AUR without all the issues associated with doing a proper Arch

04:22.520 --> 04:23.520
install.

04:23.520 --> 04:27.460
I've tried just about every Arch-based KDE distro out there, including Entergos.

04:27.460 --> 04:31.600
And thus far, Manjaro was the only one that worked well for me and gives me Bluetooth

04:31.600 --> 04:33.800
support and Wi-Fi right out of the box.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.200
I think that's a big one.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.880
I really think that those who use pure Arch really need to get over it and accept those

04:38.880 --> 04:43.720
of us who use Manjaro and the other offshoots as fellow Arch users, even if we didn't build

04:43.720 --> 04:45.160
our own system from scratch.

04:45.160 --> 04:49.200
We're using Pac-Man, same as Arch users, and we do appreciate the power of Pac-Man,

04:49.200 --> 04:52.880
hopefully with the help of distros like Manjaro, we'll learn enough to move to pure Arch

04:52.880 --> 04:54.920
install sooner or later.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.680
Until then, let's try to play nice with each other and stop all of the hate.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.960
Besides, there are plenty of Windows users for us to hate on, lol.

05:01.960 --> 05:02.960
Catch you on the show.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.880
Keep up the great work, Tennessee Frank.

05:04.880 --> 05:09.520
So there was one defensive Manjaro, and then we had a second emailer, just kind of in the

05:09.520 --> 05:15.400
same vein, write in to say, this is Kerry, and Kerry said, about Arch, Manjaro, and Wi-Fi.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.960
Hi Chris and Matt, loved the show.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.640
I just had a small rebuttal about the comment that why would people use Manjaro instead

05:20.640 --> 05:21.640
of pure Arch?

05:21.640 --> 05:25.360
I wish I was on the Mumble channel that last Tuesday, because I could have said this.

05:25.360 --> 05:29.640
But a good reason why, and I think many other people use Manjaro instead of pure Arch, is

05:29.640 --> 05:31.600
because of the Wi-Fi drivers.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.720
Trying to figure out how to install Wi-Fi drivers is difficult enough, but I don't have

05:34.720 --> 05:36.360
easy access to an Ethernet dongle.

05:36.360 --> 05:41.880
In the new age of extremely thin laptops, I'm guessing, he says, this is in the age

05:41.880 --> 05:47.200
of new extremely thin laptops where you almost always need an Ethernet dongle now, I'm guessing

05:47.200 --> 05:50.320
that Debian, Arch, and many other Ethernet by default distros will start running into

05:50.320 --> 05:54.840
this issue more and more as these laptops become more popular, although maybe this is

05:54.840 --> 05:57.280
an issue of non-free software.

05:57.280 --> 06:01.280
So that's an interesting angle, too, of the hardware support, don't you think, Matt?

06:01.280 --> 06:05.920
Well, you know, I mean, so I've actually had one instance, was not with Wi-Fi, it was actually

06:05.920 --> 06:11.320
with an Ethernet situation to where Integrus was not seeing it, you know, which is essentially

06:11.320 --> 06:13.440
pure Arch for all intents and purposes.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.440
Manjaro did.

06:14.440 --> 06:18.560
Normally, this wouldn't be a big deal except for the one little bit that if you want to

06:18.560 --> 06:21.720
install the operating system, you kind of have to have internet.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.120
So that was kind of a deal breaker for me.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.740
So of course, on that machine, I went with Manjaro.

06:25.740 --> 06:31.640
On most other machines, though, whether it be Integrus or Manjaro, I've never really

06:31.640 --> 06:35.880
had a problem with wireless stuff, just personally, my own experience.

06:35.880 --> 06:40.100
At the end of the day, you know, as far as like people that don't like Manjaro or do

06:40.100 --> 06:43.280
like Manjaro, honestly, if you're a Manjaro fan, hey, that's awesome.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.200
You know, don't worry about what other people think about it.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.760
If it's working for you, stick with it.

06:46.760 --> 06:47.760
Don't sweat it.

06:47.760 --> 06:48.760
And to that, Matt.

06:48.760 --> 06:49.760
RodCorps, go ahead.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.760
You wanted to make a point.

06:51.760 --> 06:56.840
Yeah, but it was mainly to talk about the elitism of Arch people and it's not that Arch

06:56.840 --> 06:59.320
users say you're not using real Arch.

06:59.320 --> 07:03.980
It's that Arch users say specifically the people who are in the community helping people

07:03.980 --> 07:08.320
is if you're not using Arch, you shouldn't be coming to Arch people for help.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.880
So then people who are Manjaro have a completely different kernel.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.860
They've modified their kernel and put extra pieces into it.

07:14.860 --> 07:18.880
That means that there's many aspects where it's just going to create breakage when you

07:18.880 --> 07:23.440
have Arch packages in a different distro and then claim that they're compatible when they're

07:23.440 --> 07:24.440
actually not.

07:24.440 --> 07:27.720
And then you go to the Arch packages and maintainers and ask them what's the problem and you're

07:27.720 --> 07:31.640
like, they say the same thing that the Ubuntu people would say to Mint users, you're using

07:31.640 --> 07:36.680
a different distro, stop expecting us to help you with a different distro.

07:36.680 --> 07:37.680
Go ahead, Popiah.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.800
I think you're about to say exactly what I was just thinking.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.800
Yeah, I think Rod hit the nail on the head.

07:42.800 --> 07:47.860
We get exactly the same thing with Ubuntu in our IRC channels.

07:47.860 --> 07:55.760
We get Mint people coming in or Mint users coming in and saying, my system's not working

07:55.760 --> 08:00.280
and I'm using Ubuntu when in fact they're using an Ubuntu derivative Mint and it's not

08:00.280 --> 08:01.280
just Mint.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.280
It could be any derivative.

08:02.280 --> 08:08.000
I think this is one of those growing pains of any derivative of another distro where

08:08.000 --> 08:13.760
they don't have a wide variety of support that they often direct people to the upstream

08:13.760 --> 08:18.400
support channels or people inadvertently go to the upstream support channels and they

08:18.400 --> 08:24.440
find that upstream, some to get lost because it's not actually upstream that they're running.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.440
Riley, I wanted you to get your repo pointing about Manjaro.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.440
Go ahead.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.440
Yeah.

08:29.440 --> 08:35.120
The main thing that really bugs me about Manjaro is how they manage the repos and how they

08:35.120 --> 08:40.760
test the packages because I know there's no way on earth with a small team that they have

08:40.760 --> 08:46.720
that they can test all those packages, hold them back for two weeks and call it stable.

08:46.720 --> 08:47.720
There's no way.

08:47.720 --> 08:52.360
I'm sure they test some of them, but to hold a package back just two weeks and call it

08:52.360 --> 08:56.640
stable and call it a day, this doesn't make sense to me at all.

08:56.640 --> 08:58.960
They'd have to have testing on a pretty large scale.

08:58.960 --> 08:59.960
Yeah.

08:59.960 --> 09:02.240
Nine people with about 10,000 packages.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.240
Yeah.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.240
Yes, exactly.

09:04.240 --> 09:05.240
There's no way they can do that.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.440
Wimpy, go ahead and give me the dev perspective on this.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.800
Well, Rotten sort of hit it on the head there.

09:11.800 --> 09:19.520
There has been some aggravation with the Arch developers and the Manjaro developers where

09:19.520 --> 09:26.480
we change things because we're rolling release and then we get accused of deliberately breaking

09:26.480 --> 09:33.800
Manjaro when packages roll into Manjaro at offset intervals because the way that things

09:33.800 --> 09:41.720
trickle from Arch into Arch is controlled, and I don't know that's matched with Manjaro.

09:41.720 --> 09:46.480
Also what Riley was saying is also true.

09:46.480 --> 09:55.160
I got a lot of flack from some Manjaro users when I released Marte 1.8, and they were all

09:55.160 --> 10:00.920
stating that in two weeks when it all trickled into Manjaro, it would be stable.

10:00.920 --> 10:04.800
I was making the point, well, I wasn't going to do anything in two weeks, so what was going

10:04.800 --> 10:09.880
to make these packages more stable in two weeks' time other than the passage of time?

10:09.880 --> 10:10.880
Exactly.

10:10.880 --> 10:14.560
Then you just have to wait two weeks in order to get that next patch in.

10:14.560 --> 10:19.360
This is the key question about Manjaro for me.

10:19.360 --> 10:24.640
I have yet to have heard a great answer to it because to me it seems like one of the

10:24.640 --> 10:29.680
few distributions that could pull off a successful testing branch like this would be distributions

10:29.680 --> 10:36.520
with the size install base of Debian or Ubuntu because such a niche of your base is going

10:36.520 --> 10:40.640
to be running on test, and then a niche of that niche will have all of the packages installed,

10:40.640 --> 10:47.480
so even with 10,000 users running on a test version of a distribution, a small subset

10:47.480 --> 10:50.360
of them are going to have the package installed that you have installed, so it could literally

10:50.360 --> 10:55.480
come down to maybe 100 people use that same package, maybe those people issued the update

10:55.480 --> 11:00.840
in that two weeks' time period and tested it, and if maybe they ran into a bug, maybe

11:00.840 --> 11:04.140
they reported it, so now maybe you're down to a dozen possible people that would actually

11:04.140 --> 11:10.200
do that, so to me, the only way to prove a system like that is with massive scale and

11:10.200 --> 11:14.300
demonstrated ability to catch bugs before they ship, and I don't know if we've seen

11:14.300 --> 11:17.720
either one of those in Manjaro's case yet.

11:17.720 --> 11:24.080
I think that they just wait for packages to be in Arch on two weeks, so they see if there

11:24.080 --> 11:28.120
are enough stable that nobody says there's something wrong with this.

11:28.120 --> 11:35.280
I think that the two weeks help because there's a higher chance of Arch users to report the

11:35.280 --> 11:36.280
problem.

11:36.280 --> 11:40.000
Wimpeed, could you touch on the testing process for Arch there?

11:40.000 --> 11:46.920
Yeah, so this doesn't apply necessarily to the community repositories, but the core and

11:46.920 --> 11:52.440
extra repositories, there's a testing, so everything that goes into core and extra has

11:52.440 --> 11:57.600
to go into testing first, and it requires a number of developers to then sign off on

11:57.600 --> 12:01.520
those packages, meaning that you've actually used those packages out of the testing repositories

12:01.520 --> 12:05.660
and agree that they work and they don't break things, so that's the testing that happens

12:05.660 --> 12:10.720
within Arch, so when things land in Arch, they have already gone through a testing process,

12:10.720 --> 12:20.120
so further delaying the packages with a derivative distribution doesn't actually add anything

12:20.120 --> 12:21.120
to the testing.

12:21.120 --> 12:25.560
So the real benefit would be to have a distribution that got maybe more people testing.

12:25.560 --> 12:30.200
Well quite, and what I do is I'm putting most of my packages into community, and there's

12:30.200 --> 12:36.600
no official testing sign off there unless there's a rebuild because of an underlying

12:36.600 --> 12:43.720
library change, but what I do is I host some development repositories, and the users that

12:43.720 --> 12:48.760
I'm in contact with through Google Plus and other online forums, they actually run these

12:48.760 --> 12:55.080
things for weeks or months in some cases before they actually make it into production releases,

12:55.080 --> 12:56.080
so it's well tested.

12:56.080 --> 12:59.960
But the other thing I wanted to touch on is that there has been occasion where there's

12:59.960 --> 13:04.860
been security updates that we've applied in Arch that haven't trickled through immediately

13:04.860 --> 13:09.520
into Manjaro, so you've got a bigger attack window.

13:09.520 --> 13:13.680
Right, but still though, in relative to some other distributions turnaround times, a pretty

13:13.680 --> 13:14.680
tight window.

13:14.680 --> 13:19.040
Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of security teams.

13:19.040 --> 13:22.920
Oh yeah, that's a good point, as Matt points out, Manjaro is a desktop.

13:22.920 --> 13:27.240
I always found that to be such a crap answer, I just, I can't, yeah, I mean, I'll give you

13:27.240 --> 13:30.240
the other stuff, but that was, come on, you know.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.240
Yeah.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.760
Well there's other flaws with Manjaro too, we can go through if you want.

13:34.760 --> 13:37.560
Well I didn't want this to be a, I mean, because these guys are writing in in defense, and

13:37.560 --> 13:42.040
I guess I wanted to say this is a, I mean, I think there's a place for hardware support

13:42.040 --> 13:46.720
and like Matt says, for offline install, that's obviously, there's a need for that when it

13:46.720 --> 13:48.160
comes to installing Arch.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.160
I mean.

13:49.160 --> 13:52.880
But the bug testing is not done by Manjaro.

13:52.880 --> 13:56.360
Like most of my PCs are Arch, but there's one specifically that I don't want to screw

13:56.360 --> 14:00.520
with, I leave it alone, I run Manjaro on that for a reason, because I'm not updating every

14:00.520 --> 14:04.640
bloody day, because quite frankly, you really, to be proactive, you need to actually be in

14:04.640 --> 14:05.800
front of that and paying attention.

14:05.800 --> 14:09.440
Yeah, there is almost an inherent benefit in having slowed down updates just for that

14:09.440 --> 14:10.440
purpose.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.440
But for myself, it's a distro that serves a purpose in that regard.

14:13.440 --> 14:14.760
Do I want it on all my machines?

14:14.760 --> 14:15.760
Not necessarily.

14:15.760 --> 14:18.840
I like different flavors of things for different tasks.

14:18.840 --> 14:23.160
I guess the reason why, because I don't want to hate on Manjaro too much, and I was thinking

14:23.160 --> 14:28.040
maybe we should dedicate an episode where we kind of really get into this, and maybe.

14:28.040 --> 14:32.160
There are some things that does better than other distributions, and I, you know.

14:32.160 --> 14:36.440
And sounds like there's some legitimate concerns about the way they do testing, and so it sounds

14:36.440 --> 14:39.320
like we could have a pretty good robust, we might be able to dedicate a whole episode

14:39.320 --> 14:40.320
to that.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.560
Should we do an episode on this?

14:41.560 --> 14:42.560
Maybe.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.000
I think that's a good idea.

14:44.000 --> 14:48.920
An Arch-based conversation with Entergos and Chakra and stuff like that.

14:48.920 --> 14:52.160
Yeah, maybe we'll let this topic air for a few weeks, so we think about it, because we've

14:52.160 --> 14:56.200
got some stuff planned for the next few weeks, and then we'll come back to this, and we'll

14:56.200 --> 15:00.400
dedicate a whole show to it, because I think that could be, because like the chairman's

15:00.400 --> 15:04.280
pointing out, Chakaraka Raka Bing Bang is also, you know, they do something interesting

15:04.280 --> 15:09.560
where they just support a subset of Arch packages, and so they have their own approach, right?

15:09.560 --> 15:13.360
And then, of course, you've got Entergos, and then you've got straight up Arch.

15:13.360 --> 15:20.440
Chris, actually Chakra, the Nijaro devs are actually former Chakra devs, who actually,

15:20.440 --> 15:24.280
I think there was like some kind of in-house fighting that happened or something, and they

15:24.280 --> 15:26.160
split off and just did their own thing.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.160
Yeah.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.160
Yeah, so maybe, alright.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.880
They're not an Arch derivative anymore.

15:30.880 --> 15:34.360
As they say, let's put a pin in it, and we'll come back to this in a couple of weeks, because

15:34.360 --> 15:39.200
we do have Liam here, and I want to get to Liam to talk about Witherwitcher 2, and also

15:39.200 --> 15:45.400
we got an email in, okay, it's a little weird, I'm not upset, it's just a little weird.

15:45.400 --> 15:48.540
We got an email in, and this is the first time this has ever happened, it's not addressed

15:48.540 --> 15:52.720
to me, it's not addressed to Matt, it's addressed to the Mumble Room.

15:52.720 --> 15:56.520
So Mumble Room got an email this week, so we're going to read that here in a minute.

15:56.520 --> 16:02.320
I was like, oh, they're not even writing to talk to Matt and I, that's cool, but before

16:02.320 --> 16:05.720
we get to that, I want to thank our first sponsor this weekend, that is the great folks

16:05.720 --> 16:10.200
over at DigitalOcean, and the month of May is almost wrapping up, so if you want to go

16:10.200 --> 16:13.460
out there and use Unplugged May to give us a little boost for the month of May, I would

16:13.460 --> 16:14.840
love it, and why would you do that?

16:14.840 --> 16:18.640
Because you're going to get a $10 credit over at DigitalOcean when you use Unplugged May.

16:18.640 --> 16:22.240
So what is DigitalOcean, and why would you want a $10 credit?

16:22.240 --> 16:26.560
Man, I am so glad you asked me that question, it's like you knew exactly what to ask, dear

16:26.560 --> 16:27.560
audience.

16:27.560 --> 16:30.720
Well let me tell you, DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider, dedicated to offering

16:30.720 --> 16:33.560
the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

16:33.560 --> 16:38.400
Now our audience is fast, but on average, users can create a cloud server in about 55

16:38.400 --> 16:43.880
seconds, and pricing plans start at only $5 per month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte

16:43.880 --> 16:51.720
SSD drive, a fast CPU, and one terabyte of transfer for $5 a month, and DigitalOcean

16:51.720 --> 16:56.040
has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, and Amsterdam, but I

16:56.040 --> 17:00.860
think the thing I love the most about them is their interface is intuitive yet powerful,

17:00.860 --> 17:03.800
and power users can replicate it on a larger scale with an API.

17:03.800 --> 17:09.960
Now that's not me, I'll just take the easy to use control panel, but I am appreciative

17:09.960 --> 17:14.120
of this API because there are some great apps that are propping up around it.

17:14.120 --> 17:19.680
But I could also see back from my IT days, I could very easily see DigitalOcean as sort

17:19.680 --> 17:24.480
of our remote data center for like maybe an offsite baculum machine, or an offsite own

17:24.480 --> 17:29.360
cloud box, or an XMPP server, or whatever we would need where it would be really easy

17:29.360 --> 17:30.720
for everybody to connect to.

17:30.720 --> 17:34.200
I could easily see using DigitalOcean for that, and I love the fact that I could write

17:34.200 --> 17:39.040
a series of scripts, and even integrate it in with my puppet setup to manage my DigitalOcean

17:39.040 --> 17:40.300
droplet.

17:40.300 --> 17:44.400
And because they have Docker so tightly integrated, you can actually use Dooku to publish applications

17:44.400 --> 17:46.400
directly onto a DigitalOcean droplet.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.360
They've got lots of Linux distribution choices.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.360
I think Arch is still available right now, so if you want an Arch machine, go grab it

17:51.360 --> 17:57.000
while you can, and use the promo code unpluggedmay, so you get that $10 credit.

17:57.000 --> 18:00.520
You can try out that $5 rig for free for two months.

18:00.520 --> 18:04.000
If you're not even sure what you would use it for, take advantage of that free two months

18:04.000 --> 18:07.520
because their interface is so simple to use.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.760
You're not going to get bamboozled into subscribing to something you don't want.

18:10.760 --> 18:18.280
So try out that unpluggedmay promo code, and just experiment with a really fast VPS up

18:18.280 --> 18:22.440
in the cloud that is connected to tier one bandwidth on data center hardware that really

18:22.440 --> 18:23.440
performs.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.160
Just so you get a sense of what that's like if you've never gotten to experience that,

18:26.160 --> 18:28.560
and why not build yourself a little server to play with.

18:28.560 --> 18:32.720
And then, if you're like Michael Dominic for Coder Radio or myself, you can actually deploy

18:32.720 --> 18:35.240
some of your infrastructure on this.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.560
There's a massive website that you've all heard about.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.900
I'm waiting for their permission to mention how they use DigitalOcean because it's such

18:40.900 --> 18:42.080
a cool setup.

18:42.080 --> 18:46.200
The great thing about DigitalOcean is they early on invested in SSDs.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.760
Way, way, way, way long, from the very beginning they knew this is how we're going to have

18:49.760 --> 18:52.840
to do this, and we're going to have to wrap it in a package that people can really grok

18:52.840 --> 18:54.200
and really use.

18:54.200 --> 18:59.640
The benefit of these SSD drives up on a DigitalOcean droplet is you can get such good performance,

18:59.640 --> 19:01.920
and IO contention is a total non-issue.

19:01.920 --> 19:06.160
And what I mean by that is back in the day, to get the kind of performance I get from

19:06.160 --> 19:11.600
my DigitalOcean droplet now, I would have to have a rate array of at least three or

19:11.600 --> 19:15.740
more disks to get the kind of performance I can get now off of one single SSD drive.

19:15.740 --> 19:18.960
And DigitalOcean's pricing structure is so straightforward that if I need to expand that

19:18.960 --> 19:24.120
SSD size, it's clear to me exactly what I'm going to be spending, and the value is absolutely

19:24.120 --> 19:25.120
reasonable.

19:25.120 --> 19:30.360
So go over to DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code unpluggedmay when you check out, see

19:30.360 --> 19:34.080
what we've been talking about, go check out what an awesome product can be built using

19:34.080 --> 19:39.160
Linux technologies like KVM, of course the Linux kernel, all riding on top of amazing

19:39.160 --> 19:40.160
hardware.

19:40.160 --> 19:46.560
DigitalOcean.com, and a really big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

19:46.560 --> 19:53.520
Okay, so we got this question for the Mumble Room, not for us, comes in from James, and

19:53.520 --> 19:59.000
James says, I have multiple machines, both for work and personal, all right, so get that

19:59.000 --> 20:02.200
Mumble Room in your head, and I use them on a daily basis.

20:02.200 --> 20:06.280
My question is, how do you, the virtual lug, handle multiple systems with documents, config

20:06.280 --> 20:09.200
files, projects, installed packages, et cetera?

20:09.200 --> 20:14.080
I find myself sometimes freaking out that my laptop is not exactly configured like my

20:14.080 --> 20:17.740
workstation and that sometimes I want to work on something from home.

20:17.740 --> 20:22.520
So you, virtual lug, how do you stay organized between multiple machines?

20:22.520 --> 20:23.520
You want to take this first?

20:23.520 --> 20:24.520
BitTorrent Sync.

20:24.520 --> 20:25.520
Ick?

20:25.520 --> 20:28.880
BitTorrent Sync, that's how I do it.

20:28.880 --> 20:30.480
Yeah, that's a good tool.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.560
I've been using a lot of BitTorrent Sync myself.

20:33.560 --> 20:34.560
Anybody else?

20:34.560 --> 20:39.880
That, and you know, it just got to make sure that you're using the same thing on both machines,

20:39.880 --> 20:45.280
you know, as far as secretizing like Google bookmarks or Firefox bookmarks or what have

20:45.280 --> 20:46.280
you.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.640
And then of course, password manager.

20:47.640 --> 20:53.520
So Wimpy, are you syncing like your.config files with BitTorrent Sync?

20:53.520 --> 20:55.320
All sorts of stuff, but yes.

20:55.320 --> 21:03.560
So if you search on GitHub, there's a tool called Macup, M-A-C-K-U-P, which is a Python

21:03.560 --> 21:11.260
script and it was originally designed to sync.files and.folders to Dropbox, but recently

21:11.260 --> 21:15.920
they've changed the way it works so that you can actually back it up to other cloud backends

21:15.920 --> 21:19.960
and also just to a random target directory.

21:19.960 --> 21:27.080
So I have a BitSync folder called profiles and all of my.files get backed up in there

21:27.080 --> 21:31.280
using Macup and Macup has a backup and restore facility.

21:31.280 --> 21:36.800
So I have my main workstation, I back up all my stuff and it auto creates the symlinks

21:36.800 --> 21:41.840
to all the necessary places and then when I go to a new machine, I just sync down the

21:41.840 --> 21:46.680
profile and then run Macup restore and it sprays all of the symlinks back in the right

21:46.680 --> 21:50.360
places and all of my stuff is configured and ready to go.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.680
So I use that for the.files.

21:53.680 --> 21:58.520
Do you have any problems with mismatched versions of software and reading a config that is meant

21:58.520 --> 22:00.880
for a different version of the package or something like that?

22:00.880 --> 22:07.320
No, I mean I run Arch on all my machines and they're all, if not at the same version, very

22:07.320 --> 22:11.600
close to the same version, so I've never encountered a problem with it, no.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.600
That's pretty interesting.

22:12.600 --> 22:16.840
You kind of have my interest peak, so that's, and that's, Rekai's got that linked in the

22:16.840 --> 22:20.240
chat room it looks like right now, so I'll go grab a link to that and throw it in the

22:20.240 --> 22:21.240
show notes.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.400
All right, so anybody else?

22:22.400 --> 22:27.720
I saw Dropbox mentioned a couple of times, Poby, you've been trying sync thing?

22:27.720 --> 22:36.360
Yeah, I, without wishing to get too aggressive, I find it incredulous that Linux and open

22:36.360 --> 22:41.000
source people will accept BitTorrent sync into their life.

22:41.000 --> 22:47.960
It's a proprietary closed platform and you have no idea what's going over the wire, so

22:47.960 --> 22:53.600
I use sync thing and it's fully open source, free software, it's written in Go, it's on

22:53.600 --> 23:03.680
GitHub and the developer is super active and very responsive to issues and bug reports.

23:03.680 --> 23:08.320
It does pretty much the same kind of thing as BitTorrent sync in that you can sync a

23:08.320 --> 23:10.400
folder between multiple machines.

23:10.400 --> 23:16.640
They could all be behind a firewall, they could be opened up to other people, but the

23:16.640 --> 23:23.320
key point is there's no third party that could control it or shut it down or monitor what's

23:23.320 --> 23:24.320
going on.

23:24.320 --> 23:28.440
Now Wimpy, you kind of had a response to sync thing versus BitTorrent sync, right?

23:28.440 --> 23:33.240
Well only in as much that, because Poby was banging on about sync thing a few weeks ago,

23:33.240 --> 23:37.200
I actually created the sync thing packages for Arch Linux in the AUR.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.920
Oh, well thank you.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.520
So I'm using your package then.

23:40.520 --> 23:45.480
Yeah, and I am actually using sync thing, but at the moment it doesn't quite do everything

23:45.480 --> 23:51.400
I need for me to move over to it, but I think in due course I will migrate to it, but BitTorrent

23:51.400 --> 23:54.680
sync is the thing that got me away from Dropbox, so that's an improvement.

23:54.680 --> 23:55.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.480
All right, well we're going to get to Liam here in just a sec, because I know he's been

23:58.480 --> 24:02.680
patiently waiting while he eats a box of cookies because it's getting late where he's at.

24:02.680 --> 24:06.560
Really quick though, and you still have time to vote, I'm just curious, this hit the last

24:06.560 --> 24:07.560
subreddit this week.

24:07.560 --> 24:12.000
I just really just thought maybe you guys would like to see the results so far of the

24:12.000 --> 24:15.640
desktop environment straw poll that we launched last week.

24:15.640 --> 24:18.320
Gnome, when we recorded the episode, was ahead.

24:18.320 --> 24:22.000
It has now fallen to the second position with 20% of the votes.

24:22.000 --> 24:28.800
KDE now dominates the poll with a solid lead at 23%, so 3% over Gnome.

24:28.800 --> 24:34.680
And we've gotten a total of, wow, 1,469 votes so far.

24:34.680 --> 24:38.480
And I'd say, so here's your top five, ladies and gentlemen, number one, actually I'll start

24:38.480 --> 24:45.520
at the bottom, number five, Cinnamon, number four, XFCE, number three, Unity, number two,

24:45.520 --> 24:51.320
Gnome Shell, and number one, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, KDE.

24:51.320 --> 24:52.320
Not too surprised by this.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.320
Of course.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.320
A little surprised by KDE.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.320
Yeah.

24:55.320 --> 25:04.200
There's only 8% between Unity and KDE, between the third and the first.

25:04.200 --> 25:10.360
I don't want this to come across as offensive because I actually infrequently switch over

25:10.360 --> 25:12.200
to KDE and enjoy it quite a bit.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.120
So I think KDE is a fantastic desktop.

25:14.120 --> 25:15.120
I think it's cool.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.120
You can customize it.

25:16.120 --> 25:18.000
I think Qt's great.

25:18.000 --> 25:24.600
However, that said, I kind of wonder if maybe the popularity of KDE is because KDE has been

25:24.600 --> 25:30.520
so damn solid since the four dot one days that people have just kind of put their arms

25:30.520 --> 25:33.620
up and been like, ah, I'm sick of everybody screwing around with me and changing everything

25:33.620 --> 25:34.620
on me.

25:34.620 --> 25:37.600
I'm just going to get KDE figured out and I'm just going to make it work.

25:37.600 --> 25:43.560
Now I'm not trying to say people are settling, but I am kind of saying maybe people are settling.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.560
I don't know.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.560
I don't.

25:45.560 --> 25:46.560
Because I actually think KDE is great.

25:46.560 --> 25:47.560
So maybe not.

25:47.560 --> 25:49.520
Maybe people see what I see in it and they just love it.

25:49.520 --> 25:54.980
But anyways, why don't, I'm going to grab Liam here who's been waiting very politely

25:54.980 --> 25:59.640
and I'll pull him down to our little restricted casting room where we can hang out.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.520
It's kind of like a green room.

26:01.520 --> 26:04.080
And velvet padded walls, Liam.

26:04.080 --> 26:07.040
So Liam, thank you for coming on Linux Unplugged at last minute notice.

26:07.040 --> 26:10.000
I like literally pinged you two hours ago on Twitter.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
So you're a good sport.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
I really appreciate it.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.840
Hey, no problem.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.400
So gamingonlinux.com.

26:15.400 --> 26:16.400
I love it.

26:16.400 --> 26:20.440
I read it at least every Saturday just to see.

26:20.440 --> 26:25.480
You recently had a post like all the great games that came out that week in Linux.

26:25.480 --> 26:26.480
I think you had that two weeks ago.

26:26.480 --> 26:27.480
It was a great read.

26:27.480 --> 26:29.400
I enjoyed that quite a bit.

26:29.400 --> 26:32.600
And on, I want to see, let me pull this up.

26:32.600 --> 26:38.920
You recently wrote a piece kind of covering this whole Witcher 2 fiasco.

26:38.920 --> 26:44.480
Would you be a sport and kind of update our audience in your own words on what is the

26:44.480 --> 26:49.760
big upset around Witcher 2 and what kind of started off this whole controversy?

26:49.760 --> 26:51.160
Yeah, sure.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.160
Okay.

26:52.160 --> 27:01.680
Well, it's a bit of a harsh stance to take really, but I think it is an important one.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.320
The port basically was a lazy port.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.220
There's no way to get around that.

27:06.220 --> 27:08.640
The Witcher 2 is not an old game.

27:08.640 --> 27:12.480
It's not like it's using old tech that the developers aren't familiar with.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.680
It originally shipped for Windows in 2011.

27:14.680 --> 27:15.680
Is that right?

27:15.680 --> 27:16.680
Yeah.

27:16.680 --> 27:17.680
Yeah.

27:17.680 --> 27:18.680
You're talking a couple years.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.680
Yeah.

27:19.680 --> 27:20.680
Nothing.

27:20.680 --> 27:24.000
And then we had another game, System Shock 2.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.200
Now that was ported using Wine.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.920
That's like 15 years old.

27:28.920 --> 27:31.920
That is completely different.

27:31.920 --> 27:36.120
Now Linux users are obviously very technically minded.

27:36.120 --> 27:40.560
We know all the ins and outs of everything basically.

27:40.560 --> 27:45.720
We are going to find out if something like this happens quite easily, as we did.

27:45.720 --> 27:50.200
So what happened, right, if I have this correct, is it gets announced on Steam.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.200
People start downloading.

27:51.200 --> 27:56.520
They start noticing really odd performance issues, especially if they're on ATI and Intel.

27:56.520 --> 27:58.400
They basically can't play the game, right?

27:58.400 --> 27:59.400
Yeah.

27:59.400 --> 28:00.800
I mean, that's it.

28:00.800 --> 28:07.380
When it first came out, it only worked, well, they said it only worked on Nvidia hardware.

28:07.380 --> 28:09.800
That was the first iffy thing, really.

28:09.800 --> 28:10.800
Yes.

28:10.800 --> 28:11.800
Yeah.

28:11.800 --> 28:12.800
That seemed a little strange.

28:12.800 --> 28:15.600
And then people started investigating why the performance was so bad.

28:15.600 --> 28:19.040
In fact, some have even claimed it ran better under Wine.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.200
So people started doing a little digging, and then they discovered, wait a minute, there's

28:22.200 --> 28:25.280
an actual Windows EXE in here.

28:25.280 --> 28:29.960
And when you launch the game, this Eon wrapper is essentially performing the function that

28:29.960 --> 28:36.160
Wine would perform and running a Windows executable in sort of a little cocoon environment,

28:36.160 --> 28:37.160
correct?

28:37.160 --> 28:38.160
Yeah.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.160
It's pretty much that.

28:39.160 --> 28:45.040
I mean, the virtual programming, the guys that did the port, they claim they do make

28:45.040 --> 28:51.880
code changes and they specifically tune their software for every port.

28:51.880 --> 28:57.320
But when something works vastly better in Wine than the port itself, something's not

28:57.320 --> 28:58.320
right.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.680
Now, I got to be honest with you.

29:00.680 --> 29:04.680
On my system, I don't know if I would have known it wasn't a native port.

29:04.680 --> 29:08.120
So I think if you have the right setup, if you have basically an Nvidia card with proprietary

29:08.120 --> 29:14.000
Nvidia driver, I mean, I probably played it for two, two and a half hours without issue.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.600
I haven't played it beyond that, so I don't know if it becomes unstable later on.

29:17.600 --> 29:20.640
So for me, I was kind of like, oh, cool, a game I didn't have before is now available

29:20.640 --> 29:21.640
on Linux.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.960
And I kind of just stopped the thought process there.

29:23.960 --> 29:29.840
But the point that you brought up in your article is this could set a bad perception

29:29.840 --> 29:31.800
about Linux as a gaming platform, right?

29:31.800 --> 29:37.160
You're worried that maybe Windows PC switchers will look at it and go, oh, Linux, you mean

29:37.160 --> 29:41.560
that platform that has all the emulated ports that don't run as good as the native games?

29:41.560 --> 29:45.040
If I ran Windows on the same box, you're worried about that kind of perception, right?

29:45.040 --> 29:51.420
Well, yeah, for Linux to grow, for Linux gaming to grow, we have to have games.

29:51.420 --> 29:57.160
And if developers keep coming along, pushing games out like this, then people that switch

29:57.160 --> 30:00.960
from Windows or Mac to Linux are going to notice the difference.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.520
They're going to start talking about it.

30:02.520 --> 30:04.360
Well, isn't this already happening on the Mac?

30:04.360 --> 30:07.400
Because when I think of a lot of Mac games, I think of crappy Windows ports.

30:07.400 --> 30:11.520
To be honest with you, this seems to be an already problem that plagues the Mac platform.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.720
And they're selling them through the Mac App Store.

30:13.720 --> 30:14.720
Yeah.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.520
And it's a funny thing.

30:16.520 --> 30:21.760
The guys who ported The Witcher actually do a fair few of the Mac ports, and they're also

30:21.760 --> 30:23.440
not very good.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.440
So let me ask you this.

30:24.440 --> 30:29.200
Are you opposed to the idea if, let's just say we live in some sort of magical pony land

30:29.200 --> 30:35.040
where happiness is abound, and they can just out of nowhere develop a really solid wrapper

30:35.040 --> 30:40.660
where, I mean, really, it's actually a pretty good performing game, and they've really done

30:40.660 --> 30:41.660
some magic there.

30:41.660 --> 30:43.240
Are you okay with that kind of port?

30:43.240 --> 30:46.520
Or is it a principle thing where it needs to be native code?

30:46.520 --> 30:51.880
Because I've been sensing it's a bit about the technology, too.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.840
It's not just about the functionality of the game.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.840
Is that right?

30:55.840 --> 30:58.200
Originally, yeah.

30:58.200 --> 31:02.320
My complaint originally was that they didn't port it natively at all.

31:02.320 --> 31:03.920
It was using a wrapper.

31:03.920 --> 31:08.340
But then so many people made comments about the performance and that it doesn't matter

31:08.340 --> 31:09.340
as long as it works.

31:09.340 --> 31:10.340
And that's true.

31:10.340 --> 31:11.340
It works.

31:11.340 --> 31:12.340
That's great.

31:12.340 --> 31:13.340
That's what we need.

31:13.340 --> 31:17.600
But the point about this is it doesn't work for a lot of people, and the wrapper is the

31:17.600 --> 31:19.080
source of those problems.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.080
Right.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.080
Yeah.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.560
And I could see that reputation thing becoming a big problem.

31:23.560 --> 31:28.600
But don't you think in a way the overly verbose reaction from the Linux community will sort

31:28.600 --> 31:33.680
of promote that image because we're drawing so much attention to it?

31:33.680 --> 31:35.480
Oh, yeah, definitely.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.440
I mean, some people have just gone way too overboard.

31:38.440 --> 31:42.880
I mean, one of the developers came on and sort of tried to speak to people on the Steam

31:42.880 --> 31:45.960
forum and he got destroyed by people.

31:45.960 --> 31:46.960
It was horrible.

31:46.960 --> 31:47.960
Yeah, I saw that.

31:47.960 --> 31:54.200
One of the Eon guys came on and he said, you know, we consider it to be a good middle ground

31:54.200 --> 31:58.340
because these shops simply just don't have the budget to do a full native port.

31:58.340 --> 32:02.480
And so this developer says, look, it was either this wrapper or no game at all.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.480
What would you prefer?

32:03.480 --> 32:07.800
What would Liam, writer for gaming on Linux.com, what would you prefer?

32:07.800 --> 32:11.000
No game at all or a port like this?

32:11.000 --> 32:15.080
Personally, for me, I mean, this is just speaking for myself.

32:15.080 --> 32:18.560
I would have personally preferred no port to what I've got.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.600
It's about the reputation for you.

32:20.600 --> 32:21.960
Well, it's not just that.

32:21.960 --> 32:28.000
I mean, I went out and actually bought it myself as a gamer to write about it, to video

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
it.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
I can't even run it.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
Wow.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.880
Yeah, that would be very easy.

32:32.880 --> 32:33.880
Yeah.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.880
See, I got lucky, right?

32:34.880 --> 32:37.120
I bought it on sale at 80 percent off and I had an NVIDIA machine to try it on.

32:37.120 --> 32:40.360
I didn't even try it on an Intel rig here at the studio.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.480
I actually have an NVIDIA machine.

32:42.480 --> 32:44.840
I mean, I'm using the proprietary drivers.

32:44.840 --> 32:50.200
I get about nine to ten frames per second on the lowest settings.

32:50.200 --> 32:54.720
You know, honestly, I would rather the developers just work with like wine and just say, here,

32:54.720 --> 32:56.800
if Linux users want to play our game, use wine.

32:56.800 --> 32:57.800
I don't know.

32:57.800 --> 33:01.960
Well, that was the stance of the guy behind ID Software.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.760
That was what he said originally.

33:03.760 --> 33:08.400
He said that for Linux gaming to succeed, something along these lines, that people need

33:08.400 --> 33:09.880
to push wine, basically.

33:09.880 --> 33:10.880
Yeah.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.640
I mean, no, I just mean in some circumstances.

33:13.640 --> 33:16.920
I don't want to have a whole bunch of emulators, or whatever, not emulators, but you know what

33:16.920 --> 33:17.920
I mean.

33:17.920 --> 33:27.640
I guess I kind of wanted to wrap on this question and ask you if you think this has set perhaps

33:27.640 --> 33:32.180
a bad taste in developers' mouths now?

33:32.180 --> 33:33.720
Probably has a bit, yeah.

33:33.720 --> 33:38.080
The backlash of it has probably not made them very happy, I imagine.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.080
Yeah.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.080
Yeah.

33:40.080 --> 33:41.080
All right.

33:41.080 --> 33:44.440
Well, I'm going to drag you up to the Lion's Den, and we'll let the Virtual Lug toss some

33:44.440 --> 33:47.600
questions at you and see if they have anything they want to ask you.

33:47.600 --> 33:50.000
So Virtual Lug, Popey, why don't we start with you?

33:50.000 --> 33:53.920
Is there any questions you wanted to ask before we jump to the next segment?

33:53.920 --> 33:54.920
Yeah.

33:54.920 --> 33:58.000
I'm not so fussed about having a wine port.

33:58.000 --> 34:01.200
I mean, as in, I don't mind.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.200
I like Limbo.

34:02.200 --> 34:07.400
I don't really care that it runs under Wine, or Eon, or whatever any of these enabling

34:07.400 --> 34:13.840
technologies are, in the same way that I don't care that Minecraft runs under Java.

34:13.840 --> 34:18.080
I don't care what technology enables it, so long as it works.

34:18.080 --> 34:22.800
It depresses me that the Linux community would be happy to file a bug about their keyboard

34:22.800 --> 34:27.960
not working, or their mouse not working to their distro, but when a developer of a game

34:27.960 --> 34:34.000
comes along and uses a third-party enabler to make their game work on Linux, rather than

34:34.000 --> 34:39.960
file a bug and say, hey, in a friendly, respectful way, rather than saying, your game doesn't

34:39.960 --> 34:46.400
work very well on my platform, they go full bore hassling the person on Steam.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.480
And I think that's just the wrong way to approach it.

34:48.480 --> 34:49.480
That was the wrong way.

34:49.480 --> 34:50.480
I agree there.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.680
I do see that.

34:51.680 --> 34:54.040
That was the part that kind of went dirty that leaves the bad taste.

34:54.040 --> 34:56.760
Daredevil, I wanted to get a chance, because you say maybe we're looking at this the wrong

34:56.760 --> 34:57.760
way.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.920
Yeah, I agree totally with Popi.

34:59.920 --> 35:04.720
And also, it's like, this is not a matter of Linux.

35:04.720 --> 35:09.280
We're talking about if the problem was that developers didn't acknowledge the platform.

35:09.280 --> 35:10.520
They're starting to acknowledge.

35:10.520 --> 35:14.000
When they started to develop for Windows, they also had quirks, and they had to deal

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
with it.

35:15.000 --> 35:17.480
Same way when they go to consoles.

35:17.480 --> 35:18.480
That's true.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.440
If you look at it like old DOS games coming to Windows, man, what a wreck that was for

35:21.440 --> 35:22.440
a while.

35:22.440 --> 35:24.520
Yeah, it takes a while.

35:24.520 --> 35:29.280
And it's just a matter of going and reporting bugs and saying, look, this doesn't work.

35:29.280 --> 35:33.520
Maybe even if you buy the game and the game doesn't work, pay attention to the license

35:33.520 --> 35:34.560
that you accepted.

35:34.560 --> 35:38.320
Maybe the license is like Windows license, that if it doesn't work for you, you can actually

35:38.320 --> 35:39.320
get a refund.

35:39.320 --> 35:40.320
Yeah.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.200
Yeah, if you're going to use a wrapper, I think that should be SOP.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.000
Now, Rotten, I think I like where you're going.

35:45.000 --> 35:49.240
You're saying maybe developers could take advantage of that open source ecosystem.

35:49.240 --> 35:56.560
Yeah, I was just saying, like, if the game developers decided to use Wine as the platform

35:56.560 --> 36:00.800
instead of using something that's, you know, the Eon thing or making their own.

36:00.800 --> 36:03.640
If they used Wine, they could actually be helping Wine in general.

36:03.640 --> 36:09.080
So even other apps that are not gaming apps could be benefiting from the completion stuff

36:09.080 --> 36:11.840
that they're fixing for their stuff on Wine.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.000
Yeah, that's kind of what I was saying.

36:14.000 --> 36:18.160
Like a Photoshop or something could be at some point usable because Wine would be so

36:18.160 --> 36:27.240
far, you know, expanded on, you know, DirectX or OpenGL or whatever.

36:27.240 --> 36:31.040
So Riley, go ahead on, maybe you think they took the wrong approach, I'd like to hear

36:31.040 --> 36:32.040
your thoughts on that.

36:32.040 --> 36:37.400
Yeah, my main issue with all this is how people discovered it because they didn't, like, originally

36:37.400 --> 36:41.160
say it was a wrapper and said, oh, hey, here's a bonus for it.

36:41.160 --> 36:45.760
And by the way, it's going to be this amount of money, but it ran horrible and it took

36:45.760 --> 36:50.120
people, like, having to, like, look at it to figure out it was a wrapper.

36:50.120 --> 36:54.280
You gotta be upfront about those things at first and make the people be more accepting

36:54.280 --> 36:55.280
about it.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.120
That was the position I took on the Linux Action Show, but then I started thinking about

36:58.120 --> 37:03.600
Liam's point about creating a bad reputation for Linux gaming and then I thought, you know,

37:03.600 --> 37:06.400
geez, if you're putting it right there in bold letters in the description, this is a

37:06.400 --> 37:11.140
wrapped game, it's almost like you're screaming attention to the fact that the games on Linux

37:11.140 --> 37:13.520
are a bit of a second-class citizen in some cases.

37:13.520 --> 37:17.120
So I do, as a buyer, I want the disclosure.

37:17.120 --> 37:21.680
As somebody who wants to see Linux advance as a gaming platform, I'm not so sure I want

37:21.680 --> 37:25.560
our games branded with their weaknesses necessarily.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.720
Is that one screwed up thing or what?

37:27.720 --> 37:29.240
It's the way they brand it.

37:29.240 --> 37:33.720
Like if you branded it with, you know, it's a wrapped game or something like that, it

37:33.720 --> 37:34.720
would be bad.

37:34.720 --> 37:39.340
But what if you said, you know, wine enabled or powered by wine or something like that?

37:39.340 --> 37:43.500
People who know what that means would recognize that, but it wouldn't have some kind of stigma

37:43.500 --> 37:44.500
attached to it.

37:44.500 --> 37:52.120
It would be nice if wine carried a cache that was like, powered by wine, oh wow, this game

37:52.120 --> 37:53.120
is powered by wine.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.120
Oh, that's interesting.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.560
It will probably work on my system.

37:55.560 --> 38:01.400
Not powered by wine, oh crap, it's a nasty port that's just, you know, the women's version.

38:01.400 --> 38:04.520
Right, it becomes a brand you almost want to be associated with.

38:04.520 --> 38:07.960
And Colonel Linux, I think that's sort of what Colonel Linux is trying to get at is

38:07.960 --> 38:14.040
he's, I'm not positive, but I suspect he thinks that rappers make games look like Linux was

38:14.040 --> 38:15.040
an afterthought.

38:15.040 --> 38:21.480
Well, so my thought, so here's the thing is let's not forget what wine is.

38:21.480 --> 38:26.520
Wine exists so that we can run Windows software on Linux.

38:26.520 --> 38:30.440
It's not, when you say something like powered by wine, it's not like it's some sort of,

38:30.440 --> 38:35.880
you know, fancy game engine that was developed to give an advantage to gamers, even though,

38:35.880 --> 38:39.360
like you were saying, in certain use case scenarios, that seems to be how it works out.

38:39.360 --> 38:43.200
But the reality of it is it's a compromise.

38:43.200 --> 38:47.120
It's developers use it because they don't actually want to commit to Linux and that

38:47.120 --> 38:48.120
bothers them.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.120
Well, what about like...

38:49.120 --> 38:51.160
No, that's not true.

38:51.160 --> 38:56.240
Wine exactly is something that empowers Linux users to run software that wasn't written

38:56.240 --> 38:57.240
for their platform.

38:57.240 --> 38:59.240
It's a brilliant piece of software.

38:59.240 --> 39:00.240
It's still a hack job, though.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.240
It's still a hack job.

39:01.240 --> 39:07.280
No, but it needs to be continued, that's why the more work we put into wine, the better

39:07.280 --> 39:08.280
it gets.

39:08.280 --> 39:12.480
And like, for example, the gaming thing, well, yeah, it's an afterthought, but it already

39:12.480 --> 39:13.680
is an afterthought.

39:13.680 --> 39:18.240
That's why wine makes it possible to make that afterthought a reality.

39:18.240 --> 39:22.480
Yeah, and maybe you couldn't have wine be like this prestigious brand, but you might

39:22.480 --> 39:26.560
be able to have a pretty good reputation, I mean, just look at DOSBox.

39:26.560 --> 39:31.480
Like when you hear good old games are selling a game and it ships in DOSBox, your first

39:31.480 --> 39:34.320
thought is, oh, well, I know that's probably just going to work flawlessly because DOSBox

39:34.320 --> 39:35.680
just handles that for me.

39:35.680 --> 39:39.480
And wine could get to that point, I think, where wine has a right, oh, it ships with

39:39.480 --> 39:40.480
wine.

39:40.480 --> 39:42.160
Well, I mean, I know that's not native, but I know because it ships with wine, it's just

39:42.160 --> 39:46.600
going to work flawlessly, just like we think about DOSBox games now.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.800
I'd rather have an afterthought than no thought.

39:48.800 --> 39:49.800
Go ahead.

39:49.800 --> 39:50.800
Exactly.

39:50.800 --> 39:51.800
Go ahead, Colonel.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.880
And I don't disagree with...

39:53.880 --> 39:54.880
I'm glad.

39:54.880 --> 39:55.880
Don't get me wrong.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.600
I'm very happy that the wine project exists.

39:57.600 --> 40:01.240
I think they do a lot of good and I think it works very, very well in a lot of cases.

40:01.240 --> 40:08.160
What I'm getting at is that the mentality behind the reason wine exists is because,

40:08.160 --> 40:10.640
I mean, at the end of the day, wouldn't it be better if...

40:10.640 --> 40:13.920
And I'm not saying that this would happen, but wouldn't it be better if developers said,

40:13.920 --> 40:20.320
we're going to develop for Linux because that's the open platform and that's where we see

40:20.320 --> 40:21.320
our development.

40:21.320 --> 40:24.440
And so I'm glad that wine exists, but I still feel like it's a compromise.

40:24.440 --> 40:32.400
Right, I agree with you, Colonel, that that would be an amazing thing if we lived on that

40:32.400 --> 40:33.400
planet, but we don't.

40:33.400 --> 40:37.640
We live on planet Earth where developers don't see that as their primary goal.

40:37.640 --> 40:41.760
Their primary goal is to get as many people buying their software as possible.

40:41.760 --> 40:49.560
And if that means getting it onto people's machines via a shim, a layer that enables

40:49.560 --> 40:54.800
them to do minimal effort in order to deliver it to as many people as possible, then well

40:54.800 --> 40:55.800
done then.

40:55.800 --> 40:57.760
Well, and that's how a lot of software development is done too.

40:57.760 --> 41:02.940
I mean, let's look at a lot of platforms like Android, there's layers of it.

41:02.940 --> 41:06.840
And I think too, I see it as a transitional thing because I think like Pope is saying,

41:06.840 --> 41:12.840
we do live in the world right now where it's suicide if you only targeted Linux as a large

41:12.840 --> 41:13.840
gaming shop.

41:13.840 --> 41:16.560
It might work as an indie, but as a large gaming shop, you'd literally have to shut

41:16.560 --> 41:17.560
the doors.

41:17.560 --> 41:22.240
So you can understand their business perspective of it, but it doesn't mean that maybe that

41:22.240 --> 41:24.600
will be the case in 10 years.

41:24.600 --> 41:29.980
I mean, we're looking at this, we look at this in a very, maybe occasionally at a five

41:29.980 --> 41:34.240
year perspective, but the reality is, is that unlike a commercial operating system like

41:34.240 --> 41:40.640
Windows or Mac OS X, there is a much longer curve potential for Linux.

41:40.640 --> 41:43.860
And five, 10 years could be short term for Linux desktop.

41:43.860 --> 41:45.800
That could be, who knows?

41:45.800 --> 41:48.300
So who knows what it's going to look like in five, 10 years, maybe it'll be the other

41:48.300 --> 41:49.300
way around.

41:49.300 --> 41:53.000
Maybe there'll be some sort of shim that people are using to run GL games on top of Windows

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
properly.

41:54.000 --> 41:57.720
We'll just have to find out, but yeah, I don't like the precedent.

41:57.720 --> 42:02.040
I don't want to set the reputation because I don't want Linux to get in the spot where

42:02.040 --> 42:07.320
the Mac is right now, where the drivers aren't so hot, which is the fact that Linux drivers

42:07.320 --> 42:08.320
are already better.

42:08.320 --> 42:09.320
But it won't.

42:09.320 --> 42:15.960
If you look at, if you look at Steam now, compared to Steam, Steam to where it was two

42:15.960 --> 42:17.760
years ago, where there was Windows and Mac, right?

42:17.760 --> 42:25.200
Then along came Linux and Valve made a big thing about being available on the Linux desktop.

42:25.200 --> 42:31.000
And now it's pretty obvious that the whole reason for that was a stepping stone towards

42:31.000 --> 42:32.000
Steam OS.

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
In fact, if you look at, if you look at Steam now and you look at the categories of applications

42:37.000 --> 42:44.920
available in Steam, there is Windows, Mac, and the last category is Steam OS plus Linux.

42:44.920 --> 42:51.160
So it's quite clear that Linux is seen as a primary goal for Valve and they are pushing

42:51.160 --> 42:53.280
it to developers as much as they can.

42:53.280 --> 42:59.680
So I don't see OS X, Linux becoming anywhere near like OS X.

42:59.680 --> 43:00.680
That's the difference.

43:00.680 --> 43:01.680
Yeah.

43:01.680 --> 43:02.680
Yeah.

43:02.680 --> 43:03.680
You nailed it.

43:03.680 --> 43:04.680
Exactly.

43:04.680 --> 43:05.680
That's exactly it.

43:05.680 --> 43:06.680
That's exactly how I see it too.

43:06.680 --> 43:08.560
It's a much more serious platform for Valve.

43:08.560 --> 43:13.720
And it's because of that long tail where, this sounds so corny, but it's literally the

43:13.720 --> 43:19.400
advantage of basing your platform and product around Linux is in your, in a very real sense,

43:19.400 --> 43:24.080
you get to dictate the future of your own product where when they're attached to Windows,

43:24.080 --> 43:28.300
they're attached to whatever the crazy shenanigans Microsoft wants to pull off.

43:28.300 --> 43:31.840
And that was just, that was long-term, it's not viable for them.

43:31.840 --> 43:32.840
And it would make sense.

43:32.840 --> 43:34.320
I mean, could you imagine?

43:34.320 --> 43:38.240
If I was, if I was Gabe, man, I would be up at night worried about what's going to happen

43:38.240 --> 43:41.920
to Microsoft and Windows because that's where all my money's coming from.

43:41.920 --> 43:44.600
So of course I'd want to take that under my own control.

43:44.600 --> 43:45.800
I think he wasn't.

43:45.800 --> 43:50.000
That's why we're looking at Steam OS and Linux ports of all the games.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.000
Right.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Yep.

43:52.000 --> 43:53.000
Yeah, exactly.

43:53.000 --> 43:56.040
And so I think that's why I'm not as worried about these kinds of shims now because I don't

43:56.040 --> 43:58.840
think we're going to get stuck in Mac land for exactly the reasons Popey just said.

43:58.840 --> 43:59.840
So that, our friends.

43:59.840 --> 44:00.840
That's loud.

44:00.840 --> 44:04.720
Woo, that's loud, woo, that's our Valve update.

44:04.720 --> 44:08.640
Oh, oh, boy, did you feel that one, Matt?

44:08.640 --> 44:09.640
Could you feel that Valve update?

44:09.640 --> 44:10.640
Oh, man.

44:10.640 --> 44:11.640
I felt that clear down here.

44:11.640 --> 44:12.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:12.640 --> 44:13.640
Well, okay.

44:13.640 --> 44:17.240
So, Liam, thank you very much for joining us.

44:17.240 --> 44:21.560
You, my friend, are welcome to not only stay for the rest of the show, but join us anytime.

44:21.560 --> 44:24.280
I know it's a little late where you're at, but join us anytime.

44:24.280 --> 44:28.340
The Mumble Room's open and we'd love to have your input.

44:28.340 --> 44:32.160
And keep up the great work at Gaming on Linux and the writing for Linux Voice as well.

44:32.160 --> 44:36.800
We'll have links to those Twitter feeds in the show notes if folks want to check out

44:36.800 --> 44:38.440
Liam and Gaming on Linux.

44:38.440 --> 44:43.000
So all right, I have a big announcement to make.

44:43.000 --> 44:49.480
So everybody knows that we've been working on a show, another Linux show, How to Linux.

44:49.480 --> 44:53.280
And so that is not what I'm going to talk about today.

44:53.280 --> 44:56.960
That's very close though, too, so it's very, very close.

44:56.960 --> 45:02.200
I check the site often next week, potentially, if everything goes as planned, but maybe the

45:02.200 --> 45:03.200
week after.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.320
Who knows?

45:04.320 --> 45:05.800
How to Linux is very close though.

45:05.800 --> 45:09.040
But I'm going to tell you about something else I'm doing.

45:09.040 --> 45:15.520
Another show that has been, it's been on my mind since we canceled Jupiter at Night.

45:15.520 --> 45:19.080
And Jupiter at Night, if you're not familiar, because it was a long time ago and not a lot

45:19.080 --> 45:20.080
of people watched it.

45:20.080 --> 45:22.920
One of the reasons why we canceled it.

45:22.920 --> 45:27.280
It was a nightly show every night except for Fridays.

45:27.280 --> 45:29.680
And man, oh man, is that a big commitment.

45:29.680 --> 45:31.760
But I like the idea of it.

45:31.760 --> 45:35.160
I've always liked the idea of doing a daily show.

45:35.160 --> 45:38.480
And I like the idea of doing a daily tech show.

45:38.480 --> 45:41.760
Because I think a lot of you guys know, especially if you've listened to the back catalog of

45:41.760 --> 45:47.500
Linux Unplugged, I'm not super happy with the state of journalism, specifically in the

45:47.500 --> 45:49.000
open source and Linux arenas.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.200
I think it's pretty crap.

45:51.200 --> 45:55.280
And I think the journalism that I do like, there's daily tech shows out there I respect

45:55.280 --> 46:00.440
a lot like Tom Merritt's daily tech new show.

46:00.440 --> 46:02.880
He's a really good show.

46:02.880 --> 46:03.880
And he does it on his own.

46:03.880 --> 46:05.840
He's funded through Patreon.

46:05.840 --> 46:07.240
And I have a lot of respect for his work.

46:07.240 --> 46:14.840
But even in that case, even in Tom's case where he has a really good show, I don't want

46:14.840 --> 46:19.480
to offend people, but there's sometimes a valley bias when you're in the valley.

46:19.480 --> 46:21.460
And there's a Google and Apple bias.

46:21.460 --> 46:27.640
And all of these networks have tech shows, but they're looking at them from the perspective

46:27.640 --> 46:32.040
of a Mac user or a Google advocate or a Windows user.

46:32.040 --> 46:35.680
There's nobody that's looking at it that is thinking about things in terms of open source,

46:35.680 --> 46:36.680
in terms of community.

46:36.680 --> 46:42.500
And a lot of times, a lot of times what drives me so crazy is they'll be covering and talking

46:42.500 --> 46:45.520
about a technology that's already existed in open source for years and they have no

46:45.520 --> 46:47.600
idea it even exists.

46:47.600 --> 46:49.240
Because it's just not on their radar.

46:49.240 --> 46:50.720
And it's not giving it fair coverage.

46:50.720 --> 46:59.680
So I was thinking about a daily show that would start next week called Tech Talk Today.

46:59.680 --> 47:05.520
Monday through Thursday at 9 a.m. Pacific, noon Eastern, 7 p.m. GMT, we'll do a daily

47:05.520 --> 47:06.600
show Monday through Thursday.

47:06.600 --> 47:10.360
And that'll be just sort of kicking off the day, the broadcast day at J.B. one every single

47:10.360 --> 47:11.360
day.

47:11.360 --> 47:13.840
Release for download a little bit later.

47:13.840 --> 47:19.200
We picked 9 a.m. because it gives you, there's sort of a lull between online streams at that

47:19.200 --> 47:21.200
time of other morning shows.

47:21.200 --> 47:23.600
It also means on the East Coast, it'll be lunchtime.

47:23.600 --> 47:25.880
So people might be able to join us during their lunch break.

47:25.880 --> 47:29.800
And I think we can also then get the show out in time for people's commute.

47:29.800 --> 47:33.960
And it'll be 7 p.m. GMT so folks over there can maybe listen after dinner.

47:33.960 --> 47:37.520
So I think that's going to be, it's really an experiment.

47:37.520 --> 47:39.600
I mean, because a daily show is a lifestyle.

47:39.600 --> 47:41.560
It's a huge commitment.

47:41.560 --> 47:42.560
It really is.

47:42.560 --> 47:43.560
It's crazy.

47:43.560 --> 47:47.320
And what I want to do is I want to have a rotating cast of friends who join me.

47:47.320 --> 47:52.120
I mean, sometimes I might just do it solo, but I want to have something where we get

47:52.120 --> 47:57.340
to hear from different voices, from our hosts, from folks on Mumble.

47:57.340 --> 48:01.280
And I would even love to have, yes, yes, yeah, I see you're starting to, now you see where

48:01.280 --> 48:02.280
I was going earlier, aren't you?

48:02.280 --> 48:03.280
Yeah.

48:03.280 --> 48:06.080
Yes, because I was doing a little teasing on the pre-show.

48:06.080 --> 48:09.520
And I know this one, this last one might be crazy, but gosh, it'd be fun to even sometimes

48:09.520 --> 48:10.520
have people in studio.

48:10.520 --> 48:14.880
I mean, obviously I'll have Ange and Chase in studio from time to time and those kinds

48:14.880 --> 48:15.880
of things.

48:15.880 --> 48:18.240
And, you know, obviously could call Matt on Skype.

48:18.240 --> 48:20.080
So we'll do all our regulars.

48:20.080 --> 48:22.400
I'd love to have some folks in studio.

48:22.400 --> 48:26.880
And it's going to be, because it is daily, it's going to kind of allow for the show to

48:26.880 --> 48:28.160
meander a bit.

48:28.160 --> 48:30.400
And I want to kind of underscore something.

48:30.400 --> 48:31.880
It's not going to be just the tech news headlines.

48:31.880 --> 48:35.320
I mean, it's going to, a lot of times it'll be a topic and discussion derived from the

48:35.320 --> 48:40.420
tech news of the day, looked at through the perspective of a Linux and open source user.

48:40.420 --> 48:43.860
And not like it's going to be heavily biased in one direction, but it's going to at least

48:43.860 --> 48:48.280
that perspective will at least be considered when these topics are discussed.

48:48.280 --> 48:52.760
And I think sometimes that can provide a special kind of insight that gets missed in the daily

48:52.760 --> 48:53.760
analysis.

48:53.760 --> 48:55.600
So the show is going to be able to do that on a day to day basis.

48:55.600 --> 48:57.320
I'm going to be honest with you guys though.

48:57.320 --> 48:58.320
This is going to be my show.

48:58.320 --> 48:59.320
Okay.

48:59.320 --> 49:00.360
This is just going to be something I'm doing.

49:00.360 --> 49:03.680
And sometimes when there's not a lot going on, I might talk about barbecue.

49:03.680 --> 49:06.920
I mean, really, this is going to be, when you're doing a daily show, huh?

49:06.920 --> 49:07.920
Yum.

49:07.920 --> 49:08.920
Yeah.

49:08.920 --> 49:09.920
I know, right?

49:09.920 --> 49:10.920
Yeah.

49:10.920 --> 49:11.920
I mean, that might be okay.

49:11.920 --> 49:12.920
Right.

49:12.920 --> 49:17.120
I don't know if all the details totally worked out yet because you know, like one of the

49:17.120 --> 49:22.480
things we're considering doing is maybe having a, I don't know, it might not be, well, I

49:22.480 --> 49:23.760
don't know if it's going to be video yet.

49:23.760 --> 49:28.080
I'm still working that out because we can do a lot quicker turnaround if it's audio only,

49:28.080 --> 49:32.440
but I have a feeling we'll do video so that way we can put it up on YouTube and stuff

49:32.440 --> 49:33.440
like that.

49:33.440 --> 49:35.040
So it'll probably be video and audio.

49:35.040 --> 49:38.040
It'll be audio focused though so that way we can do quick turnaround.

49:38.040 --> 49:42.820
The daily format, you know, what I kind of am envisioning is we're going to do a discussion.

49:42.820 --> 49:45.560
We'll have at the beginning talk about one or two big topics.

49:45.560 --> 49:49.520
Essentially, instead of hitting you with all the stupid crap, we'll just talk about the

49:49.520 --> 49:53.840
one or two stories that actually matter that day, have a little discussion around them,

49:53.840 --> 49:57.280
and then take mumble, feedback, and calls towards the latter half of the show.

49:57.280 --> 50:02.840
I've also got some plans I'll talk more about in the show for the days I can't make it so

50:02.840 --> 50:04.080
that we will still have a broadcast.

50:04.080 --> 50:10.280
I've got something kind of fun planned there that I, that longtime fans might recognize

50:10.280 --> 50:12.320
that I've wanted to do for a while too.

50:12.320 --> 50:15.800
So we've even got kind of a good filler for the days where maybe for some reason I can't

50:15.800 --> 50:19.240
actually get in the studio and do a show that morning because, man, 9 a.m. is early.

50:19.240 --> 50:20.640
I mean, let's just be honest.

50:20.640 --> 50:23.520
I was actually, the first time I thought about it, I was like, should I do it at 6 a.m.?

50:23.520 --> 50:24.520
Nope, nope.

50:24.520 --> 50:25.520
Take that right off the table.

50:25.520 --> 50:26.520
I can't do it at 6 a.m.

50:26.520 --> 50:31.840
So here's kind of the second big shoe that drops on this.

50:31.840 --> 50:35.440
There's going to be advertising maybe.

50:35.440 --> 50:39.520
I'm thinking about maybe doing, I don't know, it depends on if advertisers are interested.

50:39.520 --> 50:43.280
I was also considering making a community spot where maybe we could do a discounted

50:43.280 --> 50:46.280
community ad for something going on out there or a distribution.

50:46.280 --> 50:47.280
I don't know.

50:47.280 --> 50:48.280
I don't know.

50:48.280 --> 50:50.680
It will depend on sponsor interest because one of the other things I think I want to

50:50.680 --> 50:55.080
do is I think I'm going to make this a Patreon funded show.

50:55.080 --> 51:00.280
And it's more than just about the show on Patreon.

51:00.280 --> 51:02.080
And we might base the funding on a certain level.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.080
There won't be any sponsorship.

51:03.080 --> 51:05.160
It will be ad free.

51:05.160 --> 51:10.640
But what I want to do is I want to create a funding source for the network.

51:10.640 --> 51:16.200
So essentially this Patreon that I'll be setting up will be a general fund that the revenue

51:16.200 --> 51:22.660
from that fund will go into the JB1 Studio, upgrades, facility upgrades, hardware.

51:22.660 --> 51:27.940
And it'll be a way for the community to use Patreon to fund the Jupiter Broadcasting Network,

51:27.940 --> 51:33.240
help our growth because we are, you know, we have exceedingly new, higher new expenses.

51:33.240 --> 51:37.920
I mean just from where we went from moving to JB1, recording out of my house to a dedicated

51:37.920 --> 51:40.480
townhouse with staff and new equipment.

51:40.480 --> 51:43.120
I mean it's just our expenses are beyond what they've ever been.

51:43.120 --> 51:45.240
We knew that would happen.

51:45.240 --> 51:50.840
But the question I have to ask myself is do I want to press more on the advertising side

51:50.840 --> 51:55.000
or do I want to experiment with Patreon because like I said this show itself is a grand experiment.

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
I mean a daily show.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.000
I don't know.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.000
Can I do it?

51:58.000 --> 52:02.120
Can I fund future developments of the network through a Patreon model and as a thank you

52:02.120 --> 52:05.920
we create a daily show and we create an exclusive club of folks who are supporting us through

52:05.920 --> 52:10.520
Patreon and we'll set milestones up so you'll know what things we bring into the studio,

52:10.520 --> 52:15.700
what the different milestones get us and I also want to see if we can do things like

52:15.700 --> 52:20.360
potentially get the funding to a level where I could finally go on the road and do a road

52:20.360 --> 52:21.360
show.

52:21.360 --> 52:24.740
I've been talking about taking shows on the road for over a year now.

52:24.740 --> 52:30.280
The problem is we need a good financial position to be able to stand on and right now I'm really

52:30.280 --> 52:34.240
comfortable with our advertising model because we have a very small select of advertisers

52:34.240 --> 52:41.000
that we genuinely all of the hosts really love and we're happy to talk about and I feel

52:41.000 --> 52:45.960
like right now we have a good balance between content and ads and I don't, I'm not totally

52:45.960 --> 52:50.800
opposed to adding more ads, adding more ads, but I think maybe the better route to go is

52:50.800 --> 52:54.320
through the Patreon system because it has been a smashing success for Unfiltered.

52:54.320 --> 52:59.800
People have switched over to love it because the financing is right up in front and center.

52:59.800 --> 53:01.600
You know, just like a Kickstarter project.

53:01.600 --> 53:02.600
It's right there.

53:02.600 --> 53:03.600
You can see where we're at.

53:03.600 --> 53:04.600
You see what our milestones are.

53:04.600 --> 53:06.840
You see once we reach each milestone, what we get.

53:06.840 --> 53:11.000
There's a content distribution system built in just for folks who are patrons so we can

53:11.000 --> 53:14.720
have exclusive content through this portal for them.

53:14.720 --> 53:15.720
It's a really cool system.

53:15.720 --> 53:20.360
If you want to see it, how we do it for Unfiltered, just go to patreon.com slash Unfiltered and

53:20.360 --> 53:23.820
right now through Patreon, let me see, you know, I'll pull it up on the screen right

53:23.820 --> 53:29.320
now because I think we're over $2,000 now getting raised on Patreon for Unfiltered,

53:29.320 --> 53:34.360
which to me, this is a huge, cause you know, this is, this is going to fundamentally change

53:34.360 --> 53:39.800
independent media production because it really makes the show accountable to the audience.

53:39.800 --> 53:43.960
When you have a crowdfunded show like this, it's no longer picking the content that gets

53:43.960 --> 53:48.720
the most clicks that then generates the highest numbers for advertisers.

53:48.720 --> 53:53.400
It's about generating content that makes that 181 people happy.

53:53.400 --> 53:57.840
Think about the difference in content creation when you're trying to make 181 people happy

53:57.840 --> 54:03.000
versus as many fricking clicks as you can get so that way you can charge advertisers.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.340
That changes the fundamental recipe of a show and I want to apply that to a daily show where

54:08.340 --> 54:12.440
we talk about tech, we talk about news from a Linux and open source perspective and that

54:12.440 --> 54:16.360
money is used to fund the future growth of Jupiter Broadcasting.

54:16.360 --> 54:20.000
I don't know if it's possible, like I said, it's an experiment and I want to start it

54:20.000 --> 54:21.000
on Monday.

54:21.000 --> 54:25.040
So that's really soon cause you know, it's something we've been thinking about for a

54:25.040 --> 54:28.760
long time but to actually pull the trigger on a daily show like that, I don't know if

54:28.760 --> 54:30.240
I can do it but I'm going to give it a go.

54:30.240 --> 54:31.240
I am excited about it.

54:31.240 --> 54:32.240
Yeah.

54:32.240 --> 54:35.560
How long would this show be?

54:35.560 --> 54:39.240
About 15 to 30 minutes depending on the topic of the day.

54:39.240 --> 54:43.080
And would it be only working weekday or weekends as well?

54:43.080 --> 54:44.080
Monday through Thursday.

54:44.080 --> 54:48.080
Ah, so the American definition of the day.

54:48.080 --> 54:49.080
Well I hate working on it.

54:49.080 --> 54:50.080
The daily show.

54:50.080 --> 54:51.080
The daily show definition.

54:51.080 --> 54:55.040
Essentially what it is cause Fridays are all packed with like behind the scenes business

54:55.040 --> 54:58.960
stuff that I need to be off air for, you know, like phone calls and emails and stuff like

54:58.960 --> 54:59.960
that.

54:59.960 --> 55:02.480
I have to say this is the first I've heard of it and it sounds brilliant.

55:02.480 --> 55:03.480
Thank you.

55:03.480 --> 55:04.480
Yeah.

55:04.480 --> 55:06.480
Well I wanted to invite you on the Monday show as my co-host.

55:06.480 --> 55:08.240
Oh, oh hang on.

55:08.240 --> 55:09.240
I know, I know.

55:09.240 --> 55:12.240
I'm just bringing it to you on you on the air but that was my attention cause I want

55:12.240 --> 55:16.320
to, you know, we have great discussions in the mumble room and, and, and you'll be one

55:16.320 --> 55:22.240
of many that I want to pull in and just have a one off really casual, I mean this show

55:22.240 --> 55:24.480
is going to be extremely low key.

55:24.480 --> 55:26.640
It's something that you'll be able to pop in.

55:26.640 --> 55:28.420
You're not going to get hit in the face too hard.

55:28.420 --> 55:30.920
It's going to like, if you had a long day, you can drive home to it.

55:30.920 --> 55:33.000
If you're getting ready in the morning, you can listen to it.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.660
It's not actually, to be honest, it might be a tad offensive sometimes cause I was thinking

55:36.660 --> 55:40.880
about just being brutally honest about stuff, not holding anything back.

55:40.880 --> 55:41.880
But like, uh.

55:41.880 --> 55:42.880
I'd prefer it.

55:42.880 --> 55:43.880
I think that'd be the way to go.

55:43.880 --> 55:44.880
Yeah.

55:44.880 --> 55:45.880
You know.

55:45.880 --> 55:46.880
Yeah.

55:46.880 --> 55:52.360
Like being more relaxed and just shooting the breeze, but being very tight and having

55:52.360 --> 55:53.360
a focus.

55:53.360 --> 55:54.360
I like the sound of that.

55:54.360 --> 55:55.360
Yeah.

55:55.360 --> 55:58.080
And it's also, it's going to be a great way for folks who like, you guys know, we have

55:58.080 --> 56:01.640
a bunch of shows on the network, but you know, you don't always have time to listen to every

56:01.640 --> 56:02.640
single one.

56:02.640 --> 56:05.840
So in a sense, it'll be a network show too, where I can say, Hey, you know, this week

56:05.840 --> 56:10.520
on BSD now, they interviewed one of the co-founders and co-creators of ZFS.

56:10.520 --> 56:13.520
So if you're interested in ZFS, you might want to tune in this week's like we can give

56:13.520 --> 56:14.640
mentions to that kind of stuff.

56:14.640 --> 56:19.240
So people who will have essentially a master Jupiter broadcasting feed to get updated on

56:19.240 --> 56:20.640
that kind of stuff.

56:20.640 --> 56:22.200
So I'm, I don't know.

56:22.200 --> 56:26.160
I mean, I told myself when I stopped doing Jupiter at night, if I ever started doing

56:26.160 --> 56:29.000
a daily show again, I'd have to like really commit to it.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.960
So we're calling it tech talk today, tech talk today, TTT.

56:32.960 --> 56:35.600
And I've already registered tech talk dot today.

56:35.600 --> 56:38.320
So I mean, that seems like a done deal because I got dot today.

56:38.320 --> 56:41.040
It's like, okay, that's the name.

56:41.040 --> 56:42.040
Dot today.

56:42.040 --> 56:43.040
Yeah.

56:43.040 --> 56:44.040
Yeah.

56:44.040 --> 56:45.040
So anyways.

56:45.040 --> 56:46.040
Yeah.

56:46.040 --> 56:47.040
Hmm.

56:47.040 --> 56:48.040
Marinade on that poppy.

56:48.040 --> 56:50.840
I'd love to have you join me and we'll set up times with folks in the mumble room and

56:50.840 --> 56:52.360
you guys can come on there at Colonel Linux.

56:52.360 --> 56:56.480
I'm looking at you as potentially another one and get Ick on there as well and rotten.

56:56.480 --> 56:59.600
And now of course, I'll, you know, a bunch of people, it's just as, as time goes on and

56:59.600 --> 57:02.360
we have good conversations in the mumble room, I might pull people aside and say, Hey, do

57:02.360 --> 57:03.360
you have some time?

57:03.360 --> 57:07.500
The other thing that's cool about it is, uh, we might like, you know, like Liam right now,

57:07.500 --> 57:08.500
it's late where he's at.

57:08.500 --> 57:12.640
Like I could maybe do something with him earlier in the day to help people across the pond

57:12.640 --> 57:18.000
who are staying up really late to chat with us at a two PM on a Pacific at Pacific time.

57:18.000 --> 57:21.600
So I think it's going to give us an opportunity to also pull in folks from the other side

57:21.600 --> 57:23.040
to get another perspective on things.

57:23.040 --> 57:24.760
I'm looking really forward to that.

57:24.760 --> 57:28.560
Maybe get a few accents on the air from time to time instead of just my droll.

57:28.560 --> 57:31.480
I will warn you though, there's the times where I'd, you know, it's a daily show.

57:31.480 --> 57:33.000
I'd maybe just didn't have time to line somebody up.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.760
It might just be me complaining about something.

57:34.760 --> 57:35.760
Yeah.

57:35.760 --> 57:37.760
If you can't have poppy, I'll do his accent for you.

57:37.760 --> 57:38.760
Okay.

57:38.760 --> 57:43.400
As long as, as long as we can get a day of trying to get to Southern accents.

57:43.400 --> 57:44.400
Yeah.

57:44.400 --> 57:46.200
Or we could do Southern accents too.

57:46.200 --> 57:52.600
So I wouldn't, um, every day show be overwhelming and people will just stop watching it because

57:52.600 --> 57:55.040
it's every day and then just can't wash it.

57:55.040 --> 57:56.040
Yeah.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.040
No.

57:57.040 --> 57:59.720
I mean, that's going to happen for some people, but then for some people they won't be able

57:59.720 --> 58:00.720
to get enough.

58:00.720 --> 58:04.600
I think, I think it might be cool because he's talking about keeping it at, I don't

58:04.600 --> 58:08.360
think it'll be a problem because it's literally like you're doing it while you're washing

58:08.360 --> 58:09.360
dishes or something.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.080
I mean, it's really not a big time commitment.

58:11.080 --> 58:12.080
Yeah.

58:12.080 --> 58:13.080
So I don't think that'll be a problem.

58:13.080 --> 58:14.080
Yeah.

58:14.080 --> 58:15.080
You got another 20 minutes in your commute.

58:15.080 --> 58:17.960
You can round off your, your podcast listening with this show.

58:17.960 --> 58:24.440
I frequently find myself a loss to find, you know, interesting content to listen to.

58:24.440 --> 58:29.600
I'm not saying we'll fit that gap, but I hope it does.

58:29.600 --> 58:33.320
Actually that's literally what my goal with the show is just to have an interesting show

58:33.320 --> 58:34.320
every day.

58:34.320 --> 58:36.800
And there'll be some days where it's very tech focused, very Linux focused, and there'll

58:36.800 --> 58:40.920
be some days where maybe it's, you know, a little off the beaten path.

58:40.920 --> 58:43.920
But I think that's, what's kind of fun is to have a show where we have a little room

58:43.920 --> 58:48.480
to do that and see what comes of it and see who we meet in the community and all kinds

58:48.480 --> 58:49.480
of things.

58:49.480 --> 58:51.400
So I'm kind of looking forward to it.

58:51.400 --> 58:52.400
So it'll start on Monday.

58:52.400 --> 58:55.280
If I get all my ass together, which I better now that I've said something on the air tech

58:55.280 --> 58:58.340
talk today, starting next Monday, let's see.

58:58.340 --> 59:03.800
So if we're recording this on the 27th, that means June 2nd, first Monday of June.

59:03.800 --> 59:07.480
I'd love to have you guys join us live because I'm going to try to have the mumble room open

59:07.480 --> 59:08.480
too.

59:08.480 --> 59:12.560
So we can get a little bit of a morning call in effect going where I'll maybe set up a

59:12.560 --> 59:15.200
topic and then you guys can kick it around with me.

59:15.200 --> 59:16.200
Cool.

59:16.200 --> 59:17.200
Yeah.

59:17.200 --> 59:19.200
And eventually we'll go to 24-7 coverage.

59:19.200 --> 59:20.200
No.

59:20.200 --> 59:21.200
No.

59:21.200 --> 59:22.200
We'll see how far we get.

59:22.200 --> 59:23.440
Breaking news.

59:23.440 --> 59:29.080
I think I would be very happy and very proud if we could find a really cool way to fund

59:29.080 --> 59:33.680
the network, give you guys a new show, make something that's truly independent media while

59:33.680 --> 59:34.680
doing it.

59:34.680 --> 59:39.240
I mean, I'm loving the potential of it and I know Patreon is a new thing.

59:39.240 --> 59:40.360
It's going to be a new system.

59:40.360 --> 59:42.280
Some people have to go create accounts.

59:42.280 --> 59:43.280
Trust me.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.280
I've been doing it for a few months now.

59:44.280 --> 59:45.280
It's a really good system.

59:45.280 --> 59:46.280
I'm really excited.

59:46.280 --> 59:53.200
So join me on Monday, tech talk today live, 9 a.m. Pacific, 12 p.m. Eastern, 7 p.m. GMT.

59:53.200 --> 59:56.880
Let's see how it goes and give it some time because it's going to be a new show.

59:56.880 --> 59:58.520
We'll see.

59:58.520 --> 59:59.520
But I want to hear your feedback too.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.680
And I'll set up email addresses and all that kind of stuff soon as well.

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.680
All right.

01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:06.280
Well, that's all I had for this week on the Linux Unplugged show.

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:10.160
Some announcements, some discussion, pretty good show overall.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:15.360
And we have some really good interviews coming up on both Unplugged and LAS.

01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.240
If all the timing works out, I'll talk about it a little bit in the post show just so that

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.000
way I don't commit anybody to something they can't make on air.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.400
But join us on Sunday for a really good interview about an up and coming distribution that a

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.240
few of you have written in about and asked about and we're going to talk with the developers

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.840
and we'll have a follow-up interview of it.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:33.840
All the timing works out.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.480
We're still trying to get it scheduled in Tuesday's Unplugged.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.840
So we've got a couple of back-to-back interviews that I think you guys will particularly find

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:40.840
fascinating.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:41.840
So join us for that.

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:46.080
If you don't know, you can hang out live in our virtual lug or in our chat room over jblive.tv

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:48.520
on Tuesdays at 2 p.m. Pacific.

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:53.320
Just go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar where we have robots and in the background

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:58.640
they look it up on Wolfram Alpha and then they modify the HTML code in real time and

01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:01.800
post it on that Jupiter Broadcasting calendar site for you automatically.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.200
So you might as well go over there and take advantage of that because why else am I paying

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.880
all that money for those robots?

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.800
So jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get the show time in your local time zone

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:16.440
and then you can always join us live for the Linux action show on Sunday at 10 a.m. Pacific.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:17.600
And don't forget we want your feedback.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:20.720
Go over to jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.120
Choose Linux Unplugged from the drop down.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.680
I know, I know.

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.680
It's crazy.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.680
Send us your feedback.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:28.240
We'll read it on a future episode.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:32.760
Also hit up the subreddit linuxactionshow.reddit.com to integrate your links and feedback directly

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:33.760
into the community.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:34.760
It's like the pork.

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:35.760
All right, Matt.

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.400
Well, I'll see you on Sunday for a good Linux action show, okay?

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.400
All right.

01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:40.400
See you Sunday.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.400
All right, everyone.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:43.280
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:01:43.280 --> 01:02:10.400
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.
