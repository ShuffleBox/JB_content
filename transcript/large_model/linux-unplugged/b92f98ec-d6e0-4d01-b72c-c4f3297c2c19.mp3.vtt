WEBVTT

00:00.560 --> 00:02.080
Wes, what do you think?

00:02.080 --> 00:04.840
Nintendo and Super Nintendo,

00:04.840 --> 00:08.400
good game consoles or greatest game consoles ever?

00:08.400 --> 00:10.680
Here we are almost 30 years later

00:10.680 --> 00:13.520
and people are still remaking these games,

00:13.520 --> 00:14.360
replaying these games.

00:14.360 --> 00:16.080
We're watching right now on the live stream

00:16.080 --> 00:19.340
the automatic 3Dification of an NES game,

00:19.340 --> 00:21.760
which started out as a bit of a ruse

00:21.760 --> 00:23.960
because there's this April 1st conference

00:23.960 --> 00:25.540
where people have published fake research.

00:25.540 --> 00:26.720
It's been going on for years.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.660
And as usual, this guy over here,

00:28.660 --> 00:30.440
we got a link to the blog post.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.400
I think his name is Tom.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.600
He created an NES emulator

00:35.600 --> 00:39.880
that actually renders the NES game in legit 3D.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.760
So manual steps involved,

00:41.760 --> 00:44.400
but best game console or greatest?

00:44.400 --> 00:47.440
I'm just gonna throw my PlayStation 4 right out the window.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.480
What do I need it for when I can have this?

00:49.480 --> 00:52.200
VR v Schmar, I want this, exactly.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.040
Yeah, yeah.

00:54.000 --> 00:54.840
I mean, it does say something

00:54.840 --> 00:56.680
about the enduring value of these games.

00:56.680 --> 00:58.600
Yeah, you know what it tells you?

00:58.600 --> 01:00.960
You code something really well once

01:00.960 --> 01:03.200
and you make people love it and it sticks around.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.280
It's part of the culture forever.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.120
Yeah, it's almost open source by default.

01:06.120 --> 01:06.960
Yeah, exactly.

01:08.240 --> 01:13.240
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 194 for April 25th, 2017.

01:13.240 --> 01:27.240
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

01:27.240 --> 01:30.240
that's celebrating International Penguin Day.

01:30.240 --> 01:31.080
My name is Chris.

01:31.080 --> 01:31.920
My name is Wes.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.160
It really is legitimately.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.000
Well, that's great.

01:34.000 --> 01:34.840
I know, I'm very excited

01:34.840 --> 01:36.320
because we got a great show to celebrate.

01:36.320 --> 01:37.160
Yeah.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.000
Tux's birthday.

01:38.000 --> 01:38.840
It's officially Tux's birthday.

01:38.840 --> 01:39.680
Happy birthday, Tux.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.080
The mascot of Linux.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.800
Yeah, coming up on this week's episode,

01:42.800 --> 01:44.840
of the Unplugged program.

01:44.840 --> 01:47.560
I'm not gonna say we're gonna talk about System D.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.400
We're actually gonna talk about the total lack of System D.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.720
Yeah, but that's totally different.

01:50.720 --> 01:51.780
That is totally different

01:51.780 --> 01:53.240
and it's coming up at the end of the show.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.840
So if you have no interest,

01:54.840 --> 01:56.360
you'll be able to tune out before we get there.

01:56.360 --> 02:01.240
But first, the Linux Foundation has made

02:01.240 --> 02:05.480
their largest announcement in the history of the Foundation.

02:05.480 --> 02:06.400
Whoa.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.280
I'm not sure if a lot of people are talking about it.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.120
Yeah.

02:09.120 --> 02:13.520
But I actually have some exclusive footage

02:13.520 --> 02:15.520
that I've been sitting on for three weeks

02:15.520 --> 02:17.520
I wasn't allowed to tell you about.

02:17.520 --> 02:19.080
And I will play it for you today

02:19.080 --> 02:21.600
now that Linux Foundation has made their announcement.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.320
So that's coming up in the show.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.680
Plus, of course, we're gonna go through some updates

02:25.680 --> 02:28.640
on our favorite open source projects.

02:28.640 --> 02:33.120
And it turns out, I know a lot of you love it.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.680
I know it.

02:34.680 --> 02:36.880
But I got some bad news.

02:36.880 --> 02:41.360
Thunderbird is on the ropes and it's not coming from me.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.120
It's coming from the developers of the project.

02:43.120 --> 02:47.560
And it's really thanks to improvements coming to Firefox

02:47.560 --> 02:48.600
that robbed Thunderbird.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.320
So we'll be talking about what's all going on there

02:51.320 --> 02:53.520
and why you should actually care,

02:53.520 --> 02:55.120
even if you're not a Thunderbird user.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.080
And trust me, there are some reasons.

02:57.080 --> 03:00.480
Some drama going on with some Unity 8 ports.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.840
We're gonna clarify some announcements

03:02.840 --> 03:05.000
that were on the show last week.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.080
And big changes coming to Debian.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.520
But before we can get to any of that, Wes,

03:09.520 --> 03:10.880
we gotta bring in that mobile room.

03:10.880 --> 03:11.720
Heck yeah.

03:11.720 --> 03:14.160
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.000
Hello.

03:15.000 --> 03:15.840
Hey.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.240
Hello, hello.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.120
Hello, you know, you guys,

03:19.120 --> 03:21.400
I think if we practice a little bit after the show,

03:21.400 --> 03:23.120
we could make a pretty good singing group.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.440
Ooh. Sometimes they nail that.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.720
A little acapella up in here.

03:25.720 --> 03:26.560
That's what I was thinking, Wes.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.400
That sounds great.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.320
Yeah, just something we'll play with.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.160
Just something we'll play with.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.640
But that'll be after the show.

03:31.640 --> 03:32.920
Let's start with some news.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.360
Let's start with some updates.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.560
And I wanted to follow up on something

03:36.560 --> 03:38.320
that we started talking about last week.

03:38.320 --> 03:42.200
And we were literally just talking about it

03:42.200 --> 03:44.320
before I hit the go button on the show.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.480
And there's a group of Linux users.

03:46.480 --> 03:47.600
You might not be one of them, Wes.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.200
I'm not one of them.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.080
But there's definitely a group of Linux users now

03:51.080 --> 03:53.360
that are looking for replacements to Unity.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.520
They're coming from Unity,

03:54.520 --> 03:57.440
and they're looking for maybe another

03:57.440 --> 03:59.040
desktop environment to land on.

03:59.040 --> 04:01.040
Is it GNOME with some extensions?

04:01.040 --> 04:02.000
Is it Budgie?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Is it Plasma?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.120
Is it XFCE?

04:04.120 --> 04:04.960
Probably haven't looked in a while.

04:04.960 --> 04:06.360
There's a lot of options now.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.800
Yeah, and one of the things you might notice

04:08.800 --> 04:10.720
when you're making the transition

04:10.720 --> 04:14.320
is every now and then, things will look out of place.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.800
They won't look quite right.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.000
And it's nice if you can kind of smooth things out,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.600
make everything look like it belongs on the same desktop.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.160
And I don't know if it's just because

04:22.160 --> 04:23.800
of Canonical's announcement,

04:23.800 --> 04:25.880
but it seems like there's a lot of energy around GNOME.

04:25.880 --> 04:26.720
I agree, yeah.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.560
Themes.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.440
And I wanna just follow up on this one,

04:29.440 --> 04:30.480
which I thought was pretty great

04:30.480 --> 04:32.920
because it makes Qt apps, or Qt apps,

04:32.920 --> 04:35.520
feel at home on the GNOME desktop.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.720
It's Edwadia Qt.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.080
It's a theme that you can get

04:38.080 --> 04:40.080
for the Plasma desktop applications.

04:41.160 --> 04:43.760
And it will match the default GNOME theme.

04:43.760 --> 04:46.640
Now, I'm not gonna sit here and assume

04:46.640 --> 04:49.640
that you would run Edwadia like an animal.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.980
I am assuming you're probably running Arc.

04:51.980 --> 04:56.200
But if you're not, this could be very useful.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.520
Actually, even if I was on Arc or ArcDark,

04:58.520 --> 05:00.000
I would still like my Qt apps

05:00.000 --> 05:02.200
to look as close to a GNOME app as possible.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.040
Right, yeah.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.600
This is better than what they natively look like.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.560
Yeah, and a lot of folks do run Edwadia by default.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.080
I think they're insane, but they do it.

05:08.080 --> 05:09.320
Once you have it installed,

05:09.320 --> 05:12.040
you set it as the theme for your Qt apps.

05:12.040 --> 05:15.940
If you're on GNOME, you can run qt-config to do this.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.000
Or you could start the Qt app specifically

05:18.000 --> 05:21.880
on the command line with tax style space edwadia.

05:21.880 --> 05:22.840
And then I actually. I'm not gonna do that.

05:22.840 --> 05:23.800
No. I'm not gonna do that.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.000
No, but if you had like one Qt application

05:26.000 --> 05:27.480
and you wanna just add it to the desktop shortcut.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.080
Make an alias so you have a desktop shortcut,

05:29.080 --> 05:29.900
it would work well.

05:29.900 --> 05:30.840
Can I stop calling him Qt now?

05:30.840 --> 05:31.840
Can I just say Qt?

05:31.840 --> 05:33.120
Can we, is that okay?

05:33.120 --> 05:34.760
Can we, hey, a mumble room.

05:34.760 --> 05:35.760
Is anybody gonna get offended?

05:35.760 --> 05:37.000
Anybody in the mumble room gonna get triggered

05:37.000 --> 05:39.520
if I just refer to this as Qt application instead of Qt?

05:39.520 --> 05:40.440
Will everybody be okay?

05:40.440 --> 05:42.960
If anybody's gonna get triggered, say something.

05:42.960 --> 05:43.840
Go on once.

05:43.840 --> 05:44.680
Oh, go on.

05:44.680 --> 05:45.840
Monkey, you're gonna get triggered?

05:45.840 --> 05:46.660
No.

05:46.660 --> 05:47.500
Oh, dang.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.120
I was excited there for a second.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.220
What were you gonna say, monkey?

05:50.220 --> 05:51.680
What were you gonna say then?

05:51.680 --> 05:53.600
I was gonna say, I don't need my safe space.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.440
I'm good.

05:54.440 --> 05:56.440
Well, dang it.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.840
All right, well, there goes all the fun for this show.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.600
There goes all the clicks.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.160
Anyways, you can find a link to this in the show notes.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.480
I find this whole process to be really interesting.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.840
I think in all of this,

06:07.840 --> 06:10.360
I'm gonna end up switching back to GNOME myself.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.920
I've had a few people tweet me and ask me.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.480
I don't know why.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.160
I don't know why people seem to care.

06:15.160 --> 06:16.480
But yeah, I have been using Plasma

06:16.480 --> 06:18.080
on about half my machines.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.300
And I haven't switched over on a couple of systems.

06:21.300 --> 06:24.280
And I think on the systems, I have switched to Plasma.

06:24.280 --> 06:25.400
At least for a little while,

06:25.400 --> 06:27.500
I'm gonna switch back to GNOME.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.440
So gotta go full bore here.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.040
Well, I feel like most of the community is in a large way.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.600
I'm not trying to downplay Plasma or people that use it

06:34.600 --> 06:36.640
or the Neon Projects work or anything like that

06:36.640 --> 06:38.040
because I think those are all super relevant.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.200
In fact, after the dust settles,

06:40.200 --> 06:41.400
the Plasma desktop will probably be

06:41.400 --> 06:42.240
more important than ever.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.080
Yes, I think so.

06:43.080 --> 06:43.900
You're right, but.

06:43.900 --> 06:44.740
But right now, I wanna.

06:44.740 --> 06:45.760
Be part of the zeitgeist.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.120
Yeah, I just wanna,

06:47.120 --> 06:49.400
I've been running Plasma desktop for a while.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.160
One of the things I'm interested,

06:51.160 --> 06:52.800
going from Plasma back to GNOME,

06:52.800 --> 06:55.000
is if I'm gonna feel like it's slow as shit.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.480
The whole thing about GNOME,

06:57.480 --> 06:59.300
when I remember switching to Plasma,

06:59.300 --> 07:01.960
was that Kaywin felt like everything was lubricated.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.080
Butter smooth, I think you said.

07:03.080 --> 07:05.720
Just, yeah, everything just flew around on my desktop.

07:05.720 --> 07:08.800
Windows render, I could perceive how the Windows

07:08.800 --> 07:10.200
just moved better.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.760
And I've been doing some reading about that.

07:11.760 --> 07:12.840
Is it mutter?

07:12.840 --> 07:15.320
Because really, the GNOME Shell is like an extension

07:15.320 --> 07:16.860
that runs on top of mutter.

07:16.860 --> 07:18.280
GNOME Shell itself, in some ways,

07:18.280 --> 07:19.940
is like an extension that runs on mutter.

07:19.940 --> 07:20.800
And so is it mutter?

07:20.800 --> 07:21.640
Is that the problem?

07:21.640 --> 07:22.860
Is it JavaScript?

07:22.860 --> 07:26.080
Is GNOME Shell just stuffed full of JavaScript?

07:26.080 --> 07:27.320
And that's why it's so slow.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.720
And that's not really a fair characterization either.

07:29.720 --> 07:32.160
It's, there are some blocking things

07:32.160 --> 07:35.120
that make performance not as great as it should be.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.040
But I have to tell you,

07:38.040 --> 07:39.880
and I don't know if you recall,

07:39.880 --> 07:41.400
but last week when we had Aiki on the show,

07:41.400 --> 07:44.120
I said, hey, tell me about these patches you did

07:44.120 --> 07:45.680
that supposedly make mutter support

07:45.680 --> 07:47.120
the NVIDIA proprietary driver.

07:47.120 --> 07:47.960
Remember that?

07:47.960 --> 07:48.780
And he's like, oh yeah,

07:48.780 --> 07:50.560
that's just something Pharaonyx cares about.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.920
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.800
I wanna know.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.040
Well, so since that conversation with Aiki

07:56.040 --> 07:57.640
in the last week's show,

07:57.640 --> 08:00.480
I've been running Solus Gnome Edition

08:00.480 --> 08:04.560
on that Dell 7720.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.000
And it flies, man, it flies.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.760
And it feels like everything's faster

08:08.760 --> 08:09.720
and I don't understand why,

08:09.720 --> 08:13.080
because it feels like even the menus in Chrome are faster.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.440
Like when you click on the bookmarks bar

08:14.440 --> 08:17.040
and you drill down and you click on a bookmark,

08:17.040 --> 08:20.520
the way that shows up and fades away feels faster.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.680
The way that the rest of the desktop performs

08:22.680 --> 08:25.660
while five Chrome tabs are loading at once feels better.

08:25.660 --> 08:28.620
The, there's, I think it's a combination.

08:28.620 --> 08:30.160
I think the first part of the mix

08:30.160 --> 08:33.280
is that Solus by default with their Gnome spin

08:33.280 --> 08:35.120
is shipping the impatience extension.

08:35.120 --> 08:35.940
Oh, right.

08:35.940 --> 08:38.420
And the impatience extension shaves off animation times.

08:38.420 --> 08:41.400
So I think there's a bit of that.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.000
But I tell you what, Wes,

08:43.000 --> 08:44.680
I'll have you use this Gnome machine before you leave.

08:44.680 --> 08:45.680
It's out there.

08:45.680 --> 08:46.840
I'll have you play around with Gnome

08:46.840 --> 08:49.440
and just tell me if it's not the fastest damn desktop.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.840
I'm excited, that sounds nice.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.660
I, so I feel like gonna move back to Gnome,

08:53.660 --> 08:55.000
gonna try it out again for a little while,

08:55.000 --> 08:56.040
gonna live that lifestyle,

08:56.040 --> 08:57.240
gonna maybe try experimenting

08:57.240 --> 08:58.720
with some of these things people are doing.

08:58.720 --> 08:59.560
Yeah, right.

08:59.560 --> 09:01.000
It makes it a lot easier to like,

09:01.000 --> 09:02.600
to be with, see what the community's doing,

09:02.600 --> 09:03.440
play along with them,

09:03.440 --> 09:06.880
even if you don't want to use that for the long term.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.520
Monkeycom, you have a comment about switching to Gnome?

09:09.520 --> 09:11.800
Well, our whole office is in the process

09:11.800 --> 09:15.160
of upgrading to, from 16,

09:15.160 --> 09:16.880
and they're talking about going to 17,

09:16.880 --> 09:18.200
and now it's okay, well, what do you do?

09:18.200 --> 09:20.160
Gnome or whatever.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.440
Most of our group has gone from Unity to Gnome.

09:24.440 --> 09:26.380
They were going, a couple of them have gone to KDE,

09:26.380 --> 09:27.220
but they ended up with Gnome

09:27.220 --> 09:28.880
because they had Java issues,

09:28.880 --> 09:31.120
and they had Java issues in KDE,

09:31.120 --> 09:32.180
and it may have just been-

09:32.180 --> 09:34.280
Like Java apps not working properly?

09:34.280 --> 09:37.240
Yeah, they have custom apps.

09:37.240 --> 09:42.240
One of them was, oh, the Ruby management,

09:42.640 --> 09:44.320
development environment that they use,

09:44.320 --> 09:45.860
and it runs in Java,

09:45.860 --> 09:47.660
and they were having problems in KDE

09:47.660 --> 09:49.240
where it would just crash randomly,

09:49.240 --> 09:50.660
and it doesn't do it under Gnome,

09:50.660 --> 09:52.640
and the only difference is Gnome.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.920
So it's not, you know, 1704 with KDE.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.400
That just doesn't make any, it's gotta be,

09:57.400 --> 09:58.560
it's gotta be like a,

09:58.560 --> 10:01.280
that just doesn't make any sense to me.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.120
It doesn't.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.280
Why would a Java app be impacted

10:03.280 --> 10:04.680
by the desktop environment?

10:05.800 --> 10:06.640
I don't know.

10:06.640 --> 10:10.600
I mean, it was why we switched from Unity to KDE.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.920
We were just thinking it would be faster and smoother.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.600
Well, you know, Monkey, I hear this

10:13.600 --> 10:15.920
in different versions from a lot of people.

10:15.920 --> 10:20.240
So since the news, Noah and I have been trying to talk to,

10:20.240 --> 10:22.680
like, as many people as we can that are using Unity,

10:22.680 --> 10:23.560
that are switching to Gnome,

10:23.560 --> 10:25.240
or that went from Unity to Gnome,

10:25.240 --> 10:26.720
and we're specifically trying to talk to people

10:26.720 --> 10:28.960
that are using it in the workspace, just like Monkey is.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.660
This is super awesome that we're having this conversation,

10:31.660 --> 10:33.360
because one of the things that we've heard

10:33.360 --> 10:36.000
over and over again in different iterations

10:36.000 --> 10:39.420
is X, Y, Z didn't work under X desktop environment,

10:39.420 --> 10:40.520
so we moved to a different one,

10:40.520 --> 10:42.640
and it's sometimes something didn't work under Gnome,

10:42.640 --> 10:45.100
so they used Unity, and it's, I don't know,

10:45.100 --> 10:46.580
I don't know what, so what it comes,

10:46.580 --> 10:49.740
what I think it must be is something with graphics drivers,

10:49.740 --> 10:51.320
either with the compositor,

10:51.320 --> 10:53.640
and if you're using proprietary versus free.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.500
Do you know, Monkey, if that could be a factor

10:55.500 --> 10:56.340
on any of these systems?

10:56.340 --> 10:58.800
Maybe it was like Compiz versus Mudder.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.720
I mean, could it be something dumb like that?

11:01.720 --> 11:03.120
It could be a thousand things.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.880
It's, you know, when you're installing a bunch of programs,

11:05.880 --> 11:09.300
one of them was a database development program,

11:09.300 --> 11:10.720
and it was a commercial application

11:10.720 --> 11:13.320
that they had running in Unity just fine,

11:13.320 --> 11:18.320
and then when we installed it on KDE, it didn't run.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.280
We were running Neon, so it was 16.04,

11:20.280 --> 11:23.520
but when we went to 17.04 Gnome,

11:23.520 --> 11:25.280
it just ran fine, we had no issues,

11:25.280 --> 11:27.160
so there might have been a distro issue on that one,

11:27.160 --> 11:31.360
but it, you know, it's, you talk to the vendor

11:31.360 --> 11:33.320
who's selling the application, and they're saying,

11:33.320 --> 11:35.520
well, we did all our development under Unity,

11:35.520 --> 11:39.720
and we are in the process of revamping for other distros.

11:39.720 --> 11:41.520
Hmm, wow.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.200
Hmm, well, the beard hooks us up

11:43.200 --> 11:45.600
with something that's perfect for me.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.920
It's exactly what I was just talking about,

11:46.920 --> 11:48.880
the theme for Qt applications

11:48.880 --> 11:50.360
to make them look like Gnome apps.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.560
Well, instead of using Adwadi, if you do use Arc,

11:53.560 --> 11:54.640
the beard's linked us up,

11:54.640 --> 11:58.480
a Arc theme for Qt applications,

11:58.480 --> 12:00.360
so I'm gonna grab this right now.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.200
Yeah, you should, yeah, just grab it.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.720
I'm gonna bookmark this, it'll be in the show notes,

12:02.720 --> 12:05.000
if you run Arc or Arc Dark,

12:05.000 --> 12:08.160
and want to be able to run a few Qt applications.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.440
I'll give you an example, Quasal Core.

12:10.440 --> 12:14.400
There's nothing like Quasal and Quasal Core on Gnome.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.280
I'm using it right here, right now.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.640
And are you on a GTK desktop, otherwise?

12:18.640 --> 12:19.480
Yeah.

12:19.480 --> 12:21.320
Exactly what you're doing.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.820
Yeah, at the end of the day,

12:22.820 --> 12:26.120
even if you've replaced everything with a GTK app,

12:26.120 --> 12:27.680
eventually you're gonna want good IRC,

12:27.680 --> 12:29.160
and when you do, you're gonna wind up at Quasal.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.000
Exactly.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.440
Hmm, this looks really good, thank you, beard.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.280
That is a good one.

12:32.280 --> 12:33.800
He's never so helpful.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.240
You know, that beard, he has got the Google food down,

12:36.240 --> 12:37.560
that is for sure.

12:37.560 --> 12:38.640
Maybe he uses something else,

12:38.640 --> 12:40.920
he's just not telling us about it.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.840
Maybe he's using DuckDuckGo.

12:42.840 --> 12:44.000
While the peeps are using Google.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.680
Yeah, right, that guy.

12:45.680 --> 12:46.640
He's clever.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.640
So Debian is making a big change,

12:48.640 --> 12:50.480
and it feels like a passing of an era.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.800
They're shutting down their public FTP servers.

12:52.800 --> 12:53.760
Goodbye.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.600
I don't buy any of this.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.600
I think this is really a shame,

12:57.600 --> 13:00.200
and oh, I know FTP's old, hmm.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.960
If you're one of the few people, LWN writes,

13:02.960 --> 13:05.440
that's still using FTP to access Debian repositories,

13:05.440 --> 13:07.240
well, the time has come to move on.

13:07.240 --> 13:08.760
They're gonna shut it down in November.

13:08.760 --> 13:11.440
It's driven by the following considerations.

13:11.440 --> 13:15.240
FTP servers have no support for caching or acceleration.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.080
All right, fair enough.

13:16.080 --> 13:17.880
Okay, okay, you got me there, okay.

13:17.880 --> 13:21.440
Most software implementations have stagnated

13:21.440 --> 13:24.120
and are awkward to use and configure.

13:24.120 --> 13:27.920
I find that to be weak.

13:27.920 --> 13:31.200
Stagnate, yeah, they've stagnated because FTP's finished,

13:31.200 --> 13:35.880
and awkward to use, that's totally an opinion.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.400
That's absolutely an opinion.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.480
Okay, the next reason.

13:38.480 --> 13:41.160
Usage of FTP servers is pretty low,

13:41.160 --> 13:43.200
and our own installer has not offered FTP

13:43.200 --> 13:46.000
as a way to access the mirrors for over 10 years.

13:46.000 --> 13:48.800
Whoa, okay, all right, got me there.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.840
The protocol is inefficient

13:51.840 --> 13:56.000
and requires adding awkward kludges to firewalls

13:56.000 --> 13:57.540
and load balancing daemons.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.340
That feels like an argument from 10 years ago

14:01.340 --> 14:05.320
when it was hard, is this FTP or is it FTP passive?

14:05.320 --> 14:07.560
I gotta configure my, like that's a problem

14:07.560 --> 14:10.880
that all firewall administrators literally figured out

14:10.880 --> 14:11.720
15 years ago.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.800
But maybe that knowledge is gone, right,

14:13.800 --> 14:15.660
like these guys didn't do that?

14:15.660 --> 14:18.680
No, it's built in now, it's baked in now.

14:18.680 --> 14:23.680
I find all of this, to me, to my personal preference,

14:24.240 --> 14:27.160
I really find FTP to still be one of the fastest ways

14:27.160 --> 14:28.220
to pull down files.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.960
So you use it day to day?

14:31.960 --> 14:33.840
I can't think of the last time I used it.

14:33.840 --> 14:37.080
SFTP sometimes, but regular old FTP is tough.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.160
I don't use it daily, I don't use it,

14:39.160 --> 14:40.900
the shit is fast and great,

14:40.900 --> 14:43.280
and if I'm just pulling down stuff that's GPL code anyways,

14:43.280 --> 14:45.480
it's not like I care about privacy,

14:45.480 --> 14:46.760
it's all open source code,

14:46.760 --> 14:48.600
it's not like I'm moving around in the Nuke codes

14:48.600 --> 14:49.440
or something.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.680
And here's the other thing that's gonna be,

14:50.680 --> 14:51.760
you wanna talk about awkward,

14:51.760 --> 14:53.520
they used awkward twice in this reasoning,

14:53.520 --> 14:58.520
here's some awkward, they're gonna remap ftp.debian.org

14:58.600 --> 15:01.080
to go to the HTTP mirrors, that's awkward.

15:01.080 --> 15:01.920
Yeah, that is a little awkward.

15:01.920 --> 15:04.480
You go to ftp.debian.org and you end up on an HTTP site,

15:04.480 --> 15:06.680
that is a definition of awkward, my friends.

15:06.680 --> 15:08.740
That is awkward in kludge.

15:08.740 --> 15:10.840
I don't know why this hurts me.

15:10.840 --> 15:11.680
This cuts me deep.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.360
I'm a little surprised, honestly.

15:13.360 --> 15:14.200
I know, I can tell.

15:14.200 --> 15:16.600
I guess like, I feel like it's just, it's not.

15:18.180 --> 15:19.020
It doesn't matter at the end of the day,

15:19.020 --> 15:21.840
but it feels like the passing of a, it feels like.

15:21.840 --> 15:22.680
I agree with you there, I do.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.560
Part of what it is, is it feels like we're shitting

15:24.560 --> 15:26.120
on a perfectly good technology.

15:26.120 --> 15:28.200
I'm not claiming that we should all be updating

15:28.200 --> 15:30.320
our websites or pushing our applications

15:30.320 --> 15:33.060
or moving around databases with FTP.

15:33.060 --> 15:36.160
But if you're downloading something like a package

15:36.160 --> 15:40.400
or a source file or an ISO that is GPL'd,

15:40.400 --> 15:43.200
there is literally no security consideration here.

15:43.200 --> 15:45.520
You're not logging in with an authenticated account.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.360
You're just pulling down open source material.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.760
It happens to be one of the fastest, most efficient means

15:49.760 --> 15:52.960
to file transfer protocol.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.860
Well, you say that, but it's not like,

15:54.860 --> 15:55.700
like they said, like there's no.

15:55.700 --> 15:57.760
Hypertext, that's what ACTP stands for.

15:57.760 --> 16:00.120
It's for hypertext, Wes, not file transfer.

16:00.120 --> 16:02.160
But since then, we've invented CDNs,

16:02.160 --> 16:05.120
all kinds of methods to make this sort of thing

16:05.120 --> 16:06.560
much more efficient for the provider.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.840
Especially if you're a beleaguered Debian admin

16:08.840 --> 16:11.920
where like, all right, this is another daemon to configure.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.480
There's not very many users.

16:13.480 --> 16:16.360
No one serious really uses it or has to use it.

16:16.360 --> 16:17.200
I don't know, Wes.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.020
To me, it feels like.

16:18.020 --> 16:18.860
I don't even know if I have like, I mean,

16:18.860 --> 16:20.040
do I have FTP here?

16:20.040 --> 16:22.780
It feels like you kids today with your system Ds

16:22.780 --> 16:26.760
and your containers and your Kubernetes

16:26.760 --> 16:30.200
and your microservices all wanna shut down

16:30.200 --> 16:31.640
good old simple FTP.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.960
I'm not trying to say we should all go

16:33.960 --> 16:35.360
to the Church of Telnet here.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.960
I'm not trying to advocate that we should all be sending

16:37.960 --> 16:39.680
our usernames and passwords over clear text

16:39.680 --> 16:40.600
across the internet.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.560
I am simply saying that when you have a simple, clean,

16:43.560 --> 16:46.320
efficient file transfer protocol

16:46.320 --> 16:50.640
and you need to transfer files, it kinda makes sense.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.320
Like, it kinda works.

16:52.320 --> 16:55.120
Especially for the Debian project, right?

16:55.120 --> 16:57.040
It's not like we're talking about Solus here.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.880
We're not talking about elementary OS.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.240
We're talking about Debian, okay?

17:01.240 --> 17:02.400
But it's fine, Wes.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.280
It's fine.

17:04.460 --> 17:05.720
Mookie, what do you think?

17:05.720 --> 17:09.360
FTP is old and works and that's all that matters.

17:09.360 --> 17:10.520
Okay, all right.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.360
Thank you.

17:11.360 --> 17:12.820
It's like we're gonna talk about Thunderbird

17:12.820 --> 17:13.660
here in a little bit.

17:13.660 --> 17:15.360
And what everybody always says is,

17:15.360 --> 17:16.720
Chris, you're an asshole.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.080
Thunderbird is finished.

17:18.080 --> 17:19.980
We don't need to be working on it anymore.

17:19.980 --> 17:21.460
Nobody's doing anything with email.

17:21.460 --> 17:22.360
It's fine.

17:22.360 --> 17:24.380
And everybody's like totally cool with Thunderbird

17:24.380 --> 17:26.600
being this thing that isn't revolutionary

17:26.600 --> 17:27.640
every couple of years.

17:27.640 --> 17:28.880
But FTP, well, God forbid.

17:28.880 --> 17:29.920
Well, there's a big difference though

17:29.920 --> 17:32.080
because that's open source client-side software.

17:32.080 --> 17:34.360
It doesn't require anyone to maintain a server

17:34.360 --> 17:37.120
or perform security patching.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.120
That's true, that's true.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.720
I would not, as an admin,

17:39.720 --> 17:42.000
I would not run FTP if I didn't have to.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.200
I agree.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.720
I actually agree on my own service.

17:44.720 --> 17:45.640
Right, right, yeah.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.480
I use SFTP.

17:46.480 --> 17:47.800
And like you said, you wouldn't expect Solace

17:47.800 --> 17:49.920
to have an FTP archive for you, would you?

17:49.920 --> 17:51.360
I just use SCP, to be honest with you.

17:51.360 --> 17:52.200
Yeah, right, totally.

17:52.200 --> 17:53.960
But that Debian project, Wes.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.760
I do, it is the end of an era.

17:55.760 --> 17:56.880
You are right about that.

17:56.880 --> 17:58.480
Yeah, yeah.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.280
You know what the reality is too, when it comes to-

18:00.280 --> 18:02.240
You should go download something before they shut it off.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.120
Yeah, just to celebrate.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.440
What really probably killed off FTP though

18:06.440 --> 18:07.880
is corporate firewalls.

18:07.880 --> 18:08.880
Because they all support,

18:08.880 --> 18:10.360
corporate firewalls don't care what you're doing

18:10.360 --> 18:12.080
when you're going to 80 or 443.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.120
Have that at Haas, enjoy yourself.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.400
Oh, you wanna establish an SSH connection or FTP?

18:17.400 --> 18:18.960
Oh no, you might be hacking.

18:18.960 --> 18:22.600
So, I think it's really corporate firewalls.

18:22.600 --> 18:23.440
I don't think so.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.040
I mean, we use SFTP.

18:26.040 --> 18:28.280
I mean, I know it's SSH,

18:28.280 --> 18:32.440
but we use SFTP in the banking industry like crazy.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.560
That is the protocol.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.760
And when you start getting into stuff

18:35.760 --> 18:40.760
like just the file transfers between financial institutions,

18:41.080 --> 18:46.080
they still use SFTP because it works.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.440
You're just dropping a file into a directory

18:48.440 --> 18:51.240
for someone else to go read later.

18:51.240 --> 18:54.080
And there's nothing really better than SFTP is fine,

18:54.080 --> 18:56.000
but you really can't beat that,

18:56.000 --> 18:57.240
especially when you're doing shared search

18:57.240 --> 18:59.080
and stuff like that.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.120
Wes is over there doing a passive FTP session right now.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.520
I just got downloaded the read me from that archive.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.320
You went to ftp.devian.org?

19:06.320 --> 19:07.160
I sure did.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.320
Good man, good man.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.160
Pull that down while you can.

19:09.160 --> 19:10.440
Now I have a piece of history.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.440
You have until November 1st, 2017,

19:12.440 --> 19:15.640
and then they'll shut it down and redirect you to HTTP.

19:15.640 --> 19:17.480
What we have to do, see, we can't do it

19:17.480 --> 19:18.840
because it's the observer effect.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.360
Now that I'm gonna say this, it won't happen.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.760
But in the future, you could all play a game at home

19:24.760 --> 19:26.880
when we do something, when we cover a story like this.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.460
So when Chris talks about FTP or something like that,

19:29.460 --> 19:31.120
you could play a game at home

19:31.120 --> 19:32.960
to see how many people go to the comments

19:32.960 --> 19:35.520
to tell me about R-Sync or SCP.

19:35.520 --> 19:37.400
Even though we kinda gave them quick mention on the show,

19:37.400 --> 19:39.520
you'll be amazed at how many people listening

19:39.520 --> 19:41.000
think Chris has never heard of these things.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.640
Somehow, dude manages to do a Linux show for 11 years

19:43.640 --> 19:45.840
but doesn't know about R-Sync or SCP.

19:45.840 --> 19:48.520
And so it's such a fun game to play at home.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.660
You can tell I love it.

19:49.660 --> 19:50.560
You should play it too.

19:50.560 --> 19:53.320
But now that I've mentioned it, it's the observer effect.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.540
It will have 90% less.

19:55.540 --> 19:56.820
I bet you we'll still get a couple.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.480
Maybe two that are ironic and three that are serious.

19:59.480 --> 20:01.520
Be careful if you drink while you play this game.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.300
You have to set a reasonably low limit

20:03.300 --> 20:04.740
or you will hurt yourself.

20:04.740 --> 20:07.940
Yeah, that's like when you were playing drinking games

20:07.940 --> 20:08.780
during the election.

20:08.780 --> 20:10.120
You will get wrecked. Yes, exactly.

20:10.120 --> 20:12.500
Let's talk about another way to get improved.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.880
Let's talk about Linux Academy.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.180
Now this is why I'm a big fan of Linux Academy.

20:17.180 --> 20:18.480
It's on my terms.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.860
I did schooling when I was in IT.

20:20.860 --> 20:25.380
I mostly through community college like programs.

20:25.380 --> 20:28.180
Do you have any, does your work give you a budget?

20:28.180 --> 20:29.100
We do have a training budget.

20:29.100 --> 20:29.940
That's nice.

20:29.940 --> 20:31.980
Do you go to like classes?

20:31.980 --> 20:33.740
We've had some, I've had some people come in

20:33.740 --> 20:35.580
and then I think, you don't even get to three

20:35.580 --> 20:37.660
like your individual managers but you can request training.

20:37.660 --> 20:40.740
Yeah, this is, man, if I work somewhere,

20:40.740 --> 20:43.440
this JB, you know, they don't have the perks.

20:43.440 --> 20:46.140
But if I work somewhere that gave me a training budget.

20:46.140 --> 20:47.740
Some baddies.

20:47.740 --> 20:48.660
Yeah, exactly.

20:48.660 --> 20:49.980
Just a little.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.540
This would be such a great way to use it

20:51.540 --> 20:52.920
because then it's on my terms.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.740
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

20:54.740 --> 20:56.420
It's a platform to learn about Linux.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.700
You go there, you support the show,

20:57.700 --> 20:59.620
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

20:59.620 --> 21:02.020
and you can sign up for a free seven day trial.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.740
Now you'll learn about the core of Linux

21:03.740 --> 21:05.540
and everything you really need to know to manage

21:05.540 --> 21:08.900
and set up and really be a great Linux administrator

21:08.900 --> 21:10.940
or DevOps or sysadmin.

21:10.940 --> 21:12.120
That's nice and that's fancy

21:12.120 --> 21:14.780
and I pretty much use it exclusively now

21:14.780 --> 21:17.420
for a couple of years just to do that kind of stuff.

21:17.420 --> 21:20.260
I have dabbled a little bit in like Ruby and Python.

21:20.260 --> 21:21.180
They have some great courseware.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.020
Nice.

21:22.020 --> 21:23.180
A little bit.

21:23.180 --> 21:24.980
But I gotta tell you, if I was in the industry today

21:24.980 --> 21:28.340
and I felt like OpenStack was over my head

21:28.340 --> 21:32.260
or I keep hearing all these big data concepts tossed around

21:32.260 --> 21:34.420
or containers fell out of my reach

21:34.420 --> 21:37.380
or I didn't understand what made AWS so competitive

21:37.380 --> 21:39.820
or why Microsoft is killing it with Azure,

21:40.820 --> 21:42.880
even if I didn't have to work in that field just yet,

21:42.880 --> 21:44.940
I would totally dive into these courses.

21:44.940 --> 21:47.280
So we use Chef where I work.

21:47.280 --> 21:50.540
We had some Chef training, intermediate level.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.340
Linux Academy was an awesome resource

21:52.340 --> 21:53.940
for everyone who hadn't done Chef before

21:53.940 --> 21:55.380
to get up to speed on the basics.

21:55.380 --> 21:56.620
Everything that Linux Academy covered

21:56.620 --> 21:59.100
was exactly what the best practices in the industry.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.500
They just, it's up to date.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.660
It's focused on the real tools that people use.

22:03.660 --> 22:04.780
Yeah, I think it makes a difference

22:04.780 --> 22:06.740
because they have, not only do they have

22:06.740 --> 22:08.660
a lot of passion for this stuff,

22:08.660 --> 22:10.500
but they've really doubled down

22:10.500 --> 22:12.220
on bringing in-house staff in

22:12.220 --> 22:13.960
that's constantly making this stuff relevant,

22:13.960 --> 22:14.800
keeping on top of this.

22:14.800 --> 22:15.640
They're going to the events.

22:15.640 --> 22:16.980
They're staying abreast in the industry.

22:16.980 --> 22:19.140
And they think the other big differentiator for them

22:19.140 --> 22:20.060
is if you get stuck,

22:20.060 --> 22:22.620
they have real human mentorship available,

22:22.620 --> 22:26.640
like actual instructors that know the courseware,

22:26.640 --> 22:29.340
know the stuff in and out, and they can help you.

22:29.340 --> 22:32.580
You can master Linux at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

22:32.580 --> 22:33.900
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

22:33.900 --> 22:36.880
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

22:37.700 --> 22:38.720
Last week on the program,

22:38.720 --> 22:40.900
we tried to make sense of the big Docker announcement

22:40.900 --> 22:42.660
because DockerCon was going on.

22:42.660 --> 22:45.620
And I thought we did a pretty good job

22:45.620 --> 22:47.300
of cutting through the BS.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.140
We weren't the only ones.

22:48.140 --> 22:50.300
It was a lot of BS to cut through though.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.020
I felt a little validated that you found

22:52.020 --> 22:53.540
a few other conference discussions online

22:53.540 --> 22:55.940
where people were incensed by the amount of BS

22:55.940 --> 22:56.900
coming out of Docker.

22:56.900 --> 22:59.960
And now we have a little bit better understanding

22:59.960 --> 23:02.060
of what the hell's going on and why you should care.

23:02.060 --> 23:04.260
So it appears, kinda sorta,

23:04.260 --> 23:06.580
that Docker became Moby last week.

23:07.740 --> 23:09.620
It was like a rebranding thing

23:09.620 --> 23:12.860
that has just sparked a shit ton of confusion.

23:12.860 --> 23:14.620
So at DockerCon in Austin,

23:14.620 --> 23:15.860
apparently I leave Austin and then they

23:15.860 --> 23:17.740
decide to have DockerCon. They just both talk.

23:17.740 --> 23:19.420
On last Tuesday, which was the day

23:19.420 --> 23:21.100
we were recording the show,

23:21.100 --> 23:23.240
Docker announced the Moby project.

23:24.800 --> 23:27.020
It's a new name for the open source software

23:27.020 --> 23:29.900
from which the commercial versions of Docker are derived.

23:30.980 --> 23:33.500
And it serves as like a starting point

23:33.500 --> 23:35.680
to create customized container software

23:35.680 --> 23:38.420
for specific purpose-built infrastructures.

23:38.420 --> 23:40.420
It's essentially what we said last week.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.100
Turns out though, we were probably

23:43.100 --> 23:45.260
one of the only news outlets that got it right.

23:45.260 --> 23:47.420
Because, and it's not other folks' fault,

23:47.420 --> 23:49.080
they got really confusing.

23:50.940 --> 23:53.660
There was a series of issues

23:53.660 --> 23:55.620
that totally muddled the message.

23:55.620 --> 23:59.940
First of all, you had Docker's extremely thick,

23:59.940 --> 24:01.460
complicated PR announcement.

24:02.700 --> 24:05.180
Then there were some vague mentions

24:05.180 --> 24:10.100
on some poll requests that sort of

24:10.100 --> 24:11.580
led people to misunderstand.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.600
So there was some terminology

24:14.600 --> 24:16.340
in one of the recent poll requests

24:16.340 --> 24:18.300
where it just said, Project Moby

24:18.300 --> 24:21.300
is the new upstream for the Docker project.

24:21.300 --> 24:22.140
And people are like, what, what, what?

24:22.140 --> 24:23.300
What is this, what?

24:23.300 --> 24:25.500
And then people went to go check what was going on

24:25.500 --> 24:27.340
and GitHub connectivity problems

24:28.620 --> 24:32.100
totally messed up this announcement.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.900
The message had disappeared.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.740
Docker had to get in the hold of GitHub's support staff

24:38.740 --> 24:40.300
to try to get this stuff restored

24:40.300 --> 24:42.060
while people are trying to figure it out.

24:42.060 --> 24:44.020
Then the problem was compounded

24:44.020 --> 24:45.760
during another poll request

24:45.760 --> 24:47.760
where the CTO of Docker said,

24:47.760 --> 24:49.780
Docker is transitioning all of its open-source

24:49.780 --> 24:52.420
collaborations to the Moby project going forward,

24:52.420 --> 24:54.700
which people didn't have any idea what that meant.

24:54.700 --> 24:57.100
Yeah, so then they go to the PR announcement

24:57.100 --> 24:59.380
and they can't make sense of it at all.

25:00.540 --> 25:01.660
There really was, like last week,

25:01.660 --> 25:06.540
there was no straight-laced, easy-to-read description at all.

25:06.540 --> 25:10.500
Yeah, yeah, so we have this other announcement

25:10.500 --> 25:12.820
that kind of actually makes more sense.

25:12.820 --> 25:14.860
They should have led with Linux kit.

25:14.860 --> 25:17.060
Now, it sounds like something for iOS,

25:17.060 --> 25:18.980
but Linux kit includes the tooling

25:18.980 --> 25:21.660
to allow building custom Linux subsystems

25:21.660 --> 25:24.020
that only include exactly the components

25:24.020 --> 25:25.300
that the runtime requires.

25:25.300 --> 25:26.780
So you got an application,

25:26.780 --> 25:28.220
maybe it's a web app with a database,

25:28.220 --> 25:29.960
it will only include the components necessary

25:29.960 --> 25:33.520
to boot that container up and get those applications started.

25:33.520 --> 25:36.820
All system services are containers that can be replaced.

25:36.820 --> 25:38.380
Everything that is not required

25:38.380 --> 25:39.620
can just be removed from the system.

25:39.620 --> 25:41.600
All components can be substituted

25:41.600 --> 25:43.060
with ones that match specific needs,

25:43.060 --> 25:45.340
so different runtimes, different containers,

25:45.340 --> 25:47.340
different DNS servers.

25:47.340 --> 25:51.160
It's a kit very much in the Docker philosophy

25:51.160 --> 25:54.240
of batteries are included, but all are swappable,

25:54.240 --> 25:57.220
and Docker announced it an open-sourced Linux kit,

25:57.220 --> 25:58.980
which is up on GitHub.

25:58.980 --> 26:01.100
And if my understanding of it is correctly,

26:01.100 --> 26:03.380
it's like an Alpine Linux shim

26:03.380 --> 26:05.740
that goes on top of Mac OS or Windows

26:05.740 --> 26:08.520
that gives them the basic elements they need

26:08.520 --> 26:11.920
in the user land space to fire up a container.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.940
It's not a Ubuntu Linux, it's not a Red Hat Linux,

26:13.940 --> 26:14.780
it's Alpine Linux,

26:14.780 --> 26:17.140
which is like this hyper-focused container Linux.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.220
Am I tracking this so far?

26:18.220 --> 26:23.220
Well, yeah, it's a way to build these very minimal,

26:23.820 --> 26:25.180
customized Linux.

26:25.180 --> 26:27.820
I mean, you could call it a distribution, but it's not.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.140
It's really this image that's meant

26:29.140 --> 26:31.580
to just have the bare bones necessary

26:31.580 --> 26:34.580
so that on top of it, you could just run a bunch of containers.

26:34.580 --> 26:36.060
It kind of seems like a lower-level

26:36.060 --> 26:37.380
container OS kind of thing.

26:37.380 --> 26:39.660
Right, that can run on top of a host OS,

26:39.660 --> 26:42.780
but it's not a VM because you're not virtualizing

26:42.780 --> 26:44.520
the disk controller and the ethernet

26:44.520 --> 26:46.280
and all of the hardware stack.

26:46.280 --> 26:50.280
The kernel of the host OS is facilitating

26:50.280 --> 26:51.540
the actual processes.

26:51.540 --> 26:55.280
So the processes are using the same type

26:55.280 --> 26:56.580
of containerization they use on Linux.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.220
So you could be running on a Mac,

26:58.220 --> 27:00.800
but it's not necessarily virtualization,

27:00.800 --> 27:02.680
which is very confusing to me,

27:02.680 --> 27:05.340
but it's all made possible with this Linux kit,

27:05.340 --> 27:08.720
which Docker is billing as a lean, portable Linux subsystem

27:08.720 --> 27:10.720
for all OSes, basically.

27:12.740 --> 27:13.900
And how far does this go?

27:13.900 --> 27:16.580
Could a group like the FreeBSD Project

27:16.580 --> 27:19.700
come and make it their new Linux subsystem?

27:19.700 --> 27:20.540
That's a good question.

27:20.540 --> 27:22.820
Is this now basically, is Linux going to become

27:22.820 --> 27:24.900
like the bash for Mac OS 10,

27:24.900 --> 27:26.920
like getting a bash on Windows?

27:26.920 --> 27:28.640
Is this, I know OS 10 already has bash,

27:28.640 --> 27:30.920
but is this going to be a way for people

27:30.920 --> 27:33.900
to just have a Linux environment running on their Mac now?

27:33.900 --> 27:35.180
Where does the line stop?

27:35.180 --> 27:37.180
When do we stop taking from Linux

27:37.180 --> 27:39.820
and let Linux just have something for God's sakes?

27:39.820 --> 27:42.020
Now the user land and containers,

27:42.020 --> 27:43.260
and the only thing we have left is the curve.

27:43.260 --> 27:46.380
Well, they don't seem to want to take our desktops.

27:46.380 --> 27:48.260
They don't want those.

27:48.260 --> 27:49.380
Damn it, Wes.

27:49.380 --> 27:50.860
That just made me feel worse.

27:52.140 --> 27:53.420
I did note here at the bottom,

27:53.420 --> 27:55.860
they talked about how Linux kit provides a space

27:55.860 --> 27:58.820
to incubate security projects that show promise

27:58.820 --> 28:00.100
for improving Linux security.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.460
So like WireGuard, I don't know what Landlock is,

28:02.460 --> 28:04.260
but Mirage and O-kernel.

28:04.260 --> 28:07.500
Damn, you know, I also got the, I got a smell,

28:07.500 --> 28:09.700
I got a Microsoft smell coming off this.

28:09.700 --> 28:11.060
There's nothing in this.

28:11.060 --> 28:12.460
I mean, they do reference,

28:12.460 --> 28:15.180
they do reference Windows 10 customers

28:15.180 --> 28:16.860
will get access to Linux containers

28:16.860 --> 28:18.680
and we will be working together

28:18.680 --> 28:23.220
on how to integrate Linux kit with Hyper-V isolation.

28:23.220 --> 28:25.900
So there is some reference to Microsoft technologies,

28:25.900 --> 28:27.860
but it doesn't, when I read this,

28:28.820 --> 28:29.820
yeah, that's Redmond.

28:29.820 --> 28:31.120
Yeah, I know what Redmond smells like.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.100
That smells like Redmond.

28:32.100 --> 28:34.740
And I don't quite know what it is.

28:34.740 --> 28:36.200
I think when I was on Twitter,

28:36.200 --> 28:38.460
I noticed some Microsoft employees that I follow

28:38.460 --> 28:39.700
were promoting this.

28:39.700 --> 28:43.980
And I think some of this was done in partnership

28:43.980 --> 28:46.540
with Microsoft to get this on Windows

28:46.540 --> 28:48.580
and the work they did to make this work for Windows

28:48.580 --> 28:51.820
is basically opened up for other BSD, Mac OS,

28:51.820 --> 28:53.540
other platforms as well.

28:53.540 --> 28:56.800
So Linux kit, they say, is a container native.

28:57.700 --> 28:59.500
They just can't help themselves.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.960
They still got to talk like a bunch of monsters in here.

29:01.960 --> 29:05.140
I don't know what it is, but it just gets me crazy.

29:06.100 --> 29:08.020
Yeah, Linux kit.

29:08.020 --> 29:09.520
They do, I mean, they talk about security

29:09.520 --> 29:11.300
like a thousand times in that little article.

29:11.300 --> 29:16.300
So I hope it means that they are focusing on that

29:16.460 --> 29:18.700
and helping to advance,

29:18.700 --> 29:20.600
like they mentioned the kernel self-protection project

29:20.600 --> 29:21.440
and other things.

29:21.440 --> 29:23.300
And I think we need that, right?

29:23.300 --> 29:25.340
Like, especially with all the hype around containers,

29:25.340 --> 29:27.140
whatever that means on Linux and all that thing.

29:27.140 --> 29:29.420
I think a big name like Docker taking it seriously

29:29.420 --> 29:31.820
or at least looking like it is a good sign.

29:31.820 --> 29:33.660
I wanted to talk more about it,

29:33.660 --> 29:36.220
but I sense that there is just a,

29:36.220 --> 29:38.340
I don't give a shit aspect in the audience.

29:38.340 --> 29:40.420
Like people, as soon as you start talking about Docker

29:40.420 --> 29:42.220
and containers, I feel like there's a portion of the audience

29:42.220 --> 29:44.180
that just doesn't care.

29:44.180 --> 29:47.100
And I don't know how to grapple with the fact

29:47.100 --> 29:48.000
that at the same time,

29:48.000 --> 29:50.240
this could be one of the biggest things that's happening

29:50.240 --> 29:52.540
in the Linux space in the last few years.

29:52.540 --> 29:53.860
Like I don't know how to connect those dots.

29:53.860 --> 29:56.020
It's also one of the ways where it's like,

29:56.020 --> 29:57.620
it is kind of far away from this show, right?

29:57.620 --> 29:58.980
Like especially the desktop focus,

29:58.980 --> 30:00.760
but this is like one of the main things

30:00.760 --> 30:02.460
that's selling Linux to the enterprise

30:02.460 --> 30:03.340
or the modern enterprise.

30:03.340 --> 30:06.020
Yeah, we talked about it on Monday's Code to Radio,

30:06.020 --> 30:08.780
but basically Michael Dominic is refocusing in a large way

30:08.780 --> 30:10.700
his entire company on delivering Docker solutions,

30:10.700 --> 30:14.080
not even like container solutions, but Docker solutions.

30:14.080 --> 30:18.220
And I just, yeah, I feel like I have a hard time

30:18.220 --> 30:19.860
figuring out a way to make it connect with the audience

30:19.860 --> 30:21.760
because there's only so many reasons they should care.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.140
At the same time, like if you follow Linux,

30:24.140 --> 30:26.060
this is a huge thing that's happening.

30:26.060 --> 30:29.460
And at the same time, there's this undertone,

30:29.460 --> 30:30.940
what's really happening here,

30:30.940 --> 30:33.060
and it's something we've talked about before,

30:33.060 --> 30:35.780
is Linux is the runtime.

30:35.780 --> 30:37.780
They're delivering software in containers,

30:37.780 --> 30:40.100
but what is the software actually running on top of?

30:40.100 --> 30:41.740
It's Linux.

30:41.740 --> 30:46.280
Well, now with this Linux kit move,

30:46.280 --> 30:48.500
it's like a hybrid Linux

30:48.500 --> 30:51.460
because it's no longer the Linux kernel.

30:51.460 --> 30:55.420
It's Linux user land and some aspects of the kernel

30:55.420 --> 30:58.780
and a host kernel, something's happening here.

30:58.780 --> 31:02.020
And in some ways, it doesn't all feel good,

31:02.020 --> 31:04.580
but it definitely feels like inevitable progress.

31:04.580 --> 31:06.380
Yes, I mean, I think that that is one of the thing

31:06.380 --> 31:08.300
about the Docker stuff,

31:08.300 --> 31:11.020
their strong cooperation with Windows,

31:11.020 --> 31:13.660
it really is focused on cloud, cloud workflows,

31:13.660 --> 31:14.480
whatever that means, right?

31:14.480 --> 31:15.320
But that's the marketing,

31:15.320 --> 31:16.220
that's what they're trying to talk about.

31:16.220 --> 31:19.700
And the Linux part is really an implementation detail.

31:19.700 --> 31:20.900
Jeez, that's so true.

31:20.900 --> 31:24.620
Which is both like good and useful and maybe, right?

31:24.620 --> 31:25.500
And it does advance Linux,

31:25.500 --> 31:26.540
it brings people to Linux Foundation

31:26.540 --> 31:27.780
to see a lot of benefit from that, I think,

31:27.780 --> 31:32.080
but it's also like, do we lose sight of the core thing?

31:32.080 --> 31:34.160
Does that make it easier for Linux to then be replaced

31:34.160 --> 31:35.740
as a component of that ecosystem?

31:35.740 --> 31:36.580
I don't know.

31:36.580 --> 31:38.600
Yeah, something that we've been kicking around here,

31:38.600 --> 31:41.620
like if you can take Docker containers

31:41.620 --> 31:43.580
and you can run them on macOS,

31:43.580 --> 31:45.380
if you have Bash on Windows,

31:46.700 --> 31:49.300
you go to a tech conference like DockerCon,

31:49.300 --> 31:50.400
they're all MacBooks.

31:50.400 --> 31:54.020
You just go search for hashtag DockerCon on Twitter

31:54.020 --> 31:57.620
and then sort by images, it's all MacBooks.

31:57.620 --> 32:00.240
It's on, DrupalCon's going on this week.

32:00.240 --> 32:02.260
I'm doing the same exercise.

32:02.260 --> 32:03.260
I'm working on a project

32:03.260 --> 32:05.140
and so I'm following all these conferences

32:05.140 --> 32:07.220
and no one I notice when we go to these things.

32:07.220 --> 32:08.380
And I gotta tell you, it's all MacBooks.

32:08.380 --> 32:10.940
So you got MacBooks with Bash terminals

32:10.940 --> 32:12.220
and Docker containers.

32:12.220 --> 32:15.740
You got Windows machines with Ubuntu in a terminal

32:15.740 --> 32:17.820
and the ability to run Docker containers.

32:20.260 --> 32:23.940
It feels like Linux has been recently gaining a lot of ground

32:23.940 --> 32:27.180
for the DevOps web developer type role.

32:27.180 --> 32:28.380
I mean, look at Project Sputnik

32:28.380 --> 32:30.440
and the year over year 100% growth

32:30.440 --> 32:33.260
they're having there selling to developers.

32:33.260 --> 32:36.100
But why the hell does a developer need to use Linux

32:36.100 --> 32:38.420
if the Bash shell and containers

32:39.300 --> 32:41.380
are on their favorite OS that they're used to

32:41.380 --> 32:42.440
and they've been using for years?

32:42.440 --> 32:44.180
Where's the motivation to switch?

32:44.180 --> 32:46.100
Where's the platform advantage?

32:46.100 --> 32:48.180
Am I overthinking?

32:48.180 --> 32:51.420
It seems like just as we're finally gaining a foothold

32:51.420 --> 32:53.060
with a certain type of user,

32:53.060 --> 32:55.500
all of the things that are driving users to that

32:55.500 --> 32:57.440
are beginning to vanish in front of us.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.700
Yes, it means that the server world

33:00.700 --> 33:01.660
of Linux and the desktop world

33:01.660 --> 33:04.020
are even farther apart than they have been in the past.

33:04.020 --> 33:07.340
There's no reason to use Linux on the desktop really anymore

33:07.340 --> 33:08.340
unless you want to.

33:09.240 --> 33:10.540
Which is fine.

33:10.540 --> 33:11.580
Right, and maybe it's good.

33:11.580 --> 33:14.540
But I was sure enjoying the competitive advantage we had

33:14.540 --> 33:17.340
where there was like, you couldn't reproduce production

33:17.340 --> 33:19.860
unless you also ran it on your laptop or desktop.

33:19.860 --> 33:22.620
And now with containers, now with Bash on Linux

33:22.620 --> 33:23.800
or Bash on Windows.

33:23.800 --> 33:27.040
And I feel like there's at least a small subset of users

33:27.040 --> 33:28.880
that have misconceptions

33:28.880 --> 33:30.440
or those people that tried it 10 years ago

33:30.440 --> 33:32.280
when it was really rough or other things

33:32.280 --> 33:34.920
that before they had that incentive to give it a try

33:34.920 --> 33:36.120
and maybe they would find something they like

33:36.120 --> 33:36.960
but now they can just be like,

33:36.960 --> 33:38.800
well, then I'll just keep using my MacBook.

33:38.800 --> 33:39.640
Why did I change?

33:39.640 --> 33:41.040
Right.

33:41.040 --> 33:41.880
Or Windows.

33:41.880 --> 33:42.700
Or Windows, yeah.

33:42.700 --> 33:45.880
I mean, Windows has become a much better option.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.400
Right, I got the Linux subsystem.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.720
I can run Bash if I need to.

33:49.720 --> 33:53.200
I can SSH into a VPS when that doesn't work.

33:53.200 --> 33:56.640
Oh, oh, and now with, oh, I just, all right.

33:56.640 --> 33:58.160
Well, it's not gonna be Thunderbird

33:58.160 --> 33:59.100
that's moving them over to Linux

33:59.100 --> 34:00.800
but let's talk about Thunderbird here for a second

34:00.800 --> 34:02.700
because it's a topic that's come up on this show before

34:02.700 --> 34:05.680
that I was met with a surprising amount of interest.

34:05.680 --> 34:09.400
And there is a proposal to start a new implementation

34:09.400 --> 34:13.660
of Thunderbird based on web technologies.

34:13.660 --> 34:14.800
Now, does that mean Electron?

34:14.800 --> 34:16.300
What do you mean when you say web technologies?

34:16.300 --> 34:17.140
What does that mean?

34:17.140 --> 34:17.960
Yeah, I don't know.

34:17.960 --> 34:19.040
Because isn't Thunderbird already based,

34:19.040 --> 34:21.040
isn't Thunderbird based on web technologies

34:21.040 --> 34:22.760
by the very fact that it's like a Zool app

34:22.760 --> 34:25.320
that runs on top of the Gecko engine?

34:25.320 --> 34:26.160
I mean, isn't that kind of?

34:26.160 --> 34:28.080
But those are old web technologies.

34:28.080 --> 34:28.920
We don't talk about those anymore.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.640
Oh, okay, I see, I see, okay.

34:30.640 --> 34:33.520
New web technologies like Electron and WebKit, right?

34:33.520 --> 34:35.560
No, so here's the point they make

34:35.560 --> 34:38.120
and how are you gonna ignore this.

34:38.120 --> 34:39.180
Their base is going away.

34:39.180 --> 34:42.760
What Thunderbird is based on is going away.

34:42.760 --> 34:45.080
This is reality.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.040
Gecko is gonna change dramatically in the future.

34:47.040 --> 34:47.860
It already is.

34:47.860 --> 34:50.940
They're dropping features that Firefox does not need anymore

34:50.940 --> 34:53.840
but Thunderbird clearly relies on.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.680
Plus, the Thunderbird code base is now 20 years old.

34:58.280 --> 35:00.740
JavaScript and HTML5 have evolved dramatically

35:00.740 --> 35:02.320
since they created this application.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.300
They think a rewrite in JavaScript makes sense now.

35:07.360 --> 35:10.380
He, in this article, points out that,

35:10.380 --> 35:12.240
look, this is a Zool app

35:13.140 --> 35:17.600
and Firefox is discontinuing Zool extensions.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.320
They're killing off small projects this way.

35:19.320 --> 35:20.840
I mean, it's just the reality.

35:20.840 --> 35:23.320
It's a cut that goes to the base of Firefox

35:23.320 --> 35:26.080
and they did that because these extensions

35:26.080 --> 35:28.440
are sort of holding back internal architecture improvements

35:28.440 --> 35:30.280
that they've been trying to make.

35:30.280 --> 35:33.220
And also, the Thunderbird base is based entirely

35:33.220 --> 35:37.280
on the XPCOM, the back end communication module,

35:37.280 --> 35:39.020
XPCOM, whatever it's called,

35:39.020 --> 35:40.440
and Zool for the user interface.

35:40.440 --> 35:43.040
So if you take away XPCOM and you take away Zool,

35:43.040 --> 35:45.240
which Firefox is doing,

35:45.240 --> 35:47.340
you've effectively taken away Thunderbird

35:47.340 --> 35:49.840
and they're gonna have to rewrite anyways.

35:49.840 --> 35:50.680
This is a huge problem.

35:50.680 --> 35:52.280
This is a huge problem

35:52.280 --> 35:54.320
for a project that's already struggling

35:54.320 --> 35:56.960
and understaffed or funded or whatever.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.920
Yeah, that was basically put on the shelf

35:58.920 --> 36:00.520
in maintenance mode.

36:00.520 --> 36:02.580
And this week too, I don't know if it's related,

36:02.580 --> 36:06.020
but there's been some folks posting mock-ups

36:06.020 --> 36:08.560
of what a new Thunderbird could look like.

36:08.560 --> 36:09.380
It's not bad.

36:09.380 --> 36:10.840
It looks like a web browser a bit to me.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.880
It does, yeah, very much so.

36:12.880 --> 36:14.440
That's a crew, oh no, that's, yeah.

36:14.440 --> 36:16.000
Yeah, that would be their Thunderbird,

36:16.000 --> 36:17.720
this would be their Thunderbird redesign right here.

36:17.720 --> 36:18.840
It's kind of nice.

36:18.840 --> 36:21.040
Could be worse.

36:21.040 --> 36:22.640
I've moved on in myself,

36:22.640 --> 36:24.700
so I have a hard time connecting with this story.

36:24.700 --> 36:28.120
I found Thunderbird to be really, really my go-to

36:28.120 --> 36:30.160
for many, many, many, many, many years.

36:30.160 --> 36:32.040
Especially with Enigma, like it was so hard

36:32.040 --> 36:33.720
to get away from Thunderbird and Enigma combo,

36:33.720 --> 36:35.720
which is a great, easy, simple way

36:35.720 --> 36:38.640
to do GPG encryption in your email client.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.760
Just gorgeous, beautiful, love it.

36:40.760 --> 36:43.360
It's the greatest encryption I hear from the people.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.200
It's the best.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.020
I can't, I can't, I can't.

36:45.020 --> 36:45.860
I'm not a very good Trump impressionist.

36:45.860 --> 36:47.000
I can't work on my Trump impression.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.360
For a new Linux user.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.180
I've moved on.

36:49.180 --> 36:50.020
What would you recommend?

36:50.020 --> 36:52.160
If they want, they don't want web-based email,

36:52.160 --> 36:53.000
they want a client.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.160
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

36:55.160 --> 36:56.240
For me, it's N1,

36:56.240 --> 36:58.240
but I can't recommend the latest to everybody

36:58.240 --> 37:01.440
because there's other issues people have with it.

37:01.440 --> 37:05.060
Kmail is still just as quirky as Kmail ever was.

37:05.060 --> 37:07.880
And, I mean, I just don't, I don't know.

37:07.880 --> 37:11.200
Geary was my go-to, but Geary kind of faded,

37:11.200 --> 37:14.040
and now it's merged with elementary OS.

37:14.040 --> 37:15.400
Claws gets mentioned a lot.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.240
Claws does, yeah.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.060
Yep, Claws does.

37:17.060 --> 37:17.900
I don't have a ton of Claws experience.

37:17.900 --> 37:18.740
True.

37:18.740 --> 37:19.560
What about you?

37:19.560 --> 37:20.400
What's your answer to this?

37:20.400 --> 37:21.240
I don't, you know,

37:21.240 --> 37:22.760
I just end up using web mail most of the time.

37:22.760 --> 37:24.080
What if somebody comes to you and says,

37:24.080 --> 37:24.920
Wes, I'm moving to Linux, and I just.

37:24.920 --> 37:27.960
I would probably say, try Nihilus.

37:27.960 --> 37:28.800
Really?

37:28.800 --> 37:29.640
Yeah.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.560
I mean, it depends on the person.

37:32.560 --> 37:36.520
If they were, you know, more computer savvy, maybe not.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.000
Maybe I would, I would maybe say Kmail or Claws

37:39.000 --> 37:40.480
or something like that, but.

37:40.480 --> 37:41.640
Yeah, and Elias has the advantage

37:41.640 --> 37:43.580
of being very easy to use,

37:43.580 --> 37:45.760
and it has features that people expect,

37:45.760 --> 37:47.440
like the ability to snooze emails

37:47.440 --> 37:48.960
and follow up and.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.960
And the interface is pretty nice and responsive

37:50.960 --> 37:52.800
and rich in a way that people coming

37:52.800 --> 37:54.440
from other platforms might like.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.400
I don't know how I feel about having to say that,

37:56.400 --> 37:57.760
but that's probably what I'd say.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.320
So maybe it is time for a Thunderbird reboot.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.160
Yeah.

38:00.160 --> 38:00.980
At least in our world.

38:00.980 --> 38:02.800
Because I mean, I do think it's important that we have,

38:02.800 --> 38:04.600
I mean, I don't know how important we can debate that,

38:04.600 --> 38:07.640
but it would be nice to have a good,

38:07.640 --> 38:10.560
open source, free software email client

38:10.560 --> 38:11.920
that people can come to and use,

38:11.920 --> 38:14.440
and that is well supported and modern and good.

38:14.440 --> 38:17.880
A lot of love for Claws in the chat room right now.

38:17.880 --> 38:18.720
Look at this.

38:18.720 --> 38:19.560
Yeah.

38:19.560 --> 38:21.440
I know it's producer Michael's favorite too, I think.

38:21.440 --> 38:22.920
So a lot of love for Claws.

38:22.920 --> 38:25.320
Look at the beard trolling us with his wood dust bail.

38:25.320 --> 38:26.480
Oh my gosh.

38:26.480 --> 38:27.640
Can't even with you right now.

38:27.640 --> 38:28.480
Get out of the air.

38:28.480 --> 38:30.040
I do use Evolution sometimes.

38:30.040 --> 38:31.200
I have on occasion.

38:31.200 --> 38:32.040
The nice thing about Ev,

38:32.040 --> 38:34.420
the nice thing about that is the,

38:35.780 --> 38:37.800
it's still sort of baked in a gnome in some sense.

38:37.800 --> 38:40.560
Like when you use some of the online account stuff.

38:40.560 --> 38:42.520
One of the things that the internet

38:42.520 --> 38:43.720
was saying a lot about Thunderbird

38:43.720 --> 38:46.120
is it needs to have native exchange support,

38:46.120 --> 38:46.960
which I guess is still a big thing.

38:46.960 --> 38:47.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:47.800 --> 38:48.620
That probably would add a lot.

38:48.620 --> 38:49.460
You can do it with a plugin, but.

38:49.460 --> 38:50.980
Yeah.

38:50.980 --> 38:51.820
I got a problem.

38:51.820 --> 38:52.920
I gotta, we gotta move on.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.200
We got a problem.

38:54.200 --> 38:55.760
We gotta do a little,

38:55.760 --> 38:57.440
you know, we should do the Linux Unplugged

38:57.440 --> 38:58.280
consultancy agency for some.

38:58.280 --> 38:59.440
Oh, I like that idea.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.920
Yeah, for some of these open source projects,

39:00.920 --> 39:03.560
because the folks behind the Unity 8 port

39:03.560 --> 39:05.160
could use a little consultancy.

39:06.680 --> 39:07.840
I'm not gonna give another stupid shit

39:07.840 --> 39:08.900
going on in their community right now,

39:08.900 --> 39:10.360
but there's a lot of dumb drama.

39:10.360 --> 39:14.520
And it all centers around one core problem.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.040
And I'm gonna tell you what it is here in just a minute.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.280
But so, for those of you that don't know,

39:18.280 --> 39:23.000
there is some rash, brave souls out there

39:23.000 --> 39:24.760
that have been fighting the good fight

39:24.760 --> 39:27.880
when it comes to Ubuntu on the phone for years now.

39:27.880 --> 39:28.720
Yeah.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.000
Making it available to devices

39:30.000 --> 39:32.800
that Canonical didn't officially support.

39:32.800 --> 39:36.320
And that group decided, let's take on the Unity 8 desktop.

39:36.320 --> 39:38.640
We will continue it, which, brilliant.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.000
You know, in an open source, when a door closes,

39:41.000 --> 39:41.840
a window opens.

39:41.840 --> 39:42.760
I think that's the saying.

39:42.760 --> 39:45.480
When you take a leak and flush it, right, that's the saying?

39:45.480 --> 39:47.600
That is a brilliant philosophy,

39:47.600 --> 39:50.240
one that brought us the Nautilus file manager today.

39:50.240 --> 39:52.720
The great files file manager

39:52.720 --> 39:55.680
that has been of much controversy in GNOME

39:55.680 --> 39:58.240
actually was called Nautilus,

39:58.240 --> 40:00.920
and it was created by a company called Easel

40:00.920 --> 40:03.000
that was trying to do this crazy thing.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.560
Get ready for this, Wes.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.160
Server-side storage and integration with the file manager.

40:07.160 --> 40:08.120
That's crazy.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.400
Yeah, they didn't call it cloud back then.

40:09.400 --> 40:10.720
That's, you have to say cloud.

40:10.720 --> 40:11.560
Right.

40:11.560 --> 40:12.400
We didn't learn that yet, though.

40:12.400 --> 40:13.800
No, it was just an online storage service.

40:13.800 --> 40:14.640
Yeah.

40:14.640 --> 40:15.480
See, that sounds expensive.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.400
And they were gonna integrate it

40:16.400 --> 40:19.040
into their Easel file manager called Nautilus,

40:19.040 --> 40:20.520
and that's how they're gonna make money.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.440
And they were gonna make great tools

40:22.440 --> 40:25.520
to manage Linux desktop along with this file manager.

40:25.520 --> 40:28.000
Eventually, they had this customized desktop,

40:28.000 --> 40:30.200
the Easel desktop, that was like this respin of GNOME

40:30.200 --> 40:32.800
that was like the best implementation of GNOME you could find.

40:32.800 --> 40:36.360
You could even get it with a special software manager.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.920
It was the bee's knees, as the kids say.

40:39.920 --> 40:44.080
And nobody was interested in storing their files online.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.160
That is crazy, people said.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.080
I'm not just gonna hand my personal information

40:48.080 --> 40:50.080
over to some company and have them store it on their server.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.200
Then would I have to download it if I wanted to get it?

40:52.200 --> 40:53.040
How's that gonna work?

40:53.040 --> 40:54.040
That's ridiculous.

40:54.040 --> 40:56.200
So, Easel eventually went out of business.

40:56.200 --> 40:59.280
But they had, by the day's standards,

40:59.280 --> 41:01.760
created one of the best file managers for Linux.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.120
Turns out it was open source,

41:03.120 --> 41:04.720
and so the community picked it up.

41:04.720 --> 41:07.240
And from the ashes of Easel,

41:07.240 --> 41:10.820
we have files that we still use on the GNOME desktop today.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.720
It's also used on Unity.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.280
It's been around.

41:15.280 --> 41:16.840
So, in that same spirit,

41:16.840 --> 41:18.960
the folks that wanted to continue on Unity 8,

41:18.960 --> 41:20.440
yeah, the commercial company behind it

41:20.440 --> 41:22.760
may be turning to a different direction,

41:22.760 --> 41:24.200
but we can continue Unity 8.

41:26.160 --> 41:27.800
Seems bold, seems brave,

41:27.800 --> 41:30.000
seems like in the spirit of open source.

41:30.000 --> 41:30.840
They made a problem, though.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.100
They made a real 2017 mistake.

41:33.100 --> 41:36.440
And it is hollowing the project out from the inside.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.320
It's gonna burn out the developers.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.000
It's souring the community.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.140
It's poisoning the well.

41:42.140 --> 41:43.880
And it's gonna stunt the project

41:43.880 --> 41:45.720
before they've even shipped some code.

41:48.720 --> 41:50.080
And the problem is,

41:50.080 --> 41:52.720
they've focused their community around Reddit.

41:53.620 --> 41:55.640
They thought they could start an initiative like this

41:55.640 --> 41:56.720
with a subreddit.

41:56.720 --> 42:01.720
So, you can go to reddit.com slash r slash unit Y-U-N-I-T

42:01.720 --> 42:03.440
and you can watch the train wreck for yourself.

42:03.440 --> 42:06.800
They can't even get a logo or a catchphrase together

42:06.800 --> 42:10.540
without all of the alpha geeks living on Reddit,

42:10.540 --> 42:11.660
shitting all over each other,

42:11.660 --> 42:13.640
and creating a massive invite.

42:13.640 --> 42:15.920
It is one of the best displays

42:15.920 --> 42:18.800
of how humans cannot work together out there right now.

42:18.800 --> 42:19.720
This is a rough threat.

42:19.720 --> 42:21.640
And I gotta tell you,

42:21.640 --> 42:23.340
if you have an open source project

42:23.340 --> 42:25.540
that you actually wanna build a community around,

42:25.540 --> 42:28.300
you have to build some of the infrastructure yourself.

42:28.300 --> 42:29.740
Go do it on Mastodon.

42:29.740 --> 42:31.960
Go do it on a forum.

42:31.960 --> 42:33.200
Do it on a mailing list.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.800
Do it in an IRC room.

42:34.800 --> 42:37.440
But for God's sakes, do not do it on Reddit.

42:37.440 --> 42:39.640
It will poison your project from the beginning.

42:39.640 --> 42:42.360
And unfortunately, we're watching this

42:42.360 --> 42:47.120
de-evolution of humanity right here for public display.

42:49.000 --> 42:49.960
It's really unfortunate.

42:49.960 --> 42:51.360
And I think it's a lesson

42:51.360 --> 42:53.120
that so many open source projects could take away.

42:53.120 --> 42:56.400
Do not base the center spoke of your community

42:56.400 --> 42:57.260
around Reddit.

42:57.260 --> 42:59.980
Because it's a place where people wanna go

42:59.980 --> 43:00.940
that have an opinion,

43:00.940 --> 43:03.820
and they think that they've gotta be

43:03.820 --> 43:04.740
the smartest guy in the room.

43:04.740 --> 43:06.060
And they've figured it out,

43:06.060 --> 43:07.020
and they're gonna tell you about it.

43:07.020 --> 43:09.900
And it is, it's shocking to watch this.

43:09.900 --> 43:11.600
And you have people saying,

43:11.600 --> 43:12.660
don't bother replying here.

43:12.660 --> 43:13.660
I won't be reading this.

43:13.660 --> 43:16.220
You have all kinds of typical

43:16.220 --> 43:19.120
man-child type behavior that happens.

43:19.120 --> 43:20.580
I don't see, I just,

43:20.580 --> 43:22.540
I don't see how this is gonna go anywhere.

43:22.540 --> 43:23.780
This is so unfortunate,

43:23.780 --> 43:25.100
because it's a project that's gonna have

43:25.100 --> 43:27.320
minimal community interest to begin with.

43:27.320 --> 43:28.420
Because let's be honest,

43:28.420 --> 43:30.820
it was never a massively popular project.

43:30.820 --> 43:32.620
We probably wouldn't be here today if it was,

43:32.620 --> 43:34.160
in this position we're in now.

43:34.160 --> 43:35.460
And to focus it around this,

43:35.460 --> 43:36.340
it's just such a shame.

43:36.340 --> 43:37.940
Because I would love to have seen

43:37.940 --> 43:40.860
what a modern QT desktop could look like.

43:40.860 --> 43:42.540
Maybe they'll still pull it out.

43:42.540 --> 43:45.040
But it's a little lesson we can all take away.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.660
Because the core problem,

43:47.660 --> 43:49.380
the thing that always made me leave hope,

43:49.380 --> 43:51.900
a little bit of hope for Ubuntu Mobile was,

43:51.900 --> 43:53.620
we've gotta do something about Android.

43:53.620 --> 43:55.540
I don't care if everybody does something about Android,

43:55.540 --> 43:56.380
but I would love to use it.

43:56.380 --> 43:58.040
I would like an option.

43:58.040 --> 43:59.480
I still would like an option.

43:59.480 --> 44:00.900
That has not changed.

44:00.900 --> 44:02.380
And I would love, even if it's a community.

44:02.380 --> 44:04.700
We're just a little more sad in the press.

44:04.700 --> 44:06.300
So a community project

44:07.300 --> 44:09.900
that gives us a legitimate,

44:09.900 --> 44:12.640
legitimate type image we could download one day,

44:12.640 --> 44:15.380
and flash to your Nexus slash Pixel devices,

44:16.380 --> 44:18.660
is absolutely something that interests me.

44:18.660 --> 44:23.540
So I hope that these early growing pains get worked out.

44:23.540 --> 44:26.420
Because my hopes are that one day,

44:26.420 --> 44:28.980
they can save us from the Android.

44:28.980 --> 44:31.540
Save us all from the Androids taking over our humanity.

44:31.540 --> 44:32.380
Exactly.

44:32.380 --> 44:33.200
Spying on us.

44:33.200 --> 44:34.180
Dun, dun, dun.

44:34.180 --> 44:35.380
All right, you know, let's talk about mobile.

44:35.380 --> 44:36.860
Let's talk about something you can do right now.

44:36.860 --> 44:38.040
That might all be out in the future,

44:38.040 --> 44:39.100
but there's something, there's action,

44:39.100 --> 44:40.900
there's something you can do.

44:40.900 --> 44:42.740
You can switch to Ting.

44:42.740 --> 44:44.300
This is such a great story, I'll tell you in just a second.

44:44.300 --> 44:46.860
But start by going to linux.ting.com.

44:46.860 --> 44:50.420
You go there, this is the landing page to support the show,

44:50.420 --> 44:52.900
and get $25 off a device.

44:52.900 --> 44:56.740
Or if you bring a compatible device, check their BYOD page.

44:56.740 --> 44:58.660
They'll give you $25 in service credit.

44:58.660 --> 44:59.940
You might have a device that already works,

44:59.940 --> 45:01.660
because it turns out cell phones have been around

45:01.660 --> 45:03.980
for a little while, and they've got a CDMA network,

45:03.980 --> 45:06.500
and a GSM network, so there's probably something

45:06.500 --> 45:07.480
in there that'll work for you.

45:07.480 --> 45:09.580
You get $25 in service credit then.

45:09.580 --> 45:11.460
Now Ting is pay for what you use mobile.

45:11.460 --> 45:12.820
Minutes, messages, and megabytes.

45:12.820 --> 45:13.640
You just pay for that.

45:13.640 --> 45:14.700
It's $6 for the line.

45:14.700 --> 45:16.180
Now here's the story.

45:16.180 --> 45:18.040
So Noah's out here visiting the studio.

45:18.040 --> 45:20.320
But he has a client that's like, no, I know you're busy,

45:20.320 --> 45:22.860
but I just really need to get my phone situation figured out.

45:22.860 --> 45:24.900
Can you please tell me which phone plan I should get?

45:24.900 --> 45:26.540
And she links him all the different options.

45:26.540 --> 45:28.780
And Noah's like, just look at all these different options.

45:28.780 --> 45:30.540
It's like 40 bucks a month for this line,

45:30.540 --> 45:32.940
$65 a month for this line, all these different things.

45:32.940 --> 45:35.300
And he goes, just go to linux.ting.com.

45:35.300 --> 45:37.300
And she goes to linux.ting.com, and she says,

45:37.300 --> 45:38.700
well, this can't be right.

45:38.700 --> 45:39.620
She writes him back.

45:39.620 --> 45:43.620
She's like, how can, I just did the savings calculator,

45:43.620 --> 45:45.900
and for my phone it's gonna be $12 a month.

45:45.900 --> 45:47.100
How can this be right?

45:47.100 --> 45:47.940
This can't be right.

45:47.940 --> 45:50.020
And Noah's like, yes, that is exactly right.

45:50.020 --> 45:50.900
It's that simple.

45:50.900 --> 45:53.060
She said, it's so simple, this can't be right.

45:53.060 --> 45:54.100
It can't be right.

45:56.020 --> 45:57.260
That's the funny thing.

45:57.260 --> 45:59.580
It's the rest of the industry that's wrong.

45:59.580 --> 46:00.780
That's the funny thing.

46:00.780 --> 46:02.060
They've all got it wrong,

46:02.060 --> 46:04.540
and we've just all gone along with it.

46:04.540 --> 46:09.060
We've just all, well, it's like the boiling pot, isn't it?

46:09.060 --> 46:13.300
We've just, we grew up in an environment, I started,

46:13.300 --> 46:15.300
I started with my folks having these huge phones,

46:15.300 --> 46:17.260
and I had a pager, and I thought that was cool.

46:17.260 --> 46:19.540
And I would have taken any plan they gave me.

46:19.540 --> 46:21.500
And then when these phones started coming out,

46:21.500 --> 46:23.660
for all, VoiceStream, I got on VoiceStream,

46:23.660 --> 46:25.540
I got all these different plans, tried all these different,

46:25.540 --> 46:27.020
anything they would give me, I would take it.

46:27.020 --> 46:28.100
Anything I would take,

46:28.100 --> 46:30.540
because it was such an incredible new technology.

46:30.540 --> 46:33.140
But now, here we are in 2017, looking back at it,

46:33.140 --> 46:34.180
we got snow jobbed.

46:35.140 --> 46:37.740
Why am I paying for minutes and messages and megabytes

46:37.740 --> 46:38.900
I never even use?

46:38.900 --> 46:40.260
That's crazy.

46:40.260 --> 46:41.660
Why am I getting in these agreements?

46:41.660 --> 46:43.380
Don't call it a contract, it's an agreement.

46:43.380 --> 46:44.980
This is insanity.

46:46.060 --> 46:47.700
You can make a difference by voting with your wallet.

46:47.700 --> 46:51.020
Linux.ting.com, you go there, you sign up, oh!

46:51.020 --> 46:53.220
No contract, nor the termination fee,

46:53.220 --> 46:57.020
and if you're a business with like 11 to 20 employees,

46:57.020 --> 47:01.260
there is like a 99.999999% chance you're gonna save money.

47:01.260 --> 47:02.100
It's so awesome.

47:02.100 --> 47:04.220
And they got a great blog too, you can check it out.

47:04.220 --> 47:06.820
Just start by going to linux.ting.com,

47:06.820 --> 47:09.540
and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring

47:09.540 --> 47:11.220
the Linux Unplugged program, linux.ting.

47:11.220 --> 47:12.300
So here's something that's relevant.

47:12.300 --> 47:13.340
What do you have here?

47:13.340 --> 47:15.020
Hello, it says, hello, what is this?

47:15.020 --> 47:16.140
Take a look.

47:16.140 --> 47:19.580
That is my pixel replacement, the first one died.

47:19.580 --> 47:20.420
Oh, really?

47:20.420 --> 47:21.940
Yeah, so I've been forced to use.

47:21.940 --> 47:22.900
I noticed.

47:22.900 --> 47:25.180
I know, I was like, why is he on his Nexus 5 again?

47:25.180 --> 47:26.940
So you got the new phone today?

47:26.940 --> 47:28.660
I got it yesterday, I didn't have time last night

47:28.660 --> 47:30.100
to set it up, I know, right?

47:30.100 --> 47:31.300
So I was like, wow.

47:31.300 --> 47:33.620
So it comes in a, here, do I have a, yeah.

47:33.620 --> 47:35.940
So it comes in a hello box, look at that.

47:35.940 --> 47:37.620
Pretty cute.

47:37.620 --> 47:40.980
Yeah, and it's still all wrapped up too with, whoo!

47:40.980 --> 47:41.820
No!

47:43.460 --> 47:44.980
No!

47:44.980 --> 47:47.340
Not the best packaging, I think, is what we learned.

47:47.340 --> 47:48.740
I should have planned that as a bit.

47:48.740 --> 47:49.740
I just dropped it.

47:49.740 --> 47:52.140
I just dropped it on the wood floor in the studio here.

47:52.140 --> 47:54.060
All right, all right, here we go.

47:54.060 --> 47:55.740
Wes, it's got this big crack across it.

47:55.740 --> 47:57.260
I'm kidding, it's totally fine.

47:57.260 --> 47:59.380
This is a nice-feeling phone.

47:59.380 --> 48:00.500
It is a nice-feeling phone.

48:00.500 --> 48:01.340
And this is really nice.

48:01.340 --> 48:04.300
So can you, did you just take the SIM out of your old one,

48:04.300 --> 48:05.620
put it in that, and now you can move it into this,

48:05.620 --> 48:06.580
or did you have to do something fancier?

48:06.580 --> 48:09.500
No, I had a prepaid plan on my old phone,

48:09.500 --> 48:10.940
so I just activated a month of that,

48:10.940 --> 48:12.100
and then I'll go back to.

48:12.100 --> 48:13.300
So you'll just be able to, yeah,

48:13.300 --> 48:15.300
that's so you don't even have to worry about it.

48:15.300 --> 48:17.300
That is nice, smooth move, Wes.

48:17.300 --> 48:19.420
Well, does it not come with a charger?

48:19.420 --> 48:22.060
No, so you keep your original charger and everything,

48:22.060 --> 48:23.460
and then you just send back the phone.

48:23.460 --> 48:24.300
Oh, I see.

48:24.300 --> 48:25.140
A little package.

48:25.140 --> 48:26.620
So that's a specific replacement box.

48:26.620 --> 48:28.220
So I went through Google, talked to them,

48:28.220 --> 48:30.220
they got me a replacement and everything, so that's good.

48:30.220 --> 48:32.460
I'm happy about it, and I'm very happy

48:32.460 --> 48:35.060
to have a regular 27, you know, like a modern phone again.

48:35.060 --> 48:36.540
Does it feel like a huge downgrade?

48:36.540 --> 48:38.380
Oh, yes, oh, terribly, yes.

48:38.380 --> 48:39.740
I didn't, I mean, I knew I liked the phone,

48:39.740 --> 48:41.380
like it's been a really nice phone,

48:41.380 --> 48:42.780
but I really missed it when it was gone.

48:42.780 --> 48:44.140
Now you've, now you realize like, wow,

48:44.140 --> 48:46.060
I probably use this Nexus 5 longer than I needed to.

48:46.060 --> 48:47.540
Yes, exactly.

48:47.540 --> 48:48.540
The camera alone.

48:48.540 --> 48:49.380
Oh, I know.

48:49.380 --> 48:51.780
Wow, all right, well, so there's this huge announcement

48:51.780 --> 48:53.420
by the Linux Foundation.

48:53.420 --> 48:56.060
I wonder if anybody in the Mumble Room even saw it

48:56.060 --> 48:57.180
or could even explain it to me.

48:57.180 --> 49:00.100
Did anybody in the Mumble Room see this announcement

49:00.100 --> 49:01.500
by the Linux Foundation this week

49:01.500 --> 49:04.340
of the launch of Edge X Foundry?

49:04.340 --> 49:05.180
Anybody see this?

49:05.180 --> 49:06.020
Sorry, I haven't.

49:07.620 --> 49:08.460
Yeah.

49:08.460 --> 49:09.300
I missed it as well.

49:09.300 --> 49:10.740
I find this to be interesting,

49:10.740 --> 49:13.860
and I think it's because we all have IOT fatigue.

49:13.860 --> 49:15.140
That's a great phrase.

49:15.140 --> 49:17.500
I'm gonna run with that, IOT fatigue.

49:19.260 --> 49:23.540
I've heard now, I think it's one of the phrases

49:23.540 --> 49:26.260
that's taken off is the Internet of Shit,

49:26.260 --> 49:27.300
which feels a little clunky.

49:27.300 --> 49:28.860
Like, I wish we could do something with the T,

49:28.860 --> 49:30.620
you know, to keep the IOT acronym,

49:30.620 --> 49:33.060
like the Internet of Terrible might be better

49:33.060 --> 49:35.860
because you're keeping the T, but anyways.

49:35.860 --> 49:38.700
Otherwise it's iOS, that's overloaded enough.

49:38.700 --> 49:39.540
It's true.

49:39.540 --> 49:41.620
I don't know why this isn't,

49:41.620 --> 49:43.300
so I suspect, actually, I do know why.

49:43.300 --> 49:44.900
I suspect this is why this is not making

49:44.900 --> 49:45.940
a big splash in our crowd,

49:45.940 --> 49:47.980
is because we all glaze over when we hear this.

49:47.980 --> 49:50.660
And what this is, this Edge X Foundry,

49:50.660 --> 49:54.180
is actually something that is going to,

49:54.180 --> 49:55.980
it's going to shift IOT into a direction

49:55.980 --> 49:58.540
that I think everyone listening to this show would like.

49:58.540 --> 50:01.020
It basically takes it out of the cloud

50:01.020 --> 50:04.700
and it puts it in your LAN.

50:04.700 --> 50:05.700
Yeah, it's actually-

50:05.700 --> 50:06.540
I'm scared, Chris.

50:06.540 --> 50:07.380
Are you scared?

50:07.380 --> 50:09.740
Buckle up, Wes.

50:09.740 --> 50:11.220
See, I don't like IOT,

50:11.220 --> 50:13.380
and if it's on other people's computers in the cloud,

50:13.380 --> 50:14.340
then I feel safer.

50:15.220 --> 50:19.620
So I have a little insider story here.

50:19.620 --> 50:21.740
I'll give you a little background before we start.

50:21.740 --> 50:25.300
While we were at Dell in Austin, Texas recently,

50:25.300 --> 50:27.540
there was a lab they took us into.

50:27.540 --> 50:29.380
And actually, just walking by, you'd have no idea.

50:29.380 --> 50:33.380
It's called the CTO Lab.

50:33.380 --> 50:34.980
It's called like the CTO Lab or something like that.

50:34.980 --> 50:37.460
You'd have no idea what it is.

50:37.460 --> 50:39.020
And in this lab,

50:39.020 --> 50:43.020
they're using these purpose-built hardware devices.

50:43.020 --> 50:45.700
They're like, they're x86 rigs,

50:45.700 --> 50:47.800
but they look like tiny arm systems

50:47.800 --> 50:50.420
where they have like the thin cooling on the sides

50:50.420 --> 50:52.460
and they have antennas coming off them

50:52.460 --> 50:55.780
and they're ruggedized x86 computers.

50:55.780 --> 50:59.020
And the ones I was looking at was running Ubuntu core.

50:59.020 --> 51:01.300
So they're testing a lot of this stuff with Ubuntu.

51:01.300 --> 51:05.620
And the whole idea is IoT is fun.

51:05.620 --> 51:07.640
And this is literally, I don't know if I'm,

51:07.640 --> 51:09.380
this is literally what Dell told me.

51:09.380 --> 51:11.580
IoT for the home looks fun,

51:11.580 --> 51:14.380
but let's be honest, they say, Amazon's won that.

51:14.380 --> 51:18.700
Like Amazon with the Echo has just,

51:18.700 --> 51:19.620
dude, you're not gonna,

51:19.620 --> 51:20.820
like Dell's not gonna come out

51:20.820 --> 51:22.740
with an Echo competitor, right?

51:22.740 --> 51:24.420
I'm like, yeah, you're right.

51:24.420 --> 51:26.380
How refreshing is it that finally some company

51:26.380 --> 51:28.220
just go acknowledges, yeah, there's a market leader there

51:28.220 --> 51:30.020
and we're probably not gonna unseat them.

51:30.020 --> 51:31.500
But you know what Dell said is like,

51:31.500 --> 51:34.500
there's really nothing like this for the enterprise.

51:34.500 --> 51:35.340
And the enterprise-

51:35.340 --> 51:36.160
And that's their game.

51:36.160 --> 51:37.000
Yeah, and it has, and the enterprise

51:37.000 --> 51:38.500
has a much bigger problem to solve.

51:38.500 --> 51:41.340
And if you think about it, like in manufacturing,

51:41.340 --> 51:43.420
either be like food manufacturing

51:43.420 --> 51:45.140
or even car manufacturing,

51:45.140 --> 51:46.700
there's so much equipment that's kicking off

51:46.700 --> 51:49.540
on schedules and stuff where you could be getting data,

51:49.540 --> 51:52.260
like motion sensors, pressure sensors,

51:52.260 --> 51:55.540
temperature sensors, like IoT, if you'll call it that,

51:55.540 --> 51:57.340
it's basically remote sensor devices

51:57.340 --> 52:00.940
and network connected devices, has real practical advantages

52:00.940 --> 52:03.820
in the enterprise and nobody's trying to solve that problem.

52:03.820 --> 52:06.080
So what EdgeX Foundry is,

52:06.080 --> 52:08.420
it's a Linux Foundation initiative

52:08.420 --> 52:10.700
where Dell is seeding the initial technology

52:10.700 --> 52:13.180
to try to make a standard framework,

52:13.180 --> 52:15.980
all these different vendors, IoT devices can plug in

52:15.980 --> 52:18.820
and you can do local LAN management.

52:18.820 --> 52:20.020
And so I think, whoa, hello there.

52:20.020 --> 52:20.860
Hi there. Hello.

52:20.860 --> 52:22.180
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.020
I guess it's time for us to start the show, Wes.

52:24.020 --> 52:25.420
Yeah, we're late.

52:25.420 --> 52:27.700
Yeah. Whoops.

52:27.700 --> 52:31.860
And it's actually probably solving the problem

52:31.860 --> 52:34.020
that so many of us have with IoT,

52:34.020 --> 52:35.540
where it's like, you have to give everything

52:35.540 --> 52:37.820
over to the cloud, they have all of your data,

52:37.820 --> 52:40.620
and there's other problems that brings in for businesses.

52:40.620 --> 52:43.320
And I think EdgeX Foundry is gonna solve all of it.

52:43.320 --> 52:45.740
So I got just a couple of minutes and we got some footage.

52:45.740 --> 52:47.160
I had to sit on it for a little while,

52:47.160 --> 52:49.040
but now I can share it with you guys

52:49.040 --> 52:50.700
to give you a little insight on what this is

52:50.700 --> 52:52.380
and why the Linux Foundation is calling this

52:52.380 --> 52:54.380
their largest announcement ever.

52:54.380 --> 52:59.180
We're here in the CTO lab, talking IoT.

52:59.180 --> 53:00.020
How about that?

53:00.020 --> 53:02.780
And this is Jim, and Jim's gonna give us a walk around

53:02.780 --> 53:05.260
to some of the tours, give us a couple of demos.

53:05.260 --> 53:07.380
I'm looking around, I'm just seeing all kinds

53:07.380 --> 53:10.660
of really great devices, like that guy right there.

53:10.660 --> 53:12.780
There's some hardware over here.

53:12.780 --> 53:14.220
So where should we start?

53:14.220 --> 53:16.180
We'll start in our mini lab, let's do it.

53:16.180 --> 53:17.940
During our visit to Dell, there was one thing

53:17.940 --> 53:20.500
we couldn't share with you just yet.

53:20.500 --> 53:22.780
So we're gonna save this for three weeks.

53:22.780 --> 53:24.860
Future Chris and though, save this for three weeks.

53:24.860 --> 53:28.140
Dell and the Linux Foundation are launching EdgeX Foundry,

53:28.140 --> 53:31.500
an initiative that aims to build a common framework

53:31.500 --> 53:35.500
to make IoT usable in the enterprise.

53:35.500 --> 53:37.860
The problem we have in IoT is that all these different

53:37.860 --> 53:40.780
types of devices that speak all these different protocols,

53:40.780 --> 53:43.460
everything from BLE to Modbus and BACnet,

53:43.460 --> 53:45.660
which are ancient protocols, at least by most

53:45.660 --> 53:48.220
of our standards, they all speak a different format,

53:48.220 --> 53:49.780
they speak a different language.

53:49.780 --> 53:51.980
How do you bring those all into a single platform?

53:51.980 --> 53:52.820
Yeah, exactly.

53:52.820 --> 53:54.060
And then make it available to people

53:54.060 --> 53:55.620
like you and I to actually use.

53:55.620 --> 53:59.100
That's what our platform called EdgeX Foundry is about.

53:59.100 --> 54:01.780
It's a software platform that allows us to bring

54:01.780 --> 54:05.660
all that data in, normalize it to a single format,

54:05.660 --> 54:08.100
and then make it available to your cloud or enterprise,

54:08.100 --> 54:10.460
as well as be able to control things

54:10.460 --> 54:13.380
at what we call the edge, that's the name, EdgeX Foundry.

54:13.380 --> 54:15.100
If you can't control things at the edge,

54:15.100 --> 54:18.340
it's too much data and it's too slow for reaction.

54:18.340 --> 54:20.420
And we'll talk and show that here in a second.

54:20.420 --> 54:22.540
So you're right, right here we're seeing

54:22.540 --> 54:24.580
just a little visual, a little graphic

54:24.580 --> 54:26.700
of the data coming off of, in this case,

54:26.700 --> 54:29.060
the gyroscope and this Bosch sensor.

54:29.060 --> 54:30.740
So you're seeing the ups and downs of that.

54:30.740 --> 54:32.300
In fact, we always have fun with those sensors

54:32.300 --> 54:33.220
when we take them out of the road,

54:33.220 --> 54:34.100
we throw them around the room,

54:34.100 --> 54:36.580
you get big spikes up and down.

54:36.580 --> 54:38.220
We also get to see who drops them

54:38.220 --> 54:40.420
and watch them go to the floor.

54:40.420 --> 54:42.380
So that's the collection of data,

54:42.380 --> 54:44.340
or example of a collection of data

54:44.340 --> 54:47.940
by our EdgeX Foundry software into our gateway.

54:47.940 --> 54:50.060
That's one job of the system,

54:50.060 --> 54:52.260
collect data and make it available.

54:52.260 --> 54:55.220
Second job is to be able to offer the ability

54:55.220 --> 54:56.940
to do what we call actuation,

54:56.940 --> 54:59.980
which means respond to data you see coming in

54:59.980 --> 55:01.220
and take some action.

55:01.220 --> 55:03.260
But it also solves a big problem

55:03.260 --> 55:05.060
I never really thought much about.

55:05.060 --> 55:06.940
More importantly though, it's not just about

55:06.940 --> 55:10.300
gathering data and being able to actuate back down.

55:10.300 --> 55:12.060
It's being able to do those in combination,

55:12.060 --> 55:14.860
meaning you have to have what we call edge analytics,

55:14.860 --> 55:18.940
or some smarts, some intelligence on that gateway

55:18.940 --> 55:20.980
that's watching all the data come in

55:20.980 --> 55:23.380
and being able to translate that back down actions

55:23.380 --> 55:25.300
down to your systems.

55:25.300 --> 55:30.300
Say for example, if we moved that punch machine here,

55:30.420 --> 55:32.220
I'm gonna lower that arm down.

55:33.860 --> 55:37.020
Get the little mouse on there, right?

55:37.020 --> 55:39.180
Beep, beep, beep.

55:39.180 --> 55:40.700
Sending off the signal there.

55:40.700 --> 55:42.140
Actually, I did it the wrong way.

55:42.140 --> 55:43.500
I moved it up and it was already up,

55:43.500 --> 55:46.460
so let me move it in the other direction here.

55:46.460 --> 55:48.180
So there we go.

55:48.180 --> 55:52.060
You'll notice the sound came out of that pat line.

55:52.060 --> 55:54.340
That's a rules engine that's running

55:54.340 --> 55:55.900
as part of our edge x foundry

55:55.900 --> 55:59.140
that's in this case looking for movement on that arm.

55:59.140 --> 56:01.180
There's no way that's triggered as long as you want.

56:01.180 --> 56:03.940
But you can see it happening for lots of different devices

56:03.940 --> 56:05.500
for lots of different business.

56:05.500 --> 56:07.660
Exactly, you maybe have a proximity sensor

56:07.660 --> 56:09.500
that shuts the machine off

56:09.500 --> 56:11.420
if your arm gets too close to it.

56:11.420 --> 56:13.540
That's the intelligence you want at the edge.

56:13.540 --> 56:14.460
They can be that quick?

56:14.460 --> 56:15.700
They can be that quick.

56:15.700 --> 56:18.140
As you see here, we're not exactly real time

56:18.140 --> 56:19.780
yet, but pretty darn close, right?

56:19.780 --> 56:21.820
Enough where you can send off a sensor like that

56:21.820 --> 56:23.060
in seconds.

56:23.940 --> 56:27.140
You don't want to operate your automobile airbag

56:27.140 --> 56:28.900
with our edge x foundry yet,

56:28.900 --> 56:31.140
but we're getting close to doing that.

56:31.140 --> 56:33.340
That's what local intelligence is all about.

56:33.340 --> 56:34.900
That's why you need a gateway.

56:34.900 --> 56:37.940
You can't afford to let that data go all the way to the cloud

56:37.940 --> 56:39.060
all the way back down.

56:39.060 --> 56:39.900
It's too late.

56:39.900 --> 56:40.740
Somebody's lost an arm.

56:40.740 --> 56:42.140
It's not just about security and privacy.

56:42.140 --> 56:43.180
It's also about timing.

56:43.180 --> 56:48.180
I hadn't even thought of that too late.

56:48.180 --> 56:49.740
Somebody's already lost an arm.

56:49.740 --> 56:52.460
Yeah, that's morbid, but true way to talk about that.

56:52.460 --> 56:54.660
And you know, it wasn't clear in the video there,

56:54.660 --> 56:58.460
but the system, the, the, the beep that the alarm beep

56:58.460 --> 57:00.380
was coming from a separate device.

57:00.380 --> 57:02.660
So there's like, you know, and they're talking

57:02.660 --> 57:04.420
what's great about, what's great about Dell is they have

57:04.420 --> 57:06.700
the resources to say, so they've gone into these businesses

57:06.700 --> 57:08.860
that already have like all of these systems

57:08.860 --> 57:12.660
and these, these things can connect this edge x foundry.

57:12.660 --> 57:14.960
It's based on an existing open source project

57:14.960 --> 57:18.100
that has been sort of merged with some other stuff.

57:18.100 --> 57:20.780
And Dell then went out and did some industry research

57:20.780 --> 57:22.500
and they found people that have like

57:22.500 --> 57:24.020
serial connected controllers.

57:24.020 --> 57:26.460
And they made that work with edge x foundry and yeah.

57:26.460 --> 57:29.700
So it's not, it's, it basically works with all of them.

57:29.700 --> 57:34.000
And then it gives, it gives people a framework to target

57:34.000 --> 57:36.300
if they want to make their device specifically compatible.

57:36.300 --> 57:39.140
And you can run this edge x foundry stuff on Linux.

57:39.140 --> 57:40.260
You can run it on windows.

57:40.260 --> 57:43.500
Dell has a combination of Ubuntu hardware and software

57:43.500 --> 57:45.020
that you can run it on top of.

57:45.020 --> 57:46.760
But there's 22 other companies involved.

57:46.760 --> 57:47.780
Right.

57:47.780 --> 57:49.740
Today Canonical announced they're one of them.

57:49.740 --> 57:52.560
And so that's a huge ass start.

57:52.560 --> 57:54.960
It's being head up by the Linux foundation.

57:54.960 --> 57:58.140
It's got a huge investment and initial seeding by Dell.

57:58.140 --> 57:59.720
It's got Canonical on board.

57:59.720 --> 58:02.120
And then you've got 22 other companies that are,

58:02.120 --> 58:04.560
that are device manufacturers and software makers

58:04.560 --> 58:05.980
that are going to work with this thing.

58:05.980 --> 58:08.520
And it might come, we might get to the point

58:08.520 --> 58:11.220
where the enterprise, because they got work to get done

58:11.220 --> 58:12.760
and money to be made,

58:12.760 --> 58:14.580
we'll get this IOT situation figured out.

58:14.580 --> 58:15.420
I know, isn't that funny?

58:15.420 --> 58:16.240
But it makes sense.

58:16.240 --> 58:17.080
Like, yeah, they have the money

58:17.080 --> 58:19.380
and they have like strict requirements about security,

58:19.380 --> 58:21.620
what things they are allowed to install or use.

58:21.620 --> 58:23.120
So that can drive a lot of things.

58:23.120 --> 58:26.280
Well, and when you think about it from a standpoint of,

58:26.280 --> 58:28.540
we want that machine to stop crushing

58:28.540 --> 58:30.680
before the guy's arm is totally lost.

58:30.680 --> 58:32.860
You do want something a little more fast,

58:32.860 --> 58:34.980
maybe gigabit speed, maybe not, you know,

58:34.980 --> 58:36.740
going up to the Amazon cloud

58:36.740 --> 58:38.900
and waiting for the API to respond.

58:38.900 --> 58:40.540
And you know, like that might just add

58:40.540 --> 58:42.220
a little bit of unnecessary delay.

58:42.220 --> 58:43.460
AWS is having an outage.

58:43.460 --> 58:46.460
No one use the paper crusher today.

58:46.460 --> 58:49.220
Now this is not going to work, is it?

58:49.220 --> 58:50.620
All right, before we move on from this,

58:50.620 --> 58:53.020
does anybody in the Mumble Room have any thoughts,

58:53.020 --> 58:55.180
questions, comments about any of this?

58:55.180 --> 58:56.240
You guys have been quiet for a bit.

58:56.240 --> 58:58.140
So I want to give anybody a chance in there.

58:58.140 --> 59:00.020
Charlie Brown, AU, are you new here?

59:00.020 --> 59:02.300
Are you welcome, welcome to the Mumble Room, sir.

59:02.300 --> 59:04.500
Hi, hi, Charlie Brown, AU.

59:04.500 --> 59:05.340
How you going, man?

59:05.340 --> 59:06.180
Not bad, thanks.

59:06.180 --> 59:07.020
Hey, so what do you think?

59:07.020 --> 59:08.540
Is this all crap, is it hype?

59:08.540 --> 59:10.780
Do you think there actually could be

59:10.780 --> 59:12.260
some actual value here?

59:14.860 --> 59:19.100
I don't know enough about it to have a view on it.

59:19.100 --> 59:20.540
I was hoping the segment would give you

59:20.540 --> 59:22.180
a little bit of an idea.

59:22.180 --> 59:23.460
I think, you know, for me, Charlie,

59:23.460 --> 59:27.820
it seems like, okay, oh, I get it in the business sense.

59:27.820 --> 59:30.980
I get where you would want Wi-Fi temperature sensors,

59:30.980 --> 59:32.820
and I get where you would want Bluetooth controllers,

59:32.820 --> 59:34.740
and I get where you'd want serial controlled stuff.

59:34.740 --> 59:37.820
I get Internet of Things in the business

59:37.820 --> 59:40.220
in a way that I don't necessarily get it in the home.

59:40.220 --> 59:43.140
Do you have any device, do you follow me?

59:43.140 --> 59:44.700
Do you have any devices in your home,

59:44.700 --> 59:45.940
or are you kind of on the same page?

59:45.940 --> 59:47.940
Like, I just don't get IoT for the home.

59:49.540 --> 59:52.900
I've got a Steam Link, which is like an armed device,

59:52.900 --> 59:55.900
and I want to actually get a Raspberry Pi

59:55.900 --> 59:57.800
to turn into a PFSense box,

59:57.800 --> 01:00:00.860
and I've actually got a Adreno Nano as well,

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:04.100
which I'm making a track IR out of.

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:08.180
Charlie, that's all sounding kind of thingy on the Internet.

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.580
That's getting close, Charlie, that's getting close.

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.540
Yeah, I've actually, what I have found it really useful for

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:16.700
is controlling my space heaters.

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.140
I know that sounds weird.

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:19.120
No, I get it, I get it.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:19.960
But with the-

01:00:19.960 --> 01:00:21.620
When you're cold, you don't want to move.

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:22.460
Well-

01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:25.300
I'd like some warm me up, cancel.

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:28.060
Actually, you say that, but it's funny.

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:31.180
So today when I left the house, it was like 38 degrees

01:00:31.180 --> 01:00:32.580
when I left the house, when I left the RV.

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.020
A brisk spring morning.

01:00:34.020 --> 01:00:37.480
And so we have an electric space heater

01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:41.340
in their oil-enclosed systems, so they're like coils,

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.620
and we have one in the front of the rig,

01:00:42.620 --> 01:00:43.900
and we have one in the back of the rig.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.460
And they're both controllable by the echo.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.580
And when we left today, it was cold,

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.740
I didn't even think to turn them off.

01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.540
And they're just sitting there sucking power.

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.500
But when I got here to the office, I was like,

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.740
you know what, it's like 58 degrees out now,

01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.260
I don't need those running.

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.980
And it's one command, I could say it right now,

01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.980
and it just turns off the oil heaters in the RV.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:02.900
That's really nice.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.820
And it is super nice, actually,

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:09.820
because I then compare them with Belkin WeMo plugs

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.420
that will give me the real-time amperage

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:14.140
and voltage and watts draw.

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.640
Now you've got data.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:19.100
And I can actually say, well, today's Earth Day,

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.420
so after I've drawn X amount of watts,

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.240
just turn the thing off.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:25.140
Just turn it off.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:27.500
And I can also say, I'm gonna get home

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.420
around four o'clock today, so turn the thing on

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:31.080
around three so it starts warming the place up,

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.180
but don't leave it running all day.

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:35.700
And that's actually kind of nice,

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.300
because some places I go, I actually pay,

01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:40.300
they meter me, and they actually pay for how much I use.

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:41.460
Some places I go, it's free.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:43.300
So it's nice when I'm at somewhere

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.980
that'll actually watch the meter and charge me.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:47.620
It's nice to be able to have that kind of control.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:48.940
See, that makes this more exciting.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:50.780
Imagine then, maybe if you're like Charlie

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.500
or other people, you already have some of these devices,

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.860
but then if you have your own devices

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.260
or you would be able to interface with that,

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:57.660
see the data in another way,

01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:00.020
maybe have it interface with a non-proprietary format

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.900
or just store it locally, that would be cool.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.300
One of the things they were showing me there,

01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:07.780
so I just gave you guys the real raw stuff,

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.200
just those real specific, like this is what

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.820
Edge X Foundry does, but they then took me over

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.820
to their R&D side of the room,

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:17.060
and they have three major sections.

01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.420
Well, actually, they have four major sections.

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:20.500
So you walk into this room, this lab,

01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.160
and it's like a lobby.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:24.540
There's a couple of couches, some chairs.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.540
Then to your left, they have a mini lab.

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:28.620
And this mini lab is where the bulk of that video

01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:30.020
just took place, which I have, by the way,

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:30.860
if you're listening on the audio,

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.340
I have the video embedded in the show notes.

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:33.340
It's only four minutes long.

01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.540
It's kind of worth checking out.

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:36.920
That's the mini lab.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:38.700
Then they have a glass window.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:42.120
On the other side of the mini lab is like a fucking lab.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:42.960
It's like a lab, dude.

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.580
This ain't no mini lab.

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:47.560
Yeah, it's like false floor, false ceiling, racks,

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:51.380
like full on, can't go in there, no media allowed,

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.500
don't even think about it, dude, lab.

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:56.740
Then next to that, they have this R&D room.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:00.180
It's like this long room, one window at the end of it,

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:03.220
brown walls, and all along the walls

01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:05.340
is gear just mounted like crazy,

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:07.580
like tons of different IoT stuff,

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.740
everything from custom in-house built stuff

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:11.860
that looks super crazy and esoteric

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:14.900
to Amazon Echoes, like the whole range.

01:03:14.900 --> 01:03:17.320
And what they were trying to demonstrate to us was

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.740
you can go completely local, you hold all the data,

01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:20.940
you hold all the analytics,

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.980
you do all the controlling of all of these devices

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:25.580
on the LAN, or if you really want to,

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.100
you can go as far as,

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:29.340
you can abstract all of this away to an Echo.

01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:32.100
And so they showed me where they have,

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.880
where they can start a motor actuator

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:36.700
and start something going down a conveyor belt

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.040
and an arm using a dot.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.180
Wow, that's pretty slick.

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.500
And they're like, the real thing we see here,

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.900
and this is how far out they're going,

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:46.980
like the first thing, the first stage we see this is

01:03:46.980 --> 01:03:50.820
the worker is doing something and their hands are full,

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:54.540
and so they're using voice commands to trigger something.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:55.860
And I guess people are experimenting

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:57.220
in the workplace with dots.

01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.200
But they're like, but what we kind of have

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.740
a long-term thing here is it's AR.

01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:06.420
Like what we are working towards is creating sensors

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:10.300
that we can mount in things and on top of objects,

01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:13.940
and then all of these sensors will give data back

01:04:13.940 --> 01:04:15.420
to the EdgeX Foundry box,

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:17.860
and that EdgeX Foundry box will supply data

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:20.000
to an AR headset that, you know,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:20.940
you're looking at the engine

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:23.300
and you're looking at real-time stats and schemes,

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.780
schematics and temperatures and all that stuff,

01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:30.780
and all real-time data that the EdgeX box is processing,

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:33.740
collating, and then feeding an AR headset.

01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:35.380
Totally way out in the future stuff,

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.140
but like that's how far they see this going.

01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:40.100
Like right now, today, it's just about a framework

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:42.380
to manage IoT in the enterprise.

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.460
But in the far future, it could be the key part

01:04:45.460 --> 01:04:48.720
to feed a real-time data feed to an AR headset.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.780
Are we just making the sensory organs

01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:52.740
for our future AI overlords, Chris?

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.860
We are the biological bootloader for sure, my friend.

01:04:54.860 --> 01:04:57.060
Yes, absolutely, and this is a key part of that.

01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:57.900
Right, yeah.

01:04:57.900 --> 01:04:59.260
So do your duty, help out.

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:01.500
Make no mistake about it, Wes.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:03.180
But let's be honest, it's gonna be way better.

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.180
It's gonna be great, yeah.

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.100
I could see it too.

01:05:06.100 --> 01:05:09.120
Like I could see like you're working at Boeing

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.780
or you're a doctor, like I could so see it.

01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:13.460
So it seems inevitable.

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:15.100
It really does seem like you can.

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:17.500
When you have technology like the HoloLens

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:21.620
or even Google Glass, and then you have the data

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:24.140
and the devices doing the analytics.

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:28.620
And they didn't wanna come across to me as biased.

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:31.460
They were very sure to make sure I understood

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.180
that it could run on multiple operating systems

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:34.700
and they have partnerships with Red Hat

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:36.440
and SUSE and Microsoft.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:41.140
But it is clear to me that to them,

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:44.060
they prefer running all of this stuff on Ubuntu Core.

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:44.900
Interesting.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:47.420
Something about working with Canonical.

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:49.060
I think Canonical's the right size for them.

01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:50.740
They're not too big, not too small.

01:05:50.740 --> 01:05:52.060
Dell can have some influence.

01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:53.100
Yes, totally.

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:54.260
I don't know, it just seems like,

01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:55.500
it seemed like to them, like this was their-

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.140
They have experience working with them.

01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:58.900
Yeah, it was fascinating to see.

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:02.300
So while we were there, servers obviously, storage.

01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:05.440
It turns out, and I'm gonna try to find more information

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.340
about this though, Dell's also working

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:11.060
on a Debian-based network switch OS.

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:12.380
Right, yes, I remember us talking about that.

01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:14.340
Yeah, so I gotta get more information on that.

01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:15.720
But there's just a huge range of stuff

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.560
they're working on over there.

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.100
And so this is one of it.

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:22.820
But like they put in the Linux Foundation announcement,

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.780
the foundation says, this is coming from Linux Foundation,

01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:28.940
that EdgeX Foundry is unifying the marketplace

01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:30.900
around a common open framework

01:06:30.900 --> 01:06:34.200
and building an ecosystem of companies offering

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.940
interoperable plug and play components.

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.640
I guess that's actually pretty possible.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:40.340
They say it's designed around any hardware

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:41.940
or operating system with any combination

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:44.180
of applications environments.

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:47.060
And EdgeX can quickly and easily deliver interoperability

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:49.700
between connected devices, applications, and services.

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.620
Jeez, all right, it's just getting ridiculous.

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.580
You know what's crazy too, is they make it worse

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:54.860
because it's just a bunch of commas.

01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:59.860
So this sentence has one, two, three, four commas in it,

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:03.060
just to explain all of these buzzwords, yeah.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:04.420
It's too much, but anyways.

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.500
See that list there of the companies,

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:07.340
that's more interesting.

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:10.220
That is actually legit in here, and good on them.

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.220
Lenaro's in there, that's interesting.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.460
Yeah, yeah, VMware.

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:19.340
Yeah, VMware is pretty involved with the Linux Foundation.

01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:21.580
And of course, Canonical, which I think is the bigger part

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.860
because that's what's gonna be powering the machines

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:24.780
that are managing all of this.

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:28.220
So that's the part that actually is maybe more takeaway.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:30.920
Anyways, something to follow, so it's the EdgeX Foundry.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.940
Not a ton of people in our space are talking about it,

01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:35.180
but I think it's because we don't realize it means

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:38.700
bringing a lot of this internet of things to the LAN,

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:39.540
controlling it there.

01:07:39.540 --> 01:07:40.380
And it's one of those like,

01:07:40.380 --> 01:07:42.300
Dell hasn't talked that much about it.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:43.580
Other people haven't talked that much about it.

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:45.620
And it's one of those enterprise, business-to-business

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:47.340
things that just happens behind closed doors.

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:48.260
It is very much that.

01:07:48.260 --> 01:07:51.460
And I think that one of the bigger stories here

01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:55.700
that is sort of hard to relay is it's super intentional

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.820
that Dell's not talking a lot about this.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:08:01.980
It is a big deal that this was a Linux Foundation

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.260
announcement and not a Dell announcement.

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.620
I can see that, yeah.

01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.060
I think Dell very much wants us to be an open source

01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:11.000
community project, and they are so willing to push

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.940
that angle that they are, do you understand?

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:16.420
It's a big deal for a company not to take

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:17.260
the PR win for this.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:18.380
Yeah, totally.

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:19.220
Because they could have come out,

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.620
this could be the Dell EdgeX Foundry.

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:21.440
Yes.

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.700
To be very clear about how much development happened there.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.820
But they've worked since the beginning of this project

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:28.740
to make it a Linux Foundation thing.

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.200
Like you don't just get 22 companies.

01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.660
That took like a year of work.

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:32.480
Yeah, totally.

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.540
And a lot of agreements and other things

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.860
that have to be signed, legal things to work out.

01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:37.620
That is a part of, that's a bigger story.

01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:39.740
I don't know how to quite tell it,

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:41.740
but that's a very intentional thing they're doing.

01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:43.020
So this is like, we've talked a lot about

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.460
maybe the downsides or the controversy

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:46.660
of the Linux Foundation, but maybe this is

01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:48.020
an example of the other things they do

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:52.940
that other types, not an industry organization, can't do.

01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:55.400
Yeah, and this was never, these types of tools

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.480
and IoT is never gonna be a credible thing

01:08:58.480 --> 01:09:00.860
you can use in the enterprise that's actually manageable

01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:03.220
and secureable unless something like this came along.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:04.640
Yeah.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.700
And so if it was one-

01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.900
Let me get my app on my phone that connects

01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:10.380
to this private cloud and then, yeah, that's done.

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.980
Imagine if this was Apple doing an extension of HomeKit.

01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:15.380
They would have, it would be so less relevant

01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.820
to how it's gonna impact the industry.

01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:18.920
Doing this as an open source Linux Foundation effort,

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:23.920
I think, long-term, might actually make this legitimately

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:25.380
a real, like the real products

01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.240
that we can use in the enterprise.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.500
Speaking of things that are legitimate and real

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.640
and you can use right now, DigitalOcean.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:32.960
DigitalOcean.com, go there and sign up.

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.540
And then once you sign up, use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED,

01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:38.060
that's one word, DOUNPLUGGED to support the show

01:09:38.060 --> 01:09:39.440
and get a $10 credit.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:40.700
You wanna mess around with something,

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:41.820
DigitalOcean's perfect.

01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.180
You wanna put something in production,

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.100
DigitalOcean's perfect.

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:47.220
You wanna rely on it, resell it even, DigitalOcean.

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:48.060
It's the range.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:49.540
You know, that's what's incredible about it.

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:51.520
So for three cents an hour, you can get a rig

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.820
that's probably faster than any machine

01:09:52.820 --> 01:09:53.740
you've got on your land.

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:55.140
I mean, if you wanna make Chris feel bad,

01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:56.940
you have a MacBook, you're never switching to Linux.

01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:00.460
Bam, DigitalOcean, get a VPS, 55 seconds.

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:01.300
I know, right?

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.260
It's great because, okay, so for $5 a month,

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:06.380
like that's gonna run most your stuff

01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.120
that you wanna run headless on a Linux box.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.100
That's nice.

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:11.060
For $5 a month, you get SSDs.

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:12.600
You get 40 gigabit eConnection.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.660
They use Linux for the host,

01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:15.120
they use KVM for the virtualizer,

01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.520
that you get to use their awesome interface.

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:19.140
You can use the one-click deployment

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:20.760
of open source applications.

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.340
You get to use the API.

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:23.780
Like all of that stuff is there

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.900
for like the $5 a month rig.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:27.500
And then you can step it up from there

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:29.260
to machines that are just monsters

01:10:29.260 --> 01:10:33.000
with 200 plus gigs of RAM, tons of processor cores,

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.660
crazy amounts of storage.

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:37.020
But what's nice is what,

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.180
and this is always what I've done,

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.020
is I've either started at the $5 one

01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:42.300
or maybe if it's something I'm using a lot,

01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.300
like I'm running Mumble and Minecraft on there,

01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:47.800
I might do a nicer rig, maybe at most a $20 a month rig.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.980
I mean, sometimes I'll go crazy

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:50.920
if I got a lot of stuff going on there.

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.460
But I can, there's this whole range.

01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.260
And there's also baby steps.

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:56.800
You can just take little itsy-bitsy beautiful baby steps.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:57.660
Beautiful babies.

01:10:57.660 --> 01:10:58.500
You just go over there

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.880
and you attach block storage as you need it.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.140
Just, it's all SSD based.

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.660
You can go up to 16 terabytes.

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:06.880
It's so crazy.

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.700
You want to mess around with ZFS or ButterFS?

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:10.540
I mean, why not?

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:12.460
Because they'll show up as block devices.

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:13.340
I mean, have at it, Haas.

01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:15.380
You'll really get a chance to learn something.

01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:17.340
Also, they have monitoring available.

01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.420
That'll give you metrics.

01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:19.500
It'll give you alerts.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.380
It makes you look like a boss for a team of one or 100.

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:24.620
And then speaking of teams,

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.020
you can easily manage and transfer droplets.

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:29.420
So if you got like, you got kernel Linux here.

01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:30.900
Kernel Linux in the house.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.620
This dude's over here spinning up droplets

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:35.100
for customers that want Nextcloud instances.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.340
Sets them all up and transfers it to them.

01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:38.180
It's brilliant.

01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:40.060
You can also resell at these prices too.

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:40.900
It's so nice.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.700
And when you bring in things like monitoring

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.540
or when you have their CDN,

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.420
you have private networking for backups

01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:47.780
that don't count against your transfer.

01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:50.060
There's a lot of opportunities for developers,

01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:51.700
for sysadmins, for enthusiasts,

01:11:51.700 --> 01:11:52.860
for people that just want to learn.

01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:54.660
Go to digitalocean.com.

01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:57.860
Use our promo code DOUNPLUGED, one word, sign up.

01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:58.700
And check it out.

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:00.340
And check it out at digitalocean.com.

01:12:00.340 --> 01:12:01.660
Big thank you to DigitalOcean

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:04.140
for sponsoring this here Unplugged program.

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:07.500
Boop-a-boop, boop-a-boop, boop-a-boop, boop-a-boop.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.920
So this is a hell of a story here.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:11.260
And I commend them for getting a release out.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.380
This is not gonna be a mocking thing.

01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:15.500
I say this is actually potentially a good thing.

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:18.380
A little competition actually is a very good thing.

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:19.500
Duvon?

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:20.340
Devuon?

01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.180
Devuon?

01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:22.000
Devuon.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:22.840
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.680
Devuon.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:24.500
Devuon.

01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:25.340
There we go.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.180
Devuon.

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:29.500
Devuon GNU slash Linux has been released, version 1.0.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.940
Jesse, hmm, I've never heard that before,

01:12:32.820 --> 01:12:35.100
I bet Debian's totally gonna assume for trademark,

01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:35.940
was just announced.

01:12:35.940 --> 01:12:37.260
The release candidate is actually out.

01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:40.180
The Devuon project, as I'm sure you recall,

01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:43.800
is Debian without the D,

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.260
without the system D init system.

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.700
And instead they're using, I don't know,

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:52.900
probably Hope, Bubblegum, and Magic, maybe Ponies?

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.360
What's that, init, init system, what's that?

01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.420
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:12:56.420 --> 01:12:59.380
And so I actually, at first I was gonna laugh this off,

01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.820
and I thought, this is no big deal.

01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:04.340
Who cares what Devuon is doing?

01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:07.060
And then I started thinking about it a little bit,

01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:08.940
and why the hell not do it?

01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:13.940
If you want a sort of a Debian of a different era,

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:18.480
and more importantly than that though,

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.820
what a great potential base for a bunch of respins.

01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:26.820
Maybe Devuon, Devuon itself won't be massively popular,

01:13:26.900 --> 01:13:29.500
but I could actually, for some weird reason,

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.700
see like a remix respin derivative

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:35.220
that uses Devuon as its base,

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:37.020
building a really competitive Linux distro.

01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.540
Yeah, I think, I mean, I could see that too,

01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:41.220
especially, I feel like Debian's,

01:13:41.220 --> 01:13:43.460
I mean, a lot of the strengths of that family

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.580
is the huge, you know, the huge app repos,

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:48.280
that they put a lot of efforts into like, you know,

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.060
the Etsy defaults alternatives,

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:51.260
all that kind of stuff, right?

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.380
There's like, you can, there's a lot of configurability

01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:54.680
and options built right in.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.740
So I can see, I don't know about the desktop space,

01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.100
but on the server side, container side, other things,

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.860
I can totally see, maybe you want like an old style,

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.220
minimal, you know, reproducible in its system

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:06.300
that just starts things in a row, okay, great.

01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:08.380
Yeah, or maybe on even like,

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:09.720
like they're working on Raspberry Pi 2

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.460
and Pi 3 support right now, I could see that.

01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:12.740
Anybody in the mumbler, what do you think

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.480
about a system D-less Linux?

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.660
Do you care anymore?

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.500
So one of the other things we thought was interesting

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.460
about this story,

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:22.740
and this might be something somebody could jump in on,

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:27.740
is it's 2017 and the multi-year hoopla

01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:30.620
that was system D has passed us.

01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:32.420
And essentially it's just been normalized now

01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:33.380
into Linux culture.

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:35.340
Wow, does it feel good to say that?

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:37.700
I think so.

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.220
So here we are now in 2017,

01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.900
and I'm feeling like things are actually worked out

01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:41.740
pretty good.

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.960
We haven't had a security nightmare

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:47.140
that's rolled across Linux, leaving us all exposed.

01:14:47.140 --> 01:14:48.900
Well, at least not because of system D.

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:53.140
Yeah, boot times, man, I gotta say.

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:54.780
Great.

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:56.420
The one way I interact with system D

01:14:56.420 --> 01:14:58.300
on a more frequent basis is boot up time,

01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:01.220
and so far, my system D based systems boot a lot faster.

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:05.360
System D service scripts, or service units,

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:08.260
whatever they're called, just make a lot more sense to me.

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:09.980
It is really easy to write a unit file

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:11.980
and just like turn this into a service, please.

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:15.540
And the system CTL enables such and such,

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:17.440
and stop and start, like all those commands

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.340
are really straightforward.

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:22.420
And I cherish the fact that I can log

01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:23.820
into multiple different distros now

01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:24.660
and use the same command.

01:15:24.660 --> 01:15:25.480
That is really nice.

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.320
Cherish that.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.620
I came from a time where that was not the case.

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:29.580
Never gonna happen.

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:33.340
Yeah, every distro had its own syntax

01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:36.420
for enabling, disabling, and starting and stopping services.

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:37.260
Every distro did.

01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:39.460
And then we finally got that service wrapper

01:15:39.460 --> 01:15:41.620
right at some point, but it didn't bring any features

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.240
because it was too disparate.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:47.300
And still, there was frequently variations

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:48.980
in the names of the services,

01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:51.180
which is also standardized as Apache 2,

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.960
or HTTPD, or who knows.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:55.260
Yes, yes, yes, exactly.

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:57.420
And now that's much more normalized as well.

01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.500
These are all things that we had to struggle with

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:03.300
back in the day that I feel like System D has helped with.

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:08.240
And now, here we are, here we are in 2017,

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.580
and MonkeyCom has just moved to System D,

01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:11.980
like just moved to System D.

01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:14.380
MonkeyCom, how has it been for you?

01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:15.780
Oh, it sucked in the beginning.

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:19.140
I mean, just, well, you have the thing

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:20.740
where you move your MySQL server

01:16:20.740 --> 01:16:22.500
from, let's say, 12 to 16,

01:16:22.500 --> 01:16:25.700
and everything's working great until everything doesn't.

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.480
And then the jackass you hire to come look at it

01:16:27.480 --> 01:16:29.740
removes System D and wipes out your MySQL install.

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:30.580
No.

01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:31.420
That's always awesome.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.860
Whoa.

01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:36.100
But because he said System D was bad.

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:40.340
I feel like there is a sitcom at where you work

01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:42.420
that could be filmed right now.

01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:45.280
So you had an outside contractor come in

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.220
who can't kind of have an agenda,

01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:49.620
like an anti-System D agenda?

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:51.480
I don't know what his problem was,

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:53.620
but he got on the database server

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.960
and it was production development.

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.680
I mean, it wasn't gonna hurt any customers,

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.980
but it was definitely something I didn't wanna rebuild.

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:03.180
And yeah, he removed System D

01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:06.740
and that just completely hosed everything.

01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:09.660
I mean, it literally, you couldn't even,

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.260
it wouldn't even boot.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.100
It was bad.

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:12.940
I mean, that kind of makes sense

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:13.900
when you remove the edit system.

01:17:13.900 --> 01:17:16.900
That's like, you're coming in here and fixing it

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:17.740
for free kind of bad.

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:19.100
Yeah, exactly.

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:21.220
We really liked having that database.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:23.700
So after the Nuke bomb was dropped

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:27.200
and you guys rebuilt the village, how has it been?

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.040
Oh, it's fine.

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:28.880
You just gotta learn the tweaks.

01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.540
You gotta understand how to exclude it from,

01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:34.900
you know, System D automatically does a bunch of stuff

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.340
and especially with the security profile.

01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:38.700
And you just gotta know how to deal with it,

01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.900
especially when you're running really intensive loads.

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:43.740
And once you figure that stuff out,

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.460
it's an excellent solution.

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.160
And it's much better than Annette.

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:49.040
And I don't know why anyone would wanna go back.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.540
It's just, it's a pain in the ass

01:17:51.540 --> 01:17:53.300
to get your head wrapped around.

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:55.300
Yeah, it is definitely a paradigm change.

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:57.820
It's new tools, new switches, all that stuff.

01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:58.660
Yeah.

01:17:58.660 --> 01:17:59.980
We went through that with SE Linux.

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:01.380
We went through that with, you know,

01:18:01.380 --> 01:18:03.460
every time something new comes out

01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:06.120
that has a performance or a configuration impact,

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:08.980
we always freak out and say they shouldn't have done that,

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:10.740
but it always improves your life.

01:18:10.740 --> 01:18:11.580
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:12.500
It does something.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.580
There was people that with the transition

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:18.300
from Lilo to Grub, I think some people drew blood over that.

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.860
Like there has always been big moments

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:23.360
we've made moves that have been really, really,

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.760
really painful publicly.

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:27.120
And it's done so in a way that most projects

01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.040
that are commercial projects

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.660
don't ever get that kind of exposure.

01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:31.420
And so we get to watch the sausage get made

01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:33.000
in a way that most people never see.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.620
But Monkey Comm, it's fascinating

01:18:35.620 --> 01:18:38.260
because what you represent is probably the reality.

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:41.660
Most shops are just now beginning to make this transition.

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:44.180
Like to me, my systems have been running

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:46.020
system D for ages now,

01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:47.940
but people that have like Monkey Comm

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:48.980
and probably like yourself, you probably have,

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:50.940
do you have systems in production that are?

01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.980
Absolutely. Yeah, of course, right?

01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:54.120
I probably, there's probably systems

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.980
I've still set up years ago that are still in production.

01:18:56.980 --> 01:19:00.220
I just got off a 12, so let's be honest here.

01:19:00.220 --> 01:19:01.780
And I do think like, it's interesting to compare,

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.900
like I've talked to some developers in particular

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.300
who felt a little burned about the whole Upstart thing.

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:08.700
They're like, we finally got off Etsy in it for Upstart.

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:10.140
You told us that was the next best thing.

01:19:10.140 --> 01:19:11.940
And we switched all of our programs

01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:13.060
and now we have to switch them again,

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:15.440
which I mean, I think just that improvement already,

01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:16.880
it's like pretty easy to turn an Upstart job

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:17.720
into a system D job.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:18.700
So it's not a huge deal.

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.900
And I also think that like just the rate of adoption

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:23.840
and the expanse of the adoption we've seen

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.020
means that I don't think that,

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:27.500
I don't think it'll take longer than maybe five years

01:19:27.500 --> 01:19:30.540
probably before we see a new system D thing

01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:33.500
that replaces it in the reach that system D has.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.140
So I think it's in a better position,

01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:37.940
but I can see why people are like, I have to change again.

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.020
I don't know if anybody does this out there on the web,

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:41.540
this would be really cool,

01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:46.400
is all of like the top 20 Linux distros.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.140
Now you know what, let's make it simpler than that.

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:50.780
The top four Linux distros used by enterprise,

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:51.840
and I don't know who determines that,

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:56.060
but whatever sold determines that to be fact.

01:19:56.060 --> 01:19:57.580
We'll just ask Noah, he'll tell us.

01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:58.460
That's probably true.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:02.620
I would like just a simple HTML table,

01:20:02.620 --> 01:20:04.100
doesn't have to be fancy,

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.700
of the current production Linux's

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.700
and the kernel versions they're running.

01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:13.140
And current versions, yeah, I feel like

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:15.780
if you look at the last five years of Linux,

01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:19.460
and this is so true when you look at the enterprise graph,

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:23.460
we are converging in a way that if you gave 2017

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:24.700
current day snapshot Linux,

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:25.780
if you took a snapshot of it,

01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:28.500
and showed it to Chris of 1998,

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:31.100
I wouldn't call this Linux anymore.

01:20:31.100 --> 01:20:33.500
Everybody, every major vendor

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:36.260
shipping a GTK Gnome 3 desktop,

01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:40.540
every vendor, every major vendor shipping system D.

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:42.700
Now if you look at the middle layer is system D,

01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:44.460
and the user land is GNU,

01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:49.460
then almost all distros are now exactly common.

01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:54.340
GTK, Gnome, GNU, system D,

01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:58.500
and then I bet they're all based

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.780
on a semi-modern kernel four.

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:04.780
And more and more of them at the end of 2017

01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:07.260
are gonna all at least have kernel version 4.10.

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:09.420
We're pretty much all gonna be,

01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.020
anybody running current Linux

01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:14.620
will be on version 4.10 or later of Linux by the end of 2017.

01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:17.260
So you're gonna have this unprecedented,

01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:21.100
I mean, have we ever been this cohesive as a community ever?

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:23.180
Maybe like only when it was just small enough

01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:24.620
that there couldn't have been this much,

01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:25.460
you know what I mean?

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:27.140
Like early days, but it's been a long time.

01:21:27.140 --> 01:21:30.580
And also by the way, every distribution

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.140
that matches what I just mentioned

01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:34.140
also can install flat packs.

01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.380
Whoa.

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:36.980
So now we have universal application

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:39.140
installation capabilities on Linux.

01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:40.980
I feel like we're talking about BSD.

01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:43.940
Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:45.620
Kind of, in a different way.

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:47.020
Only way more badass, right?

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.500
Like this is way better.

01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.980
Like it's so awesome.

01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:52.860
And it could also be the shittiest things

01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:53.700
ever happened to Linux.

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.260
Like you have to keep room to understand

01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:58.220
that one of the things that's made Linux great

01:21:58.220 --> 01:22:00.460
is diversity, lots of little things,

01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:03.900
doing single tasks, like there is the possibility

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:05.460
that this could lead to ruin.

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:08.860
But it seems more likely that we are reaching

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.060
a level of consensus in the community

01:22:11.060 --> 01:22:13.380
that is gonna make us more targetable,

01:22:13.380 --> 01:22:16.020
more applicable, more commoditizable,

01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:17.940
which is gonna all lead to a greater adoption,

01:22:17.940 --> 01:22:20.540
more applications, more use case scenarios.

01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:22.980
To me, it seems like we're in a better spot

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:25.220
than we've probably been in a really long time.

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:26.460
Now, we're not quite there yet,

01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:28.340
but the skate or the puck

01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:29.820
is certainly skating in that direction.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.380
So does that like play hand-to-hand

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:32.340
with what we were talking about before,

01:22:32.340 --> 01:22:34.820
where will that also make it like,

01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:36.980
so that branding and other things matter less

01:22:36.980 --> 01:22:38.180
when it's all just Linux?

01:22:38.180 --> 01:22:39.940
Like it doesn't matter if you use a bunch of,

01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:42.100
or I don't know if it's like 90% the same now.

01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:45.340
I would use Docker potentially,

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.020
oh God, I can't believe I'm gonna throw up

01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:48.460
a little bit in my mouth when I say this.

01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:50.700
So don't judge me too harshly.

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:54.020
I would use Docker slightly as the example

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:56.180
in some sense here and I'll explain myself.

01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:57.820
So what's Docker selling?

01:22:57.820 --> 01:23:01.140
Docker is selling, this is what sucks for Docker.

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:03.460
Docker is basically selling water

01:23:03.460 --> 01:23:05.220
to folks that have a town well.

01:23:05.220 --> 01:23:06.860
Like the problem with Docker is

01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:09.380
they're just selling namespaces,

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:12.060
CNAME groups, Linux kernel features,

01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:15.140
and a bunch of great management utilities on top of that.

01:23:15.140 --> 01:23:18.020
Now, if you take away the management utilities,

01:23:18.020 --> 01:23:21.300
everything else is a commodity of the Linux platform.

01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:24.100
Like every distribution has the capability

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:27.100
of namespaces and control groups.

01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:28.420
I mean, SystemD could make containers,

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.340
I mean containers or whatever, but right there for you.

01:23:30.340 --> 01:23:32.900
Right, so this multi-million dollar company

01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:34.580
named Docker is selling something

01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:37.540
that you get for free with the platform.

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.980
Now that's telling of where we could go in the future

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:42.140
because we all could be selling the same thing,

01:23:42.140 --> 01:23:44.100
but yeah, we can have a multi-million dollar company

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:47.820
on top of it that is branding and productizing

01:23:47.820 --> 01:23:50.740
the management infrastructure or the community around it

01:23:50.740 --> 01:23:52.700
or whatever it is that they do.

01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:54.780
So there is still space for a canonical

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:57.820
and a SUSE where the product is commoditized

01:23:57.820 --> 01:23:59.580
because Docker is the example.

01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:02.940
Docker is selling something that comes for free with Linux.

01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:05.520
You get containerized, you install a modern Linux,

01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:08.140
you've got what Docker, the core of what Docker can do,

01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:11.380
and yet somehow, somehow, they're still making money,

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:12.780
they're still a name we're still talking about.

01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:13.740
I thought they're called Moby now.

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:14.580
Yeah, right.

01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:15.420
But you see what I'm saying.

01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.380
I do see what you're saying, absolutely.

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:18.740
It almost makes, it almost gives,

01:24:18.740 --> 01:24:21.340
it's just at a different, it's at a different layer

01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:23.980
where the product and the innovation happens.

01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:24.820
It's at a different layer.

01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:26.340
There's a common technology base.

01:24:26.340 --> 01:24:27.580
Which I think is good, right?

01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:30.660
Like that's a, I like, you know,

01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:31.700
you always have to decide where that level,

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:34.020
where is the value add layer going to be?

01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:35.860
I think pushing it up a little higher in the stack

01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:36.700
is a good thing.

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.980
Yeah, because what it does is it makes it sane

01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:42.660
and manageable and deliverable for developers.

01:24:42.660 --> 01:24:44.020
So I know what I'm targeting,

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:45.940
I know how many systems I'm gonna be able to run on,

01:24:45.940 --> 01:24:47.220
and I know how to package it up

01:24:47.220 --> 01:24:48.740
and ship it for those systems.

01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.940
And I know how it's gonna run once it lands there.

01:24:50.940 --> 01:24:54.020
Those are not things you could actually say about Linux

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:56.620
a few years ago, and especially not 10 years ago

01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:57.660
or 20 years ago.

01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:58.820
You couldn't say that.

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:00.740
You kind of, like, depending, like,

01:25:00.740 --> 01:25:02.980
well, if it depends on a couple of libraries,

01:25:02.980 --> 01:25:03.820
you got a good shot.

01:25:03.820 --> 01:25:06.340
But when you're developing a modern huge application

01:25:06.340 --> 01:25:07.180
with all its components,

01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:09.420
the only way to do it in the past was to say,

01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:12.420
we work on Red Hat Enterprise 6, and that's it.

01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:13.940
We've tested for Red Hat Enterprise 6,

01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:15.340
and we work on Red Hat Enterprise 6,

01:25:15.340 --> 01:25:17.020
and you must run in Red Hat Enterprise 6,

01:25:17.020 --> 01:25:19.300
and that's the only way we support Linux.

01:25:19.300 --> 01:25:20.620
That's gonna go away.

01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:21.740
And what we're gonna have now is,

01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:23.860
well, you must have Linux kernel 4.10,

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:26.380
you're gonna need systemd version dot dot dot,

01:25:26.380 --> 01:25:28.540
and you probably should install these packages.

01:25:28.540 --> 01:25:30.380
And that will be the requirements.

01:25:30.380 --> 01:25:31.540
That's a game changer.

01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:33.300
That's a game changer for all of us.

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:36.100
And then the fact that at the same time that's happening,

01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:38.660
we just accidentally have Flatpak and Snaps,

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:40.420
which are universal package installations,

01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:42.140
and we just accidentally happened to have

01:25:42.140 --> 01:25:43.660
all of the major Linux companies

01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:46.060
now working on the GNOME desktop and GTK.

01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:49.100
I mean, holy, holy convergence, Batman.

01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:50.820
That's a whole different type of convergence,

01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:52.940
and it's gotta be one that's in the long term

01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:53.780
gonna be good.

01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:55.820
And how the hell is BSD gonna compete with that?

01:25:55.820 --> 01:26:00.380
All right, that brings us to an end

01:26:00.380 --> 01:26:01.660
of this week's broadcast.

01:26:03.060 --> 01:26:07.940
One more episode before the big Linux Fest Northwest, Wes.

01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:09.260
Whoa! I know.

01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:10.340
It's really snuck up on us.

01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:11.340
I'm excited now.

01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:12.580
I am, I am too.

01:26:12.580 --> 01:26:13.900
I'm really looking forward to it.

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:16.300
Audience, you should try your darndest to get there.

01:26:16.300 --> 01:26:17.860
But you know what, like every Linux Unplugged

01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:20.180
is almost like a Linux Fest.

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.780
You can join us in our virtual lug.

01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:24.140
Just go over to jblive.tv, join our chat room,

01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:25.860
and then do bang!

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.380
Mumble, that's the exclamation mark.

01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:28.460
And you'll get our server address.

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.460
You join that, you can hang out in our lug.

01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:31.620
You can also send us an email over

01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:33.180
jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact,

01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:34.100
and get it converted to your local time

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:36.460
at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:26:36.460 --> 01:26:37.580
Thanks so much for being here.

01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:38.980
We'll see you right back here.

01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:39.820
Next Tuesday!

01:26:39.820 --> 01:27:03.640
Hey guys, good to see you again.

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:25.320
JBtitles.com, why don't you all go over to that JBtitles.com.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.480
Let's pick our title real quick and then we'll make room for the TechSnap program.

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:31.960
Wes, the light's still burned out in there, I have ordered replacements but they just

01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:32.960
take weeks to arrive.

01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:33.960
I'm sure.

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:34.960
So you're just going to look like a tan man.

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:35.960
All right.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.080
I watched last week's episode, you just look like you have a real healthy glow.

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.520
I like, okay, not a problem for me.

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:43.600
Mumble Room, thank you guys very much.

01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:44.600
You guys are awesome.

01:27:44.600 --> 01:27:45.600
Yeah, thank you.

01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:46.600
Monkey, thank you very much for carrying a lot of the weight.

01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:47.600
It was a fun chat today.

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:49.640
Charlie, it was good to hear what you're working on too.

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:50.640
Come back.

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.640
Yes.

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.520
JBtitles, JBtitles, won't you all go boat.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.960
I just am tired of Docker being the end all be all of the developers.

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:03.380
I mean, half the developers don't even know them and they know they're developing in Linux

01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:06.320
but they've lost all understanding of what they're doing.

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.320
It's creepy.

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:10.280
It creeps you out because it makes Linux feel like it just doesn't matter, like it could

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:14.520
just go away and nobody even know, oh, just keep making containers.

01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:17.480
It's never going to go away because every developer I know, when they build a Docker,

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:20.880
they always use the same fucking port and then they put it on a Docker server and nothing

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:21.880
works.

01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:24.480
And then it never gets updates and it sits there riddled with security issues.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.100
But that's, yeah, that's got to get worked out too.

01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:30.800
Maybe what we need is Edge X Foundry for Docker.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.200
Just got so enterprise.

01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:36.960
IoT, biological bootloaders, not bad.

01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.360
Oh, WW, you had a rant.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.720
You wanted the floor.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:40.720
Go ahead.

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:41.720
Okay.

01:28:41.720 --> 01:28:50.600
So chat room, when you type in bang mum, you look stupid.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:57.760
If you want to come and join mumble and talk to Chris and then do Chris last mumble, hey,

01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:01.840
I want to say something, then that's what you do.

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:06.120
Outside of that, you look like a donkey.

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:08.280
Are you saying they're doing bang mumble just to get my attention?

01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:09.280
Is that what you mean?

01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.280
I don't know.

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:16.520
I don't know why they're doing bang mum unless they want to, you know, bring down fears.

01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:22.960
Yes, you know, they're just trolling because that's all they know to do.

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:26.080
I was doing it just because I saw somebody else do it and they got the floor.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:27.760
In fact, I think I saw a monkey do it.

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.760
Well, yeah.

01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:32.880
Well, if you're in the mumble room, you do mum, Chris last, and then what you want to

01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:35.000
say and I'll call on you.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.400
Bang mumble, bang mum, bang mum or whatever, I think just gives you the server.

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:40.080
I'm not even sure what that does.

01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:45.280
I think bang mum is just a misnomer, which is why it's making, it's rustling some jimmies.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:49.000
There is a way to like they're like when people preface like a comment, if you do like Chris

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:54.240
last mum, colon, and then what you want to say, I almost always will call on you.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.520
Like that seems to be, that was the confusion.

01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:57.520
Yeah.

01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:58.520
Yeah.

01:29:58.520 --> 01:29:59.520
I don't know why people get confused.

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.520
You know what?

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.800
I saw someone do it and they got the floor.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:04.800
Yeah.

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:05.800
It's cause you know what?

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:11.120
It's the, it's the, it's the, it's the wonderful cycle of noobs, w w it's, it's both glorious

01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:15.680
and excruciatingly frustrating at the same time.
