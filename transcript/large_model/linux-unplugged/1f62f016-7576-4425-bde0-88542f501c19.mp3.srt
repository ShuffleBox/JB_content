1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Anybody in the mumble room having Wi-Fi issues?

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,440
And do you have a Chromecast?

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,160
Because it turns out that's all it takes.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,280
Have you heard about this?

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,000
Really?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,200
Wait, what?

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,280
Yeah, so router vendors are going to be pushing out

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,000
firmware updates.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,480
Google's actually known about this for a little while.

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,940
There's an issue recently with Google's Chromecast,

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,440
if you have it on your network, and you launch the YouTube app

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,120
on the phone or device.

13
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,960
When the YouTube app wakes up, quote unquote,

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,160
this is the documentation language, when it wakes up,

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,760
it does a broadcast packet to see, actually,

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,800
anything that supports Chromecast does this.

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,960
It's not just YouTube, but this is the most common one.

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,260
It does a broadcast to say, hey, is there any Chromecast

19
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:44,960
devices here?

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,560
I'm awake, and I would like to be able to broadcast to you.

21
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,040
And these packets are normally sent

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,280
in 20-second intervals, which in network timing

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,040
is a pretty long time.

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,120
But it turns out there's a bit of a bug,

25
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,400
and sometimes the devices will broadcast

26
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,880
a large amount of packets at very high speeds

27
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,040
in a very short amount of time.

28
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,480
And it's around 100,000 packets instead of a 20-second interval

29
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,080
where it sends a packet.

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,000
It's hundreds of thousands of packets

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,960
as fast as your little device can cram it

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,040
over your Wi-Fi network, overwhelming routers.

33
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,520
And it's pretty much all of the major ones.

34
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,520
NETGEARS acknowledges this.

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,800
Linksys has acknowledged this.

36
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,960
ASUS has acknowledged this.

37
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,040
TP-Link has acknowledged this.

38
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,440
And Google themselves has acknowledged this.

39
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,040
Although Google says it impacts a small number of users,

40
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,680
and they're committed to providing a fix in short order.

41
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,920
Does it affect OpenWRT and LEED?

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,280
I would think it'd be possible, but because it's

43
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,880
like an overwhelming DDoS.

44
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,160
It's not necessarily like a flaw in the software, I think.

45
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,040
Right.

46
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,520
Does it impact Google hardware, specifically like Google Wi-Fi?

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,720
If you have, no, I don't know about Google Wi-Fi.

48
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,280
But if you have a Chromecast, and a lot of us do,

49
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,400
and then you have an app on your mobile device that

50
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,440
supports Chromecast, this is what you get.

51
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,440
What about half-supported devices?

52
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,600
Thankfully, both of my Chromecasts

53
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,960
are powered off the TV.

54
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,080
So if the TV's off, the Chromecast's off.

55
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,800
Same, yeah.

56
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,640
Wonder if Roku's can affect this.

57
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,480
They accept some Chromecast.

58
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, it's on the Chromecast side.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,080
It's sending out the packets from their Chromecast.

60
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,720
And it uses UDP.

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,880
There's no congestion control on UDP.

62
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,560
Exactly.

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,240
OK, so my Chromecast is getting unplugged today.

64
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:48,800
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 232 for January 16, 2018.

65
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

66
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,760
that's fending off the plague, talking brand new Linux

67
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,760
hardware, and answering your questions.

68
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,960
My name is Chris.

69
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,760
And I'm the beard.

70
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,440
Hey, beard.

71
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,640
Beard's joining me this week, but not Wes, because Wes got

72
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,160
poisoned by Beard, so that way he could step up and actually

73
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,120
be in the intro.

74
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,080
So we got that taken care of.

75
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,880
Good job, sir.

76
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,800
Now, also coming up on this week's episode,

77
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,580
we will go through a whole bunch of community news.

78
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,440
This episode is really going to be all about the community,

79
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,200
about stuff they're working on, about upcoming events,

80
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,280
and then answering a lot of your questions.

81
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,240
And Barton George from Dell will be joining us

82
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,020
to talk about the new XPS 13 developer, the Sputnik

83
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,000
line of their sweet Infinity edge-to-edge display laptops.

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,400
Well, they just shipped out a brand new one

85
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,180
with the latest eighth generation Intel processors,

86
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,900
a bunch of new features, Ubuntu 16.04 installed by default.

87
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,760
So Barton will come on.

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
I'll pick his brain about the new machines.

89
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,440
And then I'm going to ask him a couple of questions about,

90
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,160
because he's in a large corporation,

91
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,880
so he's maybe the perfect person to ask sitting

92
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,160
at Dell in a large corporation shipping Linux desktops.

93
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,920
Barton, what's it going to take to get Linux

94
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,840
on every machine at Dell?

95
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,460
What would it take for corporate systems

96
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,520
to be able to switch over and get out of that Windows trench?

97
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,600
And we talk about that.

98
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,040
We talk about big trends that Dell's getting ready for that

99
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,600
are coming down the pipe.

100
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,880
And we talk about the transition to 1710, Gnome,

101
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,520
a little Meltdown Inspector.

102
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,600
It's all coming up later on in the show.

103
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,000
So I think it's going to be, what are they,

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,080
like not a doorstopper.

105
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
It's going to be, I need a good name.

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,680
Mumble Room, what's a good name for what this week's about?

107
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,400
And hello, Virtual Log.

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,040
This is like a blowout episode, right?

109
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
It's Barnburner.

110
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,080
It's a Barnburner!

111
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,640
That's exactly what I was looking for.

112
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,360
OK, hello, hello, hello, Mumble Room.

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,120
Time appropriate greeting.

114
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,620
Hello.

115
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,120
Hello.

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,600
What's up?

117
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,100
Hello.

118
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,600
Hello.

119
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,280
Hello.

120
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,960
Guys, boy, it's good to hear all your voices.

121
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,080
I missed you guys.

122
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,200
It's been a long week.

123
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,200
But the only thing that really got me through this long week

124
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,620
has been the good news coming out of the Plasma project.

125
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,400
So we've got a couple of different things

126
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,740
to cover for the Plasma desktop.

127
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,440
I figured you Plasma desktop users have

128
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,520
been yearning for some coverage.

129
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
So there's a new LTS in the works.

130
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,280
It's the second long-term support release

131
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,160
from the Plasma 5 team.

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,600
And they're working on fixing speed and stability.

133
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,640
It's a speed and stability release.

134
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,080
Boot time for the desktop has been improved by reviewing code

135
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,500
and getting rid of anything they found that blocked execution.

136
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,120
They've been triaging and fixing bugs

137
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,560
in every aspect of the code base,

138
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,960
tidying up artwork, removing corner cases,

139
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,840
and ensuring cross-desktop integration.

140
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,600
Interesting.

141
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,360
Specifically in regard to the performance,

142
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,280
because that's what got my attention,

143
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,520
they say we have been concentrating on speed and memory

144
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,480
improvements with the 5.12 LTS release.

145
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,200
When Plasma is running, it now uses less CPU and less memory

146
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,060
than previous versions.

147
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,680
The time it takes to start Plasma desktop

148
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,400
has been reduced dramatically.

149
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,320
And Plasma support for running on Wayland

150
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,640
is now more complete and more suitable

151
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,560
for a wide range of testing.

152
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,000
So they're ready to bake it into the LTS release.

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,200
And they have got output resolution scaling working,

154
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,960
screen rotation, enabling and disabling outputs

155
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
through Kscreen, automatic screen rotation

156
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,640
based on orientation sensors, automatic touch calibration.

157
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:12,280
Ex-Wayland is no longer required to even run the Plasma desktop.

158
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,760
Big one right there.

159
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,800
Yeah, and Wayland Windows can now run full screen.

160
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,120
That's a big one for the beard.

161
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
Kaywin's been integrated with their night color system,

162
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,000
which is awesome.

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,320
That's so cool and kind of removes the need for people

164
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,520
to even run Redshift anymore on the Plasma desktop.

165
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,160
And the compositor is now automatically kind of smart,

166
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,340
depending on the desktop and the input and responsiveness.

167
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,880
And if you're using Wayland, there's

168
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,200
been a lot of work there.

169
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,080
So this really is being positioned as the Plasma

170
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,200
desktop to use.

171
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,480
It's version 5.12.

172
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,520
It's in development right now.

173
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,260
And they seem pretty excited about it.

174
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,960
I'll defer to the Mumble Room for a moment

175
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,560
if anybody wants to talk about Plasma.

176
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,480
I do have a second part to the story, though.

177
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,840
So going once, going twice.

178
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,400
Hey, you know, it sounds great.

179
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,680
But I hope, for their sake, that they lose the reputation

180
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,720
of being bloated just with this release.

181
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,920
You know what I'm saying?

182
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,840
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

183
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,880
I mean, I think that's sort of been, well,

184
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,040
boy, it's really what's your definition of bloated.

185
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,360
Because resources-wise, I feel like it

186
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,600
hasn't been that bloated for several releases now.

187
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,000
In fact, I was shocked when I started

188
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,880
running Plasma for a while how little resources are used,

189
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,400
based on just what everybody said.

190
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,840
So that's one version of bloat.

191
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,840
But another version of bloat is the package mess.

192
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,420
And I know this is a soft spot, and they

193
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,880
don't like people talking about it.

194
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,800
But just two days ago, I was going through and updating

195
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
my last remaining Arch system.

196
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,280
And of course, there's a conflict

197
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,240
between some standard accessibility feature

198
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,100
and a Plasma desktop accessibility feature.

199
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,760
And I have to choose between one of them.

200
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,080
And either one of them breaks a series of dependencies.

201
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,720
And just as a thought experiment,

202
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,480
I went down the path of what would happen

203
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,120
if I tried to uninstall the Plasma desktop accessibility

204
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,600
version.

205
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,280
And it unwinds 35 packages, which eventually ends up

206
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,720
at uninstalling the entire Plasma desktop itself,

207
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,940
because I want to remove a singular component.

208
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,160
I just wanted to uninstall the accessibility metapackage

209
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,240
and just remove the accessibility stuff altogether

210
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,800
because it was hanging up my update.

211
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,040
And then I would reinstall it later if I wanted it.

212
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,360
But to get there, I eventually got

213
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,280
to the point where I'd be uninstalling the entire.

214
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,100
It's so intertangled with everything

215
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,280
that that is another kind of bloat.

216
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,160
And that's a reputation I don't know if they're

217
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,040
going to get away from for a while.

218
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,400
They might be able to conquer the reputation one.

219
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,960
But people will still be throwing that bloat term

220
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,940
around, I think, because of that package mess,

221
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,080
unless somebody could snap all that up.

222
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,700
Yeah, that's something they were trying

223
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,360
to get rid of when they went on to Plasma 5 and KDE

224
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,040
Frameworks 5.

225
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,380
They were trying to get rid of all that dependency issue.

226
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,520
And now I'm hearing and actually using it, too.

227
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,440
It's just when the needle's at 11 and now it's

228
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,280
been dialed back to 7.

229
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,000
But my opinion, there's more dialing back to go, I think.

230
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,640
JJ, you had a question about the undestructible desktop.

231
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,600
Are you talking about the Bulletproof project

232
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,940
we had a while ago?

233
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,480
Yes, sir.

234
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,040
Yes, sir.

235
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,160
I was sort of trying to point that also in terms

236
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:19,960
of your recent crashes with Gnome and comparing that

237
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,360
to switching over to a new desktop possible.

238
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,480
Yeah, the unbreakable Bulletproof desktop project

239
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,600
sort of is what got me going down the path of solace

240
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,840
for a while.

241
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,800
But then I ended up having some issues with Budgie,

242
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,120
and so I moved off.

243
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,600
And that's sort of when the project died.

244
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,440
However, recently, as a thought experiment,

245
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,320
I've thought about how it might be fun to just poke

246
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,040
at Fedora Atomic Workstation.

247
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:50,080
So I'm going to try to have someone from that group

248
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,360
on in a few weeks to talk more about that as a possibility.

249
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,480
That kind of transactional update, whatever it might be,

250
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,040
if it maybe comes via snaps and flat packs,

251
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,560
or if it's something that's for the entire way you deploy

252
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,560
all software on the system, more like Atomic,

253
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,640
there may be a solution somewhere in there.

254
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,220
I just don't feel like we're there yet.

255
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,220
I do genuinely feel like we're on the right track to that,

256
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,440
in part because of snaps and flat packs and Docker

257
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,280
and all these other things that we love to hate too.

258
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,080
Yeah, and personally, I'm sort of on this similar boat

259
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,760
with me switching back and forth

260
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,520
between Ubuntu distributions,

261
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,480
but I've been stable on Ubuntu Mate for a little while.

262
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,320
Yeah, it is a nice landing spot, isn't it, Mr. Wimpy?

263
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,720
Wimpy, I was just thinking of you

264
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,120
because you and I have gone back and forth

265
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,200
about the transition to Wayland

266
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
and some of our different thoughts

267
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,440
about what kind of transition

268
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,360
that may actually end up being.

269
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,720
And so, Wimpy, I wanted to know what you thought

270
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,700
about this post on the Kaywin development blog

271
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,000
about Kaywin is now considering X11

272
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,980
as indefinitely feature frozen,

273
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,920
that their support for X11 is feature frozen.

274
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,640
They'll still do maintenance, so security fixes and whatnot,

275
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,600
but specifically, they won't be making

276
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,160
specific improvements to X11.

277
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Kaywin won't be adjusted to any new requirements

278
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,000
in the X server, Mesa or the input stack

279
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,240
or proprietary drivers.

280
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,920
If something breaks, it's the fault

281
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,280
of those components which broke it,

282
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,720
and they're going to be focusing their effort,

283
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,360
their development efforts on Wayland

284
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,680
after Plasma Desktop 512 ships.

285
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,800
What do you think about this, Wimpy,

286
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,360
about going just all in on Wayland

287
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,680
and saying that X11's done, it's done?

288
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,620
Well, KDE are in the fortunate position

289
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,840
where they've invested a huge amount of effort

290
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,900
over the years to keep pace with Wayland as it's evolved,

291
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,560
and the only two desktops right now,

292
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,680
or rather, the only two desktops

293
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,480
that we've had for a long time, Gnome and KDE,

294
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,920
have arrived with Wayland support,

295
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,560
so it makes sense for them to invest in the future.

296
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,360
And that's their project decision.

297
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,240
I mean, if they feel it's ready for prime time, then.

298
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,560
That's pretty political, I'll admit.

299
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,800
I gotta say, because to me, I feel like a lot of users

300
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,200
are gonna have a super rocky transition to Wayland.

301
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,920
I wonder if it's not gonna be 10 times harder

302
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,080
than the community expects it to be.

303
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,480
I don't know about this, because what I haven't done

304
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,200
is I haven't run a Wayland-composited desktop

305
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,560
or window manager other than Gnome 3.

306
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,880
So some of the rough edges that I've seen on Gnome 3,

307
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,240
That's a good point.

308
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,640
I don't know how that translates to things

309
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,560
like Sway or Lyri or KDE.

310
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,520
Yeah, point well made.

311
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,880
You could be absolutely correct there.

312
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,800
And Martin points out in the blog post

313
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,060
that they've sort of architected their,

314
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,520
essentially their Wayland system, their KWIN,

315
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,140
they've architected it in such a way that

316
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,700
they don't really need to implement a lot of stuff

317
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,540
at that level.

318
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,480
If you read through the blog post,

319
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,640
he says that there will be new features that'll come along,

320
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,680
but most functionality in KWIN is independent

321
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,980
of the windowing system.

322
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,400
Any improvements to the areas that benefit Wayland Annex 11,

323
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,760
so if they make some new feature,

324
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,360
and he gives examples like tool tips on decoration buttons,

325
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:26,280
improved blur effects, or rework of side desktop effects,

326
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,040
they're making those improvements to KWIN.

327
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,080
They're not necessarily X11 or Wayland specific.

328
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,520
Both X11 and Wayland users will get that stuff

329
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,480
because of the way they've architected KWIN.

330
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,760
And so with that in mind,

331
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,980
I think it does make a lot of sense.

332
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,680
I think that's actually a pretty good move.

333
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,340
And it does kind of make me want to try out Plasma 512,

334
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,720
probably eventually 513,

335
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,160
because that's really when all this stuff lands

336
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,560
is Plasma 513.

337
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,760
Does kind of really kind of make me want to try it

338
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,560
because you make a fair point, Wimpy.

339
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,960
I think the bulk of my experience

340
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,820
with a few exceptions has been Gnome 3 on Wayland,

341
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,120
and I may have made some assumptions

342
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,420
based on that experience that aren't fair.

343
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,360
So I think when time gets right,

344
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,760
I got to spend some time on KWIN and Wayland

345
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,700
and just see how that compares.

346
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,680
That's a good point.

347
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,520
All right.

348
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,960
It's some really, really good news this week.

349
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,520
We talked about it pretty in depth on Linux action news,

350
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,640
but I'd be derelict in my duties

351
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,080
if I didn't tell you guys about this here

352
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,340
on the unplugged program.

353
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,920
The city of Barcelona is switching to Linux

354
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,560
and open source software in a pretty smart way,

355
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,240
and they're doing it in a pretty smooth timeline.

356
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,700
So first of all, the first thing they're really doing

357
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,520
before they've even switched out a single desktop

358
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,300
is they're going to invest 70% of their software budget

359
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,160
into open source software development.

360
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,500
Then they're creating a transition period

361
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,880
that lasts until the spring of 2019,

362
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,040
and they're going to replace Microsoft Office

363
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
with LibreOffice.

364
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,400
They're going to replace Internet Explorer with Firefox.

365
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,480
They're going to do that type of transition,

366
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,800
and then once everybody's up and running

367
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,820
on these applications,

368
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,960
and they've developed the new backend applications they need

369
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,040
and probably like web versions of them,

370
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,880
that's an assumption on my part,

371
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,720
they're going to move people over to Ubuntu.

372
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,320
They're going to just ship with the Ubuntu desktop

373
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,060
instead of trying to build their own desktop,

374
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,440
which is really where Munich went off in the weeds,

375
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,440
and they're already running 1,000 Ubuntu-based desktops

376
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,260
right now as a pilot project.

377
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,900
This is how you do this.

378
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,680
They're doing essentially all the things right here.

379
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,320
Like, I was joking with Joe on Linux Action News,

380
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,120
but I kind of want to know what you think, Beard,

381
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,320
is this the silver lining of Munich blowing up

382
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,380
in the Linux community's face,

383
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,080
and the fact that it was a public thing

384
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,840
that Microsoft fans like Paul Thrott today

385
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,600
is making a Munich joke on Twitter today?

386
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,460
But maybe the silver lining is cities like Barcelona

387
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,520
can watch that and go, oh shit, don't do that.

388
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,760
Yeah, learn from their mistakes.

389
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,920
I think that's exactly right.

390
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,720
I mean, you just do a staged migration.

391
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,080
That way, if you have problems,

392
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,960
you can roll back that one specific step

393
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,000
instead of the whole thing.

394
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,280
Yeah, I hope this works.

395
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,320
JJ, you have thought about government

396
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,520
and funding of open-source software?

397
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,280
Well, sort of the usage of a software in government,

398
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,720
like a lot of these systems are Windows-based,

399
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,240
and a lot of them are using older versions of Windows,

400
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,440
and hopefully this Barcelona example,

401
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,400
it seems to be doing all the right stuff,

402
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,880
and like you mentioned before,

403
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,640
and maybe it'll bring a spur to some certain universities

404
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,840
that are reluctant to support Linux,

405
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,120
or certain companies, certain support companies.

406
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,680
Currently, I'm in a university where their IT department

407
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,880
sort of looks down upon Linux at this moment.

408
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,840
Yeah, I've been there.

409
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,960
Boy, that seems like an attitude of 10 years ago, though.

410
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,160
That's sort of unfortunate to hear that in 2018.

411
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,560
Well, I mean, thankfully, some of the professors

412
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,040
are somewhat like one of the professors

413
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,600
that just transferred over to my university.

414
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,120
He's sort of been a pro-Linux advocate,

415
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,080
sort of been, even though he doesn't say,

416
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,320
like, he uses Linux for his code examples and all that,

417
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:29,000
but he's not like, he's like an advocate,

418
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,560
but he's not like outright wears it on his sleeve,

419
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,520
if that makes any sense.

420
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can understand that.

421
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,280
Well, so Popey's drawn my attention to it,

422
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,800
so hashtag blowing Popey.

423
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,040
Thank you so much, Popey.

424
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,840
Breaking news right here on the Unplugged program.

425
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,400
This is CNN breaking news.

426
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,440
Crypto is ruined.

427
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,640
Everything is ruined.

428
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,240
This is why we can't have nice things.

429
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,960
Bitcoin has gone bust.

430
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,160
Popey, you're our Bitcoin reporter on the scene.

431
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,000
What are your thoughts, sir?

432
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,200
What's your analysis of the current Bitcoin crypto market?

433
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,520
All crypto coins are down.

434
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Your analysis, sir?

435
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,600
Those red colors, they're not good, are they?

436
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,720
I don't think so, yeah.

437
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,680
It seems like those are bad, right?

438
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,960
And they're way over on the far side.

439
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,920
You see how far over they are?

440
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,760
That seems bad too, right?

441
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,520
Yeah, they got minus signs and everything.

442
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,000
That doesn't look good to me.

443
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,480
Oh, you got a prediction

444
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,240
if this thing's gonna go down to 5,000?

445
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,080
What do you think?

446
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,560
I know you're a big follower.

447
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,440
Yeah, I think everyone should switch to Monero.

448
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,280
There you go.

449
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,960
Yeah, okay, okay.

450
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,040
I had a prediction on the Ubuntu podcast

451
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,680
for the end of year predictions

452
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,920
that said that in December 2018,

453
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,200
the price of Bitcoin would be,

454
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,320
give or take a couple of thousand dollars,

455
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,520
the same as it was in December 2017,

456
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,920
and cited a massive crash,

457
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,200
but a recovery that we've not seen in Bitcoin before.

458
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Yep, as soon as I heard that prediction,

459
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,160
I said to myself,

460
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,760
shit, that's way better than my prediction.

461
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,800
He's absolutely right.

462
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,640
And I knew it.

463
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,320
In fact, after I thought to myself,

464
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,320
I wouldn't be surprised if in the next month

465
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,760
we see this thing get down to 10,000,

466
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,120
and now here we are at 11,000.

467
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,120
I hate making predictions about Bitcoin.

468
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,360
I totally blame Joe for that.

469
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm just kidding, Joe, I don't.

470
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,240
It was the meme-y thing to make predictions about

471
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,200
at the end of the year.

472
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,040
Yeah, it was huge.

473
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,080
Yep, yep, and now it's going down like crazy.

474
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,400
You know, I still maintain that open source currency

475
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,640
for fun internet money

476
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,880
or for clandestine worldwide transactions

477
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,200
still has a value.

478
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,320
It's still, I think, I don't think,

479
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,160
I don't know if it's Bitcoin.

480
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,040
See, the problem, I think what happened was

481
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,400
is people started realizing that,

482
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,520
at least in my opinion,

483
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,960
that these transaction costs were getting to the point

484
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,680
where essentially you had unusable Bitcoin.

485
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,920
If you had like some Bitcoin Satoshis hanging around,

486
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,760
they were unusable.

487
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,480
You couldn't, you would have to spend more

488
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,320
than they were worth to get them

489
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,360
to even move across the network at any reliable speed

490
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,640
for any kind of like online transaction.

491
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,680
And I think once that really sunk in with people,

492
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,520
this is what happened.

493
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,480
Maybe if they would have solved the blockchain,

494
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,400
the block size issue months and months

495
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,320
and months and months ago

496
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,120
when it was a hot topic at the beginning of 2017,

497
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,640
we might not be here right now.

498
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,400
But they punted on a solution.

499
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,800
Several forks emerged as a result.

500
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:16,240
And this is, I think, that playing out right now

501
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,920
because the network became unsustainable.

502
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,420
Just too slow, too expensive.

503
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,960
It is probably gonna come back up eventually though.

504
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,000
So I'm sure people will call it a fire sale.

505
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,720
There was an article, I don't know if you saw it, Wimpy,

506
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,160
going around that, it was pretty popular,

507
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,880
so you may have, going around that just several,

508
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,960
just a couple of key Bitcoin players

509
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,880
were moving the market as much as 40% some days

510
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,180
back in the Mt. Gox days.

511
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:44,480
Just a couple of people.

512
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,360
I can imagine in the Mt. Gox days that was fairly easy.

513
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,200
That was, those were dark days.

514
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it seems to be getting,

515
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,740
it's interesting though,

516
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,760
that story is getting a lot of attention today.

517
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,960
So it's back from the Mt. Gox day,

518
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,320
but today's the day that it's getting passed around

519
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,380
a lot online.

520
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,880
And who knows, by the time this episode

521
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,000
actually is available for download,

522
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,440
it could be down another $5,000.

523
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,360
I don't mean to laugh, I'm sorry,

524
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,200
I know some people are dying.

525
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,880
Jeez, I've always kind of figured this could happen.

526
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,760
All right, well, I want to give an overview

527
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,960
of a bunch of really cool community events

528
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,800
that are coming up in just the next couple of months,

529
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,560
including, oh, you know what I don't have a link for,

530
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,480
is that there are flaw stocks.

531
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,560
You guys, so you guys in the Mumble Room,

532
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,980
if you have any upcoming events in the community

533
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,280
that you want to spread the word about,

534
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,600
I'll give you a few moments to think about it.

535
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,120
So prepare your links, get them ready for Discord,

536
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,280
and then we can mention them here on the show

537
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,100
if you have any.

538
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,600
And I'll take a moment and I'll thank Ting

539
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,480
for sponsoring the show while you guys prepare yourselves.

540
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,660
Linux.ting.com is where you go to get $25 off a device

541
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,360
or $25 in service credits.

542
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,280
This is pretty sweet because they have a CDMA

543
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,720
and GSM network, so you can probably bring a phone

544
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,520
and get $25 in service credits.

545
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,140
And the way Ting works is you only pay for what you use.

546
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,120
Your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

547
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,960
No contracts, you just pay for what you use.

548
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
It's $6 for the line and your usage.

549
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,720
Average Ting bill is gonna be around $23

550
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,920
per month per phone.

551
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,880
That's amazing.

552
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,720
Think about that.

553
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,400
I went from, before even all the taxes were done,

554
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,020
and the final bill was higher than this,

555
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,840
but like right around a base bill of $120 a month

556
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,720
for my three phones, and I think that some,

557
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,360
I don't know how it goes from 120 to like 165

558
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,320
after all the crazy taxes and weird fees.

559
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,120
It just, it seems unsustainable,

560
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,680
but yet they make billions in revenue.

561
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,680
And if somebody could get in like a Starship Enterprise

562
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,140
and go around the sun and turn back time

563
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,680
and then relaunch wireless networks,

564
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,000
they'd all have to do it this way.

565
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,360
It's pay for what you use.

566
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,280
You just pay for however much you talk, text, and data you use.

567
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,260
They give you really good tools to control all of it.

568
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,440
I've been a Ting customer now for three years

569
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,360
and called them twice.

570
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,600
One was because I was doing something crazy with a MiFi,

571
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,280
and the other was because I didn't know

572
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,600
you could actually activate a phone

573
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,920
on their website at first.

574
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,520
It's like, what company lets you do that?

575
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,700
But they do, and it's great, which means now,

576
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,460
like I turn MiFis on and off like crazy.

577
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,600
It's just, it's perfect for me

578
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,880
because I take advantage of both network CDMA and GSM.

579
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,800
They always have a very active blog.

580
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,180
They're talking about right now a referral giveaway.

581
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,340
You can check that out at their blog.

582
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,960
Just start by going to linux.ting.com.

583
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,260
That'll take some money off a device

584
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,520
or give you service credit,

585
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,360
and then you can get started

586
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,480
with pay for what you use mobile wireless.

587
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,020
Linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com,

588
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,000
and thanks to Ting for sponsoring the unplugged program.

589
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,920
Okay, guys, so does anybody have a community event

590
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,800
that they want to pass along?

591
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,480
I'll give a plug for one that's coming up

592
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,400
in just a couple of days to warm us up.

593
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,200
Devconf.cz is a 10th annual free Red Hat-sponsored

594
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,880
community conference for developers, admins,

595
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,680
and dev-op engineers, and many more,

596
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,480
and it's in the Czech Republic.

597
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,200
So I'll have a link to that in the show notes

598
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,120
if you're gonna be there.

599
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,320
It's the city of Brno, B-R-N-O,

600
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,360
so I'm probably butchering that,

601
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,980
and it's at the Faculty of Information Technology.

602
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,360
I have all that information in the show notes.

603
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,120
January 26th, I believe, is yes.

604
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,760
The 26th through the 28th online registration

605
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,680
is already open if you go to devconf.cz.

606
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,520
Give them a little mention

607
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,960
because that is coming up right around the corner.

608
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,680
The other one that's just not too far,

609
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,360
at least in my world, is Linux Fest Northwest 2018,

610
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,480
April 28th through the 29th.

611
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,880
You know Jupyter Broadcasting's gonna be there.

612
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,400
We're gonna probably do something different

613
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,320
than we've ever done before.

614
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,600
I don't quite have it all worked out,

615
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,920
but we're thinking about potentially attempting

616
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,000
to record one of each show that we can there.

617
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,360
So instead of just sitting there on the livestream

618
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,080
and just sort of DJing and just sort of shooting the S,

619
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,640
we'll actually be doing shows live there,

620
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,320
maybe all of the shows if we can, as many as we can,

621
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,960
live at Linux Fest, maybe pulling different appropriate

622
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,560
guests for different types of shows.

623
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,000
Alan will be there with us and it's always a great time.

624
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,640
So April 28th through the 29th, Linux Fest or lfnw.org.

625
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,960
They have a call for, if you want to talk,

626
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,080
they still have an open presentation.

627
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,360
You can submit it now for like a couple of more days.

628
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,600
So get that in if you want to do that, lfnw.org.

629
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,980
And then Floss Talk Live, which I was gonna get more

630
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:29,760
from Joe on and I forgot, cause I'm a bad person.

631
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,320
But, or no, was it-

632
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,600
Good job, I'm here now then.

633
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,300
Oh, well then there, look at, geez.

634
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,980
Geez, you just say his name and he shows up.

635
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,640
That's, so was it Floss Talk we were gonna,

636
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,320
now I'm actually thinking it wasn't Floss Talk.

637
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm thinking it was Fozdom, actually, now that you're here.

638
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,200
So Joe, what the hell's going on?

639
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,240
Tell people about it.

640
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,120
So Floss Talk Live, not Floss Talk Live.

641
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,760
Ah, that's what I, I knew I was mixing something up.

642
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,600
Yeah, yeah.

643
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,280
So it's a live event that's happening in June.

644
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,900
Okay.

645
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:02,100
And it's, well, we've done it for the last couple of years

646
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:02,940
in the summer.

647
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,520
It's in a small pub in King's Cross in London.

648
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,920
And it's traditionally been Linux Voice, Ubuntu Podcast,

649
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,120
Linux Luddites, or Late Night Linux.

650
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,600
And then a mashup show featuring Stuart Langridge

651
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,420
and Dave from Geek News Radio.

652
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,680
And it's just been an excuse to get together, drink,

653
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,120
and watch some live podcasts.

654
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,080
Nice.

655
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,920
When is it?

656
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,800
Do you guys have a, do you have like the,

657
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,720
I know the site's, is the site updated yet?

658
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,960
I don't think so, right?

659
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,240
No, I haven't updated the site.

660
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,440
I've updated the Twitter, but not the website.

661
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,000
All right, so it will be at fostalk.com

662
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:37,960
eventually for details,

663
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,440
and then go check it out on Twitter right now.

664
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,800
I'll put a link to the Twitter in the show nizzles.

665
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,680
There you go.

666
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,520
So maybe we'll-

667
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,240
We've got our hotel room already.

668
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,060
Yeah?

669
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,160
Oh, GC now?

670
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,480
Now I'm getting FOMO.

671
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,040
God dang it, guys.

672
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,800
Come on my own show and give me FOMO.

673
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
It's the 9th of June, by the way.

674
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,160
So everyone put that in your calendar

675
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,860
if you're around London, the 9th of June this year.

676
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,700
Very good.

677
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:03,780
The 9th of June, 2018 for a drunken mashup

678
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,980
of a bunch of different Linux podcasters.

679
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,320
And go say hi to Mr. Popey, he smells great.

680
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,800
And so it's always a pleasure to bump into him.

681
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,360
Joe, thanks for popping on real quick

682
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
and setting me straight,

683
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,000
because I was going to blow that.

684
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,240
Yeah, no worries.

685
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,060
I am out and about.

686
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,200
That's why I sound a bit different.

687
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,440
Yeah, no, I still appreciate it.

688
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,280
All right.

689
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,880
Well, so then, of course, there's the next event,

690
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,160
the granddaddy event that always gets a lot of attention.

691
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,800
And this is the last one I'm going to mention this week

692
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,980
before we get to Barton.

693
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,800
And that is Scale16x, March 8th through the 11th

694
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,240
at the Pasadena Convention Center in California,

695
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,160
which has a new vibe this year.

696
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,840
They're kind of really trying to push a new vibe.

697
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,240
They wanted to make sure I knew about it.

698
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,760
They wanted to make sure that late night Linux knew about it.

699
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,560
So they sent us information about a Libre photo workshop

700
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,600
that's coming up and even a photography walk

701
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,160
around Pasadena, which actually would be kind of legit.

702
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,120
If you're going to Pasadena,

703
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,600
why not go out for a photography walk?

704
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
That actually sounds kind of worth it,

705
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,760
because you could always use a walk

706
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,480
and it's kind of a beautiful area.

707
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,960
And so they're focusing in for at least one of the tracks

708
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,320
on Libre-free tools to work with graphics.

709
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,720
And they're going to bring a collection of artists,

710
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,760
projects, developers, and just, you know, users

711
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,360
that just want to make the best possible-looking art

712
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,840
on a free desktop.

713
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,640
So Libre Graphics at Scale is going to present talks

714
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,520
designed for general audience of users and developers.

715
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,180
They're going to vary in subject matter from tutorials

716
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:33,880
and workflows to project announcements and packaging.

717
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,080
Specifically, that'll be Friday the 9th of March

718
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,720
from 10 a.m. to 1700.

719
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,280
The 16th Annual Southern California Linux Expo.

720
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Anybody in the Mamba Room planning to go?

721
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,360
Really?

722
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,920
Just me?

723
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,760
That's so sad.

724
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,320
I don't know what's thinking about going.

725
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,400
Well, you know, I don't know exactly.

726
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,440
I haven't fully figured it out, but I think I'm going.

727
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,360
I have trouble getting vacation time, so yeah.

728
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,080
Yeah, my boss makes me go.

729
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,920
So.

730
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,760
Ha ha.

731
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,360
We'll be at a company thing in Budapest,

732
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,000
so it'll be difficult for us to go.

733
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,560
Oh yeah, okay.

734
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,440
All right.

735
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,560
Okay, I'll be lonely there.

736
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,440
But you know, I'll just hang out

737
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,360
with all my other Linux friends.

738
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,200
That's fine.

739
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,840
You guys just make it a good party.

740
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,800
That's cool.

741
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:20,000
We ought to just sync up our schedules ahead of time.

742
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,060
We just get a Google Calendar,

743
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,240
so that way I can make sure I'm always

744
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,080
wherever you are, Poppy.

745
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,240
That's really what I want to go for.

746
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,820
So you can find out more at sociallinuxexpo.org.

747
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,800
That is for scale 16.

748
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,680
And I'm going to be there in some capacity,

749
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,740
there with Noah doing our thing,

750
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,920
trying to pull him constantly away from all the ham guys.

751
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,800
That's what Noah does.

752
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,440
Noah goes there, he gets a feel for the layout,

753
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,480
and then he just goes and hangs out

754
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,440
with the ham guys all the time.

755
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,600
Because they've got the cool toys, they really do.

756
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,480
And they're proud of it.

757
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,840
So it's actually kind of a blast.

758
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,240
Let's get Barton on.

759
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,600
The XPS 13 is, it's kind of this strange beast.

760
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,980
Because if you just go out on the web

761
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,680
and Google search XPS 13,

762
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,420
you get something that runs Windows 10.

763
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,760
It's probably not what you're looking for

764
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,400
if you're listening to this show.

765
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,480
But you've heard that there is,

766
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,880
there is specifically a version of it that runs Ubuntu.

767
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,060
We've talked about it many times.

768
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,080
I've done reviews in the past.

769
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,160
Went down there to Dell last year,

770
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,240
got kind of my eyes on all of the different products,

771
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,500
including things outside the XPS line.

772
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,640
And so there's this sort of Skunk Works project

773
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,960
called the Sputnik project that we've covered on and off

774
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,820
that's been brewing in the background.

775
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,080
And it's been getting more and more prominence

776
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,520
at dell.com too.

777
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,160
Like now, today, if you go to dell.com slash developers,

778
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,680
or dell.com slash Sputnik, you find it right away.

779
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,520
There was a period in time

780
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,120
where it was kind of like buried on the Dell website.

781
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,200
It was like, wasn't clear.

782
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,820
Is this something they're really into?

783
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:46,320
But we are now seven releases,

784
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,160
the seventh generation,

785
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,560
we're seven releases into this product line.

786
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,160
Over five years now into this product line.

787
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,760
And they've been iterating on it over and over

788
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,640
and over again.

789
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,940
And so last week, middle of last week, I think,

790
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:04,860
they announced the new XPS 13 with eighth generation

791
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,780
Intel processors and all of those goodies.

792
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,280
So I wanted to bring Barton on to talk about it

793
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:16,280
because I honestly, I expected Dell to blow it by now.

794
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,160
I just thought, nothing good lasts forever.

795
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,920
And they've been doing it for like five years.

796
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,920
I just kind of thought, it's gonna slip, it's gonna slip.

797
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,440
But they've proven me wrong.

798
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,320
So when I saw the new release,

799
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,480
I immediately fired off an email to Barton,

800
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,360
said, come on the show.

801
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,360
So before we go to Barton,

802
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,960
let's stop right here and thank DigitalOcean

803
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,320
for sponsoring the Unplugged program, DigitalOcean.com.

804
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,080
You go over there, you create your account

805
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,480
and then use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED, it's one word,

806
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,520
and you get a $10 credit.

807
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,280
And they've just recently adjusted their pricing

808
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,800
to make it even more competitive.

809
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,920
And they got a new website too that is gorgeous.

810
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,080
DigitalOcean.com, create the account,

811
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,140
use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED, and then go dig around.

812
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,660
They got the best dashboard.

813
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,120
Every other vendor in this area

814
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,120
is attempting to rip them off

815
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,200
and they can't even compete

816
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,200
because DigitalOcean doesn't stand still.

817
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,660
When they're not making their features better,

818
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,340
when they're not adding things like monitoring or spaces,

819
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,540
or when they're not doing those things,

820
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,080
they're revving their website and they're revving their API

821
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,360
or they're publishing amazing documentation.

822
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,160
They just do not stand still.

823
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,600
It's such a great service that anytime I wanna try out

824
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,780
a new open source project these days,

825
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,760
anything that's server-based at all,

826
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,320
I don't even bother with a VM.

827
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,260
I just go spin up a droplet in seconds.

828
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,660
I've been talking about it this last couple of weeks,

829
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,540
it just blows me away for Linux action news.

830
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,980
Just over the weekend,

831
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,480
I'm gonna try out NextCloud 13 for the weekend.

832
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,320
Let's see how that goes.

833
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,080
I'm just gonna try out NextCloud 13

834
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,800
with the new NextCloud talk.

835
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,400
I had that up and running in five minutes,

836
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,160
but you're in a combination of 50,

837
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:52,800
I think I would deploy in, I say usually 40 seconds,

838
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,760
they say 55 seconds.

839
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,240
I mean, it just spins up so damn fast,

840
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,080
it almost doesn't matter.

841
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,000
You get a system up and running, you pick the data center,

842
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,600
they have data centers all over the world.

843
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,800
I chose Ubuntu 16.04, I SSH into that sucker.

844
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,120
I then immediately did a pseudo snap install

845
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,080
NextCloud dash dash edge, I think it was,

846
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,060
to get the NextCloud 13.

847
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,000
So that was within, I don't know,

848
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,080
two minutes of creating the create machine button.

849
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,640
I was installing NextCloud 13,

850
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,320
and then by minute three,

851
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,120
I was pulling up my NextCloud,

852
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,080
you know, the final configuration wizard

853
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,720
in my web browser on my desktop

854
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,220
off of a DigitalOcean droplet.

855
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,600
And then I could do calls,

856
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,840
and with DigitalOcean's incredible network speed,

857
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,680
40 gigabits coming to those hypervisors,

858
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,080
so I'm sitting there doing the,

859
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,180
it just, it blew me away that I just,

860
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,360
back in the day, I used to take,

861
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,880
it took me two to three, sometimes a month,

862
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,840
to get a new server.

863
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,640
And now I can do it in five minutes,

864
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,520
I have the whole damn thing set up.

865
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,920
It's really incredible.

866
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,440
They have cluster deployments,

867
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,040
they have different kind of optimizations

868
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,280
for different compute types, pre-build applications,

869
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,760
or you build the whole thing from the ground up.

870
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,200
It's really awesome, it's a really good service.

871
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,480
DigitalOcean.com, try it out,

872
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,880
and use our promo code DOUNPLUG.

873
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,040
So we've got this new fancy XPS 13,

874
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,640
there's only one thing to do.

875
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,280
So joining me to talk about the new XPS 13

876
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,700
is the horse's mouth, essentially.

877
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,640
It's Mr. Barton George.

878
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,720
Barton, welcome back to the show.

879
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,240
Well, thank you, yes, horse's mouth.

880
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,040
You don't mind if I call you a horse's mouth, do you?

881
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,800
I love that one, I'm gonna put that on my business card.

882
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,040
You know, it's not a comment on your physical appearance,

883
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,720
it's just a comment on your authority on the topic.

884
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,400
Oh, authoritarianism, yes, I like that.

885
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,000
Well, there is one source I go to

886
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,760
when there's a new developer edition,

887
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,120
and it's your blog, and I don't know how you guys did it.

888
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,880
I mean, you're supposed to be screwing this up by now,

889
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,880
but it looks like the new, what is this, the seventh gen?

890
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,960
XPS 13 is- Yeah, exactly, yeah, seventh gen.

891
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,880
Knocking it out of the park, I'm impressed.

892
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,080
Which is a bit confusing,

893
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:51,000
because we're one behind the Intel generations.

894
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,840
I wasn't gonna say it, but-

895
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,800
Featuring the eighth generation.

896
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,240
Yeah, and so people, I got that on Twitter,

897
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,640
some people say, wait, shouldn't that be eighth generation?

898
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,000
So. Now, you know what?

899
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,120
I have a feeling with all of the Meltdown Inspector news,

900
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,720
you may actually catch up eventually,

901
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,800
or they'll catch you or something.

902
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,440
And pass them, man, I think that's, you know.

903
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,400
I think that's very likely.

904
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,120
This will just set our sights low.

905
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,960
Well, so the XPS 13, it's like the,

906
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,800
it's the laptop in the Linux world

907
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,240
that really needs no introduction anymore,

908
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,840
which is a pretty remarkable achievement,

909
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,960
if you think about it, and it's been around

910
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,080
for how many years now?

911
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,840
Is this the fifth or seventh year?

912
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,040
Well, you know, the fifth anniversary

913
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,960
was end of November last year,

914
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,920
so that, and by fifth, I mean, anniversary,

915
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,080
I mean, the first one came out then.

916
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,560
We had about six or seven months before that,

917
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,960
that we really flew to market with that,

918
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,840
as far as going from PowerPoint to product.

919
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,920
So, but yeah, we do the counting

920
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,720
from the first product ship.

921
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,960
Well, so- So five years.

922
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,680
Still what seems like the best screen

923
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,760
on any laptop in the market.

924
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,040
I'm surprised that it's still just like,

925
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,400
I mean, nobody really seems to be touching it.

926
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,200
And it's not me that's even saying that anymore.

927
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,280
You probably saw this,

928
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,080
but Linus Torvalds posted on Google Plus

929
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,120
that when he tried out all the different laptops

930
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,920
in this category, the XPS 13,

931
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,320
not only was it the one he went with,

932
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,440
the developer edition, but he liked it so much

933
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,080
that he also bought a second one for his daughter.

934
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,400
So that's pretty high praise.

935
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,880
I think he actually, I think it went,

936
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,040
yeah, yeah, no, exactly, you're right.

937
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,960
I do remember that.

938
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:20,800
Yeah.

939
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,400
Well, that kind of thing didn't go unnoticed by us,

940
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,240
believe what you mean.

941
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,080
I would imagine.

942
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,760
So it really is the laptop that needs no introduction,

943
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,960
but I'll be honest, you're supposed to screw it up eventually,

944
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,160
but it just seems to be getting better.

945
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,160
It's got an i7, what is it, 7,500U i7,

946
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,680
all the way up to that, 16 gigs of RAM, 512 gig SSD,

947
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,640
4K screen, under $2,000.

948
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,880
Oh wait, it's got one terabyte option as well.

949
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,920
Oh, okay.

950
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,280
Okay, well that probably puts it over the $2,000 mark.

951
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,240
But it starts around what, 900?

952
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,920
So that's the entry price?

953
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,760
Exactly, yeah.

954
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,760
And I should also say we're keeping the previous one.

955
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,200
So if you give them numbers, so one's the 9370,

956
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,160
the other one is the 9360,

957
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,080
and we don't use those numbers usually for marketing,

958
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
but I use that.

959
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,840
You can search on Google on those terms

960
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,140
and the right ones will come up.

961
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:20,140
Yes, also, if you go to dell.com and check on,

962
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:25,140
I think you can look on Developer Edition or XPS 13,

963
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,100
it'll show both of those.

964
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,260
Ah, okay, and why are you guys keeping, why?

965
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,780
As opposed to in the past where one has replaced the other.

966
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,120
And that's, and you're asking why is that?

967
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,380
And that's because they're at two different price points.

968
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,560
They're not that far apart,

969
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,380
but there are folks who are gonna say,

970
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,480
hey, Quad Core, I don't really need that.

971
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,720
I'd rather save the money and get something

972
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,420
that is more appropriate for what I'm doing.

973
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,580
Yeah, and the, I mean, I have a fifth generation

974
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,580
XPS 13 Developer Edition.

975
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,420
Oh, well, there you go.

976
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,580
And it's still a great machine.

977
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,460
So I could imagine the sixth generations

978
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,560
would make a lot of people pretty happy.

979
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,180
You also have a non-4K version with a 1080 screen.

980
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,340
How well do those do?

981
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,580
Do the 4K sell a lot better

982
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,700
or are you selling more of the 1080s?

983
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,140
Do you know, can you say?

984
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,420
Well, you know, I don't have the actual split,

985
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,900
but we get people who want, you know,

986
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,540
I don't wanna drive a monitor that,

987
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,340
that, you know, that kind of resolution.

988
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,460
You know, the other thing is just tangentially,

989
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,140
whatever we offer config wise,

990
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,740
there's all these folks who say, dang, that's, you know,

991
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,380
if I would have bought it, if it just had this config.

992
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,780
And so that's one thing we're compiling is

993
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,700
what are the configs that people are saying

994
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,940
that they would want?

995
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,500
You know, what combination?

996
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,900
And then we'll go with, see if we can add it.

997
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,180
Cause we get a time or two during the life cycle

998
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,020
where we look at, well, does it make sense to drop

999
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:57,020
or add a, what you call it, the config.

1000
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,740
And that's the point where we go and we look at the,

1001
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,700
how well is this selling versus that one?

1002
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,700
And so if you get one that's only selling 5%,

1003
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,820
you drop that and you think, okay,

1004
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:10,820
what else might be something that people would enjoy?

1005
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:15,180
So along those lines, I've noticed something

1006
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,300
that's actually the absence of something

1007
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,260
that you guys are doing and it has to be intentional.

1008
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,380
So I want to pick your brain about it because it's,

1009
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,780
no, it's something that I think other OEMs

1010
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,260
need to take a lesson from.

1011
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:32,260
And it's, when I get a Dell XPS 13 and I boot it up,

1012
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,780
it's not Dell, Buntu, it's not like a custom version

1013
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,300
of the Mate desktop that's been themed for Dell

1014
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,820
and has Chrome pre-installed and Eclipse IDE ready

1015
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:46,060
to develop and push applications to the cloud.

1016
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,660
It's just Ubuntu.

1017
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,760
It's about as vanilla with a few changes here and there

1018
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,140
that are probably just for like driver support or whatnot.

1019
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,020
I mean, it's obvious at this point

1020
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,500
that this is a very intentional decision.

1021
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,100
Can you talk about that a little bit?

1022
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,340
Yeah, I think in the beginning, although people did say

1023
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,780
when we're collecting initial feedback,

1024
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,660
we did get a lot of people, it was before we launched it,

1025
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:10,660
a lot of people saying, hey, I just want vanilla Ubuntu.

1026
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,340
But we thought, hey, we can really add some value here

1027
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:15,060
by doing a couple of things.

1028
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,580
We're going to pick the utilities and tools

1029
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,940
that people want most and we'll load those.

1030
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:24,300
And we'll also go and we're going to create this thing

1031
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,660
called the Cloud Launcher, which allows you to take LXE

1032
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:33,660
and take what you create on the laptop as a micro cloud

1033
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,420
and then push that out to the cloud.

1034
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,060
And we're going to do this thing called the Platform Launcher,

1035
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:43,660
which is going to allow you to take software stacks

1036
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:48,400
that are pre-created and load them up with dependencies,

1037
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,500
everything, get them good to go.

1038
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,940
I'm seeing other manufacturers do that currently.

1039
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,540
This is something they're embarking on.

1040
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,880
Yeah, and so we went down that path.

1041
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,300
What we found though was the utilities and tools,

1042
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,060
people really wanted to pick their own.

1043
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,580
That wasn't much value adds, we stopped that.

1044
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:10,220
The profile tool turned out to be a heck of a lot harder

1045
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,660
than we thought, and so that on top of the fact

1046
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,080
that we didn't have people clamoring for it,

1047
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,260
we put that aside.

1048
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:21,260
And then the case of the Cloud Launcher,

1049
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:24,420
serendipitously, this company called Docker came along

1050
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,500
and did what we were trying to do,

1051
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,380
is get a way to write the application

1052
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,300
that you have on your laptop and then get it to the cloud.

1053
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,380
So we started out with these grand ideas of value add

1054
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,940
that the customers would love,

1055
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,820
and in the end, we're at that vanilla point

1056
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,980
that you just mentioned.

1057
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:47,540
Interesting that the developer community

1058
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,220
seems to be of the mindset of if we want it,

1059
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,060
we'll just load it ourselves, which is less work for you.

1060
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:58,500
That's like the best, that's the best of, right?

1061
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,900
Oh yeah, no, exactly.

1062
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,300
That's interesting.

1063
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,280
I think just in general, just sort of zooming back,

1064
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,500
targeting this at the developer community has been great

1065
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,980
in that they offer lots of feedback.

1066
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,000
They also can, certain issues they can, or tweaks,

1067
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,660
they can work amongst themselves to do.

1068
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,660
And so as long as you speak honestly and are transparent,

1069
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,740
there's a lot of feedback and help

1070
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,540
that they're willing to give as well.

1071
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:34,540
Well, you know, one issue that comes to mind

1072
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,340
that it's the number one question I get

1073
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:41,340
when I review an XPS product, it's about the coil whine,

1074
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:46,580
which is not unique to the developer edition of the XPS 13.

1075
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,780
It's something that can happen

1076
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,100
because of just the, I would assume the compact electronics,

1077
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,420
but maybe you can talk about that.

1078
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:56,820
But it wasn't until I started reviewing it for Linux users

1079
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,820
that I started hearing about it all the time.

1080
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,660
Yep.

1081
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,180
So how is that in the new release?

1082
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,380
And were the Linux customer base

1083
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,980
or the developer customer base, as you put it,

1084
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:11,980
were they particularly demanding in that kind of issue

1085
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,060
in a way that the Windows users weren't?

1086
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,820
Like where does that all stand today?

1087
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:19,900
Well, I think, so, you know,

1088
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:24,660
well, I can't go into too much detail

1089
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:27,180
because it involves third parties, et cetera.

1090
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,940
And, you know, anything we say, oh, it's perfect now,

1091
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,860
and then somebody has an issue with it,

1092
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,700
that's not gonna look good.

1093
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,020
And somebody, no matter how perfect anything is,

1094
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,860
something's gonna come up.

1095
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:40,100
All right, so we got a big couch here, but I follow you.

1096
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:45,100
Yeah, yeah, no, I think it was a small subset of folks.

1097
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,620
That being said, if you were one of those lucky subsets,

1098
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,180
that wasn't a good thing.

1099
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:57,180
And I think too, there's also a tolerance level for people.

1100
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,660
So there's certain people that would,

1101
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:06,100
whose parameters were more acute than what we set.

1102
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,180
Sure.

1103
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,100
Say maybe you or I or somebody else

1104
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:10,500
would hear that same thing and say,

1105
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,860
oh, well, that just sort of sounds like

1106
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,740
what things normally sound like.

1107
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,860
And then there's other ones

1108
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,820
that were outside the normal boundary.

1109
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,860
And you'd say, oh, yeah, that makes sense.

1110
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:26,940
So, yes, we have taken steps to ameliorate that.

1111
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:33,140
And, you know, that's basically what I'll say at this point.

1112
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:38,700
Yeah, I understand, you know, I have a fifth gen

1113
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,220
and I reviewed the sixth gen

1114
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,660
and never had the problem myself.

1115
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,860
But I have worked extensively

1116
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,220
with small compact machines in audio production.

1117
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,580
And I know that it is an issue that can crop up.

1118
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,300
I've, for example, had three or four,

1119
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,900
three Intel NUCs actually hooked up to my mixer at one point

1120
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:01,220
and two of them exhibited coil winds

1121
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,740
and one of them didn't, same exact model.

1122
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,580
But it does sound like it's gotten worked on.

1123
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,340
I've been following some of the threads

1124
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,020
and I've been seeing people talking about it.

1125
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,060
It does seem like things have gotten better

1126
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,540
from what I can observe.

1127
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,620
I wonder though, down the road,

1128
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:18,700
is it, am I being over cautious

1129
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:21,820
when I worry that maybe Linux users are persnickety

1130
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,860
but they're too demanding?

1131
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,260
Like, it seems like maybe we're high maintenance

1132
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,340
or is it a good thing?

1133
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,420
You know, I think in general,

1134
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,100
and getting back to what I said a little while ago,

1135
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,580
as long as you treat developers fairly,

1136
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:43,140
they're okay with a certain amount of slack here and there.

1137
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,740
And I also find that oftentimes people have,

1138
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,820
you know, Linux users will joke themselves

1139
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,660
as, hey, we're willing to,

1140
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:55,500
I'm not saying courses in regards to anything we do, no,

1141
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,660
but they feel that, you know,

1142
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,180
things have been so tough for so long

1143
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,580
when things do get better,

1144
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,340
even if they're not 100% perfect,

1145
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,900
they're very happy about it.

1146
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,100
If things tend to be trending in the right direction

1147
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,260
and there seems to be steady progress,

1148
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:11,100
then yeah, I think you're absolutely correct.

1149
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:13,140
And I would say it's the opposite.

1150
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,020
Not that you're not gonna get somebody who is persnickety,

1151
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,100
but I think in general,

1152
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:22,940
the developer crowd seems to be much more understanding

1153
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,020
and willing to work with you

1154
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,420
as long as you're working in good faith,

1155
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,980
you're being honest about what's going on, et cetera.

1156
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:32,420
Well, let's see then, let's shift gears.

1157
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,860
And I think, I was just gonna say one thing too.

1158
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:37,860
Sometimes it's tricky, you know,

1159
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,380
with regards to honesty in that,

1160
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,820
or I shouldn't say honesty, but you always are honest,

1161
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:44,740
but as far as how much you reveal

1162
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:48,980
in that it involves other partners as well and players.

1163
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,580
And so you can't,

1164
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,820
and even if you wanted to come out and say,

1165
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,780
this is what's going on,

1166
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,060
it would involve other folks as well.

1167
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:01,260
Yeah, I think everybody gets that.

1168
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,580
Yeah, I think it's pretty understandable.

1169
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,260
Now, so let's shift gears

1170
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,940
and see if we can make things uncomfortable

1171
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,740
with a different partner, Canonical.

1172
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,020
Oh, please do. Obviously, yeah.

1173
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,580
Let's see if, yeah.

1174
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:14,020
Now, you and I were sitting in a room together

1175
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:15,340
the moment it was announced.

1176
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,420
In fact, I was the person that delivered the news to you

1177
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,700
that Canonical was dropping Unity 7

1178
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,900
and switching to the GNOME desktop.

1179
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,940
How has that-

1180
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,380
Switching back, back, back.

1181
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,220
Right, right.

1182
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,300
How has that been brewing inside internally?

1183
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,820
Because 1710's been out.

1184
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:32,580
I know that you're shipping 1604 currently still.

1185
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,420
Probably won't be shipping 1710 ever,

1186
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,300
because why would you when,

1187
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,300
especially with 1804 right around.

1188
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,940
Is 1804 looking like it's gonna ship on Dell products?

1189
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:45,020
Is GNOME desktop gonna ship on Dell products?

1190
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:47,140
What's your answer for that?

1191
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,540
I'll say that what we usually do

1192
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:52,260
is when we launch a new system,

1193
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:57,260
it comes with the LTS that is current at the time.

1194
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,460
Right, so we don't, like you said,

1195
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,660
we won't do a 1710.

1196
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:05,540
We won't do an 1810 or a, what's after 18?

1197
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:07,940
19, 1904 or something like that.

1198
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,500
We only do, no, we do best efforts

1199
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,620
and we try to support people

1200
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,220
with issues they have in the interim releases,

1201
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,300
but the one that we're gonna guarantee

1202
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:22,180
is the LTS that ships with it.

1203
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,180
I mean, just, you don't even have to,

1204
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:26,340
not even talking about Dell,

1205
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,740
but just like your personal opinion,

1206
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,540
shipping a Linux desktop now for a while,

1207
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,500
working on this.

1208
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,740
How is Bart and George feeling

1209
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:35,180
about the transition to GNOME?

1210
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:39,180
Well, so without knowing all the intricacies,

1211
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,980
because I'm sure there's all sorts of things,

1212
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,180
oh, you didn't think about this

1213
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,020
and realize how it affects that.

1214
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,180
But it does seem like a big switch for some,

1215
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,620
it really does affect a product you're shipping.

1216
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,620
It does, and I think one thing is,

1217
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,060
as a company, you need to know

1218
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,860
when to hold them and when to fold them.

1219
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:00,340
Because one thing happens,

1220
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,420
and I've been in other companies

1221
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,780
that just keep pouring money into things,

1222
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,860
long after it became obvious

1223
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:11,860
that it wasn't great benefit to the customer at that time,

1224
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,900
and it really wouldn't be going forward.

1225
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,860
And yet, there is this desire sometimes

1226
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,580
to keep working at something

1227
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:24,580
long after it's been obvious that it's not the right move.

1228
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,460
So I think it's, and it's always tough.

1229
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,140
I mean, I say it as if that's an easy thing to do,

1230
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,620
but I do have a lot of respect for companies

1231
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:38,460
that early on say, you know what, this isn't gonna happen,

1232
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,780
we're gonna stop it.

1233
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:43,540
And so that's sort of the bigger picture.

1234
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,860
And so within that, put that lens on it,

1235
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:51,420
I think it made sense to realize they had an awesome vision,

1236
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,340
they'd done quite a bit of work,

1237
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:59,820
and it just, they weren't gonna get there to the end.

1238
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,500
They weren't gonna get there to the end.

1239
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,820
There seems to me, Barton, to be a similarity

1240
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:09,100
between what Canonical has done with their desktop.

1241
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,980
They went to Hacker News and other places,

1242
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,820
they said, what do you want out of Ubuntu?

1243
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:15,740
And people said, just ship stock GNOME,

1244
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:17,940
just give me my basic applications.

1245
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:19,860
Sort of reminds me of what people said to Dell

1246
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:21,860
when they said, just ship stock Ubuntu,

1247
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,580
just give me vanilla Ubuntu,

1248
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,780
I just wanna load my own applications.

1249
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,060
You see a similarity there?

1250
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,900
Yeah, and I think it's, you know, once again,

1251
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,500
it's does it add value or not?

1252
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,220
Are you just putting bells and whistles

1253
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,580
that nobody cares about,

1254
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,460
and it comes across as bloatware.

1255
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:40,340
So, yeah, I would see that,

1256
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,100
that there are certain things that are gonna be value add,

1257
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:47,100
but oftentimes in the Linux world,

1258
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,380
it's stuff that you're gonna pull down yourself,

1259
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,020
as opposed to if you're buying a Windows PC,

1260
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,500
having certain applications bundled with it

1261
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,940
really increases the value of the system.

1262
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:03,420
Now, before I let you go,

1263
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,780
I have to ask you something that you're not gonna have

1264
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:08,620
an answer to because you're not the processor guy,

1265
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,060
but I kinda have a tangential question.

1266
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:10,900
42.

1267
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:12,460
Right, okay, answered.

1268
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,660
No, thank you.

1269
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,940
If I, do you know, is this assumption correct?

1270
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:18,260
If I am a Dell XPS 13 user,

1271
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,820
running the Ubuntu that was installed on there

1272
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,260
when I got the machine,

1273
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:24,700
am I likely eventually gonna be able

1274
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,020
to just open up GNOME software

1275
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,140
and get microcode updates for meltdown?

1276
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,140
I know you might not know the intricacies

1277
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,980
of how it's gonna get patched,

1278
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:35,500
but the firmware delivery mechanism through GNOME software

1279
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,820
is something that Dell has gotten uniquely good at,

1280
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:42,420
and I wonder if, what I'm trying to get at is,

1281
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:44,380
how much awareness does it have

1282
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,580
at the Barton George level, this functionality?

1283
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,580
Like, how much of a topic of a conversation

1284
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,060
is this particular feature?

1285
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,860
Because it seems hyper important right now.

1286
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:55,860
The firmware updating through GNOME software,

1287
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:58,380
that working with fwupd, sorry to be vague,

1288
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,940
but that's a specific question.

1289
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,340
How much is that at your level?

1290
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:05,020
So, hardly any at all, right?

1291
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:10,020
So we have folks that are knee-deep

1292
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:13,060
in everything Ubuntu and working on all this,

1293
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,620
and yes, they would be,

1294
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:17,420
we have folks like that on the team,

1295
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:22,420
but my role as chief plate spinner doesn't go that far, so.

1296
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:27,340
Does it come up though, the feature,

1297
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,300
as a topic of conversation, or is it essentially,

1298
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,500
is it just an assumed, baked-in thing now?

1299
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,300
So I can't answer that specifically,

1300
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,500
not meaning that I'm not allowed to, but I just don't know,

1301
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,100
and I know, because there's a separate team.

1302
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,420
As you can imagine, technical meetings,

1303
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,260
internally about how we, what are we doing with Ubuntu

1304
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,620
as far as, from a technical point of view.

1305
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:52,420
Because it also involves your server products

1306
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:56,500
and not just the XPS 13, so I totally get it.

1307
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,540
The reason I wanted to ask is because the one thing

1308
00:52:58,540 --> 00:52:59,820
the audience are gonna say after this interview

1309
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,700
is how come you didn't ask about Meltdown or Spectre?

1310
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,740
And so I had to try to get as close to something

1311
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:05,620
I thought you'd be able to answer in that regard,

1312
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,940
unless you wanna talk about-

1313
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:08,580
Yeah, I understand, we put it in bite-sized chunks,

1314
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,500
but the answer is, yeah, I don't know.

1315
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,820
I mean, if you wanna get into x86 architecture new ones,

1316
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,620
is with me, I mean, we could do it, but it doesn't seem

1317
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,740
like that'd probably be either one of our power areas.

1318
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,300
I was hoping we'd get into the Spark chip, really,

1319
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:26,300
I think, or the old RISC MIP chips.

1320
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,180
Right, right, absolutely.

1321
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:33,180
That's here is coming into my eye right now as I think back.

1322
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:36,100
So what trends is Barton George watching

1323
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,660
in the Linux world that he thinks will be something

1324
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,940
that Dell needs to respond to in the nearish term future?

1325
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,940
Oh, gosh, putting me on the spot.

1326
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,780
Yeah, it's sort of like, put your strategy hat on.

1327
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:53,540
Well, I think for us, it's much more,

1328
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:58,540
you go back to that, what is the customer looking for?

1329
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:03,540
And we just take what's out there and make sure it runs

1330
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:06,700
without a hitch on our system.

1331
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:09,940
So where Dell is looking at is, okay,

1332
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,020
how do we make, from a hardware point of view,

1333
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:16,540
how do we make systems that are continuously better

1334
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,300
for our customers?

1335
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,940
And then given that, how do we work,

1336
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,340
take what's out there in Linux

1337
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,380
and make it work on the laptops?

1338
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:31,380
So I think we're much closer focused in,

1339
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:35,180
also because, as I said, that's a lot of the stuff

1340
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:38,620
that the customers in particular will do

1341
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:41,140
and will decide on their own.

1342
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:46,140
Do you have any sense of what Linux could do better

1343
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,660
to be more successful in large corporations

1344
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:52,300
as an actual viable desktop OS?

1345
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,260
Is it just, is it an application issue?

1346
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,180
Take Dell, for example.

1347
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,780
If even if you're, Dell, you have to,

1348
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,980
even if you have a Linux machine,

1349
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,740
you still at some point, you functionally need

1350
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:03,340
a Windows machine to fully participate on the network.

1351
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:06,540
Is that an entrenched, irretractable position

1352
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,940
that Windows has etched out?

1353
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,180
Or sitting at your desk at Dell,

1354
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,820
could you foresee a day when even corporations

1355
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,660
as large as Dell could be shipping Linux

1356
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,060
on all of their desktops?

1357
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:23,900
Well, I think I'll answer that some of the key things

1358
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,780
that are missing is you got internal apps, right?

1359
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:30,740
Whether they're name tools or your expense reports,

1360
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:34,340
et cetera, that need to be done.

1361
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,180
They need to be rewritten if they're gonna be a Linux.

1362
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,100
Right, exactly.

1363
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:42,140
And so there's all that, as well as,

1364
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:46,460
as you say, we as many large companies run on Windows

1365
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,380
and we need to have all those applications.

1366
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:52,380
And so, for right now, they're great developer boxes

1367
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,540
within ourselves, as you say, within a large corporation,

1368
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:59,540
but they aren't general purpose machines.

1369
00:55:59,540 --> 00:56:02,460
So that, I think that's gonna be tough

1370
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,940
that you're gonna need to sort of,

1371
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:06,340
at least to begin with,

1372
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:11,060
figure out what use cases you can pick

1373
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:16,060
and you don't wanna overestimate the power of Linux

1374
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,140
to supplant everything else.

1375
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,980
So don't overshoot, maybe?

1376
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,140
Because here's what I was kind of angling to is,

1377
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:30,580
is perhaps the strategy, or whatever you wanna call it,

1378
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,540
or perhaps should the goal be, maybe the goal post

1379
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:36,060
should now be a niche of the market

1380
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:40,220
that is large and growing and sophisticated?

1381
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:42,300
And should the discussion be more about

1382
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,460
retooling our desktops like GNOME

1383
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,180
to super serve a more sophisticated developer type audience?

1384
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,060
And maybe it's worth, stop chasing that

1385
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,700
total new computer user, that fantasy Linux user.

1386
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,220
Because it does seem like if we double down,

1387
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,340
if the Linux community could pull a Sputnik project

1388
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,180
and sort of just say,

1389
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,660
what would we build just for developers?

1390
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,380
We might have a lot of success there.

1391
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,220
What do you think?

1392
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,300
Yeah, no, I think that's what it's all about

1393
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:15,220
is sticking to your knitting, as they say.

1394
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:18,580
So it's not the, it's iterative, right?

1395
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:21,700
You start small, you're agile,

1396
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,540
you see what works and what doesn't work.

1397
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,540
As opposed to, by the year 20, what are we in now?

1398
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,020
2022, we're gonna be all 100% Linux

1399
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:33,780
on the desktop in our enterprise.

1400
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,500
And it's looking to expand beyond that.

1401
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,940
But as you say, the obvious targets to begin with

1402
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:44,580
are how can we do a developer machine

1403
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,900
that keeps meeting more of the developer needs,

1404
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,900
developers needs, or scientists, engineering scientists.

1405
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:57,020
Might we make a machine learning AI developer box

1406
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,940
that would have all those goodies,

1407
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,100
whatever those might be.

1408
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,940
Right.

1409
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,540
Or do you find out, once again, that it's,

1410
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,500
hey, whatever I want, I'll pull down myself

1411
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,740
so I don't need anything tailored to learning it.

1412
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,500
What we're kind of getting is,

1413
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,260
these users are generally capable enough

1414
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,100
of customizing their own system

1415
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,460
for their particular edge case

1416
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,100
if you give them the right base.

1417
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,020
So take machine learning and AI.

1418
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,660
That's a different machine than an XPS 13,

1419
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,140
but it's a type of machine that Dell certainly does sell.

1420
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,940
And if you could tune that right,

1421
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,980
give them the platform or the tool,

1422
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:33,300
and then they take care of the software side of it.

1423
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,300
And so maybe you get really good at doing that

1424
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,580
for a couple of markets.

1425
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,820
And then once you've really nailed that,

1426
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,140
you move on to another market.

1427
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,140
And then you nail that one.

1428
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:42,300
Yeah, exactly.

1429
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:46,140
And you look at what is value add in that area?

1430
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,380
Just like we said, when we originally went out with this

1431
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:52,620
and asked people what they wanted, they did say vanilla.

1432
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:53,620
And like I said, then we said,

1433
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,260
well, no, no, but we'll even give you more than vanilla.

1434
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,020
We'll give you all sorts of swirls

1435
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,580
and chocolate chunks in there.

1436
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:03,740
But yeah, to find out, say, once again, machine learning

1437
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:06,980
or people in the music industry or whatever it might be,

1438
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:10,340
what would you see as something that would be,

1439
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,460
that would make your life easier or better

1440
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:15,460
if we could provide it?

1441
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:20,380
Now, my last question is crystalline silica material?

1442
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,540
Wow.

1443
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:23,860
Now you're very gracious.

1444
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,700
This isn't, no, this is the quote.

1445
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:29,500
You would know because all retweets are,

1446
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,940
you fully support them.

1447
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,980
You retweeted a quote right here, not painted white.

1448
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,420
The new Dell XPS, don't get this wrong, everybody.

1449
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:38,620
It is not white.

1450
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,620
It is made of crystalline silica material

1451
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,580
that literally weaves the white color in like fabric

1452
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,220
in nine composite layers.

1453
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,300
Yeah, no, I tell you.

1454
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,300
You must be watching my tweets very carefully.

1455
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,500
You retweeted that, I don't know.

1456
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,500
Well, I'm on there right now.

1457
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,740
I'm on there right now, yeah.

1458
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,820
Okay, there you go.

1459
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,580
At Barton808, I go there every day, at Barton808,

1460
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,420
and all of our audience should too.

1461
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,620
Because if I were a betting man, dear audience,

1462
01:00:04,620 --> 01:00:06,340
I would bet that there may be an update

1463
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,980
along the precision line soon,

1464
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,500
and that's one of my favorite lines.

1465
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,540
So keep an eye out at Barton808.

1466
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:15,900
I can never, I can neither confirm nor deny wink wink.

1467
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:18,620
Of course not, of course not, yes.

1468
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,740
And of course you saw when I retweeted that,

1469
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:23,420
I also put in the shameless plug for the developer edition.

1470
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,460
Yes, of course, good man, good man.

1471
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:26,300
Yeah, we'll have links to-

1472
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,100
It wasn't so much about what they said, it was just, hey.

1473
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,500
A chance to plug your stuff.

1474
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:33,420
As you should, as you should.

1475
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,660
The XPS 13 is, so like Barton said,

1476
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,760
available now in the 6th gen and 7th gen model.

1477
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,980
The 7th gen is hot.

1478
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:44,140
It's the 93070, not hot literally,

1479
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,300
but hot like in the, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1480
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,260
With lots of different configs,

1481
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,940
I will link to bartongeorge.io in the show notes

1482
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:51,820
where you guys can read about it

1483
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,460
as well as the other product pages.

1484
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,940
Barton, is there anything else we want to mention

1485
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:56,300
before we roll out of here?

1486
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:00,380
No, I think that the one thing that I would say is,

1487
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:03,380
I was completely blown away by the amount of interest

1488
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,860
generated by this release.

1489
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:06,700
Oh yeah.

1490
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,120
Because as you know, it's number seven,

1491
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,740
and I thought it would be incrementally, you know,

1492
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,940
or same sort of level of interest.

1493
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:17,200
And I got more hits on my blog that first day

1494
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,300
than I have in 10 years that I've been doing that blog.

1495
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,860
So it was just, it was not what I expected.

1496
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,700
As I said, I expected people to be interested

1497
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,500
because we have folks who are interested in it.

1498
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:29,980
But, you know, I'm glad to hear that.

1499
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,540
It doesn't surprise me a single bit, Barton,

1500
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,820
because, you know, the reason I drove my RV

1501
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,860
down to your office was because I could tell

1502
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,820
there was momentum building around this product line,

1503
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:41,900
which snapped my attention around.

1504
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,300
And so I am not surprised to see it's continuing to build

1505
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:48,140
because I could, I could smell it coming, Barton.

1506
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,080
I could, like an Austin barbecue.

1507
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,340
What was it, your bunions were tweeting

1508
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,180
or something like that?

1509
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,000
You knew it was going to rain?

1510
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:56,840
I don't know.

1511
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,140
I'm not sure, I'm not sure.

1512
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:01,540
Right now, I'm just thinking about Austin barbecue

1513
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:02,380
now that I said that.

1514
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:05,020
But Barton, thank you very much for coming on.

1515
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:06,220
And a pleasure as always.

1516
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:07,980
I really appreciate the opportunity, Chris.

1517
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:10,500
Maybe one of these, maybe one of these short weeks here,

1518
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,580
I can get my hands on one of these

1519
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:12,860
and tell the folks what I think.

1520
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:15,220
But in the meantime, they can go read up about it.

1521
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:17,660
And I'll retweet new reviews for the developer edition

1522
01:02:17,660 --> 01:02:18,500
I see coming along too,

1523
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:19,940
so people can keep an eye out for that.

1524
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:20,780
All right, Barton.

1525
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:21,780
And then as we were talking about before,

1526
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,300
easiest way to get there is either,

1527
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:27,220
well, easiest to remember is dell.com slash developers

1528
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:29,460
or dell.com slash Sputnik.

1529
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,660
They'll take you to the same place

1530
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:31,860
and that's where it has the line

1531
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:35,760
and you can click through for the new one or the other ones.

1532
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,180
You know, I never even got to ask Barton about his dogs.

1533
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,260
I was going to ask him about his dogs

1534
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:41,180
because somehow I go down to Dell,

1535
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,620
I hang out with Barton for a week

1536
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,220
and I didn't even know he was a dog owner.

1537
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,860
And now these days, that's all I care about

1538
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:46,700
is a new dog owner.

1539
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,980
But I digress, let's move on.

1540
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:50,980
We still have some great emails to get to.

1541
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:54,220
I want to recap something that we've covered

1542
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,920
back in 2016 on this show and things have changed.

1543
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,060
I've been doing a head to head comparison recently.

1544
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,340
So I want to cover that.

1545
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:03,960
We've also got some quote unquote breaking news

1546
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:06,240
from the Ubuntu Mate project all to come.

1547
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,400
So let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy

1548
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,960
for sponsoring the unplugged program.

1549
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,020
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1550
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,220
Go there to sign up for a free seven day trial

1551
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,060
and support the show.

1552
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,620
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1553
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:18,700
What, what, what?

1554
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,300
You don't know what Linux Academy is?

1555
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,400
Friends, let me tell you this.

1556
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,060
Well, actually, how about a highly paid voice actor

1557
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,000
will tell you.

1558
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,820
Whether you're an experienced sys admin

1559
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:30,980
or new to the world of Linux, Azure and AWS,

1560
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:33,660
OpenStack and DevOps, a sharp skillset

1561
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,180
is an absolute necessity to succeed.

1562

01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:21,780
You should too.

1582
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:23,820
One thing the voiceover guy doesn't mention

1583
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:25,860
that's my favorite feature of Linux Academy

1584
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,100
is they have full-time human beings

1585
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,540
that are available to help you if you get stuck,

1586
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:31,940
like instructors that really know the content material.

1587
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,100
And they have a course scheduler system

1588
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,860
specifically for us busy folk.

1589
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,940
Just the more you know, guys, the more you know.

1590
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:41,780
So go check it out, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1591
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:43,500
Learn how to build a secure system

1592
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:46,100
so that way when the hackers are dropping malware

1593
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,740
on your system, you're on top of it.

1594
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:48,580
Why are you laughing?

1595
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:51,580
The hackers are dropping malware into your system.

1596
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:54,140
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1597
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,980
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

1598
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,460
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1599
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:01,820
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1600
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:04,660
So Wimpy, I heard a little birdie tell me

1601
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:06,480
that there could be something interesting

1602
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,460
over at the Monte Project this week.

1603
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,580
Ubuntu Mate, I should say, not the Mate Project,

1604
01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:12,220
but Ubuntu Mate.

1605
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:13,700
Actually, the opposite.

1606
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:14,540
Oh, really?

1607
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:15,620
Oh, I got it right the first time.

1608
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,460
Oh, good for me.

1609
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,280
Yeah, you did.

1610
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:18,120
Hey, look at that, accident.

1611
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,900
And then I messed it up by correcting myself.

1612
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,580
That's a life lesson.

1613
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,620
I can also throw some news in about Ubuntu Mate

1614
01:05:23,620 --> 01:05:24,460
if you like as well.

1615
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:25,940
Well, then that would be just right all along,

1616
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,140
so that would be great.

1617
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:28,260
So let's start.

1618
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:30,140
Let's start with Mate.

1619
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:35,140
Okay, so Mate 1.18 was released about one year ago,

1620
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:38,420
and that's been a long-lived version.

1621
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,740
We've been supporting that,

1622
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:41,740
and we've had three point releases,

1623
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:45,500
so it's very robust and stable now.

1624
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:49,940
But we have just closed the feature branches

1625
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,180
on the Mate desktop,

1626
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:56,180
and we'll be releasing Mate 1.20 in the next week or so,

1627
01:05:56,180 --> 01:05:59,740
so expect that to hit your distributions soon.

1628
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:01,220
That is really exciting.

1629
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:05,140
So, okay, so it's 1.20, right?

1630
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,780
1.20, yeah, I wanted this one to be a 2.0,

1631
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:10,260
but I've gone with consensus of the team.

1632
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,060
We're going with 1.20.

1633
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,500
I thought the next one would have been 1.19, though,

1634
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,140
so you did skip one rev.

1635
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,460
1.19 was the development snapshots.

1636
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:18,300
I see, okay.

1637
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,820
I see.

1638
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,660
Wow, so what's the headlining features?

1639
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,860
Are there headlining features?

1640
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:29,100
Well, there's some boring things that are important

1641
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,580
in that there's thousands of bug fixes,

1642
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:35,980
and a lot of those we've been cherry picking back

1643
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:39,380
into the 1.18 stuff for the important things,

1644
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:43,340
which is why people have seen that Ubuntu,

1645
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:46,340
Mate 17.10, and 18.04 daily

1646
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,060
are really very robust at the moment.

1647
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,500
But there's been a lot of work

1648
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,660
in the Window Manager, for example,

1649
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:55,820
so that's now got hardware acceleration.

1650
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,780
Oh, I love that.

1651
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:02,780
Yeah, and is, what's the word, screen tear-free,

1652
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:09,180
and now supports quadrant and upper and lower panel tiling

1653
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:12,660
within the standard Window Manager,

1654
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:14,860
and a whole heap of key bindings as well.

1655
01:07:14,860 --> 01:07:15,700
That sounds huge.

1656
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,020
That actually sounds pretty big.

1657
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:19,660
Yeah, that's quite a bit of work,

1658
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:23,060
and this really came about because we were looking

1659
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:25,340
at where we needed to go with things,

1660
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:29,380
as a team, we don't see that right now is the time

1661
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:33,820
for us to invest in any serious Wayland development,

1662
01:07:33,820 --> 01:07:35,460
and there were things that we could do

1663
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:38,900
to improve our desktop on top of X11,

1664
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:41,460
so we've taken steps to do that.

1665
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:44,260
And this is work that won't arrive in time,

1666
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:45,780
but we've also started the work

1667
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:49,380
to really finesse the high DPI support.

1668
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:53,340
So high DPI support is much improved,

1669
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:56,340
it's still got the experimental tag in that

1670
01:07:56,340 --> 01:08:01,060
it is not a seamless, it just automagically enables,

1671
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:04,340
but if you twiddle the right knobs,

1672
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,820
you actually get a fairly decent high DPI experience

1673
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:10,860
with Marte now, and a blog is forthcoming.

1674
01:08:10,860 --> 01:08:13,140
I've actually got it drafted, had it drafted for weeks,

1675
01:08:13,140 --> 01:08:16,860
I need to get on and post that, how to turn that stuff on.

1676
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:21,340
Oh boy, oh boy, I mean, just, that's a,

1677
01:08:21,340 --> 01:08:23,260
I could see why you wanted to do a 2.0,

1678
01:08:23,260 --> 01:08:24,260
especially with the Harburg seller.

1679
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,100
Is it Marco, is that the?

1680
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,300
Yeah, Marco is the window manager, yeah.

1681
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,740
All right, that's pretty great.

1682
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:31,980
Is there anything else in that arena,

1683
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:34,820
or do you wanna slip in a little secret about Ubuntu Marte?

1684
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:37,780
Well, in order, exploiting the features

1685
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,580
that we've used there, and some of the changes

1686
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:41,780
we've made in Marte itself,

1687
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,420
there's one sad thing about Marte 1.20.

1688
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:48,580
As a rule, we don't like to remove features,

1689
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:51,260
but we've actually had to remove some of the features

1690
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,140
we had to remove a feature.

1691
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,100
So if you've used the desktop,

1692
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:59,260
one of the panel applets is a stock ticker,

1693
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,980
and we've had to drop that,

1694
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:05,980
because Yahoo have ended their API

1695
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:08,820
that we were hooked up to in order to get that data.

1696
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:11,380
Like many other services around the internet,

1697
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:13,420
we're all using this Yahoo API.

1698
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,820
That's gone away, it's not coming back,

1699
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,060
and there is no drop-in replacement.

1700
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,980
So unfortunately, we've had to drop that applet,

1701
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:22,700
because it's defunct.

1702
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,540
I'm sure many-

1703
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:24,380
You should replace it

1704
01:09:24,380 --> 01:09:26,700
with a crypto coin monitor instead.

1705
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,620
Absolutely.

1706
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:28,820
But they already exist,

1707
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:31,100
we don't need to carry that in the core project.

1708
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:34,500
I'm sure many serious stock traders were using that.

1709
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,100
Yeah, yeah.

1710
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:39,900
So building on top of the features that exist in Marte,

1711
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:43,500
in fact, as we've been talking,

1712
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,900
I've been working on the global menu.

1713
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:50,180
So the global menu implementation in Ubuntu Marte 18.04

1714
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:53,820
will be such that that is permanently available,

1715
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:55,060
not necessarily enabled,

1716
01:09:55,060 --> 01:10:00,060
but permanently available in all of the various layouts.

1717
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:02,980
And what that means specifically

1718
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:06,100
is that the HUD will now work in any of the layouts

1719
01:10:06,100 --> 01:10:08,940
in Ubuntu Marte rather than just the few

1720
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:10,700
that had the global menu enabled.

1721
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,980
So that's an improvement I'm hopefully gonna land

1722
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:16,260
this evening after we've finished chatting.

1723
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,220
And then the other thing we're looking at doing

1724
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:23,860
in Ubuntu Marte is we're working on our next generation

1725
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:27,420
of the Ubuntu Marte welcome and the software boutique.

1726
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:33,740
And at the Debian conference last year,

1727
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:39,780
the Debian Marte team were asked to more closely align

1728
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:46,580
with Ubuntu Marte in terms of default settings and setup

1729
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:51,580
and things like welcome and the software boutique.

1730
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:55,500
So we're going to be delivering Ubuntu Marte welcome

1731
01:10:55,500 --> 01:10:58,660
and the software boutique as snaps

1732
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:02,380
so that Debian can take advantage of that.

1733
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:04,100
And a little bit longer term,

1734
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:07,820
we'll be adding some support so it can be white labeled.

1735
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:10,220
So when it's running on Debian,

1736
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:14,860
it can present a different look and feel and content.

1737
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:18,140
That is fantastic.

1738
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:22,420
And it's fascinating to me that snap applications

1739
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:25,260
can be contained in a snap,

1740
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:26,960
but still have the ability to manipulate

1741
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:29,020
the package management on the host system.

1742
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:29,860
So it's like-

1743
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:33,060
Well, these snaps would very specifically be classic.

1744
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:36,340
So these would be snaps that are effectively

1745
01:11:36,340 --> 01:11:38,740
like a deb installed on your host system

1746
01:11:38,740 --> 01:11:42,180
that effectively uncontained because they need to do

1747
01:11:42,180 --> 01:11:43,460
exactly as you've just described,

1748
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:45,740
they need to add and remove software

1749
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:48,140
and welcome does other things,

1750
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:50,580
to configure peripherals and what have you.

1751
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:54,140
So yeah, very much unconfined applications,

1752
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:57,140
but by delivering them as snaps.

1753
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,800
Welcome and boutique are our USP.

1754
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,760
It's what broadly defines Ubuntu Marte's identity.

1755
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,660
We haven't been moving very quickly recently,

1756
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:10,300
but that's the development's ramping up now.

1757
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,940
And what I want to be able to do

1758
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:15,180
is continually deliver improvements

1759
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:19,900
to the Ubuntu Marte users through welcome and the boutique

1760
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:23,780
without having to use PPAs that people don't know about

1761
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:27,140
and all sorts of other complicated systems,

1762
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:27,980
but having a snap,

1763
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,160
we can just keep delivering new

1764
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,980
and improved versions rapidly.

1765
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,040
That sounds great.

1766
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:34,220
That sounds really great.

1767
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:36,860
I am obviously a big fan of sort of eliminating

1768
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:39,260
some of those PPAs as much as possible

1769
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:42,580
and probably more and more as time goes on.

1770
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:44,460
When does, so I'm clear,

1771
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,020
when does that kind of,

1772
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:48,340
is that the 1804 release of Ubuntu Marte?

1773
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,380
That's where some of that will land?

1774
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:50,220
Yeah.

1775
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,380
Ah, okay.

1776
01:12:51,380 --> 01:12:52,300
Wow.

1777
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:56,020
How big of a risk is it to switch over to,

1778
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:57,940
that's a pretty big fundamental switch for the LTS.

1779
01:12:57,940 --> 01:13:01,500
I guess you have time to iterate on it if needed,

1780
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,300
but that seems like a pretty big switch for the LTS.

1781
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,580
Ubuntu Marte shipped a snap in 1710.

1782
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:08,420
Oh, that's right.

1783
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:12,340
We have some experience in what's involved in doing that.

1784
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:16,260
And our friends in the Ubuntu desktop team

1785
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,580
and the foundations team have been improving

1786
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:23,700
the hooks that exist in the build infrastructure

1787
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:28,700
so that it's easier to ship snaps on the image.

1788
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:33,820
So at the moment they are simply installed on the image

1789
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:36,900
and you only get them if you install an ISO

1790
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,020
that had that snap on it.

1791
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:41,300
Whereas the changes they're making are,

1792
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:45,580
if you installed say a beta and in the final release,

1793
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,380
an additional snap was added,

1794
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:49,020
it seeded like other packages.

1795
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,580
So you get that package added to your system

1796
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,660
as part of the upgrade.

1797
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:56,100
As I recall, it was a pulse audio mixer, right?

1798
01:13:56,100 --> 01:13:57,500
A command line pulse audio mixer?

1799
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:58,340
Yeah.

1800
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,860
Yeah, it's pulse mixer.

1801
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,380
Has that gotten much testing or,

1802
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,860
and I know one of the other things I was gonna be curious is,

1803
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:05,740
has it been updated?

1804
01:14:05,740 --> 01:14:07,580
It has been updated, yes.

1805
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:11,420
In fact, we did it a couple of few weeks ago, yeah.

1806
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:13,060
So yes, it's been tested by thousands

1807
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:14,420
and thousands of people.

1808
01:14:14,420 --> 01:14:15,500
Great.

1809
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:18,580
So that, and so, and now it's been tested

1810
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,860
to have a snap desktop application shipped on the distro

1811
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:24,420
that gets updated after the distros release

1812
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,020
with active users.

1813
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:26,860
Yeah.

1814
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,660
That's a pretty good milestone.

1815
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:33,220
Yeah, so JJ, you had a question about the beta, go ahead.

1816
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:35,900
Yeah, so is there any way for me

1817
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:38,340
to test out any of the new features

1818
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:41,860
of the new version of Mate possibly?

1819
01:14:41,860 --> 01:14:45,420
I'm sort of interested since I am a user of a bunch of Mate.

1820
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:48,460
So you can test any of the daily images

1821
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:50,140
for any of the flavors.

1822
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,580
The URL is cdimage.abuntu.com

1823
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:56,420
and in there you'll find directories

1824
01:14:56,420 --> 01:14:58,100
for each of the flavors.

1825
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:01,940
And inside there, you'll find the release name.

1826
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:04,940
So it's bionic at the moment.

1827
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:07,260
And in there you'll find a directory daily live

1828
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:09,660
and whatever architectures the flavors support

1829
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:12,140
you'll find ISO images for in there.

1830
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:14,900
And you can download those and install them

1831
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:19,100
on spare laptops or VMs or what have you to test them.

1832
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:24,100
And then there are also scheduled alpha and beta releases.

1833
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:25,500
So when those come around,

1834
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:30,140
there's a more organized test schedule for a week

1835
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:32,580
around those where each of the flavor teams

1836
01:15:32,580 --> 01:15:35,820
are looking for feedback and looking for the bugs

1837
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:39,820
that get reported in order to fix and improve.

1838
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,300
So it's like all or nothing.

1839
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:43,900
What do you mean?

1840
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:44,740
Sorry?

1841
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:46,020
So it's like all or nothing, the image,

1842
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,460
like you can't really upgrade

1843
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:52,020
the actual individual Mate environment possibly or?

1844
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:53,620
Oh, you're asking like a current install

1845
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,980
and go to a new version of Mate?

1846
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:56,820
Yes, you can.

1847
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:59,820
You could run through the same process

1848
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:02,060
to do a distribution upgrade.

1849
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:05,620
And you could upgrade from 1710 to 1804.

1850
01:16:06,460 --> 01:16:07,660
To be honest with you,

1851
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:11,380
none of the flavors did an alpha one

1852
01:16:11,380 --> 01:16:13,580
that was scheduled to happen January the 4th

1853
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:16,340
for obvious reasons that didn't happen.

1854
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,260
The next alpha will be alpha two,

1855
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:20,940
which will be the beginning of February.

1856
01:16:20,940 --> 01:16:22,820
I think you'd be best to wait

1857
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,180
until the alphas are out of the way

1858
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:26,980
cause there's a lot of things moving at the moment.

1859
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:30,180
If you need your machine to be reliable,

1860
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:32,780
just avoid 1804 for the moment.

1861
01:16:32,780 --> 01:16:34,140
Now you're telling me I started the upgrade

1862
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:35,260
before we started.

1863
01:16:35,260 --> 01:16:36,620
Oh, yeah.

1864
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:37,460
You're fine.

1865
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,380
You've got.

1866
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,460
I've got a hotline to you.

1867
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:40,540
Yeah, exactly.

1868
01:16:42,020 --> 01:16:43,300
Understood.

1869
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:45,980
Yeah, that's a lot of great stuff Wimpy.

1870
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:46,940
Thank you for the update.

1871
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,580
That's pretty, can I want to pick your brain actually?

1872
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:53,180
I've got an email come into the show from Robert

1873
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:55,780
and he says, in regards to our Linspire discussion

1874
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:59,540
last week, he says he loaded up Linspire

1875
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:02,820
and then loaded up Zubuntu

1876
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:06,100
and looked at gnome software in both of the latest Zubuntu

1877
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:09,020
and he saw a different highlighted selection

1878
01:17:09,020 --> 01:17:11,180
of applications in Linspire than he did

1879
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:14,100
in the machine he was looking at the same time in Zubuntu.

1880
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:18,300
And so he wondered, does that mean is Linspire injecting

1881
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,420
like their own suggestions into that list

1882
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:23,700
or is it more of like a random rotation

1883
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,220
with the way gnome software displays

1884
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:28,460
like those featured ones that you guys are curating?

1885
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:32,100
Yeah, there's a list of say 16

1886
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:35,820
and like six are picked from that to be displayed.

1887
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:38,900
Ah, so does gnome software just do like a random selection?

1888
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:42,460
Yeah, and it rotates I think every 24 hours

1889
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:44,420
so it's not particularly rapid

1890
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:46,300
in the way that it represents them.

1891
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,260
Ah, it's confusing.

1892
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:51,540
That is actually, I kind of, yeah, okay.

1893
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:55,540
And so any Ubuntu flavor or derivative

1894
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:56,940
that is shipping gnome software

1895
01:17:56,940 --> 01:18:00,260
is likely just using that same list

1896
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:02,500
because it's coming from the upstream

1897
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,300
to gnome software that they're repackaging.

1898
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,900
So which Linspire would be doing.

1899
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:08,180
And so if they were injecting their own list,

1900
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,980
would they have to be modifying gnome software?

1901
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:13,940
Would it be a fork or is there just some sources file

1902
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,340
that they could go?

1903
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:17,160
If they were modifying that,

1904
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,500
they would have to have forked it

1905
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,340
and made their own version.

1906
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:22,300
So that's hard coded in, interesting.

1907
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:27,300
Well, the source of the data is in one of the plugins, yeah.

1908
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,820
Interesting.

1909
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:29,660
Learning.

1910
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:32,660
They could certainly choose to ship their own plugin

1911
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:34,820
which points to their own data sources

1912
01:18:34,820 --> 01:18:37,100
and they could promote their own applications

1913
01:18:37,100 --> 01:18:40,340
that they prefer for their target users, that's for sure.

1914
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:43,060
Or remove the plugins they ship by default on Ubuntu,

1915
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:44,260
that's another option.

1916
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:48,380
So they can certainly affect the list, that's for sure.

1917
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:51,500
But it's not likely because it takes then a list

1918
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,340
you have to maintain, right?

1919
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:54,780
And is that an XML file up somewhere or RSS feed?

1920
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:55,860
What is that?

1921
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:57,180
It's a REST API.

1922
01:18:57,180 --> 01:18:58,020
Aha.

1923
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:00,100
I'm learning over the last week that gnome software

1924
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:02,340
is deceptively complicated.

1925
01:19:02,340 --> 01:19:03,980
It looks very simple on the front end

1926
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,220
but some of this stuff is more complicated

1927
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:07,940
than I thought it was.

1928
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:10,420
I envision this stuff as sources lists

1929
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:12,780
and a simple text file that somebody could just

1930
01:19:12,780 --> 01:19:14,060
throw an RSS feed in.

1931
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,300
I mean, no, no, of course not.

1932
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:17,940
Of course, in this day and age,

1933
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:19,500
you gotta support flat packs and snaps

1934
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,100
and firmware updates and all kinds of things

1935
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:23,860
and software channels and plugins.

1936
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:26,700
It's all above my pay grade apparently.

1937
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,300
I'm just glad it works when it does.

1938
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:30,220
So I wanted to take a moment on the show

1939
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:32,780
and talk about Ambient Plex again.

1940
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,620
Oh God, I know, I've talked about it too much.

1941
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:37,980
But I gotta be honest, we actually haven't covered it

1942
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:40,460
since 2016 on the show and things have really changed.

1943
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:42,620
In fact, not always for the better either,

1944
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:43,460
I'll get to that.

1945
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:45,540
Maybe I should start with that

1946
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:47,100
so I'm not ending on a super pissed off note.

1947
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:50,900
But Chris is a little upset about something.

1948
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:52,060
So let's see, when was the last time

1949
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:53,540
we covered this here topic here?

1950
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,500
Yeah, let's see, it was Linux Unplugged,

1951
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:57,860
I think it was like 156.

1952
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:01,300
So if you dig around in that range,

1953
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:03,380
you will get a more comprehensive coverage

1954
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:04,340
of what we're about to talk about,

1955
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:07,340
including things like Tiny Media Manager

1956
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:11,440
and integrating more with Kodi and whatnot.

1957
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,980
But just really briefly off the top,

1958
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:16,220
I've been head to head comparing MB and Plex,

1959
01:20:16,220 --> 01:20:18,940
which are two different streaming options

1960
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:22,940
that allow you to collect a massive media

1961
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:24,660
on a file server or on a desktop.

1962
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:27,180
I actually have been running these for testing,

1963
01:20:27,180 --> 01:20:29,840
one just on a workstation and one on a server,

1964
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,100
a couple different servers actually.

1965
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,780
Anyways, it is a server side software

1966
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:34,740
that has a client side piece

1967
01:20:34,740 --> 01:20:36,420
and the client side can run on a Roku,

1968
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:39,940
an Android TV, an Apple TV, a web browser, a mobile device,

1969
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:43,140
and it allows you to throw a bunch of media up on a server,

1970
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:45,460
it scans all of it, figures out the metadata,

1971
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:47,220
downloads the information from the internet

1972
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:49,420
and artwork and descriptions

1973
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:50,840
and organizes all the seasons

1974
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:52,700
for your TV shows and your movies.

1975
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:53,900
It's quite handy and it makes you feel

1976
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:55,880
like you're living in the future, it's great.

1977
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:59,380
And there's two main competitors in this field these days,

1978
01:20:59,380 --> 01:21:00,860
there's MB and Plex.

1979
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,340
And Kodi does fit in here, like I said,

1980
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:04,580
check our past episode for more.

1981
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:07,780
But just really briefly, if you're running Kodi today

1982
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,460
and you're wondering why the hell would you want MB or Plex,

1983
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:14,000
just a quick versus like Kodi,

1984
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,700
Plex and MB are not nearly as fast as Kodi.

1985
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,940
If you're pointing Kodi at some local files on a disk,

1986
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:21,820
Kodi is going to whoop its butt in load times

1987
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,800
and fast forward every single time.

1988
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:28,280
And these both require fairly reliable networking,

1989
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:30,180
a reliable LAN or Wi-Fi

1990
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:32,140
and a pretty solid internet connection

1991
01:21:32,140 --> 01:21:32,980
if you're doing streaming.

1992
01:21:32,980 --> 01:21:35,120
So those are their main detractions from Kodi.

1993
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,920
But they're also better than Kodi at certain things,

1994
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:41,820
like on my testing, they are better at media detection,

1995
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:43,620
getting the right metadata information

1996
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:46,700
about esoteric shows that are named something kind of off,

1997
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,980
identifying a series that maybe isn't quite right,

1998
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:50,380
it's much better at that.

1999
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:52,660
And obviously, as I started with,

2000
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:55,100
it's very easy to use for streaming

2001
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,740
for your friends and family.

2002
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:59,820
In fact, Plex has a feature called Plex sharing,

2003
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:02,740
which allows you to share with friends and family,

2004
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,120
you just add them as a buddy.

2005
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,300
And so let's take my buddy Chase from Unfilter,

2006
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,820
he and I are friends on Plex

2007
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:10,900
and we share each other's libraries.

2008
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:13,580
He happens to have episodes of Voyager that I don't have.

2009
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:16,220
So if I'm in a mood to go watch Catherine Janeway

2010
01:22:16,220 --> 01:22:18,980
make out with some Irish guy in Fairhaven on the holodeck,

2011
01:22:18,980 --> 01:22:20,860
I will just switch over to his Plex server

2012
01:22:20,860 --> 01:22:24,060
and I will stream Voyager from his server for a bit.

2013
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,380
And MB has something similar to this.

2014
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:29,540
And so what I wanted to know for purposes of this show,

2015
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:32,300
which one might be better for the audience

2016
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:34,980
and which one's more open source,

2017
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:37,320
as if this is some sort of measuring stick,

2018
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,060
but which one's more open source.

2019
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,500
And so I looked at both the Plex project

2020
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:43,620
and I looked at the MB project.

2021
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:45,440
And this full credit goes to a discussion

2022
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,540
that really got kicked off in our Telegram group

2023
01:22:47,540 --> 01:22:49,760
where people were asking questions about this

2024
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,220
and getting clarifications,

2025
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:53,300
trying to figure out what parts of Plex are open source,

2026
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:54,940
which parts are closed source.

2027
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:58,900
I'll say this, for Plex, I was pretty surprised.

2028
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:00,540
I was pretty surprised.

2029
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:01,460
It's amazing actually.

2030
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,700
They have a whole page that goes over all their licensing,

2031
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:07,060
but they have everything

2032
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:10,300
except for the backend server part up on their GitHub page.

2033
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,940
And it's all kinds of crazy.

2034
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:14,020
You realize what a project this must be

2035
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:16,460
when you just go through their GitHub page

2036
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:18,620
and look at all of the fricking projects

2037
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:21,620
that they're contributing to or have forked for Plex.

2038
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:22,780
And one of the ones that's on here

2039
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:23,740
that I was really happy to see,

2040
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:25,660
and I didn't know this before I really did the digging,

2041
01:23:25,660 --> 01:23:26,940
even though I use this,

2042
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:28,740
guess I'm not that observant.

2043
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:33,740
The Plex for Kodi add-on is developed by the Plex project.

2044
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:36,460
Plex folks are actually creating that add-on for Kodi.

2045
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:38,540
So if you prefer to use Kodi for playback,

2046
01:23:38,540 --> 01:23:41,380
but want it to connect to your Plex database,

2047
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:42,820
Kodi's actually writing that plugin,

2048
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:44,740
or I mean the Plex people are actually writing that plugin.

2049
01:23:44,740 --> 01:23:47,340
So it's about as official as it gets.

2050
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:48,820
But how did it compare to MB?

2051
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:52,220
Which essentially has a similar feature set to Plex.

2052
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:54,700
Couple of differences in how they're implemented for sure.

2053
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:57,940
Plex is simpler, maybe slightly more user-friendly,

2054
01:23:57,940 --> 01:23:59,380
but MB is more flexible.

2055
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:01,280
It's completely open source.

2056
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:06,460
And it feels more like a self-contained application.

2057
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,020
That's not often the weeds connected

2058
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:09,820
to like online news streaming.

2059
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:12,940
And it just feels like something that just is simple.

2060
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:15,220
I actually prefer it for my LAN streaming.

2061
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,740
And I use Plex for my internet streaming.

2062
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:22,380
Everything, everything regarding MB is open source.

2063
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:24,740
The front end, the back end.

2064
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:29,740
I believe, I believe perhaps the Android apps might not be,

2065
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:32,620
but the server, the web client,

2066
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:35,380
some of the secret sauce it uses to stream all of that

2067
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:37,500
is open source.

2068
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:40,860
And both of these projects have a revenue model.

2069
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:45,240
Plex sells the Plex Pass and MB sells MB Premium.

2070
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,100
In MB's case, it's a little more of a,

2071
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,460
hey, thanks for being awesome.

2072
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,540
Here's five bucks.

2073
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:53,600
You get a couple other things,

2074
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,420
like some nice file syncing features with MB

2075
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:58,540
if you become a premium member.

2076
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:01,380
Plex Pass, Plex Pass has been getting more

2077
01:25:01,380 --> 01:25:02,620
and more appealing.

2078
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:06,100
You can buy a monthly or a one-time.

2079
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:07,940
And you get nicer features.

2080
01:25:07,940 --> 01:25:10,620
You can be in the beta channel.

2081
01:25:10,620 --> 01:25:12,900
You can use their Plex Cloud streaming service.

2082
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:15,060
It's nice, it's kind of worth it.

2083
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:18,700
I bought a, they had a sale two years ago or something,

2084
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,600
and I bought a lifetime subscription, just done, done.

2085
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,540
And these are obviously vital avenues

2086
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:26,180
for these two different projects,

2087
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:29,560
whichever one you might like or not like to stay afloat.

2088
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:32,420
But one of them is being attacked

2089
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:35,220
by the very open source community it serves.

2090
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,980
MB is being eaten from within

2091
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:40,180
its own open source community.

2092
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:43,040
And I feel like this is a warning sign

2093
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:45,560
that is going to stop other projects

2094
01:25:45,560 --> 01:25:48,660
from ever doing a fully open source project.

2095
01:25:48,660 --> 01:25:51,580
It's gonna lock in this model, potentially,

2096
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:55,100
of a closed source proprietary server component

2097
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:58,000
and only open sourcing bits and pieces here.

2098
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,560
And if nothing else, least of which,

2099
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,180
the least of which is gonna happen,

2100
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:06,180
is the Plex group will be able to look at this incident

2101
01:26:06,180 --> 01:26:07,880
and point at this incident and say,

2102
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,860
this is why we will never 100% open source everything.

2103
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:12,180
We will never do it.

2104
01:26:12,180 --> 01:26:13,500
We never have to.

2105
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:14,320
This is why.

2106
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,820
This is now the ultimate justification.

2107
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:20,940
You gotta look at this and you gotta wonder

2108
01:26:20,940 --> 01:26:22,860
if maybe this isn't a fundamental flaw of open source.

2109
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:27,380
So one user of MB got really pissed off,

2110
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:28,740
kind of for legitimate reasons,

2111
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:30,340
but where he goes with it,

2112
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:33,300
fundamentally is going to undermine MB's revenue source.

2113
01:26:33,300 --> 01:26:35,980
And I don't recommend anybody install this

2114
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:37,620
because these projects need to be funded

2115
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:38,620
or else they're gonna go away.

2116
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:42,220
And somebody created an MB unlocked project,

2117
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:45,560
which just gives you all of the premium features for free.

2118
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:47,780
Because why not?

2119
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:49,120
It's just open source, right?

2120
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:52,980
So at some point, the MB developers added a nag screen

2121
01:26:52,980 --> 01:26:54,460
before playback that reminded you

2122
01:26:54,460 --> 01:26:57,820
that you could get MB premium.

2123
01:26:57,820 --> 01:26:59,540
I've never seen that because pretty quickly,

2124
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:02,220
like my first couple of days into MB testing

2125
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:04,460
a long time ago, I bought MB premium

2126
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,060
because I thought this is a good project.

2127
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:07,820
It offers good competition to Plex.

2128
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:08,780
I like seeing that.

2129
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:09,660
I wanna keep them going.

2130
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,500
So I paid for it.

2131
01:27:10,500 --> 01:27:11,500
I've never seen this nag screen.

2132
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:14,740
And I admit if I saw a nag screen, I wouldn't like that.

2133
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:16,580
And the community did ask them to stop

2134
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:18,580
and they basically said no.

2135
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:20,840
And this guy, this is a quote, says this is bullshit.

2136
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:23,660
For the GPL2, it's a GPL2 licensed product.

2137
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,340
This is bullshit that they're doing this.

2138
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:29,000
And his justification is because it's a GPL2 project,

2139
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,540
how dare they?

2140
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:34,900
And so I decided that I would just go remove the nag screen.

2141
01:27:34,900 --> 01:27:37,060
But in the process of removing the nag screen,

2142
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:40,220
I discovered that unlocking all of the premium features

2143
01:27:40,220 --> 01:27:42,420
was just the simplest way.

2144
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:43,680
So here you go.

2145
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,060
And there's a AUR.

2146
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:46,900
Of course, you can just get a Docker image

2147
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,940
of an entire MB server that's been pre-activated

2148
01:27:49,940 --> 01:27:53,020
for premium, ready to go, just a Docker install away,

2149
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:55,220
which is actually a pretty common way

2150
01:27:55,220 --> 01:27:56,540
for people to try out these projects.

2151
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:57,780
So that actually really sucks

2152
01:27:57,780 --> 01:27:59,180
because that gets same billing

2153
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,580
as the actual MB project in Docker Hub.

2154
01:28:02,780 --> 01:28:04,220
And if more people start downloading this,

2155
01:28:04,220 --> 01:28:06,380
it'll actually show up higher in the ranks.

2156
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:08,820
And what would prevent any other,

2157
01:28:08,820 --> 01:28:11,100
what prevents anybody doing this to any other project

2158
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:12,180
that's completely open source

2159
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:14,300
that has some sort of revenue system

2160
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:16,340
where you can unlock additional features?

2161
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:20,620
It feels like this fundamentally validates the fear

2162
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:22,660
of a lot of developers who've been looking at coming over

2163
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:24,540
to Linux and can't quite figure out

2164
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,100
how they get the licensing right.

2165
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,340
Well, we just validated their fears with this.

2166
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:31,380
I don't know, maybe I'm, just to me,

2167
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,880
this is just so, so upsetting to see this

2168
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,420
because if we make it impossible for people

2169
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:38,520
to make money at open source,

2170
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,520
all we're gonna have left is commercial stuff

2171
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:44,100
and Electron apps and proprietary backends,

2172
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,500
and this problem is never gonna get any better.

2173
01:28:49,140 --> 01:28:50,860
It's pretty disappointing.

2174
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:54,820
So don't install it, don't use it.

2175
01:28:54,820 --> 01:28:57,460
Or if you do, you know, also send them a few bucks.

2176
01:28:57,460 --> 01:29:00,100
I mean, I just, I really, it's one patch.

2177
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,900
You know, this guy just applies one patch

2178
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:03,620
and it unlocks all of the features.

2179
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:06,860
And maybe the MB project could like obfuscate their code.

2180
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:08,100
I don't know.

2181
01:29:08,100 --> 01:29:09,500
Mumble, remove, what do you think?

2182
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:14,500
Is this something that is addressable?

2183
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,100
This is not the first time this has happened.

2184
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:19,540
Other projects have suffered with this in the past.

2185
01:29:19,540 --> 01:29:23,300
I mean, I remember this happening in the subsonic community

2186
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:26,100
for much the same reasons.

2187
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:29,860
And there was another one as well recently.

2188
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:31,020
It may have been MB.

2189
01:29:31,020 --> 01:29:34,060
I think Mark talked about this on the Ubuntu podcast,

2190
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:35,700
the whole nag screen thing.

2191
01:29:37,220 --> 01:29:39,220
Yeah, your subsonic's a great example of that.

2192
01:29:39,220 --> 01:29:40,940
That's a great example.

2193
01:29:40,940 --> 01:29:44,820
Yeah, it feels bad.

2194
01:29:44,820 --> 01:29:45,700
It feels really bad.

2195
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:49,540
It feels like it just takes one pissed off open source user

2196
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:50,860
that knows how to fix this thing

2197
01:29:50,860 --> 01:29:53,120
and then you've just undermined an entire business

2198
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:54,860
that has multiple employees.

2199
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:56,180
Many employees.

2200
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:57,020
Go ahead, sorry.

2201
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:01,780
Yeah, so it sort of reminds me a little bit

2202
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:03,620
about the email clients as well

2203
01:30:03,620 --> 01:30:08,620
having this sort of similar sort of conflict, I guess,

2204
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:13,420
with regards to supporting certain email protocols

2205
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:15,340
such as Exchange and all that.

2206
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:16,780
That makes any sense?

2207
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:18,660
Yeah, I do follow what you mean there,

2208
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,980
where the sort of like premium features and whatnot

2209
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:22,640
and additional add-ons that they sometimes

2210
01:30:22,640 --> 01:30:25,220
have to pay licenses for and whatnot.

2211
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:27,980
You know, just to wrap up, so head to head here,

2212
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:31,860
my takeaway is if streaming to smart devices

2213
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:33,660
and streaming between friends

2214
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:34,980
or streaming to family members

2215
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:37,540
that maybe kind of just have like a typical network setup,

2216
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:40,060
they're not really doing port forwarding,

2217
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:42,620
Plex is the way, if you need those things,

2218
01:30:42,620 --> 01:30:43,440
Plex is the way to go.

2219
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:44,900
If you don't need those things,

2220
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:47,780
I would really give a hearty endorsement these days for MB.

2221
01:30:47,780 --> 01:30:50,080
It's got a couple of things I'm not a huge fan of

2222
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,860
over remote connections.

2223
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:53,580
I've even had problems where I've punched a hole

2224
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,100
through my firewall, we got port forwarding

2225
01:30:55,100 --> 01:30:57,740
going to the right box, and yet for some reason

2226
01:30:57,740 --> 01:30:59,540
my remote MB system still can't connect.

2227
01:30:59,540 --> 01:31:01,840
Whereas with Plex, it'll do a relay if it has to

2228
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:02,920
to make that work.

2229
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:06,020
But if I'm using the two different products on my LAN,

2230
01:31:06,020 --> 01:31:09,020
I find MB to be faster on the same exact hardware

2231
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:11,220
doing head to head, same hardware, same server,

2232
01:31:11,220 --> 01:31:13,020
I find MB to be faster.

2233
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:16,140
I prefer the way it displays some information.

2234
01:31:16,140 --> 01:31:19,340
Plex has been abstracting away your individual episodes

2235
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,340
more and more and trying to boost things

2236
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:23,660
into new arrivals and trending

2237
01:31:23,660 --> 01:31:25,140
and all these different things that make it feel

2238
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:26,660
like YouTube that I just hate.

2239
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:30,180
Whereas MB feels more like here's your stuff,

2240
01:31:30,180 --> 01:31:32,220
here's your season, just go.

2241
01:31:32,220 --> 01:31:35,420
And then the creme de la creme mode for me,

2242
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:37,860
the perfect setup here has been now,

2243
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:41,060
and this is since 2016, so it's really kind of bared out,

2244
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:44,960
is if I can, Android TV running Kodi

2245
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:46,580
with the MB or Plex plugin,

2246
01:31:46,580 --> 01:31:49,500
depending on which particular media pool I'm pulling from,

2247
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:52,640
connected to wired storage.

2248
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:55,160
So in my case, it's a QNAP

2249
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:57,320
that has hardware accelerated decoding.

2250
01:31:57,320 --> 01:31:59,160
I've reviewed the QNAP in the past.

2251
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:01,240
You can install codecs from its app store,

2252
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:03,000
you get hardware accelerated decoding.

2253
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,320
I can be streaming to multiple boxes, no problem,

2254
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,280
my NAS is still fully responsive.

2255
01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:10,980
There's no big, huge, loud server anywhere.

2256
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:15,240
It's an Android TV and a QNAP and it's glorious.

2257
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:18,240
And both MB and Plex can run on it just fine.

2258
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,960
And so it's really great to do head-to-head comparison on.

2259
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:23,680
And what I walk away with, at the end of the day,

2260
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,480
I'm gonna go with the GPL2 product,

2261
01:32:25,480 --> 01:32:28,120
if everything else is coming up equal

2262
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:31,480
and I'm watching on the LAN, I'm going with MB.

2263
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,480
And so I have this setup now

2264
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:36,800
where when I'm just watching something off my hard drive,

2265
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,160
I'm watching something here at the studio,

2266
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:39,900
we do the same thing here at the studio LAN,

2267
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,040
it's watched over MB.

2268
01:32:41,040 --> 01:32:43,020
And then when we watch something remotely,

2269
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:44,880
we watch over Plex, and I know that sounds crazy,

2270
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,160
but they just point at the same files anyways.

2271
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,920
It's not like I have two sets of all my movies or TV shows.

2272
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,560
So it works out pretty well.

2273
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:56,120
I really have, I've come to love this setup in a way

2274
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:57,720
that I've never quite achieved

2275
01:32:57,720 --> 01:32:58,960
with my media setups in the past.

2276
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:00,600
And I spent money on all kinds of things.

2277
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:03,520
I even took a weird dark turn

2278
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:05,320
down the Windows Media Center lane

2279
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:07,560
where they had these Media Center front end boxes

2280
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:09,280
from like Linksys and whatnot

2281
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,200
that were trying to get to that hardware appliance style

2282
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:14,300
and it wasn't there, just wasn't there.

2283
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:16,800
It was horrible and also Windows.

2284
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,840
And this, this has finally been it.

2285
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:22,680
Anyways, I have links to all of the MB stuff,

2286
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:24,160
including the open source projects,

2287
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:27,060
the Kodi plugins, and that goodness in the show notes.

2288
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:30,760
Before we get off the topic of MB or Plex,

2289
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:32,240
Pierre, are you setting up a new Plex server?

2290
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:33,100
What's your plans there?

2291
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:33,940
What are you doing?

2292
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:35,160
Because-

2293
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:36,440
I need hardware first.

2294
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,200
Why not just run it on, see, that's the thing is,

2295
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:39,680
why not just run it on your workstation

2296
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:40,640
if you have it on all the time?

2297
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:43,280
It's not like you're watching TV while you're gaming.

2298
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,960
First of all, I don't have a TV.

2299
01:33:45,960 --> 01:33:46,960
Well, okay, but you know what I mean.

2300
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,160
It's not like your machine's gonna be decoding video files

2301
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:51,480
while you're playing a video game and streaming

2302
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:53,080
because you're gonna be playing video games and streaming.

2303
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:56,000
So I just, I recently tried it out on workstation

2304
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,400
for different testing of versions

2305
01:33:57,400 --> 01:33:59,360
and I realized it's great having it right there

2306
01:33:59,360 --> 01:34:02,240
on my desktop is great because I can hook up a USB disk

2307
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:04,880
and I can add that and I can download something immediately

2308
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,380
and have it scan my downloads folder.

2309
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:08,400
So for like a full week, I'm like,

2310
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:10,280
I'm just running it off my workstation.

2311
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:13,760
Well, you say that, but while I'm streaming,

2312
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,760
the girlfriend could be watching videos.

2313
01:34:15,760 --> 01:34:17,560
All right, Popey, Popey says he's caught me

2314
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,680
in a hypocrisy loop.

2315
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:21,040
What have I done wrong, Popey?

2316
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:22,080
Set me straight here.

2317
01:34:23,440 --> 01:34:27,760
So the argument is we should not patch out

2318
01:34:29,200 --> 01:34:32,320
and make it easy for people to use content

2319
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:35,160
as in MB or whatever piece of software

2320
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,400
that somebody else has developed

2321
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:39,080
and is trying to make some money out of.

2322
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:41,640
And that's a bad thing,

2323
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:45,320
but the chances are what people are using MB for

2324
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:48,080
is downloaded TV programs

2325
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:51,980
that they probably didn't have the rights to watch.

2326
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:57,160
So how is that rationalized in your mind?

2327
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,960
Well, in my view, because the product itself,

2328
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,560
MB was still fully functional, right?

2329
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,960
It was just that NAG screen,

2330
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:06,720
which does sound super annoying,

2331
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:09,920
but it wasn't as if it couldn't say like playback MKVs

2332
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,840
without the premiere feature.

2333
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:13,480
It just would say, hey, did you know we have

2334
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,000
a premiere feature and then you click play.

2335
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,120
It's so it, when it's-

2336
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,640
No, it wasn't that part.

2337
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:21,480
It was more the part that, hey, you guys out there,

2338
01:35:21,480 --> 01:35:23,480
you should pay for this thing

2339
01:35:23,480 --> 01:35:25,560
that someone has worked hard for

2340
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:30,040
in order to watch this thing that you've stolen

2341
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:33,640
in inverted commas that somebody else has worked hard for,

2342
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:35,280
TV programs and films, right?

2343
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,720
Yeah, no, I follow what your question was.

2344
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:39,760
I just, I was just trying to say like,

2345
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,840
if MB had disabled the product and made it like,

2346
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:47,000
so in my case, take Star Trek Discovery.

2347
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,680
I download Star Trek Discovery every single Sunday

2348
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:51,320
as fast as I possibly can.

2349
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:55,280
And I watch it via MB or Plex, depending on the setup.

2350
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:59,120
But I also am a CBS All Access subscriber.

2351
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,320
Same with the House of Cards.

2352
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:02,360
I'm a Netflix subscriber.

2353
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:05,080
I don't ever watch it on Netflix because it's ass.

2354
01:36:05,080 --> 01:36:07,440
I just prefer to watch it on my TV.

2355
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,600
And I have a MiFi.

2356
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:11,320
So you're right, it is up to the individual

2357
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,640
what the morality is.

2358
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:14,720
And it's, you're right, it's also not surprising

2359
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,040
that people that are comfortable stealing a lot of content

2360
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,600
would be comfortable stealing the product

2361
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:19,880
to watch the content.

2362
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:21,720
That does make sense.

2363
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:25,880
I feel like the, it's self-harm though.

2364
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:29,940
When you, if you download Game of Thrones,

2365
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,840
you're not putting Game of Thrones out of business.

2366
01:36:31,840 --> 01:36:35,080
But if you fundamentally undermine the way for MB

2367
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:38,440
to monetize MB, they will go out of business.

2368
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,160
And they will, they'll be gone.

2369
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:43,000
And then you'll have no way to watch your stolen TV shows.

2370
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,560
So it's sort of like pissing in your own well.

2371
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,400
Right.

2372
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,880
But yeah, you do bring up a good point.

2373
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,440
And I wonder what the audience would say about that too.

2374
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:52,280
Let us know.

2375
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:54,940
Tweet me at chrisles or leave a comment on the YouTubes

2376
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:58,160
so we can all read it or linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

2377
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:02,000
Now we gotta go because the Ask Noah program

2378
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:03,240
is just around the corner.

2379
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:06,840
Mr. Noah, what's coming up on the Ask Noah over there?

2380
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:08,200
Dude, we got so many cool things

2381
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:09,040
we're gonna be talking about.

2382
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:11,560
We're talking about high resolution audio.

2383
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:12,400
Ooh.

2384
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,240
There's somebody out there

2385
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:14,280
and they're gonna be like, that's snake oil.

2386
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:15,680
And then there's the other half of your audience

2387
01:37:15,680 --> 01:37:17,960
that's like, no, no, no, that he finally caught on.

2388
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,880
And so you're gonna find out which one it is.

2389
01:37:19,880 --> 01:37:22,040
High resolution audio under Linux.

2390
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:23,940
Is it possible or is it snake oil?

2391
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:25,960
Hmm, interesting.

2392
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:28,760
Now rumor has it that there may be a topic expert

2393
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:31,080
coming on the show to discuss it with you as well.

2394
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:33,920
There is, anytime we dive into the topic,

2395
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:35,480
we go find the person in the industry

2396
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:36,960
that knows more than anyone else.

2397
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,960
And in that case, when it comes to hi-fi audio,

2398
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:40,200
I was telling you last night,

2399
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:42,400
there is nobody else other than Bob Carver.

2400
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,600
I mean, he's just the guy when it comes to hi-fi audio.

2401
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:47,000
That's sort of a pretty good get.

2402
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:49,680
Nobody networks like Noah.

2403
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:50,960
Nobody does.

2404
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:51,800
I gotta say it.

2405
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,840
It really comes to your advantage sometimes.

2406
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:55,520
Well done, sir.

2407
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:57,400
I have friends in high places.

2408
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,240
Yeah, I'm looking forward to that.

2409
01:37:58,240 --> 01:38:00,500
And so now we're doing the Ask Noah program

2410
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:01,920
and the Unplugged program back to back.

2411
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:04,200
So you come over to jblab.tv on a Tuesday.

2412
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:05,600
You can hang out with our virtual hug

2413
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,720
and all these wonderful gentlemen.

2414
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,720
And we'd love to have some wonderful ladies in there.

2415
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:10,440
Then you stick around and watch some content

2416
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:11,520
and hear the extra live stuff

2417
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,120
that doesn't make it in the published version.

2418
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,760
And then you keep watching and get Ask Noah.

2419
01:38:14,760 --> 01:38:16,160
It's like a whole week,

2420
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:18,160
or I mean like a whole afternoon, evening,

2421
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:19,940
depending on morning in your time zone,

2422
01:38:19,940 --> 01:38:22,560
block of Linux live with your participation.

2423
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,880
Cause we've got the Mumble Room on the Unplugged program.

2424
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:27,280
And then we've got your live calls on Ask Noah.

2425
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:28,840
And from time to time rumor has it,

2426
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:31,520
there'll even be some Mumble participation in Ask Noah,

2427
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,080
which is probably difficult every time you have a guest.

2428
01:38:33,080 --> 01:38:35,080
So every time I say that you got a guest, but.

2429
01:38:35,080 --> 01:38:36,920
Yeah, well actually, so Bob doesn't,

2430
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:39,040
Bob is not a computer technically savvy.

2431
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,340
So he'll be joining us over phone.

2432
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:42,160
So we can have Mumble today, yeah.

2433
01:38:42,160 --> 01:38:44,520
But yeah, we call it the Linux sandwich.

2434
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,280
Is that what we call it?

2435
01:38:46,280 --> 01:38:47,680
Oh, good to know.

2436
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,040
Good, good.

2437
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,200
Go get yourself a Patreon account

2438
01:38:51,200 --> 01:38:55,200
and go over to a patreon.com slash Ubuntu underscore mate

2439
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,040
to support some of the fine work

2440
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,540
that Mr. Wimperis is doing with the Ubuntu mate project.

2441
01:38:59,540 --> 01:39:02,960
And a lot of times that stuff funds stuff

2442
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:04,520
that just goes upstream to mate as well.

2443
01:39:04,520 --> 01:39:07,600
So Ubuntu underscore mate at patreon.com.

2444
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:09,000
Of course, we're Jupiter Signal.

2445
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,920
And they're off, they're off right now.

2446
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,720
They may never return, they say.

2447
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:14,440
But if you'd like to catch the backlog,

2448
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:16,240
go check out the Ubuntu podcast.

2449
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:17,880
There's some great episodes posted over there.

2450
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:18,980
They're on season break right now.

2451
01:39:18,980 --> 01:39:20,920
Is curry and beer been scheduled, gentlemen?

2452
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:21,960
Is that?

2453
01:39:21,960 --> 01:39:22,800
Not yet.

2454
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:24,680
We've had a pre-curry, but we haven't had curry.

2455
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:25,520
I understand.

2456
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:26,640
I understand.

2457
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:27,480
Okay.

2458
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:28,300
There's a pre-curry.

2459
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:30,560
You got a, do you have a post-curry too?

2460
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:32,160
Is there gonna be a post-curry?

2461
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:34,440
You need to, you know, flex your stomach muscles.

2462
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:35,280
Yes.

2463
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,240
Before you go for the proper curry.

2464
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:37,200
So that way, when you're ready

2465
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,400
to have a real serious discussion, you're warmed up.

2466
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:40,240
You've trained up.

2467
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,080
It's like a marathon.

2468
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,040
I understand.

2469
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:42,860
All right, guys.

2470
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:43,700
Well, thanks for being here.

2471
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:44,960
And thank you, audience, for being here.

2472
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:47,780
And hopefully Mr. West will be back to health next week.

2473
01:39:47,780 --> 01:39:51,040
In the meantime, go get him at Wes Payne on the Twitter

2474
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,600
and get more of him at the TechSnap program,

2475
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,240
TechSnap.Systems.

2476
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,080
Like I mentioned earlier, I'm at Chris Ellis.

2477
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:57,440
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

2478
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:00,320
Our subreddit is linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

2479
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:03,000
And you can email the show, Jupiterbroadcasting.com

2480
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,160
slash contact.

2481
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:05,560
Thank you, Robert, for emailing us this week.

2482
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:07,180
And everybody else, I had more emails queued up,

2483
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:08,760
but they were for Wes.

2484
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:11,340
So maybe we'll get those when he comes back next week.

2485
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:12,680
And again, those live times,

2486
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:15,160
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

2487
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:16,480
Thanks so much for being here.

2488
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,240
We'll see you right back here next week

2489
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:19,160
on the Unplugged program.

2490
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:20,060
See you next Tuesday.

2491
01:40:24,480 --> 01:40:27,040
I've never installed, you know, slash Linux.

2492
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:36,040
Get it out of here.

2493
01:40:36,040 --> 01:40:46,640
Get the hell out of here.

2494
01:40:46,640 --> 01:41:02,240
All right, let's see if we can title this thing

2495
01:41:02,240 --> 01:41:04,440
before Noah takes over the airwaves.

2496
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,320
Eabtitles.com, you can still submit.

2497
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:08,800
You can also submit in the Discord,

2498
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,680
Discord.me slash Jupiter Colony.

2499
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:12,480
I'll be searching that.

2500
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:14,520
Let's go pick a title and then we'll get out of here

2501
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,680
and Noah will take us away to AskNoahland.

2502
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:20,240
Bangsuggest.

2503
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:21,080
Thank you, gentlemen.

2504
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:24,080
I am so hooked, JJ, on Indian food.

2505
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,760
I'm actually taking a break right now

2506
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,000
so that way when Noah comes in here,

2507
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,160
I'm not burned out because otherwise...

2508
01:41:28,160 --> 01:41:29,000
Attaboy.

2509
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,240
Yeah, I'm doing that for you, Brown Bear.

2510
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,480
Oh, that's good, that's good.

2511
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,240
That makes me happy.

2512
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:33,920
Yep, and I've already warned Angela

2513
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,480
that there will be a business expense

2514
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:40,800
of butter chicken and stuff.

2515
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,880
Noah refuses to come unless you buy him Indian food.

2516
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,680
That's the reason why I'm sort of trying

2517
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:46,000
to explain a little bit.

2518
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,600
Yeah, I would imagine it's delicious,

2519
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:51,880
but man, I don't know.

2520
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:55,120
There's something about that butter chicken.

2521
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:56,080
You're gonna have to tell me, Noah,

2522
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,520
what you think, but there's something about it

2523
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,520
that's just, mm, it's healing.

2524
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,440
I had it on Friday.

2525
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:04,000
Me and Wimpy met up with one of our guys

2526
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,760
from the community and spent the day co-working

2527
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:09,360
in a library in near where Wimpy lives

2528
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:10,800
and then we went out for curry in the evening

2529
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,360
and it was so good, so good.

2530
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:14,200
I wish.

2531
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,480
I have a funny story relating to Indian food,

2532
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,000
but you can finish first.

2533
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,480
I was just gonna say, Poppy,

2534
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:21,040
sometime when you're out here,

2535
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:24,120
it would take a long time because it's like an hour,

2536
01:42:24,120 --> 01:42:26,520
well, it's like 50 minutes, well, an hour,

2537
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:27,360
depending on traffic.

2538
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,400
Dude, I'm gonna be in Seattle in like a week.

2539
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:32,040
I know, I know, but do you think you could break away

2540
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:35,000
for like three hours or so?

2541
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,400
Because we'd have to come all the way up north

2542
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,160
to go to this place, then there's the time to eat

2543
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,720
and then the time to get back.

2544
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:41,880
That's the problem.

2545
01:42:41,880 --> 01:42:45,000
But it is, I've traveled around some places

2546
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,680
and I've never had Indian food better than,

2547
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:48,920
at least here in the States that I've traveled to,

2548
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:50,060
than this place.

2549
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:51,480
It's just so good.

2550
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:52,880
I just bought six of them.

2551
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:56,080
I went in and bought six butter chickens at once last week

2552
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,840
and ate it for four days or something like that.

2553
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,000
It's so good.

2554
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:05,240
The best curry I've ever had is in Japan.

2555
01:43:05,240 --> 01:43:06,080
Oh yeah, really?

2556
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:06,920
Okay, okay.

2557
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:10,000
Yeah, they make some awesome Indian curry in Japan.

2558
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,160
I imagine there's something that surpasses it.

2559
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:13,000
I mean, there must be.

2560
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,960
What about Indian curry in Japan?

2561
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:17,000
Yeah, the best, he said, the best curry in Japan.

2562
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,760
The best curry ever is in Japan.

2563
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,160
I don't know if I agree with the best curry ever,

2564
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:23,500
but they do have some really, really motivated

2565
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:24,340
Indian people in Japan.

2566
01:43:24,340 --> 01:43:25,440
They make some good food.

2567
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,280
I'm not kidding.

2568
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,120
I mean, they make some.

2569
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,480
What does that mean?

2570
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:29,840
Motivated Indian people.

2571
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,040
Here's the thing, here's the thing.

2572
01:43:31,040 --> 01:43:31,980
Here's the thing, you have to understand

2573
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,240
something about cuisine, right?

2574
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,080
So think about this.

2575
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:35,920
In the US, it's easy to make,

2576
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,320
even the worst Indian food passes as amazing here

2577
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:40,440
because Americans are more or less.

2578
01:43:40,440 --> 01:43:41,520
Boy, does it seem to.

2579
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:42,880
Bland, yeah, they're just bland.

2580
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:45,600
I mean, because every American food is just bland.

2581
01:43:45,600 --> 01:43:47,600
But when you go to Japan and you have,

2582
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,920
they're competing on a different culinary level,

2583
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:51,960
now you have to have a really motivated Indian person

2584
01:43:51,960 --> 01:44:11,960
if you're gonna make it there.
