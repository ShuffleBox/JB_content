WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
Do you guys see this ruggedized NUC?

00:03.160 --> 00:05.740
How crazy is this thing?

00:05.740 --> 00:06.740
You ready for this?

00:06.740 --> 00:09.380
It's a NUC with Broadwell and Baytrail.

00:09.380 --> 00:13.160
You can go with a couple of gigabit ports on some of them.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.280
The standard one only has one gigabit port.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.280
It's fanless.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.280
It's got this built-in cooling.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.280
One with two gigabit ports?

00:18.280 --> 00:19.280
Yeah.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.280
Yeah.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.280
Router bitches!

00:21.280 --> 00:22.280
Yeah, and also no fans.

00:22.280 --> 00:23.280
Look at that.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.280
It's got the finned cooling there.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.100
I think it's pretty cool.

00:27.100 --> 00:31.520
One thing I'm not happy with these NUCs is the power supply, but this one looks like

00:31.520 --> 00:35.240
it has an interlocking connector, a little bit better of a superior connector, which

00:35.240 --> 00:36.240
would be better for production.

00:36.240 --> 00:39.080
Like, I want to put these in a rack and make them Skype rigs.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.080
Pretty cool.

00:40.080 --> 00:45.400
I know, it's overkill, but they're pretty neat.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.640
Using the 14 nanometer Broadwell processors.

00:47.640 --> 00:50.960
These are kind of cool.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.400
Look at this, Alan.

00:53.400 --> 00:54.400
This is perfect.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.000
It's got a serial port right here on the front for you.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.520
I saw one, the newer ones with a serial port demonstrated, it got a live demo of Xen with

01:03.520 --> 01:06.920
FreeBSD as a host at AsianBSDCon.

01:06.920 --> 01:12.120
The guy brought a NUC that was all set up with FreeBSD Xen.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.480
So FreeBSD was the host of the Xen virtualizer?

01:15.480 --> 01:19.380
Yes, FreeBSD as DOM0.

01:19.380 --> 01:20.380
How does that work?

01:20.380 --> 01:21.380
Xen has been ported to FreeBSD.

01:21.380 --> 01:23.240
I thought that was a Linux kernel thing.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.240
Nope.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.440
Wow, that's pretty cool.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.120
Now why would Beehive so close?

01:27.120 --> 01:28.120
There's lots of people.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.120
What's that?

01:29.120 --> 01:34.360
Well, because Xen can run Windows on FreeBSD already, and Beehive is a long way off for

01:34.360 --> 01:35.360
that.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.360
Gotcha.

01:36.360 --> 01:37.360
Of course, that makes sense.

01:37.360 --> 01:38.360
Yeah.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.360
Okay.

01:39.360 --> 01:43.280
Although Beehive is further ahead in hardware pass-through, but Xen will be able to catch

01:43.280 --> 01:44.280
up more easily.

01:44.280 --> 01:45.280
Hmm.

01:45.280 --> 01:46.280
Wow.

01:46.280 --> 01:48.880
Basically, because Citrix realized that Linux is toxic.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.120
Oh, ouch, Alan.

01:50.120 --> 01:51.120
That hurts.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.120
That hurts.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.120
They don't want to be the next VMware.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.120
Wow, Alan.

01:54.120 --> 01:55.120
Wow.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.120
Oh, my gosh.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.120
Look at you.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.120
Nice.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.120
Those are good ones.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.120
That's fine, Alan.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.120
It doesn't hurt.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.120
I'm sorry.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.120
I wasn't trolling.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.720
I felt like good trolling.

02:04.720 --> 02:05.720
We believe you.

02:05.720 --> 02:06.720
It's very good trolling.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.720
I understand.

02:07.720 --> 02:17.120
At the same time, people just don't want to get sued.

02:17.120 --> 02:22.360
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's feeling the luck of the Irish.

02:22.360 --> 02:23.680
My name is Chris.

02:23.680 --> 02:24.680
And my name is Matt.

02:24.680 --> 02:25.680
Hey, Matt.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.040
Happy St. Patrick's Day, Terry.

02:27.040 --> 02:30.960
Are you doing anything to celebrate the festivities today?

02:30.960 --> 02:34.520
Realizing that everything I own that is green, it is dirty, and I am hiding in my house because

02:34.520 --> 02:35.520
of it.

02:35.520 --> 02:36.520
You know what I mean.

02:36.520 --> 02:37.520
Yeah.

02:37.520 --> 02:38.520
Yeah.

02:38.520 --> 02:39.520
It's a good call, Matt.

02:39.520 --> 02:40.520
It's a good call.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.520
Yeah.

02:41.520 --> 02:46.360
See, the St. Patrick's Day, see, we're not big on the drinking these days, but we wanted

02:46.360 --> 02:47.360
to make it special.

02:47.360 --> 02:51.680
So eight years ago on St. Patrick's Day, I married the wife, the Angela Fisher.

02:51.680 --> 02:52.680
Yeah.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.680
So today's our anniversary.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.040
We're going to have a little bit of extra fun on St. Patrick's Day.

02:55.040 --> 02:58.560
So also a special happy anniversary to Angela.

02:58.560 --> 03:02.340
And I'll be going home after Linux Unplugged, and maybe we'll do something fun for dinner.

03:02.340 --> 03:06.600
But we today have a great show, even though I don't think anybody's drinking.

03:06.600 --> 03:08.160
Man, we screwed that one up.

03:08.160 --> 03:10.280
I don't have any beer in the studio today.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.400
But we do have a great show coming up.

03:12.400 --> 03:16.160
I have a make good first.

03:16.160 --> 03:17.520
Just a little bit towards the feedback.

03:17.520 --> 03:22.680
In the feedback, I wanted to play an interview with an Ubuntu representative at scale a couple

03:22.680 --> 03:26.440
of weeks ago, but we had some clipping in the video, so I said, ah, scrap it, scrap

03:26.440 --> 03:27.440
it.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.440
Well, I went back.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.440
I figured out why it was clipping.

03:29.440 --> 03:31.520
And I pulled out probably the most important bit.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.760
And that is, Noah says, well, what are you guys going to do to challenge Android in the

03:34.760 --> 03:35.760
market share?

03:35.760 --> 03:36.760
He pins that question on him.

03:36.760 --> 03:40.360
And then after he answers that question, Noah says, OK, so what are you going to do to get

03:40.360 --> 03:45.480
desktop staples like Thunderbird to work in a converged environment?

03:45.480 --> 03:46.720
And he has an answer for that.

03:46.720 --> 03:47.720
Two great questions.

03:47.720 --> 03:48.720
So I pulled those out.

03:48.720 --> 03:53.800
I'm going to go through those and see what Canonical's answer is in a converged desktop.

03:53.800 --> 03:59.280
But Matt, we have a lot of things to get to, like the ultimate Linux laptop.

03:59.280 --> 04:03.680
We got we got a lot of things, Matt, but right now we got to stop and recognize that something

04:03.680 --> 04:13.560
very important has happened in the world of Linux today, Tuesday, March 17th, 2015.

04:13.560 --> 04:16.000
Bioshock graces Linux.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.880
Right now I have it installed on my machine upstairs, Bioshock Infinite is officially

04:20.880 --> 04:27.400
available for Linux, a little bit of a mixed blessing, a really good game, really.

04:27.400 --> 04:34.480
I played I actually installed the trial, you know, like 120 day eval of Windows 8 to try

04:34.480 --> 04:35.480
this game.

04:35.480 --> 04:37.320
I was so excited and I loved it.

04:37.320 --> 04:38.560
I just couldn't stand using Windows.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.840
So I quit playing and I said, I'll just wait for Linux.

04:40.840 --> 04:41.840
Now I know I love the game.

04:41.840 --> 04:42.840
I already own it.

04:42.840 --> 04:43.840
I'll just wait for Linux.

04:43.840 --> 04:44.840
I don't ever do that.

04:44.840 --> 04:46.000
There's no exception with this game.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.920
And I really, really enjoyed it.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.680
Today I downloaded and started playing again.

04:50.680 --> 04:53.240
It was it was working beautifully.

04:53.240 --> 04:58.720
I have it set to max settings, full screen resolution, which on my 2K monitor looks really

04:58.720 --> 04:59.720
great.

04:59.720 --> 05:05.880
However, it is using that same Eon wrapper that the Witcher 2 was using that got a lot

05:05.880 --> 05:07.440
of criticism.

05:07.440 --> 05:12.320
Well, so the $10,000 question is, how is it affecting performance?

05:12.320 --> 05:15.680
Because that's my that's always my go to thing before we get into like, you know, whether

05:15.680 --> 05:16.680
it's right or wrong.

05:16.680 --> 05:20.180
I think it's too early to say because last time we had this come out, you know, I didn't

05:20.180 --> 05:21.480
have any performance issues.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.420
Again, I don't have any performance issues.

05:23.420 --> 05:27.320
But of course, I'm running it on an NVIDIA card, pretty modern driver set, pretty good

05:27.320 --> 05:33.960
I7 off of the $10,000 RPM RAID 0 set of drives like it's a pretty good use case scenario

05:33.960 --> 05:35.600
for something that's going to be heavy.

05:35.600 --> 05:39.240
And they recommend, you know, the NVIDIA 340 graphics driver.

05:39.240 --> 05:44.480
So it's semi recent and you know, at least a Radeon 7x or greater card.

05:44.480 --> 05:45.480
I don't know.

05:45.480 --> 05:46.480
I'm going to wait and see.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.400
I think we have to see it on a wider range of hardware.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.600
But it's at least a title that we can I mean, it's now available for Linux.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.320
Oh, it'll get grief just as soon as they pull, you know, how they're doing it comes about,

05:56.320 --> 05:57.320
I'm sure.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.600
But I think it's going to come down more to someone's, you know, whether or not that's

06:00.600 --> 06:03.700
a concern for them based on principles, or whether or not they're just concerned about

06:03.700 --> 06:05.320
whether or not a game is buggy or not.

06:05.320 --> 06:08.800
Myself, I don't care if it runs on Cheetos, as long as it runs, it runs.

06:08.800 --> 06:13.520
And who me points out Aeon has gotten better since the Witcher 2 release and they have,

06:13.520 --> 06:19.520
you know, here's one thing to consider is it is it is very easy from a non developers

06:19.520 --> 06:24.860
perspective to sit back on the side and go, Oh, well, it's using some sort of API translator,

06:24.860 --> 06:26.520
it must be inferior.

06:26.520 --> 06:31.440
But the reality is, is you and I, for most, for most of us, we have no idea how game development

06:31.440 --> 06:32.440
works.

06:32.440 --> 06:36.160
They're, they're, they're probably using several layers of abstraction already from the tools

06:36.160 --> 06:37.760
are using to develop the game, right?

06:37.760 --> 06:42.120
I mean, all of this stuff is already pulled way away from the metal as it is.

06:42.120 --> 06:47.480
So we really don't know what we're talking about it is, is for all we know, perhaps using

06:47.480 --> 06:52.920
well proven and laid out development methods that they can then just easily wrap some API's

06:52.920 --> 06:53.920
around.

06:53.920 --> 06:54.920
Maybe that is a better way to go.

06:54.920 --> 06:55.920
Who knows?

06:55.920 --> 06:56.920
I don't.

06:56.920 --> 06:57.920
But I do know the game's now available.

06:57.920 --> 07:01.600
And I was able to play it for about 20 minutes today before the show started.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.240
And I really enjoyed myself.

07:03.240 --> 07:05.280
For me, it was worth the price.

07:05.280 --> 07:09.200
But I would say if you're concerned, and I think maybe there's a reason to be based on

07:09.200 --> 07:11.960
previous games, why not wait a week or two?

07:11.960 --> 07:14.800
You know, you know, the Linux game cast guys are going to review it at some point, see

07:14.800 --> 07:15.800
what they're going to say.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.580
Go read the reviews on Steam, go check out Linux underscore gaming on Reddit, there's

07:19.580 --> 07:23.200
already a thread going about how it's working for people and the kind of performance they're

07:23.200 --> 07:24.200
seeing.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.200
So go check out all of that.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.200
Before we move off of this, Derek Delvin, you had something you wanted to add.

07:28.200 --> 07:34.840
Yeah, for me as a developer, that's precisely why I care if they're using a wrapper or not,

07:34.840 --> 07:40.760
because I know that when they are not using a wrapper, they're actually saying that, okay,

07:40.760 --> 07:44.880
Linux has the APIs required to make a good game happen.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.920
And Linux provides the capabilities needed for a developer.

07:47.920 --> 07:53.000
Now, yes, I understand that they're doing a port of an existing game, but still, it

07:53.000 --> 07:59.080
doesn't show appreciation or doesn't actually endorse Linux, it just says we have a market

07:59.080 --> 08:00.080
on it.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.960
No, see, this game is in that category of games that were developed many years ago.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.960
If you think about when that game came to market, how many years under development was

08:06.960 --> 08:07.960
it?

08:07.960 --> 08:11.080
So by the time it comes to market, they've already bet on a different type of technology

08:11.080 --> 08:16.200
platform, and there's just no financial sense in reworking that for a platform that has

08:16.200 --> 08:18.640
a tiny market share.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.220
So these wrappers make a lot of sense.

08:20.220 --> 08:22.920
But if you were to start a game today and say take advantage of something like the Unreal

08:22.920 --> 08:27.000
Ford engine, well, then you're going to have a first-class Linux game.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
And I don't really think it's so much of a statement on the state of Linux, because you

08:31.000 --> 08:33.560
can do it today with a first-class game using the right tools.

08:33.560 --> 08:38.680
I think it's more a statement on how much it's worth it.

08:38.680 --> 08:45.320
If this platform was worth it for them, you could see some companies maybe going in and

08:45.320 --> 08:49.360
doing a complete rewrite to make it work for the iPad, because they could make thousands

08:49.360 --> 08:52.640
and thousands and thousands of dollars an hour on the iPad.

08:52.640 --> 08:57.160
But you're not going to see that when they're going to sell maybe 1% to 2% to 5% of their

08:57.160 --> 08:59.120
overall sales go to Linux.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.920
That is not worth a complete rewrite.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.440
What it really is is to check off that box, and now you can say this title is available

09:04.440 --> 09:06.000
for the SteamOS platform.

09:06.000 --> 09:14.960
Sure, but then I think it's the way that you spread the message, right?

09:14.960 --> 09:21.240
Now on Linux, that kind of is a little bit misleading, you know?

09:21.240 --> 09:27.440
And also, it's not that they couldn't have used this thing a while back as well, because

09:27.440 --> 09:33.520
if it was just quote-unquote easy to use a shim to see and explore the waters of the

09:33.520 --> 09:37.240
platform, so they already had that thing.

09:37.240 --> 09:41.720
Because apparently, they didn't create one new shim, they are just using some that already

09:41.720 --> 09:42.720
existed.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.440
Although Eon claims the shim is customized for each game.

09:45.440 --> 09:46.440
Okay.

09:46.440 --> 09:50.640
Yeah, I know, I know.

09:50.640 --> 09:56.320
Do you know if this actually came from the dev studio, or is some company like Eon coming

09:56.320 --> 10:03.360
up to the development studio and saying, let us be the guys who port it for you, or shim

10:03.360 --> 10:08.480
it for you, or whatever you want to call it, and the original developers have nothing to

10:08.480 --> 10:12.520
do with the Linux version?

10:12.520 --> 10:13.520
Which way is it?

10:13.520 --> 10:14.520
No, no, no.

10:14.520 --> 10:18.800
I mean, of course they still have, the original developers still have something to do with

10:18.800 --> 10:22.040
it, but yeah, a lot of times they contract it out to, not in this case, but in some cases

10:22.040 --> 10:25.800
companies like Aspire and others that handle that aspect of the port.

10:25.800 --> 10:32.520
I just remember how it was with the original Torchlight, where the guy who was contracted

10:32.520 --> 10:39.400
to do it, he actually made like a full fledged port where he ripped out the original game

10:39.400 --> 10:47.800
engine, whatever it was, and put Ogre 3D instead in there, and it was buggy, and Bruny Games

10:47.800 --> 10:55.160
did not want to support it, because it was, a solid portion of it wasn't even their code.

10:55.160 --> 11:04.600
So this is, porting games is a very, very complicated thing, and I think, like you mentioned

11:04.600 --> 11:12.480
before, we just have to set our expectations to reflect whatever game developers think

11:12.480 --> 11:18.600
they can make by, how much money they can make by porting the games to Linux.

11:18.600 --> 11:24.680
I'm going to sit back and see what the reviews say, and Matt, you wrote an article this week,

11:24.680 --> 11:28.000
I was just going to point people's attention to, because we've been getting a lot of questions

11:28.000 --> 11:32.680
into the show about VoIP solutions for Linux, so kind of perfect timing, you had a state

11:32.680 --> 11:38.240
of VoIP and Linux right up over at DataMation, and I love it, because you touch on Skype,

11:38.240 --> 11:41.480
which of course is the go-to, you've got Jitsi in here, which I've been playing more and

11:41.480 --> 11:45.620
more with, and you nailed Jitsi, it's got its good and its bad in here, and of course

11:45.620 --> 11:49.400
the classic Ekejia, so it's a good write-up, good timing.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.280
Oh, I appreciate that, and it's something that Noah and I have actually gone back and

11:52.280 --> 11:57.380
forth, when you guys were first kind of coming into the changeover for Linux Action Show,

11:57.380 --> 12:01.040
we were kind of looking at the different clients and fallback clients and things like that,

12:01.040 --> 12:07.040
and it's not that cut and dry, it's like, when it comes to video, you're looking at

12:07.040 --> 12:11.220
WebRTC solutions, that's my opinion, I swear by them now, I've been playing with this one

12:11.220 --> 12:17.360
for a while, it's awesome, it's stupid easy, there's no configuration, anything on Linux,

12:17.360 --> 12:20.600
I think it's going to be Skype or that, I don't think anything else is going to matter.

12:20.600 --> 12:24.000
Yeah, and you talk about, Matt talks about his favorite in the article and some of the

12:24.000 --> 12:27.840
key differences between it and Skype, so check it out, yeah, and I agree, I played with them

12:27.840 --> 12:34.520
for the BSD Now Show, and we really liked a couple of them, but all of them had a local

12:34.520 --> 12:39.280
preview of my camera that I couldn't turn off, because I forgot somebody else's face

12:39.280 --> 12:41.280
or something, which made it hard to use for production.

12:41.280 --> 12:43.720
Yeah, exactly, it's the kind of stuff you don't even care about until you're doing

12:43.720 --> 12:46.640
a production, like, oh wait, I can't have a preview video, because that's in the shot,

12:46.640 --> 12:48.920
I can't have it in the shot, that's a practice.

12:48.920 --> 12:52.680
It's covering half of Chris's face when we were doing, if it was just me and Chris, it

12:52.680 --> 12:56.000
worked fine, but if we were trying to have a third person on for the interview, it would

12:56.000 --> 13:00.940
cover a quarter of Chris's face with a preview of my face, and people only need one of my

13:00.940 --> 13:01.940
face at a time.

13:01.940 --> 13:02.940
That's an excellent point.

13:02.940 --> 13:05.440
Well, I don't know, you can never have too much Alan face, but I guess we just have to

13:05.440 --> 13:06.440
agree to some.

13:06.440 --> 13:09.960
So we actually emailed one of the WebRTC platforms asking if they could make an option to hide

13:09.960 --> 13:12.400
that or turn it off or something for us, although I don't know what happened back.

13:12.400 --> 13:20.840
I think that would be very easy to do in Firefox Hello, but unfortunately Firefox Hello doesn't

13:20.840 --> 13:23.680
currently support conference calls, so it's just two people.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.520
I think you could do it in Jitsi Web, but I can't remember.

13:26.520 --> 13:29.920
Well, some of the options that I highlighted, you can actually do conference calls, you

13:29.920 --> 13:33.760
could do screen sharing via extension, which worked out really well.

13:33.760 --> 13:37.240
Chris put all the effort into getting all the screen sharing and stuff working in Firefox

13:37.240 --> 13:44.260
on PCVSD, so it all shifts by default working perfectly now, so that we could also do tutorials

13:44.260 --> 13:46.080
that way.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.720
But then my face covers up part of his face.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.340
Yeah, and I'm with you on that.

13:50.340 --> 13:53.000
That's a big, big not going to work in production at all.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.120
That's a big thing that needs to be resolved for sure.

13:55.120 --> 13:58.720
But you know, the nice thing is that there can be different implementations of it, and

13:58.720 --> 14:02.000
you know once it really gains traction, you know there's going to be one for podcasters

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
and people.

14:03.000 --> 14:09.120
Well, that's the thing is that WebRTC is just so close to being perfect, using one thing.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.120
Yeah, yeah.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.120
It's like everything open source.

14:11.120 --> 14:12.120
Yeah, aww.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.120
But it'll get there.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.120
I think it will.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.120
Yes, I think it will.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.120
Yeah, I think somebody will close the gap.

14:17.120 --> 14:22.280
And then somebody should, you know, some pioneering podcast network should just make a product

14:22.280 --> 14:23.280
and just sell it.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.280
There you go.

14:24.280 --> 14:31.520
Well, if what you're using is open source, it shouldn't be too hard to remove your face

14:31.520 --> 14:35.240
from being displayed at all.

14:35.240 --> 14:39.320
You should just have to delete like three lines of code and it should work.

14:39.320 --> 14:43.680
The other thing that was difficult is Firefox didn't want to use a different playback device.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.760
I can pick which camera and microphone to use.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.760
It's got to be your default system.

14:46.760 --> 14:47.760
I couldn't force it.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.760
Yeah.

14:48.760 --> 14:50.320
And for the podcast, I want that to be different.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.320
Yes.

14:51.320 --> 14:52.320
Yeah.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.320
Sometimes multiple audios.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.320
Yeah.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.320
All right.

14:55.320 --> 14:58.240
So we're going to get to an email that came in that agrees with everything Wimpy had to

14:58.240 --> 14:59.240
say recently.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.840
So we'll talk about that in just a moment.

15:01.840 --> 15:06.080
But first, I should probably take just a moment here to thank our friends over at Ting.

15:06.080 --> 15:12.400
I have just so many good things to say about my Ting GSM service on the Nexus 5.

15:12.400 --> 15:19.400
I have gotten so excited at simple things these days.

15:19.400 --> 15:23.480
I don't know what it is about it, but the combination of the Pebble Watch with the Nexus

15:23.480 --> 15:30.680
5 on Lollipop, unlocked on the GSM network, I feel like I have finally hit like the trifecta

15:30.680 --> 15:32.000
of amazing.

15:32.000 --> 15:37.100
And the great thing is, is not only do I have just amazing coverage here at the studio,

15:37.100 --> 15:39.160
but I'm on Wi-Fi, so it's not like a huge deal.

15:39.160 --> 15:43.760
But my drive now is just impeccable coverage, spotless coverage.

15:43.760 --> 15:47.000
So yeah, I'm having all fun, I'm downloading podcasts, I'm streaming stuff a little bit.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
But why not?

15:48.000 --> 15:49.400
It's like it's great coverage.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.120
And that's one of the things I love about Ting is because I'm just paying for what

15:52.120 --> 15:53.120
I use.

15:53.120 --> 15:58.480
So if I want to have a little fun, I don't have to worry about going over on some plan.

15:58.480 --> 15:59.680
That's not how it works with Ting.

15:59.680 --> 16:00.900
You just pay for your usage.

16:00.900 --> 16:03.520
It's a flat $6 for the line.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.360
And then Ting just takes your minutes and your messages and your megabytes, they add

16:06.360 --> 16:08.400
them up and that's just what you pay.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.400
I've got three lines.

16:09.400 --> 16:12.120
I've got an iPhone 5, an HTC One and a Nexus 5.

16:12.120 --> 16:19.440
Now the Nexus 5 is my daily driver and I have it totally tricked out these days to you guys.

16:19.440 --> 16:26.720
So I have if this, then that all set up on here so it's like tracking all my time.

16:26.720 --> 16:31.240
I've got automatic so I'm tracking all my car information and I'm logging my miles for

16:31.240 --> 16:35.920
taxes and it's all powered by the Ting network and so I always have connectivity.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.200
I'm always either on Wi-Fi or Ting GSM.

16:38.200 --> 16:39.600
I love the coverage.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.560
And I love too that if I need to go somewhere maybe they have better CDMA coverage, I can

16:42.560 --> 16:46.160
always switch my Nexus 5 back because the Nexus 5 can do either or.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.360
That is so slick.

16:48.360 --> 16:51.920
And right now if you go over to Ting, go to linux.ting.com.

16:51.920 --> 16:56.040
Go there, that will support our show and give you a $25 off any device you want to buy from

16:56.040 --> 16:58.500
Ting or $25 service credit.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.960
Something you might want to consider picking up is the Ting GSM card.

17:01.960 --> 17:07.320
You go to linux.ting.com, they give you $25 of credit because this GSM card is only $9.

17:07.320 --> 17:10.680
This GSM card is you pop out what if you need a micro or a regular, whatever you need, they're

17:10.680 --> 17:14.320
all the different cutouts already there and you pop it in your device.

17:14.320 --> 17:18.280
Noah's got a couple of phones he uses as sort of like bat lines.

17:18.280 --> 17:22.580
My buddy Chase from Unfilter uses this for his home security system.

17:22.580 --> 17:24.720
You know you could put this on a module with a Raspberry Pi.

17:24.720 --> 17:29.280
I mean there's so many, $9 and you have a GSM card.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.680
And then it's $6 for the line and just your usage.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.560
So if it's something that's going to send an occasional report or something you check

17:34.560 --> 17:40.040
remotely from your phone from time to time, it is such an economical way to do that.

17:40.040 --> 17:44.000
Or you know $9 for the SIM card and then it's $6 for the line and you can turn it on and

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
off too by the way.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.760
So you don't always even have to be paying the $6.

17:47.760 --> 17:48.760
You can throw it in.

17:48.760 --> 17:53.720
If you've got a tablet that has a GSM SIM slot, throw it in there and then when you

17:53.720 --> 17:55.720
do need it you just turn it on and you have data.

17:55.720 --> 17:59.920
Or if you've got an old GSM phone, I mean like you can take advantage of the CDMA network

17:59.920 --> 18:00.920
or the GSM network.

18:00.920 --> 18:01.920
It's really cool.

18:01.920 --> 18:06.880
And you can start it by going to linux.ting.com, $25 off that device or service credit and

18:06.880 --> 18:07.880
go check out their blog.

18:07.880 --> 18:08.880
They've always got lots of good information.

18:08.880 --> 18:12.200
Like they just broke down like what all the different phone acronyms are for like the

18:12.200 --> 18:14.920
different codes like in the phone that you have to like give in when you're activating

18:14.920 --> 18:15.920
stuff.

18:15.920 --> 18:18.400
They also have a savings calculator so you can put your current usage in there and see

18:18.400 --> 18:20.400
how much you would save.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.000
Linux.ting.com, go check them out.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.480
No hold customer service too, 1855-TINGFTW and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux

18:27.480 --> 18:28.480
Unplugged.

18:28.480 --> 18:30.360
Linux.ting.com, thanks you guys.

18:30.360 --> 18:33.760
Really appreciate the, really now the long term support of the Linux Unplugged show.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.420
They were one of the first sponsors because they really thought the show, you know a community

18:36.420 --> 18:40.360
focused show was somewhere they wanted to be and I really appreciate that vote of confidence.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.880
So linux.ting.com is a great way to support the show.

18:42.880 --> 18:43.880
Thanks Ting.

18:43.880 --> 18:47.520
Okay, so we got an email into the show that wanted to touch on a point that Wimpy had

18:47.520 --> 18:50.200
made about virtual reality recently in the pre-show.

18:50.200 --> 18:54.800
Brian writes in, he says, episode 82 goes down as one of my favorite pre-shows ever.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.320
I love the debate between Wimpy and Popey, it was excellent.

18:57.320 --> 18:59.160
And I have to agree with Wimpy.

18:59.160 --> 19:04.320
During college in 92 and 93, I recall the same 15 pound headset and getting some belt

19:04.320 --> 19:08.940
on to move around, this time it was a line art world, and lob some weird projectiles

19:08.940 --> 19:10.040
at another player.

19:10.040 --> 19:14.280
Amazing for the time, but I definitely didn't see the push for 20 years later.

19:14.280 --> 19:17.920
To Popey's point, the world always moves to how do we get this in the hands of the average

19:17.920 --> 19:20.120
consumer, and that's where we're at now.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.280
Thanks for the laughs and memories.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.960
And to your point Wimpy, you were essentially saying you think that VR is just another fad

19:24.960 --> 19:25.960
again, right?

19:25.960 --> 19:28.960
Yeah, yeah, I think it is.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.120
And I think I've come to an agreement with you.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.120
You know I was-

19:32.120 --> 19:33.120
Oh, really?

19:33.120 --> 19:38.000
Yeah, and I know, and I'm an Oculus SDK owner, and when I put it on I felt like this is an

19:38.000 --> 19:43.040
amazing game changer, like life changing technology, and I believe that statement to be true.

19:43.040 --> 19:47.840
I just don't think we'll ever manage to reach mass adoption.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.040
Not the way our world works anymore.

19:50.040 --> 19:54.000
There's already competing standards before a single headset's really even made it to

19:54.000 --> 19:55.400
the mainstream market.

19:55.400 --> 19:59.880
And now what's likely to make it to the market first in the fall is Samsung VR, which is

19:59.880 --> 20:04.220
a watered down version of Oculus VR, because it has to only work on mobile, which makes

20:04.220 --> 20:07.680
it easier for the average person, but it means you're limited to mobile games, and you don't

20:07.680 --> 20:10.960
get the super immersive experiences that you get with the desktop games.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.560
And that's just a fact.

20:12.560 --> 20:15.200
And that's going to be a watered down experience, and it's not anything I'm all that interested

20:15.200 --> 20:16.200
in.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.200
I'm interested in the game changer.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.200
But I just don't see it.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.200
Three, four wires coming out of my head.

20:19.200 --> 20:20.200
I've got to hook up HDMI.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.840
I've got to hook up two USB things, and I've got to hook up an infrared webcam.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.320
I've got to have that position just right.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.920
I've got to set up the mirroring just correct, and then I've got to make sure I have the

20:26.920 --> 20:29.080
correct version of the game that supports the Oculus.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.080
Yeah.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.520
Now I know they could make that easier, but it's a long way from being easy enough for

20:32.520 --> 20:34.920
the average consumer, and I just don't think it's going to make it.

20:34.920 --> 20:37.880
And that makes me super bummed, because I think it could be amazing.

20:37.880 --> 20:43.360
I think there's all kinds of applications, teleconferencing, podcasting, gaming, parenting,

20:43.360 --> 20:44.360
education.

20:44.360 --> 20:48.020
Oh man, so many educational opportunities for VR.

20:48.020 --> 20:49.680
So I hope they don't quit working on it.

20:49.680 --> 20:56.260
But you know, Samsung said that by the end of the year, VR, they were going to blast

20:56.260 --> 20:59.120
the market with VR, and I don't think it's going to go anywhere by the end of the year.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.800
I think we'll be having the same discussion in 2016.

21:01.800 --> 21:02.800
That's just me though.

21:02.800 --> 21:07.560
You know, I would like to see, I think probably, honestly, and this is going to sound terrible,

21:07.560 --> 21:13.560
how cool would it be to have like, to actually experience people's careers and things like

21:13.560 --> 21:14.560
that.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.560
Or even Driver's Ed.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.560
Although it would probably be something like GTA, but whatever.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.560
You know, I mean it would be interesting.

21:19.560 --> 21:20.560
I know, yeah.

21:20.560 --> 21:23.640
You know, what it's like to be a surgeon for a day, that could be a little scary, but you

21:23.640 --> 21:24.640
know.

21:24.640 --> 21:29.320
Think about movies in virtual reality, the way you could present movies, right?

21:29.320 --> 21:30.320
Screw VR.

21:30.320 --> 21:31.320
I mean, screw 3D.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.000
I want a virtual reality movie.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.560
Yeah, Daryl, go ahead, you had a point to make.

21:35.560 --> 21:40.160
I was just thinking that perhaps it won't happen the way we're looking at, just consumer

21:40.160 --> 21:45.480
products directly, because actually there is the untapped professional market.

21:45.480 --> 21:52.760
So currently there are already extremely expensive simulators for avionics or even, you know,

21:52.760 --> 21:54.480
trying cars and things like that.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.080
So I think those environments will get it first.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.080
And I could see military applications.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.080
Exactly.

22:00.080 --> 22:05.800
And it will increase the production of these devices, which will significantly decrease

22:05.800 --> 22:10.000
the cost of production, which means that then it's accessible to the user market.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.880
So I think that's the most likely path.

22:11.880 --> 22:12.880
I have two comments.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.900
I think along with that, I think also high-end gaming, because there you have a user base

22:15.900 --> 22:19.840
that's savvy enough to hook up HDMI and multiple USBs and understands the difference between

22:19.840 --> 22:22.320
USB 2 and 3 and video mirroring.

22:22.320 --> 22:26.520
So then I think that bodes well for Valve and Steam Machines, because again, you know,

22:26.520 --> 22:30.780
Steam Machines are going to be much more accommodating to a VR headset than like a console will be.

22:30.780 --> 22:34.040
So if that does enter the market and it's something high-end gamers want, Valve and

22:34.040 --> 22:36.800
Steam Machines will be uniquely positioned to take advantage of that.

22:36.800 --> 22:41.880
But at the same time, I really worry deeply that it's all going to be proprietary and

22:41.880 --> 22:47.160
that open source and Linux will be the losers, because so much of this stuff depends on,

22:47.160 --> 22:51.400
take your pick, incredible GPU compute power that demands proprietary drivers?

22:51.400 --> 22:52.920
Check that box.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.560
Maybe a back-end cloud infrastructure that requires a subscription and uses a ton of

22:56.560 --> 22:57.720
proprietary software?

22:57.720 --> 22:58.720
Check that box.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.480
And in most cases, it's only really going to work very well on the Windows or Mac desktop,

23:01.480 --> 23:02.600
so check that box.

23:02.600 --> 23:05.720
So I'm a little concerned where we're going towards something here, where that leaves

23:05.720 --> 23:07.400
Linux and open source.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.240
Does anybody in the Mamba room have any thoughts?

23:10.240 --> 23:11.360
That's actually interesting.

23:11.360 --> 23:17.400
So I think because of what I just mentioned, there is also the likelihood of bringing attraction

23:17.400 --> 23:22.720
back to the arcade places that, you know, you have these huge consoles.

23:22.720 --> 23:25.800
People used to gather in these places and just play games.

23:25.800 --> 23:30.720
But once you have the device in people's hands, I don't think, it's like, if it's not open

23:30.720 --> 23:32.800
source by default, it will be.

23:32.800 --> 23:36.520
This is like a rule of nature, almost.

23:36.520 --> 23:40.680
Yeah, I suppose eventually, yeah, eventually we'll make an open source version.

23:40.680 --> 23:41.680
That's true.

23:41.680 --> 23:42.680
I shouldn't worry.

23:42.680 --> 23:43.680
Yeah.

23:43.680 --> 23:45.320
I'm hoping that happens with BitTorrent Sync too.

23:45.320 --> 23:46.320
Come on.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.320
Come on.

23:47.320 --> 23:48.320
Let's do BitTorrent Sync.

23:48.320 --> 23:49.320
Let's make an open source clone.

23:49.320 --> 23:50.320
Let's do it, everybody.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.320
Man.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.320
All right.

23:52.320 --> 23:53.320
All right.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.320
All good things.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.320
All good things.

23:55.320 --> 23:56.320
And I continue to play with VR.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.320
Either way, I'll continue to play with it.

23:57.320 --> 23:58.320
I don't care if everybody else.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.920
I don't care if it gets wide adoption as long as I get to keep playing with it.

24:00.920 --> 24:06.200
I have a make good I want to play before we jump into our next segment.

24:06.200 --> 24:10.520
And I just, it was something I wanted to play a couple of weeks ago, but it was clipping

24:10.520 --> 24:11.680
at the time.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.600
And this is Nathan from Canonical.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.440
He's at the Ubuntu booth.

24:15.440 --> 24:16.920
And of course, they talk about all kinds of things.

24:16.920 --> 24:22.640
But Noah had a chance to ask him specifically about challenging Android market share and

24:22.640 --> 24:23.840
iOS market share.

24:23.840 --> 24:29.260
And then also getting some of our classic favorite Linux apps on a converged desktop.

24:29.260 --> 24:30.260
So I'll play that.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.260
And here we go.

24:31.260 --> 24:43.560
What's your guess on Ubuntu or Canonical's ability to leverage market penetration in

24:43.560 --> 24:47.360
a very heavily populated iOS and Android world?

24:47.360 --> 24:51.640
Well, when Android came out, I watched the I was interested.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.520
I watched the press release.

24:53.520 --> 24:59.400
And 15 minutes later when when the pre-orders opened, I bought one and waited a month and

24:59.400 --> 25:00.400
got it.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.680
And there are about 30 apps available for Android when it first came out.

25:03.680 --> 25:10.600
And it was exciting because it was a Linux based phone that promised to be one one platform

25:10.600 --> 25:12.980
across many different model phones.

25:12.980 --> 25:15.060
And so I think it lived up to that.

25:15.060 --> 25:20.360
But unfortunately, Google develops Android in secret and they do release it, throw the

25:20.360 --> 25:22.680
code over the wall and that's it.

25:22.680 --> 25:24.600
You take it or leave it.

25:24.600 --> 25:28.520
Ubuntu, even on the phones developed, the exact same way Ubuntu is on the desktop, on

25:28.520 --> 25:30.280
the server, on the cloud.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.280
It's all done in the open.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.960
You know, people criticize, well, this is looking rough or that's not ready yet.

25:34.960 --> 25:39.360
But the thing is that, you know, Ubuntu cooked for three years before we even saw it.

25:39.360 --> 25:43.320
Whereas this was done in the open starting from the desktop images.

25:43.320 --> 25:48.640
And actually, Ubuntu on this phone is running 1504 or what will be 1504 in April.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.640
And it's the exact same system.

25:49.640 --> 25:54.180
But if I open the terminal, I have the user space, I have everything there.

25:54.180 --> 25:58.240
So when I want to develop an app for the phone, if I don't have a phone or, you know, sometimes

25:58.240 --> 26:02.760
this can be tricky, I can develop it on my Ubuntu desktop or laptop.

26:02.760 --> 26:03.760
I run the app.

26:03.760 --> 26:06.560
It comes up in a window with the right interface.

26:06.560 --> 26:09.400
If I make the window bigger, that's a tablet interface.

26:09.400 --> 26:13.920
I can also do a little work to make it work on the desktop if I want to.

26:13.920 --> 26:16.320
And that exact same code, I bring it to my phone.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.640
It's running the exact same code.

26:17.640 --> 26:18.960
I get the exact same experience.

26:18.960 --> 26:19.960
I can test it on the phone.

26:19.960 --> 26:20.960
I can package it.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.800
I can put it in the store.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.200
I can run the same program everywhere.

26:24.200 --> 26:29.640
So the development that I'm doing for the phone is identical to the development process

26:29.640 --> 26:32.440
on my desktop, on my laptop, the same thing I'm doing on the server.

26:32.440 --> 26:35.320
I get the same development story everywhere with Ubuntu.

26:35.320 --> 26:36.760
Now, how about going the other way?

26:36.760 --> 26:41.360
So for example, to the best of my knowledge, Thunderbird doesn't exist for Ubuntu Touch,

26:41.360 --> 26:42.360
right?

26:42.360 --> 26:46.160
So let's say I took the Ubuntu version of Thunderbird, is there a way I can put that

26:46.160 --> 26:47.160
on the phone?

26:47.160 --> 26:50.920
It would take a little bit of work, so we've done nothing to make that easy, but we've

26:50.920 --> 26:52.360
done nothing to restrict that.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.360
So...

26:53.360 --> 26:54.360
Oh, fair enough.

26:54.360 --> 26:59.540
So for example, about three weeks ago, Will Cook posted a picture of his Ubuntu phone

26:59.540 --> 27:04.840
running LibreOffice, which I believe is probably the worst possible way to experience LibreOffice.

27:04.840 --> 27:33.800
I'm going to pause right there now because he has more to say, but I don't want us to

27:33.800 --> 27:34.800
lose track.

27:34.800 --> 27:38.240
What you have to do is make a mobile interface.

27:38.240 --> 27:42.000
Now that is sort of like the biggest but ever.

27:42.000 --> 27:45.520
That's kind of like a one more thing that is this huge announcement, because if you

27:45.520 --> 27:51.960
think about all LibreOffice has to do is make a mobile interface, well, yeah, yeah, that's

27:51.960 --> 27:53.360
a huge challenge.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.760
That's like the hardest thing possible for them probably.

27:55.760 --> 27:59.800
So yeah, that doesn't mean it's necessarily easy, but he goes on to make the point that

27:59.800 --> 28:01.320
it's at least the same code base underneath.

28:01.320 --> 28:08.080
What you have to do is take your existing awesome Ubuntu app and optimize that for mobile.

28:08.080 --> 28:13.680
And the Ubuntu SDK makes it really easy to build a really beautiful responsive interface

28:13.680 --> 28:18.760
that spans from a phone to tablet to desktop without extra work.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.240
That really lowers the barrier of entry.

28:20.240 --> 28:25.680
So I think when developers begin developing for Ubuntu, they're going to find that it's

28:25.680 --> 28:30.400
as easy and pleasant to develop for the phone as it is on the desktop, because it's all

28:30.400 --> 28:31.400
Ubuntu.

28:31.400 --> 28:32.400
It's all one code base.

28:32.400 --> 28:36.920
That's pretty cool.

28:36.920 --> 28:41.560
And of course, you know, I keep watching on Google+, I see more and more apps in Popey's

28:41.560 --> 28:43.840
feed all the time, which look really cool.

28:43.840 --> 28:45.280
And they're a little optimistic, though.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.480
I mean, really, it's kind of, it's a little nonchalant to say all they have to do is make

28:48.480 --> 28:50.760
a mobile interface.

28:50.760 --> 28:54.600
It does feel like the, I don't want to say the buck's been passed, but it does feel like

28:54.600 --> 28:57.520
it's been dismissed a touch, just a little.

28:57.520 --> 28:58.520
Yeah.

28:58.520 --> 29:03.760
I actually have tried developing for Ubuntu Touch.

29:03.760 --> 29:12.120
And I have to say, well, yeah, there is a fairly big challenge with creating interfaces

29:12.120 --> 29:14.560
for existing applications.

29:14.560 --> 29:23.600
If you create a new application with Ubuntu Touch in mind, or even Ubuntu in general in

29:23.600 --> 29:32.560
mind and you use Ubuntu SDK for it, then moving between desktop and tablets and phones becomes

29:32.560 --> 29:42.120
very easy because their SDK actually, I was surprised how good of a job they did with

29:42.120 --> 29:45.880
helping developers create interfaces that scale automatically.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.760
I have that, by the way, linked in the show notes for today's episode.

29:48.760 --> 29:51.240
Although, of course, what did you just say?

29:51.240 --> 29:55.480
You just said it works great when you're writing applications for Ubuntu, right?

29:55.480 --> 29:57.960
I like applications written for Linux, but that's cool.

29:57.960 --> 29:59.960
I mean, I follow what you're saying.

29:59.960 --> 30:00.960
And I'm sure-

30:00.960 --> 30:04.760
There is no reason why you would not want to-

30:04.760 --> 30:05.760
Right.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.760
It would just look like butt.

30:06.760 --> 30:07.760
It would just look like butt.

30:07.760 --> 30:08.760
But I could run them somewhere else.

30:08.760 --> 30:09.760
Yeah, you could.

30:09.760 --> 30:10.760
I would know-

30:10.760 --> 30:15.240
There's no reason why you wouldn't be able to run it on other disk shows.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.240
Of course.

30:16.240 --> 30:17.240
It would just look like an Ubuntu.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.240
You just have to resolve that.

30:18.240 --> 30:19.240
Yeah.

30:19.240 --> 30:24.560
It's the same way if you run a material design application from Android somewhere else, it

30:24.560 --> 30:26.360
looks like an Android app.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.200
Yeah, I suppose so.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.200
Which is-

30:30.200 --> 30:31.200
I do have to say-

30:31.200 --> 30:32.200
Yeah.

30:32.200 --> 30:35.880
That ultimately, toolkits are adapting.

30:35.880 --> 30:40.480
If we look at the developments that are going to the toolkits are also contemplating these

30:40.480 --> 30:45.920
new devices, these people's will to actually port things.

30:45.920 --> 30:51.080
And we also need to acknowledge that once you move to a different platform, different

30:51.080 --> 30:54.760
device, not always you expect the same amount of functionality.

30:54.760 --> 31:00.800
Maybe you are just consuming, and maybe LibreOffice won't be so much as redesigning the interface,

31:00.800 --> 31:05.960
but actually hiding more elements and not make them accessible to the same context menu,

31:05.960 --> 31:06.960
for example.

31:06.960 --> 31:09.320
Because that's not the experience you're expecting.

31:09.320 --> 31:12.360
And that type of change is not as hard as actually going-

31:12.360 --> 31:13.360
I agree.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.360
Making a whole overhaul of the UI.

31:14.360 --> 31:15.360
Yes.

31:15.360 --> 31:19.400
But if you're going with the right set of expectations, it's not so bad.

31:19.400 --> 31:23.840
And Mike in the chat room is linking us to a video, which I'll try to remember to put

31:23.840 --> 31:26.760
in the show notes, of LibreOffice running on Ubuntu Touch.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.120
I'm just waiting for him to launch it right now.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.120
So there's Google Maps.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.120
Okay.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.120
We see that.

31:31.120 --> 31:32.120
I want to see LibreOffice though.

31:32.120 --> 31:33.120
There he goes.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.120
He's launching LibreOffice.

31:34.120 --> 31:39.800
So you can see if you have a tablet, it just runs in like an XMirror window, and it's usable.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.360
So I mean, of course, you would want to have a mouse and keyboard.

31:42.360 --> 31:47.360
But you know, to be honest with you, I would prefer to have the option of carrying a mouse

31:47.360 --> 31:52.080
and keyboard, like a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, with me in my bag, and be able to run LibreOffice

31:52.080 --> 31:53.080
when I need it.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.160
Like, for me, I like that.

31:55.160 --> 32:01.000
I don't mind that it's even actual LibreOffice, because I know if I'm going to launch LibreOffice,

32:01.000 --> 32:03.560
I know what to expect, and I'm going to bring a mouse and keyboard with me.

32:03.560 --> 32:05.040
So for me, I think it's good.

32:05.040 --> 32:07.660
I'm just saying for end users, they're going to look at that, and they'll- I mean, everybody

32:07.660 --> 32:09.360
ridiculed Microsoft.

32:09.360 --> 32:12.800
They ridiculed Microsoft when people got the Windows RT tablets and you dropped down to

32:12.800 --> 32:14.320
the classic shell.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.320
Ridiculed them for it.

32:15.320 --> 32:18.800
Even though I kind of think it could be handy if you have the right set of tools.

32:18.800 --> 32:19.800
So there you go.

32:19.800 --> 32:20.800
Yeah.

32:20.800 --> 32:25.080
Just a little update, and it's an interesting discussion, and who knows.

32:25.080 --> 32:27.240
I also wanted to mention Linux Fest Northwest.

32:27.240 --> 32:30.440
I know I'm getting obnoxious, but it's the end of April, 25th and the 26th.

32:30.440 --> 32:33.280
We're going to try to have as much of the crew there as possible, and have multiple

32:33.280 --> 32:36.360
shows going on, and go around and say hi to people.

32:36.360 --> 32:39.720
I got a little details this last Friday from the crew.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.880
There's going to be a new after party at a new location, Matt?

32:42.880 --> 32:43.880
Oh, really?

32:43.880 --> 32:44.880
Okay.

32:44.880 --> 32:46.760
A three-story hotel, as a matter of fact, I believe.

32:46.760 --> 32:49.760
Or not a hotel, a museum, sorry.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.360
And so it should be quite a hell of a show.

32:51.360 --> 32:56.080
And then Friday night, for people that fly in early, Fedora is sponsoring a board game

32:56.080 --> 32:57.400
night up in Bellingham.

32:57.400 --> 33:01.200
So if you're getting in Friday night, the night before the fest officially starts, there

33:01.200 --> 33:05.600
will be a Fedora-sponsored board game, I believe, at the Hampton, but you'll have to double

33:05.600 --> 33:06.600
check on that.

33:06.600 --> 33:07.600
I'll know soon.

33:07.600 --> 33:08.600
Okay.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.600
Yeah.

33:09.600 --> 33:10.600
Yeah, so you said a museum.

33:10.600 --> 33:11.600
Is that correct?

33:11.600 --> 33:14.080
I believe it is a museum, and I forget which one.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.080
Because I'm racking my brain.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.480
I think, when you said three stores, it's one that popped into my head instantly.

33:18.480 --> 33:19.480
I'm wondering if it's that one.

33:19.480 --> 33:20.480
Okay, cool.

33:20.480 --> 33:21.480
It's cool, because check this out.

33:21.480 --> 33:25.240
If you go over to linuxfestnorthwest.org, and you go scroll down to the best sponsors

33:25.240 --> 33:26.240
section, so you've got gold sponsors.

33:26.240 --> 33:28.280
Yeah, I'm sure gold sponsors are pretty important.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.280
I wouldn't know.

33:29.280 --> 33:30.280
Yeah.

33:30.280 --> 33:31.280
I don't care.

33:31.280 --> 33:32.960
I don't care about gold sponsors.

33:32.960 --> 33:33.960
Hold on.

33:33.960 --> 33:34.960
My touch thing's gone crazy, Matt.

33:34.960 --> 33:35.960
My touch thing's gone crazy.

33:35.960 --> 33:36.960
But when you go down here, look here.

33:36.960 --> 33:37.960
Oh, media.

33:37.960 --> 33:38.960
Jupiter Broadcasting.

33:38.960 --> 33:39.960
Boom.

33:39.960 --> 33:40.960
Right there.

33:40.960 --> 33:41.960
There it is.

33:41.960 --> 33:42.960
Friday night is Fedora.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.960
Saturday night, that party at the museum is actually being paid for by Microsoft.

33:44.960 --> 33:45.960
How about that?

33:45.960 --> 33:46.960
Wow.

33:46.960 --> 33:47.960
Yeah.

33:47.960 --> 33:48.960
Wow.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.960
I'm still reeling from last year, because they were downright civil, actually.

33:51.960 --> 33:53.520
I was just kind of like, okay.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.160
You know how expensive lanyards are?

33:55.160 --> 33:56.160
It's ridiculous.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.160
Yeah.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.160
It's ridiculous.

33:58.160 --> 34:01.040
Anyways, we're going to have lanyards at Linux Fest Northwest to give out.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.600
It's going to be pretty cool.

34:02.600 --> 34:05.960
So if you're going to make it, there is a hotel up in Bellingham, Washington that you'll

34:05.960 --> 34:07.880
probably want to stay at.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.600
They're going to have a special Linux Fest Northwest deal.

34:10.600 --> 34:14.480
And I think if it's not attached to the hotel, it's close to the hotel.

34:14.480 --> 34:18.960
And the best part is there's going to be a free shuttle between the hotel and the Linux

34:18.960 --> 34:21.280
Fest Northwest campus.

34:21.280 --> 34:23.140
So you'll want to stay at the Hampton Inn.

34:23.140 --> 34:24.960
That's where they'll have the free shuttle.

34:24.960 --> 34:28.120
And I believe Hampton Inn might even be at the Bellingham Airport if you can just fly

34:28.120 --> 34:29.120
in right there.

34:29.120 --> 34:30.680
And then you don't have to worry about transportation.

34:30.680 --> 34:34.960
And you can also call them and take advantage of the Linux Fest Northwest special Hampton

34:34.960 --> 34:35.960
Inn.

34:35.960 --> 34:38.200
So it's not at the airport, but it is a short drive from the airport.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.480
And they will pick you up from the airport if you call them.

34:40.480 --> 34:41.480
Perfect.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.480
Thank you, Blaster.

34:42.480 --> 34:43.480
Thank you.

34:43.480 --> 34:44.480
Is that where you stayed last year?

34:44.480 --> 34:45.480
Yes, it is.

34:45.480 --> 34:46.480
It's where I'm staying this year.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.480
Yeah.

34:47.480 --> 34:48.480
That's the one that the Fest guys also recommend you stay at.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.400
So you got to dial in over there, Blaster.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.400
Thank you, sir.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.400
Appreciate that info.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.680
And I'd love to see anybody in the audience there.

34:53.680 --> 34:54.980
It should be a great show.

34:54.980 --> 34:58.040
And if you can't make it, we are intending to live stream the hell out of it.

34:58.040 --> 35:01.840
So we'll probably be live Saturday and Sunday from there.

35:01.840 --> 35:02.840
So you can check it out.

35:02.840 --> 35:03.840
I think it should be an honor.

35:03.840 --> 35:04.840
It's one of the best.

35:04.840 --> 35:07.400
I think it's one of the best shows in the US if you can make it.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.400
All right.

35:08.400 --> 35:13.280
Before we get to our next topic, which possibly promises to be the perfect Linux laptop, but

35:13.280 --> 35:16.560
Chris is a little skeptical, I want to tell you about our next sponsor, and that's Digital

35:16.560 --> 35:17.560
Ocean.

35:17.560 --> 35:21.540
Digital Ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to making my data center dreams

35:21.540 --> 35:22.540
come true.

35:22.540 --> 35:23.540
No, I kid.

35:23.540 --> 35:25.840
No, they're really dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud

35:25.840 --> 35:26.840
server.

35:26.840 --> 35:27.840
Now, they are my data center.

35:27.840 --> 35:31.720
I mean, it's a no brainer why I can get started in less than 55 seconds and you can too.

35:31.720 --> 35:37.240
And pricing plans start only $5 a month that'll get you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte

35:37.240 --> 35:42.400
SSD, one CPU and a terabyte, a terabyte, a freaking terabyte, a terabyte of transfer.

35:42.400 --> 35:43.400
Terabyte.

35:43.400 --> 35:47.960
Listen, if you don't have a huge podcast, just go stick it up on a digital ocean droplet.

35:47.960 --> 35:49.600
It's cheaper than anything else for $5.

35:49.600 --> 35:53.600
I mean, I don't, I seriously starting out if I could have done that, it'd have been

35:53.600 --> 35:54.600
great.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.520
These days though, these days scale engines the way for me.

35:56.520 --> 36:01.360
I tell you what, but when I started out, I think I would have probably had my website

36:01.360 --> 36:07.280
on one droplet, my MP3 files on another droplet and like my forms on, I mean, why not at $5?

36:07.280 --> 36:11.200
You could honestly, you could load them all up on one droplet, but I, from a security

36:11.200 --> 36:15.720
standpoint and a maintenance standpoint and the value is just so insane that I just, I'll

36:15.720 --> 36:17.400
just spin up multiple droplets.

36:17.400 --> 36:20.600
So for me, I've got droplets dedicated to specific functionalities.

36:20.600 --> 36:25.240
Now, some of them do a bunch of other extra things too, they're not one job, but looking

36:25.240 --> 36:29.120
back now at how I've built infrastructures in the past, I've sort of been revising them

36:29.120 --> 36:32.760
in my head, like kind of daydreaming, if I was going to do that again, how would I do

36:32.760 --> 36:34.040
it on digital ocean?

36:34.040 --> 36:37.120
And I think podcast hosting is one of the first things I would, I would do on digital

36:37.120 --> 36:38.120
ocean.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.120
Of course, there's so many other things too.

36:39.120 --> 36:42.640
And of course they have one click installations for things like WordPress or Drupal or Ruby

36:42.640 --> 36:44.680
on Rails or GitLab too.

36:44.680 --> 36:49.000
And they have data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam

36:49.000 --> 36:50.440
and London.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.440
It's really though their interface.

36:51.440 --> 36:52.440
It's so great.

36:52.440 --> 36:55.680
They have a really intuitive control panel and power users can replicate it on a larger

36:55.680 --> 36:58.540
scale with the company's straightforward API.

36:58.540 --> 37:01.280
And it really is handy because there's a bunch of great apps you can take advantage of, or

37:01.280 --> 37:04.640
if you're a little savvy yourself, you don't have to be all that savvy, you can just put

37:04.640 --> 37:06.400
something together pretty quickly.

37:06.400 --> 37:10.380
But there's a lot of like, there's desktop apps, there's mobile apps, there's things

37:10.380 --> 37:15.680
to snap it in with existing projects, modules for programming languages.

37:15.680 --> 37:17.280
I mean, it's really well done.

37:17.280 --> 37:22.600
And then to sort of round it all off, they have a great, great set of always improving

37:22.600 --> 37:23.600
tutorials.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.400
They've also recently launched free BSD support.

37:25.400 --> 37:26.520
That's pretty cool too.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.920
So here's how you can get started.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.720
You get a $10 credit over at digital ocean.

37:29.720 --> 37:32.760
This is key because they've got a lot of great things you can try like CoreOS or the one

37:32.760 --> 37:36.800
click deployments or, you know, try out their snapshot system, which is really nice.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.880
I really like the way their snapshots work.

37:38.880 --> 37:39.880
Try it out.

37:39.880 --> 37:43.480
You can try it all out and you'll get a $10 credit when you use our promo code DOUNPLUGED.

37:43.480 --> 37:48.320
DOUNPLUGED, all one word, lowercase, just apply that to your account and then just try

37:48.320 --> 37:53.760
the $5 rig two months for free, get your own Linux rig, root access, you get HTML5 console.

37:53.760 --> 37:57.400
And if you've played around with VMs and you've never really gone off and set off your own

37:57.400 --> 38:01.040
offsite backup server or something like that, just do it this route.

38:01.040 --> 38:04.320
This is so much better and it's so fast and the value is incredible.

38:04.320 --> 38:05.320
You'll really have a good time.

38:05.320 --> 38:07.320
DigitalOcean.com, promo code DOUNPLUGED.

38:07.320 --> 38:10.160
Matt, I'm a bit of a hardware head.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.760
I mean, I'm pretty solid on laptops right now.

38:12.760 --> 38:17.800
I've got the Librem coming eventually and I got the XPS 13 because I think if you're

38:17.800 --> 38:23.920
going to get a non-System 76 laptop, like if you want sort of like the MacBook Air kind

38:23.920 --> 38:30.760
of competitor with the super high resolution, like 4K screen, I think the XPS 13 is a serious

38:30.760 --> 38:33.340
contender and I think a lot of people will be looking at it to load Linux.

38:33.340 --> 38:35.360
That's why I picked it up so I could try it out.

38:35.360 --> 38:38.760
And Dell has since then released another workstation.

38:38.760 --> 38:40.640
They call it part of their Sputnik project.

38:40.640 --> 38:46.800
It's the M3800 developer edition and it's kind of like a MacBook Pro competitor.

38:46.800 --> 38:50.040
And I think Ars Technica has the review to read on this.

38:50.040 --> 38:53.980
They really have a great write-up and they talk about some of the issues that I've ran

38:53.980 --> 38:54.980
into.

38:54.980 --> 38:58.760
So I wanted to commiserate a little bit about my continued search for like my quote-unquote

38:58.760 --> 39:02.420
perfect Linux laptop and then I kind of wanted to take some opinions from you guys too.

39:02.420 --> 39:05.780
But first, let's start on a little bit of the review here.

39:05.780 --> 39:12.020
So to begin with, the price, about $1,500 at base, the one they tested at Ars, a little

39:12.020 --> 39:14.480
over $2,000.

39:14.480 --> 39:19.200
And again, it's the M3800, ships with Ubuntu 14.04.

39:19.200 --> 39:24.060
It has a high-quality build, no squeaks, no rattles, 16 gigabytes of RAM.

39:24.060 --> 39:28.600
He got it with a 256-gigabyte SSD and i7 CPU.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.800
Display is bright, beautiful.

39:30.800 --> 39:34.720
Thunderbolt port on it though, doesn't really work well with Ubuntu except for video.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.120
I ran into that same issue.

39:37.120 --> 39:41.320
Applications are not really ready for high DPI, like Chrome, and it ships with Chrome

39:41.320 --> 39:42.320
as default.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.320
It just does not look good in high DPI.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.560
That is a continued problem I have too.

39:45.560 --> 39:48.620
Opera, much better.

39:48.620 --> 39:55.800
And it has a few other things like battery life when the NVIDIA GPU is devastating.

39:55.800 --> 39:59.560
When I got my XPS 13, Dell quoted me 15 hours of battery life.

39:59.560 --> 40:03.320
And I've even heard some podcasters going, well, look at Dell's new laptops with 15 hours.

40:03.320 --> 40:04.320
Yeah, BS.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.760
I'm getting seven hours, eight hours tops.

40:06.760 --> 40:07.760
Perfectly fine.

40:07.760 --> 40:08.760
I don't really mind.

40:08.760 --> 40:10.120
But it's no 15 hours.

40:10.120 --> 40:12.920
So I wasn't surprised that he dinged that for the review.

40:12.920 --> 40:13.920
But I was looking at this thing.

40:13.920 --> 40:14.920
It's big.

40:14.920 --> 40:15.920
It's 15 inches.

40:15.920 --> 40:18.960
And I'm trying to think to myself, what makes the perfect Linux laptop?

40:18.960 --> 40:21.800
And this is something I've searched for, and searched for, and searched for.

40:21.800 --> 40:23.680
Colonel Linux, I don't know if you're still in.

40:23.680 --> 40:24.680
Did you leave?

40:24.680 --> 40:29.520
Because I know he's, yeah, because he's just recently got a new laptop too, but he vacated.

40:29.520 --> 40:34.440
And it's something that when I searched for, I'm pretty happy with the XPS 13.

40:34.440 --> 40:40.040
But the biggest downside for me is Linux's high DPI support is still pretty sucky, unfortunately.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.040
Yeah.

40:41.040 --> 40:43.840
Matt, for you, are you a laptop guy at all?

40:43.840 --> 40:45.640
Yeah, I had one.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.400
It's long since left the building.

40:47.400 --> 40:51.300
But for me, it was basically a matter of, I don't like the glossy screen.

40:51.300 --> 40:52.800
I want it to be matted.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.600
That's just for my own eyes.

40:54.600 --> 40:57.800
Does it manage to handle a wireless end connection?

40:57.800 --> 40:58.800
Cool.

40:58.800 --> 41:05.040
It's the battery life at minimum of three hours, preferably more, if it is, great.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.800
And then, of course, just the keyboard not spongy.

41:06.800 --> 41:07.800
That's another thing.

41:07.800 --> 41:08.800
I can't stand that.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.800
Right.

41:09.800 --> 41:10.800
You know?

41:10.800 --> 41:11.800
Yeah.

41:11.800 --> 41:12.800
And then touchpad sensitivity.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.280
Can I, what are my options as far as disabling it?

41:14.280 --> 41:19.000
I know a couple of hacks that I can use to disable a touchpad while typing, but a lot

41:19.000 --> 41:23.200
of times you can actually get a touchpad that will work correctly when you set it to turn

41:23.200 --> 41:24.200
off.

41:24.200 --> 41:30.200
I noticed, too, that Dell, so the XPS 13 I got came with a Broadcom Dell proprietary

41:30.200 --> 41:34.880
Linux not very happy loving kind of wireless driver, or wireless card, and I swapped it

41:34.880 --> 41:41.160
out with an Intel 7000 series, which is the same one they ship, yeah, the AC7260, which

41:41.160 --> 41:43.840
is the same one that Dell's put in this laptop.

41:43.840 --> 41:48.520
So I would imagine that would avoid the out of the box wireless issue, which was my primary

41:48.520 --> 41:51.680
issue when I tried my XPS 13 is my wireless didn't work out of the box.

41:51.680 --> 41:54.160
I don't think this is a particularly good looking laptop either.

41:54.160 --> 41:56.000
Unfortunately I think Dell kind of has a bit of a miss here.

41:56.000 --> 42:01.960
I think the XPS 13 is a lot more competitive than this, but you know.

42:01.960 --> 42:02.960
Could be.

42:02.960 --> 42:03.960
It really could be.

42:03.960 --> 42:04.960
Look at that.

42:04.960 --> 42:05.960
And it still has the Windows sticker on the bottom, Matt.

42:05.960 --> 42:11.640
Well, I mean, I go back to, I mean, actually years before I even was a part of Jupiter

42:11.640 --> 42:15.500
Broadcasting years ago when I first came to System76, what brought me to it was after

42:15.500 --> 42:21.320
a interesting Dell experience and dating back to when I went and actually bought the laptop

42:21.320 --> 42:23.000
from them, which they promptly lost.

42:23.000 --> 42:27.520
But when I bought the laptop from them, they were still recommending Office and various

42:27.520 --> 42:32.480
Windows software after I designated, I mean, it's just like, really?

42:32.480 --> 42:33.840
It's like, I mean, come on guys.

42:33.840 --> 42:37.560
So you know, for me, it's just like, eh, you know, they could, they could come out with

42:37.560 --> 42:38.960
the coolest thing in the world.

42:38.960 --> 42:41.480
Honestly, I, I, I've been burned by them so badly.

42:41.480 --> 42:42.480
I don't know.

42:42.480 --> 42:43.720
I'd have a real hard time with it.

42:43.720 --> 42:47.400
I, Wimpy, I'm curious, what makes your perfect Linux laptop?

42:47.400 --> 42:51.760
What is it for you that makes a good machine that specifically to run Linux?

42:51.760 --> 42:59.480
Uh, well, there's a couple of things, um, I like lightweight, so not, not very big.

42:59.480 --> 43:01.240
And I like a proper keyboard.

43:01.240 --> 43:06.440
So, um, and I've got a ponch on for the old, um, track point nipple.

43:06.440 --> 43:07.440
Right.

43:07.440 --> 43:08.440
Yeah.

43:08.440 --> 43:09.440
Yeah.

43:09.440 --> 43:16.920
So mostly I buy, um, relatively old secondhand ThinkPads.

43:16.920 --> 43:23.560
So my newest computer to me is a ThinkPad X201, which I think is about five years old.

43:23.560 --> 43:28.600
Uh, and that's quite good for me cause it's an i5 and everything.

43:28.600 --> 43:31.800
And um, battery life is important too.

43:31.800 --> 43:34.200
And the ThinkPads are good in that regard.

43:34.200 --> 43:41.680
And if you pair, pair your Linux machine with, um, TLP, um, you can, you can probably get

43:41.680 --> 43:42.680
in some cases.

43:42.680 --> 43:43.680
Go on.

43:43.680 --> 43:49.240
Well, so what you're telling me is essentially, uh, what makes the perfect Linux laptop is

43:49.240 --> 43:52.800
a Lenovo, but what do you do if say Lenovo starts making you unhappy?

43:52.800 --> 43:53.800
Where do you go?

43:53.800 --> 43:56.280
Like, are all your eggs in one basket?

43:56.280 --> 44:02.480
Uh, well, they, they've suited me so far, but no, I mean, companies like System76 would

44:02.480 --> 44:05.240
be where I would have to go for a new machine.

44:05.240 --> 44:11.840
Um, the problem is, is that I can't afford the, you know, the upfront price for a new

44:11.840 --> 44:13.960
machine from those companies.

44:13.960 --> 44:19.720
So if I needed a new computer, I'd have to save for some considerable time before I could

44:19.720 --> 44:20.720
afford one.

44:20.720 --> 44:22.400
But you know, there are places I could go.

44:22.400 --> 44:23.400
Mm hmm.

44:23.400 --> 44:24.400
Mm hmm.

44:24.400 --> 44:26.760
Uh, so the screenshot I'm showing here from Mars Technica kind of shows you how the web

44:26.760 --> 44:29.640
renders on the Chromium browser on a high DBI display.

44:29.640 --> 44:30.640
It's tiny.

44:30.640 --> 44:35.360
It looks good and Unity itself does a good job of scaling up and other GTK applications

44:35.360 --> 44:38.640
will do a good job of scaling up, but yeah, it's kind of hit and miss.

44:38.640 --> 44:42.440
I feel, I feel like if I was, if somebody came to me and said, I don't have a lot of

44:42.440 --> 44:47.080
money to spend, uh, but I really want a high resolution display, I would say at this point,

44:47.080 --> 44:53.000
if you're tight on money, don't get a 4k display because a lot of stuff looks fine, but a lot

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
of stuff doesn't look fine.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.580
And if you are powering that with an Intel GPU, there are times that will work harder

44:57.580 --> 44:58.580
than you want it to.

44:58.580 --> 45:01.920
If you have a dedicated Nvidia graphics like this thing does, it's not so bad.

45:01.920 --> 45:06.200
Uh, but then like they, but they notice when they turn that Nvidia GPU on battery life goes

45:06.200 --> 45:08.800
in half, half.

45:08.800 --> 45:09.800
Oh, I believe it.

45:09.800 --> 45:13.320
I'm not surprised by that at all, but you know, at the same time, it's like when it

45:13.320 --> 45:16.840
comes to laptops or even desktops, to a certain extent, if you're someone that needs that,

45:16.840 --> 45:21.240
you know, needs that, uh, you know, kind of quality, that's gotta be a larger consideration

45:21.240 --> 45:22.240
in your overall experience.

45:22.240 --> 45:26.840
But I think for Joe average, honestly, I think a decent keyboard, a decent battery and a,

45:26.840 --> 45:30.560
and a display that is reasonably good and of course not being, not weighing a ton.

45:30.560 --> 45:32.560
I think that's really what it comes down to most people.

45:32.560 --> 45:40.120
I am, uh, waiting, uh, I am waiting to hear, uh, updates on the, uh, the, uh, Purism, uh,

45:40.120 --> 45:41.120
Librem 15.

45:41.120 --> 45:43.800
Uh, I, we now have the, uh, the boot screen.

45:43.800 --> 45:45.800
I guess that's going to be the boots, uh, the boot screen right there.

45:45.800 --> 45:50.880
There's just this nice white Purism, uh, logo, uh, so I, you know, it reached its funding

45:50.880 --> 45:53.200
and they're still posting updates about the project.

45:53.200 --> 45:57.440
And I think Noah's been checking in, checking in with them from time to time as well.

45:57.440 --> 46:03.280
So, uh, it looks like when that ships, it's going to have an i7 in June.

46:03.280 --> 46:06.980
The one will ship in April, one will ship in June and it's going to be pretty nice rig.

46:06.980 --> 46:08.120
So hopefully we'll see.

46:08.120 --> 46:11.440
I don't know if it's going to be the perfect Linux laptop, but the quest to find the perfect

46:11.440 --> 46:14.920
Linux laptop, in my opinion, continues on.

46:14.920 --> 46:17.360
So there's actually one thing that I don't know.

46:17.360 --> 46:23.680
I really, I noticed that in the text on their campaign mentions an integrated, uh, Intel

46:23.680 --> 46:27.960
car video card and in the video, they talk about the Nvidia one.

46:27.960 --> 46:29.520
I don't know what's going on with that.

46:29.520 --> 46:30.520
Are you talking about the Libra?

46:30.520 --> 46:31.520
Yes.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.520
The Purism.

46:32.520 --> 46:33.520
Yeah.

46:33.520 --> 46:34.520
Yeah.

46:34.520 --> 46:35.520
It's going to have both.

46:35.520 --> 46:36.520
Yeah.

46:36.520 --> 46:40.160
It's going to have both because it's like in the text, it only says the Intel one.

46:40.160 --> 46:41.160
Right.

46:41.160 --> 46:43.680
I think, I think in our interview, I think in our interview with him, he said it would

46:43.680 --> 46:48.800
have both if I recall correctly, because I tried to clarify that point.

46:48.800 --> 46:49.800
If I recall.

46:49.800 --> 46:50.800
Okay.

46:50.800 --> 46:51.800
Yeah.

46:51.800 --> 46:57.920
Because it does look, it does look weird because for me, I was like, I was rechecking it and

46:57.920 --> 47:02.080
then the text only mentions one of the cars, then in the video mentions the Nvidia.

47:02.080 --> 47:04.080
It feels a little bit sketchy.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.080
Yeah.

47:05.080 --> 47:06.080
Yeah.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.080
I don't know.

47:07.080 --> 47:08.080
Yeah.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.440
Uh, if somebody was, if you, if you want to, if you want to, you could check, you could,

47:09.440 --> 47:11.080
I think it is in that interview.

47:11.080 --> 47:12.080
Uh, yeah.

47:12.080 --> 47:13.080
All right.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.080
I'll rewatch it.

47:14.080 --> 47:17.400
I'm, I'm looking forward to, I hope mine's in the April batch, even if it, even if it

47:17.400 --> 47:21.320
doesn't mean, cause I really want to give it a review and, and, uh, I don't know, I still

47:21.320 --> 47:25.200
feel like the quest continues on the quest continues, just like the quest continues on

47:25.200 --> 47:26.200
to always better yourself.

47:26.200 --> 47:27.200
Doesn't it?

47:27.200 --> 47:28.640
And that's why our next sponsor is so perfect.

47:28.640 --> 47:29.640
That's Linux Academy.

47:29.640 --> 47:33.640
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash Linux.

47:33.640 --> 47:37.800
I believe that as our year old, no, I'm sorry, it's unplugged linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

47:37.800 --> 47:38.800
You'd think I would know.

47:38.800 --> 47:42.440
Uh, the reason why I was a little distracted is I have the coolest note here that I wanted

47:42.440 --> 47:47.480
to read, uh, from, uh, a, uh, Linux unplugged audience member who heard about Linux Academy.

47:47.480 --> 47:50.960
So get started, keep this in mind, linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

47:50.960 --> 47:51.960
Go there to get started.

47:51.960 --> 47:55.160
You'll get our special 33% discount, which is really awesome.

47:55.160 --> 47:59.400
Uh, and Linux Academy is a great resource for you to learn more about the systems you're

47:59.400 --> 48:03.920
probably going to end up having to use, administer, be responsible for, or want to someday.

48:03.920 --> 48:05.680
Linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

48:05.680 --> 48:06.680
Go get started over there.

48:06.680 --> 48:07.960
I got an email in from Mike.

48:07.960 --> 48:11.360
He says, I just want to say thanks to the whole Jupiter broadcasting community.

48:11.360 --> 48:14.760
I wouldn't have known about Linux Academy if it wasn't for you guys.

48:14.760 --> 48:19.280
I was able to get my Linux plus certification and land my dream job as a Linux administrator

48:19.280 --> 48:21.000
for a hosting company.

48:21.000 --> 48:24.320
I went over to Linux Academy forums to thank them too and made sure they heard about it

48:24.320 --> 48:25.320
from you guys.

48:25.320 --> 48:27.040
They knew it was from you guys.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.220
Thanks again, Mike.

48:28.220 --> 48:30.160
And I get stories like that all the time.

48:30.160 --> 48:33.560
Linux Academy is set up by people who truly care about this stuff and really know the

48:33.560 --> 48:34.560
subject material.

48:34.560 --> 48:36.240
And so they devoted their entire site to it.

48:36.240 --> 48:39.280
They hyper focus in on this area and so that way they super serve you.

48:39.280 --> 48:40.620
You know why that makes the difference.

48:40.620 --> 48:43.700
If you're a Linux enthusiast, you know how much it makes a difference when the people

48:43.700 --> 48:46.200
behind it care and use Linux and open source.

48:46.200 --> 48:50.160
They have step-by-step video courses, downloadable comprehensive study guides, and it's never

48:50.160 --> 48:54.280
been a better time to join Linux Academy because they have a huge announcement coming very

48:54.280 --> 48:55.280
soon.

48:55.280 --> 49:00.560
On April 16th, they're going to have a live show at 9 PM central time where they're going

49:00.560 --> 49:03.480
to make some of their biggest content announcements ever over there.

49:03.480 --> 49:05.240
You're going to want to go check that out.

49:05.240 --> 49:09.640
Also, they've got some great news if you're going in for one of the LPI, like the LPIC

49:09.640 --> 49:12.440
one exam or Linux plus.

49:12.440 --> 49:16.640
They are now CompTIA approved quality content, which means you can go take the study lessons

49:16.640 --> 49:20.040
from Linux Academy and then just go get your certification.

49:20.040 --> 49:21.720
You can do this from the comfort of your own home.

49:21.720 --> 49:25.480
What's really nice about that is Linux Academy will just let you get all that material offline.

49:25.480 --> 49:28.040
You can listen to the courseware like when you're commuting.

49:28.040 --> 49:31.460
You can set how much availability you have and it will automatically create courseware

49:31.460 --> 49:32.940
for you that matches that.

49:32.940 --> 49:34.480
You can get step-by-step.

49:34.480 --> 49:35.480
This is where you're at percentage-wise.

49:35.480 --> 49:37.280
You can see I have this much time for this area.

49:37.280 --> 49:40.360
Then it's going to take me this long to move on to here and you can do quizzes to check

49:40.360 --> 49:41.360
yourself.

49:41.360 --> 49:44.520
There are seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from and the courseware all

49:44.520 --> 49:45.520
matches that.

49:45.520 --> 49:46.520
So does the virtual labs.

49:46.520 --> 49:47.520
They spin up automatically.

49:47.520 --> 49:52.200
It's just such a cool system and you're really going to be impressed with the stuff they

49:52.200 --> 49:53.520
announced on the 16th.

49:53.520 --> 49:54.520
Go to linuxacademy.com.

49:54.520 --> 49:58.120
Get our special 33% discount and go check them out.

49:58.120 --> 49:59.120
It's a great time.

49:59.120 --> 50:04.120
I love that you're going to get that 33% discount right now when they're just about to make

50:04.120 --> 50:05.120
the service even better.

50:05.120 --> 50:07.040
It's just such a cool opportunity.

50:07.040 --> 50:08.040
Linuxacademy.com.

50:08.040 --> 50:16.920
Something really nerdy happened this week and too bad Alan missed his opportunity to

50:16.920 --> 50:20.320
bash ButterFS and sing the praises of ZFS.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.320
Aw shame.

50:21.320 --> 50:23.240
Too bad he had to leave early.

50:23.240 --> 50:27.220
Well there was actually a pretty big developers conference going on talking about the future

50:27.220 --> 50:28.220
of Linux storage.

50:28.220 --> 50:29.220
Oh I know.

50:29.220 --> 50:30.800
So exciting right?

50:30.800 --> 50:36.560
Well it turns out maybe things are going to look up for good old ButterFS.

50:36.560 --> 50:39.840
So let's dive in right into that because I think that's the piece that's the most relevant

50:39.840 --> 50:43.400
to our audience because we all want to see ButterFS succeed but we all know it's got

50:43.400 --> 50:44.640
a little bit of room.

50:44.640 --> 50:47.480
So Chris Mason, he's a Facebook software engineer.

50:47.480 --> 50:49.040
We've talked about him before.

50:49.040 --> 50:51.800
He's one of the ButterFS maintainers.

50:51.800 --> 50:54.960
He explained how Facebook uses ButterFS.

50:54.960 --> 50:58.220
ButterFS has many advantages of file systems such as the ability to handle both numerous

50:58.220 --> 51:03.600
small files and single files as large as six exabytes, a baked in RAID, built in file system

51:03.600 --> 51:06.980
compression and integrated multi-storage device support.

51:06.980 --> 51:11.040
Facebook of course runs on Linux.

51:11.040 --> 51:15.640
To be exact Facebook runs the 3.10 and 3.18 Linux kernels on an internal distribution

51:15.640 --> 51:17.440
which is based on CentOS.

51:17.440 --> 51:22.420
For Facebook the real win is that ButterFS is stable and fast under an endless input

51:22.420 --> 51:27.080
output operation per second, you know IOPS, pounding from Facebook's constantly updating

51:27.080 --> 51:28.160
users.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.160
That's good news.

51:29.160 --> 51:33.560
The bad news is ButterFS is still way too slow for traditional databases such as Maya

51:33.560 --> 51:34.560
SQL.

51:34.560 --> 51:39.440
For those systems Facebook is still using XFS, which I thought that was kind of interesting.

51:39.440 --> 51:43.460
To coordinate the two file systems Facebook uses Gluster, the open source distributed

51:43.460 --> 51:45.000
file system.

51:45.000 --> 51:47.040
This is all kind of some good details we're getting here.

51:47.040 --> 51:51.920
Facebook which works hand in glove with upstream ButterFS Linux kernel developers is working

51:51.920 --> 51:55.600
on improving ButterFS's database speed.

51:55.600 --> 51:57.400
Kind of neat.

51:57.400 --> 51:58.400
That is interesting.

51:58.400 --> 52:01.000
It's like it's one of those things to where, you know, I think a lot of people go to these

52:01.000 --> 52:04.400
social sites and they just see everything, well, if it's Facebook, you know, whether

52:04.400 --> 52:07.400
it works or not is kind of hit and miss, but most social sites work pretty well for the

52:07.400 --> 52:08.400
most part.

52:08.400 --> 52:11.980
And it's interesting to see what they're choosing and, you know, how that's going forward and

52:11.980 --> 52:14.600
where ButterFS fits into the whole thing.

52:14.600 --> 52:17.520
It's going to be fascinating to see where things go two, three years from now.

52:17.520 --> 52:25.560
It gives me, you know, I'm not a big fan of Facebook, but I'm kind of glad that they have

52:25.560 --> 52:27.960
a bit of their horse hitched to that wagon.

52:27.960 --> 52:30.200
Is that the right, am I using that right?

52:30.200 --> 52:35.040
I think so, but I would definitely agree that it's not like attending the Federation Council

52:35.040 --> 52:36.320
or something when you go to Facebook.

52:36.320 --> 52:39.680
It's pretty, the culture is definitely a little different.

52:39.680 --> 52:42.920
The fact that, so the way that Facebook is approaching this is they seem to have identified

52:42.920 --> 52:45.760
ButterFS as a critical piece of Linux technology.

52:45.760 --> 52:50.120
So they hire one of the guys that works on it and that's his job and he interfaces directly

52:50.120 --> 52:53.840
with the Linux kernel team and it's a pretty ideal situation.

52:53.840 --> 52:58.280
So it seems like it's pretty important to them and in that case that means ButterFS

52:58.280 --> 53:02.360
probably has a pretty good shot of having long-term funding and longevity of development

53:02.360 --> 53:04.920
behind it, which I think is pretty important.

53:04.920 --> 53:06.160
I think it's extremely important.

53:06.160 --> 53:07.160
Yeah.

53:07.160 --> 53:09.600
Derek Dublin, you had a point about their upstream give back?

53:09.600 --> 53:10.600
Yeah.

53:10.600 --> 53:16.820
They've actually been very keen on trying to get things to the open source community

53:16.820 --> 53:19.080
back like as fast as possible.

53:19.080 --> 53:23.200
I can give you the example of HHVM and their programming language.

53:23.200 --> 53:29.360
They actually went immediately to the Debian folks and opened an ITP, which is intended

53:29.360 --> 53:35.460
to package requests and they've been working directly with Debian maintainers to get that

53:35.460 --> 53:37.840
across and spread through there.

53:37.840 --> 53:45.240
It's like they hired doing an effort and most of the times I see an actual, you know, just

53:45.240 --> 53:48.360
not put the project out and not maintain it.

53:48.360 --> 53:54.440
They actually continuously support the project and do an effort to make it lend to the community

53:54.440 --> 53:55.840
back as soon as possible.

53:55.840 --> 53:58.600
I think that's a good part of that.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.560
That is really cool to hear actually.

54:00.560 --> 54:01.560
That's good to know.

54:01.560 --> 54:09.440
Before we wrap up, has anybody else noticed all the attention the Ubuntu Mate project

54:09.440 --> 54:10.440
gets these days?

54:10.440 --> 54:11.440
Oh yeah.

54:11.440 --> 54:12.440
Yes.

54:12.440 --> 54:14.240
Have you been noticing this?

54:14.240 --> 54:20.320
Oh, so Wimpy makes a video about including Tilda or something like that.

54:20.320 --> 54:24.840
Wimpy announces that Ubuntu Mate 1504 will have Tilda, a very nice drop-down menu and

54:24.840 --> 54:28.000
Wimpy made a very great video that sort of explains the rationale of how he came to use

54:28.000 --> 54:31.320
it and why, which maybe we can repeat here in just a sec.

54:31.320 --> 54:35.920
But next thing I know, I'm seeing it on three or four or five Linux news websites.

54:35.920 --> 54:39.080
Wimpy, you have a bit of a sensation on your hands here.

54:39.080 --> 54:40.080
Yeah.

54:40.080 --> 54:41.080
How did that happen?

54:41.080 --> 54:42.080
I don't know.

54:42.080 --> 54:43.480
I think it's great.

54:43.480 --> 54:45.600
So tell us about Tilda.

54:45.600 --> 54:49.640
Yeah, everyone's really keen on such a simple feature.

54:49.640 --> 54:52.520
I was very surprised by it.

54:52.520 --> 54:57.560
You know what, I've heard you mention it before, but I liked your rationale and how you came

54:57.560 --> 54:59.760
to use it and why it's sticking in the distro.

54:59.760 --> 55:00.760
Yeah.

55:00.760 --> 55:08.840
So when I was working on the Compiz integration and I kept breaking Compiz, you're left without

55:08.840 --> 55:12.440
window decorators, so you're kind of stuffed.

55:12.440 --> 55:20.440
So I installed Tilda as my get out jail free card, so every time I broke Compiz, I could

55:20.440 --> 55:27.360
just F12, reset Compiz, start Marco and get my session back up and running again.

55:27.360 --> 55:33.840
So whilst I was dev-ing Compiz, that was my safety net and I got so accustomed to using

55:33.840 --> 55:37.000
it, I started using it for other things and I thought, you know what, this is actually

55:37.000 --> 55:40.200
kind of useful, so I'm going to leave it in.

55:40.200 --> 55:42.840
That's how it came to be in the distro.

55:42.840 --> 55:47.680
And so why Tilda over, say, like Guake, because Guake's always what I use.

55:47.680 --> 55:48.680
Yeah.

55:48.680 --> 55:54.760
Well, I tried both, but Tilda runs in about five megs of RAM and Guake runs in about 25

55:54.760 --> 56:00.300
to 30 megs of RAM, so if I want something that I'm leaving in that's turned on by default,

56:00.300 --> 56:05.640
I don't want it to be too large because most, well I'll say most, there's a good number

56:05.640 --> 56:10.720
of people running Ubuntu Mate on resource constrained hardware so I didn't want to bloat

56:10.720 --> 56:11.720
it out unnecessarily.

56:11.720 --> 56:12.720
Of course.

56:12.720 --> 56:14.080
They really appreciate that, I'm sure.

56:14.080 --> 56:20.960
You know, I think what it is is, and this is what I have ragged on Canonical for taking

56:20.960 --> 56:26.420
a little focus off the desktop for the last couple of years, is what I believe and what

56:26.420 --> 56:31.840
you're doing with Ubuntu Mate may be proving this out, is the Ubuntu desktop got really

56:31.840 --> 56:36.940
close, really close to the goal line, and what you're doing by like adding things like

56:36.940 --> 56:44.560
sensible compass integration, the Tilda integration, but also like the folder color stuff.

56:44.560 --> 56:49.740
Just these little, it's not the final 10%, that's not the right way to put it, but these

56:49.740 --> 56:54.200
closing the gaps that adds these little things like, when I saw you and started including

56:54.200 --> 56:57.560
folder color, I thought, you know what, I should probably install folder color, I want

56:57.560 --> 57:01.060
folder color, like that sounds like something I would, just a nice little visual indicator.

57:01.060 --> 57:04.440
And it's these little things that you're just sort of polishing off and adding a little

57:04.440 --> 57:08.960
bit here and there to this traditional desktop paradigm, and I think people are recognizing

57:08.960 --> 57:09.960
that.

57:09.960 --> 57:14.240
Plus, let's be honest, Ubuntu 14.04 and Ubuntu 14.10 are decent platforms for people to distribute

57:14.240 --> 57:16.240
applications on, so there's some excitement there.

57:16.240 --> 57:20.080
And you guys are polishing off these little edges here and adding these nice little touches.

57:20.080 --> 57:22.400
I think that's why people are getting excited about it.

57:22.400 --> 57:24.680
Well, thank you very much.

57:24.680 --> 57:28.600
And whilst you've mentioned folder color, the developer of folder color has been working

57:28.600 --> 57:37.880
on a new version, which now supports Numix icon themes, and also has a facility where

57:37.880 --> 57:43.200
if you want to change the default color for all of your icons, so effectively theme your

57:43.200 --> 57:45.840
icons, you can now do that as well.

57:45.840 --> 57:49.540
So whether or not that lands for 15.04, we'll have to see.

57:49.540 --> 57:54.520
There's a feature freeze exception filed for that, but hopefully that'll make it in time.

57:54.520 --> 57:56.320
If not, it'll be in 15.10.

57:56.320 --> 57:57.320
Cool.

57:57.320 --> 58:02.360
And something I've been following is the... I know you have a lot of places you distribute

58:02.360 --> 58:03.360
info.

58:03.360 --> 58:07.500
Maybe this isn't even the best one, but one I've been following is the Google Plus community.

58:07.500 --> 58:10.760
So I'll put a link to that in the show notes.

58:10.760 --> 58:15.320
Everything somehow makes it to the Google Plus, so yeah, that's probably the best place

58:15.320 --> 58:16.320
to follow.

58:16.320 --> 58:22.560
And if not there, then the actual Ubuntu Marte community where there's some deeper discussion

58:22.560 --> 58:27.200
with some of the community members that if you want to get the skinny on the Raspberry

58:27.200 --> 58:34.760
Pi 2 development and the Odroid C1 development, that's all happening in the Ubuntu Marte community.

58:34.760 --> 58:35.760
Very good.

58:35.760 --> 58:36.760
And you know what?

58:36.760 --> 58:37.760
I actually had an email in about that.

58:37.760 --> 58:38.760
So thank you.

58:38.760 --> 58:39.760
So that's a good place to go to.

58:39.760 --> 58:40.760
Yeah.

58:40.760 --> 58:49.600
You know, I've been running the version of Ubuntu Marte based on 14.04 here as my Skype

58:49.600 --> 58:54.240
and Mama machine now for weeks, and it's just been rock solid.

58:54.240 --> 58:55.240
So I love it.

58:55.240 --> 58:57.120
I think it's a great... I think it's a great distro.

58:57.120 --> 59:02.380
Well, it's been... I'll tell you, it's been... the more I use it, the more I become married

59:02.380 --> 59:03.380
to it.

59:03.380 --> 59:07.700
I just... it's because I'm finding that I'm not having to screw with the stuff I was having

59:07.700 --> 59:08.700
to screw with before with other distributions.

59:08.700 --> 59:09.700
Yeah.

59:09.700 --> 59:10.700
You're just using the computer now.

59:10.700 --> 59:11.700
Yeah.

59:11.700 --> 59:12.700
Crazy thought, right?

59:12.700 --> 59:13.700
I could actually get my work done.

59:13.700 --> 59:17.460
And like what he mentioned with Tilda, I actually installed it after he mentioned it the first

59:17.460 --> 59:19.560
time before I even... I was just like, oh, this is sweet.

59:19.560 --> 59:20.560
Yeah.

59:20.560 --> 59:22.000
I got a low resource machine.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.000
This is fantastic.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.000
Yeah.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.000
Yeah.

59:25.000 --> 59:26.000
I thought it was pretty good.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
All right.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.360
Well, so we'll wrap it up there.

59:28.360 --> 59:30.720
And I have so much more I could talk about in regards to watches.

59:30.720 --> 59:34.280
I feel like I could talk about watches for some reason for like a whole episode, but

59:34.280 --> 59:38.120
I'm saving all of you the burden of having to listen to me go on and on about my Pebble

59:38.120 --> 59:39.120
Watch.

59:39.120 --> 59:44.080
However, I will mention I installed a couple of really cool apps.

59:44.080 --> 59:48.200
If you've got a Pebble Watch, go get the... let's see, where is it?

59:48.200 --> 59:50.460
And I assume you also have Lollipop.

59:50.460 --> 59:55.240
On 11, we'll sync your steps to Google Fit so you can track your fit stuff with Google

59:55.240 --> 59:56.380
from your Pebble.

59:56.380 --> 01:00:01.180
And also there's a really great sleep app called... I think it's just called Android

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:04.960
Sleep or something like that that works with the Pebble to track your sleep.

01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.800
There's a real... I'm having a lot of fun with the Pebble, Matt.

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:07.800
I'm just going to... I'll just leave it at that.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.800
Very, very cool.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.800
I'll just leave it at that.

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.520
I won't bore everybody else to tears with all of the details.

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.520
I'm sorry.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.480
Hey, watchers are cool.

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.200
I used to have one with a calculator on it.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:18.760
It dates me a little bit, but that's okay.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:19.760
No, it's the new thing.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.760
It's back.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.760
The new thing is the old thing.

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:22.760
Right.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:23.760
Right.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.440
Matt, wouldn't it be nice if we had everybody join us next week?

01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:30.040
Now, I know Daylight Savings has been a bit of an issue, but we do the Unplugged Show

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.240
on Tuesdays at 2 PM Pacific, and you can go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.640
to get that converted to your local time zone.

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:36.640
You go to jblive.tv.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.980
We've got the chatroom embedded.

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:39.120
You can join our open Mumble Room.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:42.660
We just check your mic, and you can comment on the stories, so we really would love to

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:43.660
have you join us.

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:45.960
Hey, Matt, have a great week, and I'll talk to you next Tuesday, okay?

01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:46.960
All right.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:47.960
All right, everybody.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.720
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Lettings Unplugged.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:01:19.000
We'll see you right back here next week.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:28.000
Oh, I'm glad Daylight Savings worked out for you, Hume.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.720
You're the one audience member, I think, that hasn't been messed up by it.

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.040
Yeah, Sleep as Android.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.120
Thank you, micro89.

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.120
That's the app.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:38.400
It's really cool because Sleep as Android, if you have any sleep issues, it's really

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.760
a good troubleshooting application because it uses the accelerometer in the Nexus.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:49.360
It uses the microphone to monitor noise in the room, and then it uses the accelerometer

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.440
in the Pebble to detect any movement, and it combines all of that data together, so

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:59.280
if I move and my Pebble tracks that, it will then at the same time correlate that to any

01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.200
room noise, and it'll show a waveform spike of any noise in the room, so I can listen

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.880
to somebody rip an ass or snore or whatever it is, and then it'll also give me my total

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.960
time of REM sleep.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.960
That is extremely useful for me because that's what I'm troubleshooting right now because

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:21.440
I go to bed at a decent time, but if I go to bed, say, at 10.30 and I wake up at midnight

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.080
versus I wake up at, say, five in the morning, I feel exactly the same either way.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.760
It feels like I got the same amount of sleep, so I know there's something that's not right

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:32.080
there, so I'm trying to troubleshoot how much sleep I'm actually getting at night, like

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:39.300
how much good sleep, and that, according to the Pebble, is last night I actually got two

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:40.300
hours of sleep.

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:46.640
Chris, I've got a little tip for you because I got bitten in the ass by it this morning.

01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.640
All right.

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:54.920
It's Sync, not Sync thing, BitSync again, so I went around and updated a couple of my

01:02:54.920 --> 01:03:00.360
boxes this morning, and BitSync 1.4 got replaced with BitSync 2.0.

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.160
It is, I was wondering if they were going to replace it.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:10.280
Okay, right, well, I don't know what OS you're running on, but in the AUR, there's a BTU

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:19.400
T-Sync 1.4 package, and the guy that makes the Ubuntu packages in his Debian repository,

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:24.640
he's got a repository that is specifically pinned to the 1.4 version, so I've gone around

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.640
and...

01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:26.640
And so it begins.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:31.920
So now there's essentially a 1.4, so I have to go uninstall BitTorrent Sync and install

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.020
this 1.4 version.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:36.040
Have you upgraded to 2.0 yet?

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.040
No.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.040
No.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:44.920
On the machines that I haven't upgraded to 2.0, I just installed the 1.4 version, and

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:45.920
that's fine.

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.880
It just replaces the 1.4 version that I'm already running.

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.560
So I just did an upgrade last night.

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:53.880
Do you think I might have to check?

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:54.880
I don't know.

01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.400
Yeah, so there is a guide on the btsync2.0 help center.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:06.300
There is a guide on how to roll back to 1.4, and you are going to want to do this because

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:12.240
btsync2.0 is not 1.4 out of beta.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.000
It's a completely different product, and it works in a completely different way, and it

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.440
will not suit your use case of handing out a key that multiple people can then snag.

01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:30.760
It's all designed about, these are my devices in my network, and I want to link them together.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:38.040
And with the btsync2.0 package, there's no way to create what they now call a classic

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:42.160
share where you say, you know, make me some keys.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.280
You can only now create these device-linked shares in the 2.0 system.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:47.280
Oh no.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.280
Oh no.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.540
What am I going to do?

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:52.740
Do what I did.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:54.380
You can roll back.

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.880
It's fairly straightforward to roll back to 1.4.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:01.440
Yeah, but what are you going to do about security fixes in the future?

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:03.080
Yeah, well, this is it.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:07.080
This is my holding position until I get cfile up and running.

01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:12.280
And how is cfile at distributing to large audiences files?

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:16.880
You can share links via its web thing, but I haven't actually got around to testing that,

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:21.840
so I can't say how well it will suit your use case.

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:26.280
So basically, I should downgrade back to BitTorrent Sync 1.4, huh?

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.720
Well, it depends.

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:36.720
I mean, I'm going to because the way I'm using the product, I could probably go to 2.0, but

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:42.840
I was really wary of the fact that I didn't realize that it worked in a different way.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:49.020
And suddenly, the two instances that I'd upgraded were no longer connected to one another.

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:55.880
The old classic shares were still syncing, but in terms of how new shares would work,

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:57.720
that was they weren't linked together.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:07.440
So I've rolled back so I can test BtSync 2.0 in its own installation in a VM somewhere

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:12.800
just to see how it works and figure it all out before I either stick with it and pay

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:17.440
my money and upgrade or move to something else and quite possibly I'm going to move

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.920
to cfile.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:26.160
This is super unfortunate because I'll give you another use case.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.880
People have asked for a complete archive of the Linux action show, and there's not one

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:38.080
spot you can go and get everything from episode one to episode 356 or whatever we're at.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.400
And part of that is because where do you store all that?

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.800
But part of it is it's a lot of transfer, et cetera, et cetera.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:46.920
And one of the things we used BitTorrent Sync for was we started working on a collaborative

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:52.560
effort where some people have personal archives where we have gaps missing.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:56.840
And we started all collaborating in one BitTorrent Sync folder, and I just gave them out the

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:57.840
key on the subreddit.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:58.840
Yeah.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:05.440
I can't do anything like that with any other file services.

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:14.440
So my advice is roll back to 1.4 as your holding position so you retain your existing behavior.

01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:22.880
Go and test 2.0 in its own VM that isn't linked in any way with your existing BT sync devices

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:26.480
and see if it's going to continue to work for you.

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:32.000
If you are running BT sync 2.0, say I'm one of your subscribers.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:40.360
If I'm running BT sync 2.0, I can paste classic share keys in, but you can't create them.

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.360
Okay.

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:44.680
So that's the other thing is I can't prevent the audience from upgrading.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:45.680
No.

01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:46.680
No.

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:47.680
Yeah.

01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:48.680
This is screwed.

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:49.680
This is so screwed.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:56.320
And I can't do like the other thing is there are like there are software packages out there

01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:02.600
that will automatically create like torrent feeds and all that kind of stuff, but it's

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.600
not the same.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.160
It's not like a distributed content.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:08.200
It's just I should have seen it coming.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.280
I actually did see it coming.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.000
So I'm actually none of this none of this surprises me at all.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.320
I would not say I'm caught surprised by any of this.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:22.800
The only thing I'm surprised about is 1.4 was, you know, it's a beta and 2.0 is the,

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:26.680
you know, the final product, but it's a completely different product.

01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:29.200
It works in a completely different way.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:34.600
So all of that beta testing we did, we weren't beta testing the product that has just been

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:35.600
released.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.960
If you're using BT sync 2.0 now, you are a beta tester again because it's so fundamentally

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:41.960
different.

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:46.640
It can't have been, you know, tested at the scale that, you know, 1.4 was.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.640
Yeah.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.640
Hmm.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:49.640
C file.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.920
I wonder where I can go to download the latest version of 1.4.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:53.920
Right.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:54.920
Okay.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.880
Let me paste a link in the chat room.

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.880
Yeah.

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.640
I'm definitely gonna be looking into C file.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.640
That's for sure.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:07.280
I've never heard of what it would C file open source cloud storage for your teams and organizations

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:08.600
organized files into libraries.

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.080
Each library can be shared between users and into groups like library can also be selectively

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:14.880
synced to any device, edit and comment on files online.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:18.480
Hey, uh, wimpy, can you comment on that part?

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.760
Edit and comment on files online.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.560
Is that like collaborative editing?

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:25.040
Uh, I haven't tested any of that stuff yet.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.040
I'm own.

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:30.120
I'm really only interested in file sync and all.

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:37.320
And what I've done so far is yeah, and all I've done so far is gone and read the documentation

01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.320
a couple of times.

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:44.560
So I know what to do when I get the time to actually set up a server.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.080
Now why use a C file?

01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:47.920
What about sync thing?

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:51.060
Um, I've used sync thing.

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:58.580
It's not, um, it's not, even if you've only got, I've got maybe eight or nine devices

01:09:58.580 --> 01:10:04.820
that are in my sync network and just managing that number of devices with sync thing, having

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:10.800
to keep exchanging the keys every which way is unmanageable.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.720
So it just doesn't scale.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.720
You know, if you've got two computers, it's great.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:17.720
If you've got four computers, it's tricky.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.520
And if you've got, you know, more than six, it starts to get really cumbersome.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:22.520
Hmm.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:23.520
Okay.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:30.440
I'm looking at a ccloud.cc, which is a online commercial version of a C file.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.800
And cause they, they just, cause I was just curious if I, I would probably roll my own,

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:43.640
but this one uses Amazon web services for the backend storage, uh, uh, gross, uh, I'll

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:56.640
play with it some more and we'll see what we get.
