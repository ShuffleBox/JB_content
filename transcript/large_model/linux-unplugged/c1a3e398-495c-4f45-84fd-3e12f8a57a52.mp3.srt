00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,400
Wester is a conspiracy afoot it appears that office 365 one drive looks at user agents to determine performance

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:13,000
This is breaking news on the r slash Linux subreddit, which everyone knows is the Bastion

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,100
CNN level style reporting here, but this is something to consider from tornado. He says a few weeks

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,120
I've been running Linux mint 18.1. I got on my lappy. I'm still in school. I started a new project

5
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:33,360
We have a project where we use one drive on an office 365 when he uses Firefox 52 and goes online

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,880
He gets it in compatibility mode. Sadly enough. He said I experienced a lot of performance issues with that

7
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:42,360
He says I have a desktop running Windows 10 in the same Firefox 52 web browser

8
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,400
I tried working on the document and I see no I see if the problem is this but it does not there was no problem

9
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,160
I began thinking about trying a few different things

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,200
So he began switching the user agent under his mint install to make it look like he was running on Windows NT 6.1

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,880
64-bit version of Windows but still Firefox gecko and after changing the user agent

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,600
He says the performance problems were resolved the UI of one drive worked flawlessly

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,760
The only thing the user the only thing that was changed was the user agent in the user agent was the OS

14
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,020
He left all the version stuff of Firefox the same

15
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:19,340
He thought maybe it was a random occurrence. So then he changed it back to the regular agent problem comes back

16
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,820
Have we discovered a massive controversy here Wes or do you think it could just be a

17
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,060
Testing thing like wow, we didn't test that one very well. So we'll put it in compatibility mode

18
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,820
I am inclined to think that you should more often attribute things

19
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,020
Two bugs rather than malice. Yes, I would imagine so in this case

20
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:42,700
Yeah, especially in a case like this where I wouldn't expect Microsoft to do that

21
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:48,460
I wouldn't expect Microsoft to put a ton of resources into researching and testing the Linux side of things

22
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,500
So they dad just this should work, but we haven't tested it. So slap compatibility on there

23
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,860
That doesn't pretty boss. All right, darn it conspiracy busted right here on the unplugged program

24
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,020
This is Linux unplugged episode

25
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,780
189 for March 21st

26
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:15,780
2017

27
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:24,060
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's alive and strong. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes

28
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:30,140
Hello, sir. You know what Wes today is a great day. We have so many fun topics to cover

29
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,940
Yeah for me personally, there's some great ones in here too. But I know for some of the other projects the shows just talked about

30
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,620
in the past we got some great updates and then and

31
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,300
Then I am I am really excited

32
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,260
We have a we have a great attendance in the in the virtual lug today

33
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,780
And I know one of the main topics we're gonna get into later in the show

34
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,500
I don't want to say too much because I don't want them to yeah quiet now

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:56,080
I don't want them to spoil it but we have we have a really great conversational topic about long-term future desktop like

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,540
Stuff that's sort of an elephant in the room kind of stuff that we're going to be talking about

37
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:04,620
We'll also get an update from I key on that what the solace project is up to some new code has been pushed and I got

38
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,260
A few questions, but obviously obviously we're gonna start with a bunch of updates that are totally totally rockin

39
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,220
So mr. West we've been supplied with are these are these a

40
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,580
Are these an ale technically or are these consider a cider? It's a wheat ale. Oh, it's a wheat ale

41
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,180
Okay, so wait us to help us to help

42
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,220
grease the wheels of Linux unplugged

43
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,100
West has supplied us with a passion fruit kicker. Oh, yeah a wheat ale with passion fruit built-in

44
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,500
So that is that is that that'll be what we're drinking along here. Here you go. Cheers. Cheers

45
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Yes, cheers to 189. Yeah, and a Linux and to our mumble room. Oh speaking of that mumble room

46
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,620
Let's bring them in time appropriate greetings a virtual lug

47
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,020
Hello

48
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,580
I am very excited a little bit of late-breaking news as we go into the show today

49
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,820
Those of us that run Kodi are going to be very very excited by this news

50
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,180
It looks like a proper Netflix plug-in could be coming to Kodi soon

51
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,780
What in fact if you're on Kodi Android you can get your hands on it already

52
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,420
so this is um

53
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,380
This is not a sanctioned thing

54
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,860
I'm gonna just get that big big caveat out of the way

55
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,940
But after years and years a user of using different workarounds

56
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,860
There is now sort of this legit Kodi native Netflix plug-in add-on being developed

57
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:26,540
It's it's open-source. So that's kind of a big deal right there. Just this plug-in itself being open-source is nice

58
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,260
Because it not only does it mean

59
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:33,660
Maybe we could get off our Android Cody, but it could also do from architecture. Yeah, exactly

60
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,820
So it's interesting because it's based on Cody's input stream binary add-on extension

61
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:46,220
Which can serve as an input stream for Cody's video player, which is new since Cody 17, which has been a massive update

62
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,700
The add-on it enables playback of the DRM protected content

63
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:56,140
Without having to break the DRM distribution chain that Netflix uses to encrypt its video stream

64
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,700
Now I think that's important because it means that Netflix might be content

65
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,900
Pretending like this doesn't exist because you're not you're not doing anything improperly. You're not busting the DRM

66
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,700
It only works with Kodi built for Android, but it should be possible to port it to Linux

67
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:18,380
Right, like as long as it's not enabling workflows that break your user agreement or make it really easy to make it easy to pirate

68
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,900
Yes, exactly. Then maybe they will just uh-huh. So this slide it is up on uh, it is up on uh,

69
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,380
This is a messed up post. The Kodi 18 isn't anyways, it says a pre-rec is Kodi 18

70
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,740
But the Ferronix post is the pre-rec is Kodi 17. I would guess it's 17 since 18 isn't

71
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,460
A downloadable thing right now

72
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:45,580
But uh for me using the NVIDIA shield android tv and having Kodi on there and it I right now

73
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,860
I use Kodi to also play Plex media because I I yes, right I find um

74
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,260
I find that every now and then when I back up something

75
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,940
There's like a flaw in the file that I don't catch until I've tried to watch it and um the standard Plex player

76
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,020
Just dies

77
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,700
When oh, I hit it hits it, you know a couple of drop frames or drop audio files

78
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,260
When oh, I hit it hits it, you know a couple of drop frames or drop audio package just dies

79
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Kodi will just and then keep going

80
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,580
Go right. Um

81
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,780
And it's faster too. And the plus you get all the other benefits of Kodi. You don't have to leave Kodi

82
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,940
So now I can add one more thing to that

83
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,340
exactly that that's where I would change things for me is I could go from

84
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,980
You know before I have to rely on things like a chromecast or maybe it's built into a smart tv or I have a third

85
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,260
Party device if it could all just be right in my Kodi appliance

86
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,300
It really would make it more of an appliance to me because I do I mean or the people that

87
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,020
Use it in my life and a lot of us use Netflix. Mm-hmm

88
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,100
Yeah, otherwise you're always jumping out of Kodi to go watch exactly eventually now, uh, we have mr

89
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:45,660
Colonel linux joining us this week and he he and I did like this, uh, accidental versus like cheap android tv box versus

90
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,220
The nvidia shield which is kind of on the higher end

91
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,500
I've since bought two more nvidia shields since that review. I really like the product, but I wanted to check in with you

92
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,420
Colonel linux. Are you still using uh?

93
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:00,300
Are you still using that android tv reviewed ages ago or if you all have you rolled all back to the western digital lives?

94
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,540
Nope, so I have uh still in the house the majority of the um

95
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,260
Of the media players are still the western digital tv lives the box you're talking about is the matricom

96
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,780
uh m a t r i c it's like 99 bucks, right

97
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:18,460
Yeah, it's a little cheaper than that and I have the I have the q2 which comes with the the built-in ir

98
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:24,940
Connector as well as wired ethernet. Um, and so far i've had not I have not had any problems

99
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,700
I'm still using that the the q2 downstairs in my shop where so basically every day when i'm working on something

100
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,100
I just have it kind of up playing some media

101
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,860
Um, and I really really like it. They're only I only have two hits

102
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,420
I found once I tried to take it with me to the lake and the western digitals are all 12 volt dc

103
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:46,700
So you you know living in an rv you can understand why that's amazing and the the q2 is is five volts

104
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:51,660
So I have to use a either an ac inverter. I'd have to use like a voltage step down transformer

105
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:58,460
Transformer, um, and then uh, the other thing I don't like about it is there's no there's no the western digitals are very square

106
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,180
So they mount very nicely to the wall and the the g2 is or the q2 is kind of a i'm surprised

107
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,700
How many boxes do that? Yeah, that's weird, right? That is uh, that is a thing

108
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,740
They do they they do make they make a bracket for uh, the roku and I was I was planning on using that

109
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,820
But you know the fact that you have android means that it works with netflix means it works with cody

110
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:22,640
Yes means, you know and and the ability to to be that flexible is actually worth overcoming some of the other shortcomings

111
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,060
That's how that's that's exactly been my takeaway. I key. I saw you in there saying

112
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,580
Can you explain a little bit of that I mean I saw a lot of that it seemed like you were going

113
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:39,340
Using a player I just use my web browser like a man explain yourself. Oh, yeah. I mean that's pretty much it

114
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,660
I like that I do this massive characterization. Yeah, that's about right

115
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,380
Yeah, I have youtube and I have netflix in the browser. I mean what else do I need?

116
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,460
Well, I think I don't have downloads

117
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,940
I think for I think for me and you know

118
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,660
I think one of the reasons I talk about cody more is when I when I moved into lady jubes

119
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:03,340
I made this huge shift into consuming a lot of my video content via the television instead of on my my desktop

120
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,340
Yeah, and it's a totally different experience for me. Like it is a legit way

121
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,740
For my my fiance and I to sit down right, especially when you're sharing it with yeah

122
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,740
And the family too like it is it has become like our primary way of we don't have television

123
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:20,620
We barely get any where i'm at right now. I get decent reception, but usually I don't hardly have any reception

124
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,860
Um, so for me, it's I I yeah, obviously if i'm at my desk i'm using chrome. Yeah, i'm not using cody

125
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,220
I'm using chrome, but if i'm on the if i'm on my tv

126
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,780
I want something that is

127
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,020
Appliance level reliable and fast and cody's the only one that delivers that and it has you know

128
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:42,060
Like it integrates well if you want to tie in like an ir remote or other things that will be feel first class

129
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,260
In the tv. Yeah system. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean right now I have it all tied in with the echo, which is right

130
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,500
Yeah, there you go. Yeah something don't don't tell noah, but I just walk in I tell it to turn on the tv

131
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,180
And it just does all that stuff

132
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,180
Um, all right. Well, let's move on because I know not everybody cares about cody and just next one

133
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,900
I just wanted to take a moment. There's two pieces of kind of

134
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,300
I don't know if malware is the right term

135
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,860
It's not because the first one's ransomware and the other one's an exploit

136
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,780
But I just thought both these stories were interesting. Uh, and so I wanted to throw them together really quick first. I love this

137
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:14,540
Um, there's new ransomware out written in python and it's called

138
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,840
Kirk ransomware. Yeah, it's kirk ransomware

139
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,580
Um, and it's the first ransomware really that uses the are you familiar with this mono monero?

140
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,980
Monero, uh payments. It's like an alternative. It's an alternative to bitcoin

141
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:34,300
What kind of big crap what oh, yeah, okay. It's an open source cryptocurrency created in april 2014

142
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,380
Yeah, I don't know why i've never heard of it. No, I haven't heard it about either

143
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,740
Yeah, but i'm sure

144
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,580
But you know what? I i'm gonna read on but I have I have a little bit of bacon about this

145
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,660
I I kind of I kind of suspect something

146
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,580
Yeah, so it is uh, it's written in python

147
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,180
So it seems like it could probably be moved over to linux and you know screw up your home directory if you're not careful

148
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,620
Um, but there was one little bit of tidbit that I liked about it

149
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:01,020
It is not knowing how it's being distributed. So don't worry. This is not like a this is not something

150
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,500
That's like a big deal. I just some of the details are interesting. Um

151
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:11,120
Um, it masquerades as a network stress testing tool called low orbital ion cannon, which we've heard of before. Absolutely

152
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,100
So what happens is people go out and they look for like I want to do a network stress test

153
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,220
Or I want to just be a dick to somebody and they go get low orbital ion cannon thinking that well

154
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,580
This is the python script that does it turns out no actually it encrypts your home directory

155
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,500
um

156
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,140
The kirk ransomware will then generate an aes password that will require the user to

157
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:36,060
Put in um the unlock key to decrypt the files, but this is the best part. This is the best part of all of it

158
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,420
The decrypter tool

159
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,580
Do you have a guess what it's called? It's called kirk ransomware. What do you suppose the decrypter tool is called?

160
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,980
Really hoping for something with con or spock one of those two. It's spock. The decrypter is called spock. Yeah

161
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,540
Yeah, you run the spock decrypter and they supply that to the victim once the payment's made

162
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,780
Nice, and I mean the live long and prosper thing after yeah, that's nice. That's nice

163
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:03,740
They got a screenshot of that. I really some production quality like, you know, they wanted the appearance to be nice here

164
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,460
It's me. It's it's

165
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:11,740
It's I think a promotion for the cryptocurrency. Yeah, I think somebody created this what?

166
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,940
Like why not con like yeah

167
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:20,140
Well, I guess spock is saving the day right because con would be destroying your files and spock is rescuing

168
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:20,220
Yeah

169
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,300
So if it didn't if it like fake decrypted and just deleted them then it would be con

170
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,620
I really feel like this is a promotion for a cryptocurrency

171
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,100
Like hey, how do we get some movement in the market? You know what we do? We get people to have to go buy some

172
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,260
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, not only does to get the name out there, but about six moneros

173
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,220
That's not true, but i'm mining moneros right now, dude

174
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:45,980
Now kirk will ruin your plans. So maybe we should like create a fix for this

175
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,860
Ransomware that will maybe that will be called con the fix for the man's rent

176
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,020
Right, right. I think I think or the ransomware should have been called the wrath of con

177
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,140
um

178
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,300
All right, then just one other thing just to follow from a story. We covered recently that cia vault 7

179
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,780
well, it turns out now that with some of the

180
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,060
I

181
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:08,540
It's funny because wikileaks has been getting a hard time for releasing code that that makes us more vulnerable

182
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,580
But I wish they would have released more code so we could have built better tools to detect where cia tools are being used

183
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,860
But there have been some people uh sabana virus companies that have taken some of the wikileaks releases

184
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,420
And generated pattern recognition to detect the tools and stuff like that. So there is some stuff that's coming out

185
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,020
um

186
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,140
And there's this one a simple command allows the cia to commandeer

187
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,340
318 different models of cisco switches

188
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,060
The bug relies on a telnet protocol

189
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,700
Yeah relies on the telnet protocol

190
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,500
um, and uh, yeah over three three hundred and eighteen switches. All right, what's the command?

191
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,660
Yeah, right. Um, I don't know because all they say is the bug resides in the cisco cluster management protocol

192
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,660
Which uses the telnet protocol to deliver signals and commands on the internal network

193
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:56,220
So I don't I don't ours is not really giving you the command here in the article

194
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,100
Uh, I just thought I thought you know

195
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,380
Just wanted to follow up on the vault 7 stuff and also include it maybe with the with the star trek malware

196
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,980
Or i'm, sorry ransomware. Oh, that's beautiful. Yeah, or horrible. Yeah

197
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:13,900
now william, I see you're you're back in the room and your your timing couldn't be more perfect because there is

198
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,100
One big update on a project that you've gotten me really excited about and that is bcash fs

199
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,020
I think a new version has shipped and lots of stuff's been going on

200
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,780
I think the biggest milestone has been that all of the breaking on disk format changes are landing like all that stuff's getting out of

201
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,180
The way that should be over now in theory

202
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,300
But there's also some other big features that have rolled out

203
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,260
Where do you where should we start when we're talking about the new bcash fs?

204
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,580
I think the most interesting thing is the on disk encryption stuff that we're doing. Yes

205
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,180
The cache fs that's great because you build that right into the file system

206
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:50,300
And so now you'll have competition in that space and I think what's even better is that not only do you get encryption?

207
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,140
But you also get verification

208
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,180
So that someone can't just come along and write bytes to the underlying file system and corrupt your data without you knowing about it

209
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:02,460
Because with something like dm crypt you just get encryption. It doesn't actually check to see if what you wrote is authentic

210
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,940
Okay, I hadn't even thought of that

211
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,220
Uh, and then also, uh, can you tell me about the wonders of the new backup super blocks?

212
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,340
I mean that just brings it up in the line with the butter of fs and zfsd, right?

213
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:16,140
So you get a bunch of super blocks distributed across the file system

214
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,500
That way in case one of them gets corrupted you still have backups to go back to

215
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,100
Because before I think on the version that i'm using on my laptop you just have one super block

216
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,900
So the moment that one thing gets corrupted you lose everything

217
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,100
So is this uh, is this new in node format?

218
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,300
Is this one of the larger sort of practical changes in the new in the new release?

219
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,580
It's not necessarily interesting to end users, but it is a little bit more compact and it does allow him to um,

220
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,700
Add more features to the file system over time. So I think it's actually a good thing

221
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,700
Oh, and also I like this line being able to fit all of your metadata in ram smiley face

222
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,340
Yes, that is that is very a lot of them are just small underlying changes that make it more performant

223
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,260
User space fsdk. That seems kind of nice. Yeah, that just is yeah

224
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:59,980
Actually having the fsdk already done before it's even integrated into linux is probably a huge selling point because neither zfs or butter

225
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,740
Fs had that. How do you feel about the file system migration stuff?

226
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,140
So apparently it works flawlessly i've never tested it

227
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,420
I actually am not using the new version yet. I'm still on the old disk format

228
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:14,300
I mean like somebody wants to bail on butter fs because it's garbage or somebody wants to upgrade from extended four

229
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:17,500
Or somebody wants to purge zfs from their life. Hello

230
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,580
Fantastic because it'll take any file system

231
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:24,060
It'll build an image and then you can rewrite that image over once you verify the image is correct

232
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,460
Obviously, this means that you're going to store the data twice

233
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,140
So you're using less than 50 of your file system currently. Yeah, that's right

234
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,460
But it is nice if you have a fairly small amount of data and you want to migrate your root fs over or something

235
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:42,700
And you could you could also oh, yeah. Okay. So, um, could you could you actually boot from from a bcash fs file system?

236
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,900
Yeah, i'm booting my laptop, but i'm running the whole thing on the

237
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:51,100
Oh, I thought that wasn't a thing partition the efi partition has to be readable by the efi. Okay, so it's fat 32

238
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,180
Yeah, um, but otherwise it's all bcash

239
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,460
Uh, it's built right into the kernel. Unfortunately, that doesn't work

240
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:01,580
You have to build his linux tree, right? Uh, I maintain my own with the most stable patch set

241
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,100
He actually just keeps it at like the base 49 and just keeps adding patches on top

242
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,540
But I merge in the stable versions every now and then as soon as they come out

243
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,340
So i've just been keeping with that. It's a fairly up-to-date kernel. Like it's still 49. It's not 410 or you know

244
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:18,380
The rc but he pushes it forward every now and then so kent's assertion here is that uh,

245
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,900
Raid one and raid 10 are raid one and raid 10

246
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:28,060
Potentially work. It's not very well tested as my understanding and i'm not 100 sure the recovery code is even in place

247
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,500
And then so it'll distribute the blocks across multiple disks. Uh-huh

248
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,860
Uh, but beyond that i'm not really sure how well you'd be able to recover your data stuff went bad

249
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,700
I know it is doing checksumming. So it is aware of disk errors

250
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,220
I'm, just not sure what the replication code does in the case of seeing an error on one

251
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,900
Disc if it copies the crank over from the other disk, right? Yeah, but it's not

252
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,260
An error on one disk if it copies the crank over from the other graph, right? Yeah, what is the tooling like around the?

253
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,780
Replication support like I you know, i'm familiar with like zfs send obviously is that is it in line?

254
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,700
Well, that's different right? Okay, that's sending and receiving uh file system images more or less or compression

255
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:10,700
Okay, this is different than this. This is the raid levels. This would be like, you know running mirrored mode in cfs

256
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,140
I think eventually he's going to grow send receive support

257
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,700
I just don't think that's a major feature major milestone on his plate right now, right?

258
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,580
Man, this is sounding like an awesome freaking this is sounding like my future linux file system right here

259
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,220
Yeah

260
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,060
It'll be really interesting to watch as it uh gets closer to being ready to be upstreamed

261
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,580
I think someone said deduplication in the chat room. No, there's no deduplication yet

262
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,900
I assume that will also be something that's pretty trivially possible at some point

263
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,060
I think the hardest thing is going to be getting snapshot support. Oh, yeah. Why is that?

264
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:49,100
Oh, just given the structure of the file system using b-trees. It's fairly hard to do snapshots correctly

265
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,820
Oh, okay. I think at butterfs. It's actually fairly complicated logic

266
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,260
I was gonna because that was gonna be my next question is it seems like that was something that butterfs sort of rolled out with is

267
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,220
Is this?

268
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:10,380
Is this not a format sorry, is it not a copy-on-write file system? It's a copy-on-write file system then didn't

269
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:16,780
Normally, well copy the attitude do it is yeah copy you copy it and then just stop

270
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,940
Sorry, you just stop writing where it was writing you write somewhere else sort of

271
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:29,340
I know that's a gross oversimplification. That's a gross oversimplification and I don't think those are the underlying issues

272
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,380
Okay with doing snapshotting. Well, hmm

273
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,220
You know what? I I would love to know more about that. Maybe yeah

274
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:41,100
The hardest part i'm not necessarily very familiar with the topic, but I think the hardest part is actually

275
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:48,460
Purging old snapshot data. Oh interesting keeping ref counts correctly and those sorts of things and then rebalancing the b-tree. Hmm

276
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,180
This is uh, this is this is this is a project we've been watching now for I don't know

277
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,380
I mean feels like it's been it's been a little while now. Uh, it's been going

278
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,860
Yeah, he announced it. I think in august or june and you've been that time frame somewhere in the summer

279
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,020
You've been running it for how long?

280
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,260
I've been running it since he announced it basically

281
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:11,660
And I haven't reformatted once love it dude. I will say there's probably a bit of corrupted stuff on there. Oh, just a little

282
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,780
Wow, it seems to be running. Okay still I think one of the nicest things is the tail the long tail latency is fairly low

283
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:25,100
So all your operations perform incredibly quickly when you're just trying to do small accesses. Oh, man, that's nice

284
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:31,100
Yeah, random performance is very good. Assuming that the underlying device is also decent right like a modern ssd or something

285
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,260
Yeah, which is what you want

286
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:37,820
Yeah, because the problem with butter fs i've noticed is you get a lot of hangs doing certain operations

287
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,260
Every now and then like it'll just go to sleep for a second and come back. Yeah

288
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,300
Um, especially this is better with that especially under different

289
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,620
There's some conditions where that seems to be worse too with butter fs. Yeah. Oh, yeah, it seems

290
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,820
It's not a well understood thing. It's a very complex code base

291
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,100
So maybe if I grab edge cases where you can run into really long tails

292
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,260
And bcash does as much as it can to not run into those long tails for reason rights

293
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,700
I see so it tries to avoid doing most of the work in the critical path

294
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,380
So if I get this kernel and the synchronous path, maybe if I compile that wire guard module, too

295
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,180
I can just be the ultimate kernel hipster. So you're just going to switch to gen 2 got my wire guard

296
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,460
Nice

297
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,460
Living in the in the future you do

298
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,460
Like william's like yeah, that's my setup. What disk are you using william? I'm using xms

299
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,660
Oh, yeah, that's right. That's why you're one of my favorites

300
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,780
We got to do an episode on that. Yes, we do. We can do an episode. I can show you nixos in production

301
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,620
Awesome. Yeah, write that down. I think I think I think I want to do that. Let's talk to know about it

302
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,940
We'll figure it out. Okay. Yeah, cool. All right

303
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,140
Well, uh, let's uh, let's talk about solace here in just a moment

304
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,900
But first first I would like to say a big thank you to linux academy

305
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:49,820
I I am so I am so happy with the growth linux academy has seen and and the pickup there again

306
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,820
And the partnerships they're establishing now

307
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:57,660
it's one of those things where if you signed up like a year ago like every single week something new and

308
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,620
Just constantly improving

309
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
It is so so valuable

310
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,680
Uh, but if you're new to it, I would I would encourage you to get started at linuxacademy.com

311
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:12,300
Unplugged you get a seven-day free trial that is going to get you acquainted with like the essentials of this platform

312
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,980
It's it's a platform to learn about linux. It's a platform to advance your career and go into a new field

313
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,340
It's a it's a platform to double down on the area that you work in

314
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,860
It is

315
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:28,780
So well built because it was designed by linux enthusiasts linux educators and developers who came together and said, all right

316
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,580
How can we advance linux?

317
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:37,020
And I had this conversation with their ceo before they were even a sponsor when we just started flirting about

318
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,820
It's okay. What are you feeling it out feeling it out? Just no, that's that's that's that's a whole different

319
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:47,100
Hold on. Hold on to a different picture. We were we were just kind of talking just talking at first and uh,

320
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,940
He said, you know where we watched jb, uh, but I don't understand how you make any money at it

321
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,460
I said, well, we don't make very much. It's like yeah

322
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:52,620
well

323
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:57,660
We think we might have a way to advocate linux make money and actually improve the workforce in a way that it was like

324
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,820
A tool that was never available when you were in the workforce like oh, yeah, sure anthony. Yeah, that'll happen

325
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,900
And you know what a couple of years later now it is unbelievable what they've accomplished

326
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,900
Self-paced in-depth video courses on every linux cloud and devops topic and they're not afraid to branch out into areas that you need

327
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,660
it's

328
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:20,220
Very impressive hands-on scenario-based labs give you experience on real servers instructor mentoring. That means an actual human being

329
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,220
That knows what they're talking about an instructor that will work with you and you need help

330
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,300
That's that's phenomenal for the type of course where they're covering. This is unique to the linux academy

331
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,300
They have lab servers that spin up on demand as you need them a course scheduler for your busy schedule

332
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,560
I would like you to go check them out at linuxacademy.com

333
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,420
Unplugged that supports the show and from there you can sign up for a free seven-day trial

334
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:43,340
well, the other thing that's nice is even when life gets busy like

335
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,940
Say it's the holidays right and life is super busy

336
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,340
They have nuggets that can be just a few minutes long where you can just go in and get a little value that week

337
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,700
They have availability planners that can build courseware for your busy schedule

338
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,100
And on top of all of that

339
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,900
You can just log in and just get snapshots of what your progress is out

340
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,660
So you can kind of just keep track of how you're doing you get time estimations for every major topic

341
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:06,060
You want to learn python? You want to learn ruby? You want to learn php?

342
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:11,100
It's going to take you six hours four hours seven hours. It's like quantifiable. Yep. It's great

343
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,620
Like you I know I I don't know how to wrap my head around learning ruby

344
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,860
I know how to wrap my head around six hours where you have to go find all the documents then do it

345
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,620
Oh, this is all just right there

346
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:20,780
Right

347
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,780
Have an idea of how long it's going to take and for me taking it down from i'm going to learn this

348
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:31,340
Nebulous topic that is is massively broad and there's so many different opinions taking it from something like that to

349
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:36,140
I'm going to spend six hours and learn a thing is so much more mode

350
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:41,900
It's like I have so much more motivation to do that because it's a clearly definable object to that same point

351
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:46,780
You can just browse through right? Like maybe I want to learn ruby by looking you can see all the stuff

352
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,060
You'll do after going through their resources. You'll have an idea like okay. Yes

353
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,760
I'll be able to accomplish my goal after six hours. Absolutely linuxacademy.com

354
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,700
Unplugged go there to keep us going support the show

355
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,660
Let them know you heard about it here and then sign up for a free seven-day trial

356
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:06,460
And by the way, the community rocks because it's stacked full of jupiter broadcasting members. They fork like the study cards and stuff

357
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,540
So that way they get even better over time

358
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:14,620
It's nice and they've got downloadable guides you can take with you and lessen audio personal notebooks tools that help you study

359
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,840
Ios and android apps as well linuxacademy.com

360
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,400
Thanks linux academy for sponsoring the unplugged program

361
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,780
So mr. Aiki joins us again, which is it's always a it's always a nice pleasure. So thanks for being here ike

362
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:33,180
I appreciate it because I know it's not like the middle of it's not like the afternoon over there like it is here

363
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:37,180
So I always really do appreciate it's about nine o'clock. Well 20 to 10 now

364
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,420
I I I don't i'm grokking from what's happened that you probably don't sleep much anyways

365
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,020
Because it looks like a lot's been going on with solace. It got uh mate matea

366
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,980
1.18. I got new linux kernel coming in got a new budget coming in. Tell me what's going on over there

367
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,860
Uh, yeah, basically all that stuff

368
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,220
And lots of new apps too or updates

369
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:02,540
Yeah, I mean matea 1.18 went in I think it was the day after or maybe even two days after i'm not even sure now

370
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,060
Uh, we got that into solace got that tested very quickly and out to people

371
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:13,180
No breakages was very very happy with that. Congrats. Uh, we got the lib input support as well. So that's very nice. That's great

372
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,740
Oh, yeah, so now people will have less touchpad problems. Really that's super nice

373
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,860
Yeah, so there's been bugs about that on the tracker long standing issues, but upstream solved them

374
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,060
So we have those in one of our changes from solace that actually landed for this release cycle

375
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,860
Was the action icon support within mate notification daemon. Oh nice

376
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,460
It's a trivial little change, but it just allows you to have icons instead of just plain text on there

377
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:43,900
Yeah, and some applications like rhythm box express more actions when icons are available

378
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,140
So it's uh, it's a more natural use of things like media players

379
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,540
So we was happy to get something in at least into that release

380
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,820
And we got four point nine point sixteen kernel, I believe we're on now

381
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:04,860
Uh, we're following the lts tree for now until we got a clear boot manager integrated and then we can have switchable kernels

382
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,620
How is that going?

383
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,140
That's actually gone really well

384
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:15,580
So the last bit of stuff that I was doing there was basically implementing proper name spacing on the efi system partition

385
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,220
Uh, so the decision was made to namespace under the efi directory

386
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:27,500
So for solace it would be slash efi slash com dot solace project and then all of our files will live in there

387
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:34,620
And we're going to want to add things like uh, firmer update support in there using the fw upd project

388
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,860
and i've

389
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:40,540
Pretty much finished the grub 2 support for legacy booting

390
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,420
So I need to test that on the laptop, but once that's done, it's pretty much close to a 2.0

391
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,940
And then that will be deployed first as a suicide test. So remind me, uh, yeah

392
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:56,060
I mean, I mean it seems like you're going to be uh aside from clear linux won't you be?

393
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,940
Won't won't you be the only other distro that's shipping? Uh, that is the bootloader

394
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:08,380
Yes, well, it's not the bootloader itself. The idea is explain it to me because I barely understand so explain it to me. Yeah, so

395
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,740
so

396
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
basically want to have a

397
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:17,100
Safe and bulletproof approach to booting and the management of kernels themselves, right?

398
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,620
We've broken it down a few weeks ago, and I thought it was actually a pretty brilliant idea

399
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Uh, it's it's an intel project, right?

400
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:29,260
Yeah, so basically bootloader tools you can kind of trust them. Not always

401
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,820
When it comes to things like case sensitivity it matters to linux. It doesn't matter to fat 32

402
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:41,980
So simple things like that if you was to go and rename some of your directories to some cranky mixed case names

403
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,140
And then if you started to use things like a gummy boot or boot control

404
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:52,780
You're going to run into problems where you can no longer install or update because it's trying to create new name directories that already exist

405
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,660
So it started out of those problems and having

406
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,740
Having a way of updating to a new kernel and retaining the last kernel without having to have

407
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:08,140
Lots of meta packages depending on new versions of those packages to push the updates because you don't want to end up where you've got

408
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,140
47 different kernels on your system and no way to garbage collect them

409
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,340
So I had to implement a policy whereby it knows if a kernel is booted, which is very simple

410
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,140
That's just a system d job to run the tool, right?

411
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,500
It then needs to know what the new default kernel is. It needs to know about different types of kernels

412
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,220
And when to kill an old kernel

413
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:35,740
So basically everything lives in user lib kernel and once once you call the tool everything happens in a single atomic

414
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:41,260
Atomic operation if you can't continue it's going to bail and it will try its absolute best

415
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,780
Not to murder your system. This is really an attempt to get as close as possible to bulletproof kernel updates, right?

416
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:51,820
Yeah, that's the thing. So sometimes I mean we've all been there. You've updated kernel you boot to the new kernel

417
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:58,380
You boot to the new kernel at crap, you know, it's completely trashed now if you're using solace or even arts linux

418
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,780
You know yourself the way the kernel updates work

419
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,420
Your last kernel is gone

420
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,900
It's just completely gone now. You're on the new kernel. You've had the carpet ripped out from underneath your feet

421
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,020
And all the kernel modules are gone. You've got a reboot

422
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,220
So it's all those things now distributions like ubuntu

423
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,900
They use meta packages to depend on the new package they put out, right?

424
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,980
Right, but then you still have all those old packages. You still have the complexity of it

425
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:28,060
You still have poor maintenance of the esp itself where you have something like slash vm linux

426
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,580
How do you jewel boot with that?

427
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,660
It's it's just not really good

428
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:39,260
I mean we've jewel booted for years with legacy boot purely because we all maintain our own separate boot trees

429
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,660
Um, we get away with that, right?

430
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,220
When you start having a boot partition you start to get conflicts when you've got an esp

431
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:50,540
You're almost certainly screwed. So, you know, you need to be able to jewel boot

432
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:55,180
You need to be able to have bulletproof updates and always always always do the right thing

433
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,300
So if something does go wrong, you can just boot back to the old kernel

434
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:05,420
That's going to be a great way to make sure you know feeling comfortable with updates especially kernel updates

435
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,740
Yeah, I mean imagine look at the just look at the hoops that mint goes through to avoid kernel updates

436
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,220
I would much rather just know that I could boot right back into my last configuration if I need to

437
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:19,500
And yeah, I mean that's kind of the main thing now the problem you have like, um, if you use system deep boot

438
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,660
You know, it's basically the same as gummy boot, right?

439
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:28,700
Yeah, and solus a long time ago forked gummy boot when we had the whole fiasco of system d. Oh really swallowing

440
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,620
uh gummy boot

441
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,580
And my reasons there was the whole distro side of it not the actual boot side of it

442
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,660
It was things like the case sensitivity because it's actually a case of case ignorance

443
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,580
Because linux cares fat does not care, but if you try and create two files uppercase and lowercase

444
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,580
Linux is going to scream

445
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:53,260
But fat again doesn't care it would just fail to create the file because it already exists linux doesn't know it exists

446
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,980
So because of problems like this and basically upstream system d didn't care at the time or being able to upgrade from

447
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,380
Gummy boot 49. I think it was to the first system debut again

448
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,300
They didn't want to implement that logic and I wasn't particularly happy

449
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:15,900
So that's why my fork came about but the stuff that went into that that that approach to the esp and the maintenance of it

450
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,660
That's what clear boot manager now does anyway

451
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:19,980
Yeah

452
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,260
So I can now drop a fork I can adopt system debut

453
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,340
And I can have cbm manage all these things the nicer bits that it does

454
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,060
Is it automatically generates and maintains the loader entries on the esp?

455
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,620
So you probably seem like the loader entries star.com files that you have

456
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:41,980
What cbm does is it will emerge the upstream command line files, which is on a per kernel basis

457
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,780
So we could have like linux and linux lts. We have a default command line in those

458
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,180
Yeah, you can have etc command line files as well, which are then merged into it

459
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:56,140
It will dynamically find the root partition and put the root equals part into there as well

460
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:00,300
So you don't have to go looking for block id stuff anymore. Yes. I hate that

461
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,900
You know the pain with that and one of the nicest things it actually does

462
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,540
At the moment, it's limited to draco, but it can actually find out if you're running an encrypted root fs

463
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,420
And put in the lux uuid in there for you

464
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:17,660
Which i've had problems with that with grub and if you're manually creating entries with something like system debut

465
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:20,860
It's very very hard to get all those things consistent

466
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,820
So it does all of this stuff for you create entries just so you're safe all the time

467
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,180
Pop up bless you see kernel linux when I say

468
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,820
I feel like solace is a is a different distribution. Even if it might be a smaller distribution

469
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:38,140
I you know, I think it's something you can't know as a regular end user

470
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,700
Maybe you can tell by certain external properties of a project, but there's no way to really know

471
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:49,420
Unless you listen to these shows I suppose like the heads behind these projects like ike that's you're obviously

472
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:55,260
Solving you're solving a problem there with with clear root manager that red hat's trying to solve the canonical is trying to solve

473
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:01,740
and This seems to be a very very very obvious way to do it after you explain it's like that makes sense

474
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,940
That's of course, that's how we should do it

475
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:06,620
Like this seems like and I really like the the using of prior art

476
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,460
Maybe that isn't well known but seen, you know seeing that diamond in the rough. I'm like this

477
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,300
This is something that everyone can benefit from that. Yeah, that takes a lot. Yeah

478
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,300
I mean a lot of my projects now have been trying to focus on making them distro agnostic

479
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:22,540
So while clear bit manager obviously started out with clear linux to a large extent

480
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:29,740
So you don't have this benefit anymore of you know, having these um, these meta packages and these new dependencies been introduced

481
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,900
You don't have that. You have a static file system contents. There's atomically written to this

482
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,580
This is what you have to work with

483
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,140
So the idea was to turn the update mechanism into the delivery mechanism

484
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,980
So you'll have like these user lib code that you can use to do that

485
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,820
And then you'll have a bunch of other things that you can do that you can do that you can do that

486
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:54,140
Update mechanism into the delivery mechanism. So you'll have like these user lib kernel files that turn up

487
00:34:54,540 --> 00:35:00,140
The only thing that really changes there is the sim link. So you'd have like default lts or default kvm

488
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,780
Those point to the newest kernel. So there's no

489
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,860
There's none of this trying to figure out by the release number or the version

490
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,020
Which is the newest thing because I did that in the past. It doesn't work very well

491
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,620
So it looks at the sim link what whatever's the newest one is the default one

492
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,140
Which should be your basically your head or your tip kernel. Hmm

493
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,140
And it took a while to get that right. But once it started getting fleshed out

494
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,580
It's like this clearly could be used in other places damn

495
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,620
So I set about making that agnostic and i've been trying to do that with a lot of my projects. Yeah, you have I agree

496
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,660
I you know, and I don't I don't agree. Everybody always takes it up

497
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:40,780
Sometimes somebody else somebody else just creates the same idea and uh, but it's a start to try to have less of that

498
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,180
now you think arch would actually uh would be

499
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,580
Would it be open to something like this because I I mean arch is the perfect candidate

500
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:51,340
I agree. They've got a very similar process to the way that solace does it?

501
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,900
You know like you you have this kernel package

502
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,660
And then you have this danger of you're removing a live kernel and live modules from the system

503
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,540
Yeah, and that's just incredibly dangerous and it's got to lead it's got to be the number module breakage

504
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,980
It's got to be got to be the number one rolling cause rolling break

505
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,900
Yeah, I mean my usb no longer works because these modules are buggered off, right?

506
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,820
I can no longer use my speakers or you have all these problems

507
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,900
But yeah, something like this would be very easy for them and it's a very fixed scheme

508
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,340
so you'd have like a user lib kernel and then you'd have like a

509
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:29,340
Kernel dash com dot solace project blah blah blah each one has a a namespace I configure time

510
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:35,660
So you customize it for your distro the the branding stuff that's put into the loader files

511
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,420
That's just taken from the os release file. So it's all standardized stuff

512
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,540
Uh, one of my rules when i'm creating anything and you'll see this even in solace or any other projects I do

513
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,740
Not a lot of what I do is original or new

514
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,500
It's just doing something in a sensible way

515
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:57,580
I'm, not necessarily inventing anything new because again, this is using the existing technology. It's just trying to

516
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,140
Trying to make it sane

517
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,780
Basically, hmm, you know, I feel like uh, well, I guess I'll ask you this question

518
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,500
Do you think the success of the clear boot manager might be dependent on the success of clear linux?

519
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,740
Um, do you think it stands on its own because to me it feels like it stands on its own

520
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,020
Well, I mean it's not one

521
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:23,180
I mean i'm not going to talk about the success or whatever of clear linux because obviously i'm not in capacity to do that

522
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,300
Right

523
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:30,220
But clear bit manager itself while it started out as just a solution for clearing is something that quit very quickly

524
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,540
Became obvious. It had to be agnostic

525
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:37,020
And you know, that's something that's maintained in my own namespace up on github

526
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,180
quite deliberately

527
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,140
and at some stage, I probably will change the name as well because

528
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,260
It was at the time. It was like, okay. What's a generic descriptive name? All right clear bit manager

529
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:53,180
Yeah, I actually I really like it. I think it's actually I think it I think it's very good

530
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,580
I we're going to get it adopted very very soon in solar. So over the next week

531
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,860
I mean i'm on vacation at the moment, but i'm going to be finishing this up over the next

532
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:05,820
Six weeks along with the other solace bits, you know how vacations work. You just go mad at projects

533
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,020
So i'll get that finished up tested once that's in

534
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,820
We can just throw that straight into solace and then immediately everyone is then on

535
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,060
I mean, it's it's been an issue like for over a year in solace

536
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,860
People like I update and then my windows entries are gone because what actually happens there

537
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,140
Is your ntfs and f80 modules have disappeared?

538
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:31,260
And because it's the first time it's trying to load them using os prober. It tries to mount the file systems

539
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:35,420
It can't do them because the modules are gone. So you lose windows from grub

540
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:41,900
And those are the sort of usability problems we've had or i've stuck in my headphones. They're no longer working yet

541
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:47,020
Sorry, you're gonna have to reboot, you know, the whole thing sounds it sounds like it sounds like a really great solution

542
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,580
and I can't wait for solace to ship it because

543
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,820
That's it's an example of something that solace is willing to do that

544
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,300
I just don't think ubuntu is going to do right now or fedora is going to do right now

545
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,380
Um, I maybe I could tell but I think once solace proves it

546
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,980
I think I could see them doing it

547
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:09,420
But I the reason why I mentioned that is because it takes me back to the conversation that noah and I had

548
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,620
months ago where he felt like he was kind of writing off solace because

549
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:21,820
It was some sort of boutique. It was esoteric in a sense and my my point was is it might be slightly boutique at the moment

550
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:28,140
But it is it is in that position where it's it's you guys are the right size and have the right temperament to

551
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:35,340
Implement sweeping changes like this that people that are playing it a little bit safer are not willing to make and the issue is

552
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,260
If you're always living in the little bit safer zone of linux

553
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,660
You kind of miss out on some of the best stuff that's being

554
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:46,620
That's happening and you kind of something you kind of miss out on some of the new solutions to solve the problems like

555
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:49,340
This is gonna this could potentially one day

556
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:55,820
Legitimately lead to bulletproof kernel updates on arch and solace and other distributions. That's a big deal

557
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,860
That's a really big deal. And if you're hanging out on ubuntu

558
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,700
And it's fine

559
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:06,300
But you're gonna miss it until it until it trickles down years down the road and that's totally fine and legitimate for a lot of

560
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,060
People but for some of us

561
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:13,180
You want that now if you're not riding that solace wave or you're not on the arch system or you're not want to insert distro

562
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:18,220
X right, whatever you're gonna miss it and I and I think you guys are in a really great position to do that

563
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:21,020
You guys are in a really great position because you've got a good size user base

564
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,980
So it matters these things matter and you have to be careful

565
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,540
You have to contemplate very carefully about this

566
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:29,500
But you're also not at the size where it's so so large

567
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,820
That 200 people lose their job if everything falls apart. And so I mean that's the thing

568
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,900
we we don't have to play it safe and

569
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,740
One of the things that we have that the other projects done and it's not me blowing smoke up my own arse here, right?

570
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,420
We're one of the very very few independent projects that

571
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,820
is not

572
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,620
Commercial viability is not an aspect in any decision

573
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,380
And that's something that we have that none of the other independent projects have

574
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,500
Because even though they might be independent and they might be you know, they might be 501c or whatever

575
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,460
They still have interests to consider

576
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,060
Whereas we are fully independent. We can go make changes

577
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:13,020
And there isn't a board to satisfy there are no shareholders there to get again frightened by the changes

578
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:17,980
And so we can go in and make the changes that nobody else is willing or able to make

579
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,140
And then you know

580
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,140
They can say that we've done it. Well, it's all right

581
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:27,660
And then it might change their thinking as well and that's one of the things that's it goes back to again

582
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,700
Like, you know, how do you measure success if we get people to rethink how they've been doing these things?

583
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,700
You know, we're the disruptor at the moment when it comes to linux

584
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:44,140
We've chosen desktop linux and we're going to disrupt and make people reconsider the way things have been going on for the last 10

585
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,900
20 years whatever

586
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,620
So if we can only just do that then we've already succeeded

587
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,860
I like I like that how you phrase that especially given how much we talk about fedora

588
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:58,380
As playing kind of a similar role of pushing the edge, but from a very you know red hat comes, you know

589
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,100
It's a very traditional enterprise perspective

590
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,980
Uh, so I like that that solace can come from a very different place and innovate in the same. That's a super good point

591
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:09,980
No, were you were you about to jump in there? Yeah, i'm just gonna say so I think I think saying I wrote

592
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,560
Um solace off might be a slight mischaracterization

593
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,940
So I I think I think that um

594
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,740
I think that really what I was trying to get at was that it's great to have

595
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,020
Uh people that are idealists like ike and I think it's great to have

596
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,680
Projects that have to stop you there because i'm not an idealist. I'm very pragmatic

597
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,280
If you're pragmatic though, why why exclude java java is you know, java is a very needed thing

598
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,680
And there are a lot of apple. It would nobody likes java

599
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,520
I don't like java, but the reality is I need java to do half of the things I do during the day

600
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,280
Uh, well the last time that we tried to use it

601
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:50,240
The last time we tried to use solace. Yeah, java was not working properly and simple help didn't work properly. Oh

602
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,240
Simple, right. I remember. I mean, well anyway, but just electron app and it's not even java. No, it's not electron

603
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,840
Here's the thing we can go on. I mean there there I I can pick it apart piece by piece, right?

604
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,920
We can I could go out and say there's a you know

605
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,760
Like we could go back to the minicom thing. I need to be able to use, you know serial communication

606
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,200
But that my overall point is that you're making you make decisions with the project that say

607
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,640
We're not going to do x because I have a belief system of y and that's a good thing

608
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,400
And I think you should be commended for it. I don't think I don't think you can necessarily say that um,

609
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,520
That that we're on the same level playing field as somebody like a bantu who says here are the requirements of xyz users

610
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,880
Here's what they want to be able to do

611
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,320
Let's accommodate that and make what compromises we need to make to make that distribution useful to those people. Sure

612
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,120
Yeah, all right

613
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,520
But what am I doing then if i'm not making compromises for users and addressing real world needs?

614
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:48,720
To look at and reevaluate problems that have existed for a very long time and lex and i'm already looking at how our

615
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,600
Distribution, would you characterize it? I'm saying they're doing it wrong. Yeah, I am saying that they're doing it wrong

616
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,280
How do I add software to your distribution without compiling it from source?

617
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:02,640
Install it from the repos if we don't have it request it flat pack will be the future method

618
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,480
Okay

619
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:07,360
What if they're okay? Well, right? What how do I do it right now?

620
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,560
If it's not in the repos and I don't want to compile it from source, but I just want to install the software

621
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,680
How do I get it then request it? Okay, you have to install it from source

622
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,360
I just want to install the software. How do I get it then request it? Okay, you have a book tracker

623
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,840
And in fact, we redid the requirements after that last how should we say?

624
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,640
mild fiasco

625
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,480
We've redid the requirements because I basically said the same as everyone else the requirements were complete bullshit

626
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,160
We know they were bullshit, right?

627
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,680
But we hadn't had a discussion about it until that point they've been read

628
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,640
But you still have a gatekeeper you still have ultimately you still have a person that decides this can be right

629
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:48,400
But that's no different to debian or abuntu. You still have to request a package that's not there. That's not entirely true

630
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:55,200
Right, but somebody else has had to package it. How is it different from solace when somebody has to package it?

631
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
Could I not package it myself on abuntu?

632
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,840
Yes, but

633
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,240
I can't do that around in a circle from what you've just said

634
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,400
You said if it's not on solace and you know, I I would then have to package it

635
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,240
That's a bad thing on solace, but you're then allowed to package it on a bun too

636
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,360
What i'm saying what i'm saying is it what i'm saying is

637
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,800
That as an if I was a software you could make your own you could make your own custom

638
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,480
I could make my own ppa. I could just make a dead file

639
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,320
If you want ppa support and solace ask me and i'll set it up i'm not an augur off in the distance

640
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,920
If there is demand for it, I will happily do these things there has to be an actual demand

641
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:44,000
But I guess my my my my I guess my overall point is the fact that we're having this discussion now

642
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,240
Rather like you didn't you didn't see that people would want to add

643
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,000
A software and if you didn't have your own method you wouldn't have included ppa that that's something that

644
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,000
After we've already had the discussion of it being a boutique or not boutique distribution

645
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,680
Now we're having the discussion of how we're going to maybe include ppas

646
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,400
And so if we go back to the core problem here, it's about software availability, right?

647
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,200
The thing is if you want something like ppas, you also need people willing to maintain those ppas

648
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,760
You know, you can't just say

649
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,040
Because i'm wasting money i'm pissing money in the wind if I do that, right? It doesn't help anyone

650
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:24,640
We've got to a point now where we have people coming through and I think so far we had something like 15,000 patches

651
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,480
With multiple revisions come through to solace from the community. We're at a point now where our tooling is in place

652
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:37,840
Where we're switching our infrastructure over. There's actually an open bug for this to allow community maintainers for packages within solace

653
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,560
So that that in itself isn't really a problem

654
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,680
There has to be people willing to package those things our packaging is very very very simple

655
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,880
I made our policies very very simple for those to do that now

656
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:54,160
Yes, the software isn't completely there at the moment, but then again, we're not exactly an old project

657
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,760
So there are going to always be things that you want and aren't there yet

658
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,680
If you want them ask us someone's going to put it in it might even be us now because people from the community are doing it

659
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,920
It takes time to build things up

660
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,160
But it takes even longer to build them up properly and that's what we've been doing

661
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,760
So you say that you're so would you say your position has changed from the last time?

662
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:21,600
We had a conversation where you said that part of your part of your part of your methodology was to exclude software that you didn't think was

663
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,060
appropriate or well maintained

664
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:29,820
I've been more lax on it. Yes, right because first of all, we had a policy that's basically come through

665
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:36,380
From the evolve os days and you have certain protective policies in place because at the time, you know your capabilities

666
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:41,820
You know your size and you know your your technology at the time our tooling very much sucked

667
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:45,420
And we didn't even have white package or soul build back then

668
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:52,860
So there are certain things we basically said absolutely no way in hell are going in because it's going to cause us grief down the road

669
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:57,020
We've now got to a point where white package soul built all of these tools exist

670
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:02,620
And it's very very very trivial for anyone to just sit there and package something. It's a yaml file

671
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:08,220
You know, we've got a troop builder. You don't need to install a ton of dependencies on the system. It's very very easy

672
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,340
So it's allowed me to be more lax on them. Did I take too long in doing the policy?

673
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:19,340
Probably but the the conversation wasn't properly had we saw how it went someone went and bitched on reddit

674
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:23,500
That's that's not how you do things. You know people normally know i'm very upfront, you know

675
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,100
I'll be very blunt about things but go and whingeing behind me back on reddit

676
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,100
It's not going to do anyone any favors

677
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:34,300
Raise it up with me and we'll fix it. I would respectfully i'd respectfully disagree with the characterization there as well

678
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:36,460
You know, it's one thing to you know

679
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:42,540
To me complaining on reddit is simply going to reddit before taking any other action and right but I hadn't seen it

680
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,820
This is this is the point if it didn't go to me, how was I going to know here?

681
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:50,300
But so where on the solace site does it tell me that I need to direct solace project.com?

682
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,980
There's a tracker link in the bottom

683
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:56,780
But my point is that he attempted to go through what you know based on based on his

684
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,940
Based on the time constraints that he had he went through to try to submit an issue to you guys

685
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,060
He got formal communication back from the solace project

686
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,060
Maybe maybe you had or had not seen it

687
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:08,140
But how is he supposed to know that you know?

688
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,620
What i'm saying is like if I submit something to canonical

689
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,780
I don't wait for mark to come back and say

690
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:17,340
Hey, you know i'd say did mark personally review this when I submit something to system 76. I don't make sure that well

691
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,020
You're making a very unfair comparison there, right?

692
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:27,100
We are not the size of canonical. We do not have 700 employees fine fine compare it to altus

693
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:32,140
I have five. I have five the lead developer personally review every single issue that comes through our company

694
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:37,740
I delegate out to other people and I would expect that a customer wouldn't expect me to review every single issue as well

695
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:43,820
So I think that I think that I think that just because that you didn't personally see it to then and then after he took

696
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:50,060
Steps to submit it to you and then was rejected and after that process completed then went on reddit and said here was my experience

697
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:53,820
I think to characterize that as complaining, you know, that might be a bit unfair to him

698
00:49:54,860 --> 00:50:01,340
Right, but what i'm saying, right long story short is could have complained then say look let's look at the policy

699
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,980
Nobody then said let's look at the policy and i've said we took too long in fixing the policy

700
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,660
But we did put a policy in place. It wasn't the right way to go around it

701
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:14,060
And that's all it comes down to I I suppose and that's a matter of opinion at the same time

702
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,700
I also don't think it's necessarily appropriate to expect your users to uh

703
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:24,380
To suggest policy revisions to to the project because you know like to for to a large example

704
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:31,580
As a user if a software company or software project doesn't meet my needs or isn't willing to work with me at some point

705
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:36,140
I just say okay. That's the direction they want to go. I'll go a different direction. That's fine. Hmm

706
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,660
All right, look everyone's entitled to their own opinion

707
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:47,420
But we are talking about someone who did provide a patch right and that incur that it does infer not just a user

708
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:51,580
Right. So let's get that one out of the way. That is a contributor and a developer

709
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,180
Yes, they had a bad experience, but that was the policy at the time

710
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,300
Yeah, and at the time the policy said no this thing can't go in well

711
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,740
Which was fair because the policy that then said this thing is basically dead. It's abandoned, right?

712
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,780
Then we did revise the policy afterwards. Yes

713
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:11,500
It wasn't exactly a great experience the way it turned out and I don't think anyone wanted to turn out that way

714
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:16,860
Me and that particular guy spoke and read it afterwards and we said we said it didn't really need to go this way

715
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:20,780
Right and and I followed that conversation one minor correction to chat room is reminding me

716
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:25,020
It wasn't uh, it wasn't simple, uh note that I had problems with it was simple help

717
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:31,100
Uh, and which which heavily relies on java just one minor correction. So yeah, we've only got open jdk at the moment

718
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:34,860
I guess we do like the oracle jdk. So I just want to might be part of it

719
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:39,020
I just want to step in here for a second and just say, you know when I uh, when I think about this

720
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:43,740
uh, I think what I what I what I do take away is, uh

721
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:52,380
Almost every time he comes on the show he's evolved in a way that's logical and and understandable on a position

722
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:57,580
Uh, like you know, he just sprinkles and you know things like flat pack bombs and things like that in his conversation generally

723
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:03,500
But that's a huge that is a huge change from where you started originally on this show and I

724
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,140
as someone who also um

725
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:12,060
Tries to allow myself to change my mind on things and just you know get get into something and then decide to change it

726
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:18,540
Because I feel like if I don't evolve my position that i'm not taking in new information. I'm not taking in new input

727
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:24,220
I'm not considering all of my possibilities if I just stay really fast and on a particular course

728
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:25,820
so I

729
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:29,100
I guess I I I look at this and I think we'll we'll

730
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:34,060
Screw all of this crap. Let's move forward and just get flat packs. Like if this i'm i'm sick

731
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,140
I am so sick of this conversation

732
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:40,300
Let's get flat packs up in here and you know what i'll install the three programs

733
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,380
I need that aren't in the repo at this point

734
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:47,180
Maybe two at this point that aren't in the repo from flat packs. I'm good. I'm good

735
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,780
But it comes down to a simple thing. It's it's

736
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,020
The solo started off very very very very tiny. It was basically just me

737
00:52:55,580 --> 00:53:00,220
Originally making something for myself. It grew a lot quicker than I expected

738
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,420
You know, it's it's had problems. It's had growing pains

739
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:08,220
And every so often, you know, we go through this new expansion right now

740
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:12,700
We're right on the edge of one and you always know when it's coming because you can feel the tension

741
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:17,260
We have this kind of debates as well. God, do I know what you mean? They do happen, right?

742
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:22,780
And at the moment we're on the verge of expanding again. It's like an exponential growth. We do it every few months, right?

743
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:28,220
And the the problem we have right now and it's it's basically a meme solace has no software, right?

744
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,620
And yes, it's valid

745
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:35,420
But the thing is we're willing to look at ourselves and say right this thing isn't being done, right?

746
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:41,260
We could do it better. So in terms of maintenance load and core software availability

747
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:46,480
We're basically moving all of our infrastructure into fabricator, which is the dev.solaceproject.com

748
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:52,940
What that'll allow us to do is allow people within the community to own a git repo within solace

749
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:57,980
Which corresponds directly to a package. They'll be able to publish it directly to the unstable repo

750
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,980
Obviously we'll have checks and stuff. Don't worry about that

751
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,860
But for the core repo, we're going to go from just a few gatekeepers and that kind of is the problem here

752
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,500
Isn't it? It's gatekeepers, which is what noah said, right?

753
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,980
We'll go from just having a few select few to a basically this tick list

754
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:18,380
Of what is okay to go in and we've even got a two distro role if it's in two mainstream distros, you know

755
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:20,380
It goes in

756
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:25,900
Interesting for sure. Yeah, because it was it was it was so anal but it protected us during growth

757
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:30,620
So then we'll have this checklist. It's there's a few things that it basically says, you know

758
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,580
Like if it's introducing huge stack complexity

759
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,580
Whoever said getting this half the fun never

760
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:42,700
Whoa, whoa kaira. Sorry over eager kaira was very excited about you

761
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,340
Huge stack that was really scary

762
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:49,180
That was one of the scariest things ever happened on this show actually

763
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:55,180
Yeah, if it introduces like really large complexity, um, like something like plasma then someone would have to maintain it because yeah

764
00:54:55,340 --> 00:55:00,540
Okay, we can't do it ourselves. That's very logical outside of the core applications. We're we're gonna back flat pack

765
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:02,540
We're gonna help get them hosted, you know

766
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:07,580
Like and we've done the the gl validation for the the open gl driver support nvidia and stuff

767
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,700
So there will be choice. It's not all completely there now

768
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:13,180
But if you look at it the the last year or so

769
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:19,660
We've been building that engine that core part of solus and defining what solus actually is, right?

770
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,380
Now it's the time when we say let's flesh it out

771
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:28,220
Let's legitimize ourselves as a distro and that's where we're at now. So we've been a project we've

772
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:32,060
Focused on the os aspect for it for a very long time

773
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:37,900
And now it's about legitimizing ourselves as a distro as a larger player within the scene

774
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,300
And yeah, we're going to want the community to help us do that

775
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,900
You know, it's like kaira says getting there is half the fun and we're watching

776
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:48,940
Just like people are watching last go through a a transition, uh, you know

777
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,780
we watch solus in some sense go through a transition and uh, I

778
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:58,140
I don't know. I so I find that all to be I find I find everything from from flat packs to clear boot manager

779
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,980
To the latest mate all to be extremely interesting development. So thank you for coming on

780
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,340
I'll say one last thing before I go now

781
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:10,780
A lot of things I say are a lot of things I say about solace. I'm not saying in a blanket statement way

782
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,180
solace is for

783
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:17,100
Some people it's not for everyone. It's the same as for budgie. It's for some people

784
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:21,420
It's not for everyone when i've complained about things like valor before it's

785
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,460
It's good for certain jobs. It's not good for everything, right?

786
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,340
Use the right tool for the job

787
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:33,680
We need to stop being so religious and trying to blanket apply these things to every given situation

788
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,780
Solace is not trying to dominate every market

789
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,140
It is trying to go for the home and give users a good experience

790
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:45,020
That does not mean we're going on satellites and we're going on servers or raspberry pies

791
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:47,980
We've a given focus if it doesn't work for you. That's great

792
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:53,820
We work on projects that go on over distributions to work with us on those things. Hmm. I like that boy

793
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,900
That's a great philosophy. I got one question for you

794
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:58,460
Uh bungee 11. What am I getting it?

795
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:04,940
Bungee 11. What's this shit? I know budgie. What is it? Should be right, right? Yeah, we're doing 10.3 first

796
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,580
Because we have some issues with

797
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,340
I don't want it. Yeah, it's old. It's crusty. It's

798
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,900
It's well refined it works good. It's stable well

799
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:20,140
Apart from all who wants those don't even get started on the alt. Okay. Okay

800
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:26,620
So budgie 11 we're looking to have that basically in next quarter and we're we're right on there to going into next quarter now

801
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:32,220
And we will be one in testing on that and i'm gonna i'm gonna try and see if we can do some kind of

802
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,580
Unstable testing images so you can just download them and give them a go

803
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:38,860
Don't know how that's going to be working yet

804
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:44,700
But yeah, I mean that'd be kind of cool if you can just get like unstable builds of budgie and try it out

805
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:49,900
Yeah, I think that'll be and maybe submit a few times. It's gonna be a few months. Yeah, very good. Very good

806
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:53,100
Yeah, all right kind of stay tuned. Well, thank you very much, sir

807
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,940
Thank you for taking the time and like kairos is getting there is half the journey and half the fun

808
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:01,100
I know that i'm coming i'm gonna go but texas you're about to find out you know what dylan my son

809
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:07,660
That my my drive down to texas lands right on the spring break. Yeah, so he's gonna he's gonna go with us

810
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:10,140
He'll be there the whole trip. It's gonna be a ton of fun

811
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:14,860
Uh, and you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna use my ting my fi i'll have a cdma and gsm

812
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:20,940
My fi go to linux.ting.com to sign up you get a twenty five dollar dollar discount if you sign up or

813
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,500
If you're bringing advice

814
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:27,100
They give you twenty five dollars in service credit now your average ting bill twenty three dollars

815
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:32,060
Can you believe that I heard an ad for a network the other day

816
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:36,800
It was just 23 or no actually it was 22. It was just 22

817
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,640
22 for the entire line that's before your usage

818
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:48,240
That's before that 22 just to add in a line a line 22 ting is six dollars

819
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,880
Gsm and cdma six dollars

820
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:59,920
22 just for the line, you know, it's six dollars and you pay for what you use minutes messages megabytes

821
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,160
You add them up whatever you use. That's what you pay

822
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:07,440
It's really easy to keep track of too because they got apps for your mobile device and they have a totally killer website

823
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:12,320
They also have really good customer service if you need to talk to a human being and get some actual support from a geek

824
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,840
Ting's ting's got that they have cdma and gsm

825
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,320
So you can either bring a device or pick whatever works best for you

826
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:24,400
I'm mentioning that because that's huge for me right now because most of my trip i'll be on gsm

827
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:31,120
But there will definitely absolutely without question be times where I need a cdma network and that's what's so great about ting

828
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:34,640
I got the tools to keep control. I can turn them off when i'm done. That's something else

829
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:38,240
I think that is maybe overlooked because there's no contract. There's no really termination fee

830
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,400
You can turn the line on for two months and turn it off

831
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:46,320
I got this little tracker that I was i've been thinking about putting in the rig again so people can track the trip

832
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,680
Well, I i'm like I use that once a year

833
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,400
Am I seriously gonna go get a contract or i'm sorry. It's not a an agreement

834
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:58,660
Am I gonna for for something to use once a year? No, that's ridiculous

835
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:03,140
I'll put it on the cdma network. I'll pay it for one month and then i'm done

836
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:10,420
I can use these devices like the tools they are linux.ting.com go there check them out

837
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,980
And you know what since we had a little random kyra

838
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:16,340
Let's go get an app pick from kyra because they otherwise that's just like we got

839
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:21,620
Hanging kyras, so we got to get this in here. Whoever said getting there is half the fun never flew economy

840
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:24,500
Oh, i'm kyra and this is the ting app of the week take the rv kyra

841
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,500
Tripcase

842
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:32,260
Tripcase aims to take the trouble out of travel. If they don't already have a slogan

843
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:34,100
They're welcome to use that one

844
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,340
The first time you try tripcase, it might blow your mind when you get a travel email confirmation

845
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:44,260
Just forward it to trips at tripcase.com. That's it. All the relevant details of your trip are now on your phone

846
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:48,500
If there's a change in your itinerary if your flight is delayed or the gate changes

847
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:53,380
You'll be among the first to know tripcase can send you a push notification of changes if you give it the okay

848
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:57,700
It's about more than air travel though tripcase can help you plan your trip on the ground too

849
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:00,980
See details on your hotel check-in and out as part of your itinerary

850
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:05,380
See what the weather is like at your destination with a 10-day forecast. Is that perfect or what?

851
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:08,980
Tripcase has detailed maps of many airports, which is super handy

852
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:11,140
Especially if you have time to kill before you fly out

853
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:16,420
All right, decide what you want to do while you're visiting by pinning attractions appointments and stuff. You want to see on a map

854
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,900
You can even get driving directions or book a ride with uber with a couple of caps

855
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:26,340
Damn dude two cases free in the apple app store and in the google play store. All right links are directly below. Thanks. Kyra

856
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:32,020
Thanks for watching subscribe to ting on youtube and get the latest app of the week episodes quick unboxings reviews and much more

857
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,580
until next time

858
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,820
Linux.ting.com

859
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:41,800
It's mobile that makes sense. Thank you to ting for sponsoring the unplugged program

860
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,900
Now let's roll into a few more updates just really quick

861
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:51,220
First one I like a lot here. This is a big one for the beard serious sam fusion 2017 is rolling into public beta

862
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:55,060
He says this is a great game. You ever played any serious sam. Oh, yeah, I have not

863
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:58,180
Oh, actually, that's not true. I've played one. I've played one of the serious sam

864
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:03,380
also, there's going to be vr support and the other thing that's really big is

865
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:10,500
Vulcan support. In fact core team is bringing vulcan to their linux ports. This is another big publisher

866
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:15,620
That's going to be using vulcan. Awesome. Yeah, man. This is this is a huge deal actually. Uh, so

867
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:20,360
It's in beta right now 64 bit vulcan multi-threaded rendering

868
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,940
Totally new save system all of that buzzwords, man

869
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:29,460
All the buzzwords buzzwords I love also while we're in the sort of media consumption category

870
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:34,260
This is no longer a valve update, but so we'll close the valve section. Goodbye. Um,

871
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:37,640
mozilla has proposed obsidian

872
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,240
Obsidian

873
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:45,640
Do you know what obsidian is? I don't well besides being obviously what the original user. Hold on. Hold on a second

874
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:51,160
Hold on west. I got you got this. We can't gotta get out of the I gotta get these out of my pajamas

875
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:53,160
But I feel like we can't go any further

876
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,720
I feel like I would be negligent. Yes, you would in my duties as a host of the show

877
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,920
define obsidian

878
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:06,280
Obsidian a hard dark glass-like volcanic rock formed by the rapid

879
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,380
solidification of lava without crystallization

880
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:14,940
Obviously, I think the irc is right though. We can't forget about the obsidian order. Uh, you know, yes, right, right

881
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:22,060
The obsidian order is uh, one of my favorite uh groups of uh spies that are directly modeled after our own cia

882
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:28,700
Which is pretty frightening. So obsidian has been published as a possible pro proposal from mozilla as the next web gl

883
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:30,700
technology

884
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:33,980
Yeah as a as something, you know, you probably stay hip to this

885
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:37,580
but the kronos group has been getting ready for web gl next

886
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:43,580
And they've been looking for for new proposals on the on the next version of web gl and guess who one of the first

887
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,220
to submit a proposal was

888
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:48,220
mozilla foundation

889
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:52,940
Uh, they say this is a draft proposal for the new gpu api for the web called obsidian

890
01:03:53,100 --> 01:04:00,240
It's a low level api that provides maximum feature set for the gpu to web applications. The api is designed for web assembly

891
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,240
Web assembly

892
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:09,040
Modern gpus and multi-threaded environments now web assembly just recently shipped in firefox as a default feature

893
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:15,360
It's kind of a big deal also shipping in chrome's latest I think version 53 and it's in web kits development builds

894
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,880
but not in any uh, like safari or anything, uh

895
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:26,640
Now mozilla already has a prototype that's been built into servo which provides a metal like api in web idl for javascript backed by

896
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,880
Vulcan

897
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:34,240
Yeah, so this this is this this is a big deal this obsidian thing could work out to for my reasons

898
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,160
I'm glad mozilla is still around. Yeah. Yeah, because otherwise

899
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,960
Who knows who would be pushing this agenda? Yeah, exactly

900
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,600
Now I also wonder why we're in the media section

901
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:48,880
And I know we have we have a big conversation still to get into but I wanted to talk about this really quick

902
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:54,020
Because I think this is going to be one of those things that silently passes in the night, but it has long-term ramifications

903
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,040
Uh at midnight on march 20th

904
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,040
2017

905
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:02,660
Dolby's last relevant patent on dolby digital

906
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,500
expired

907
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,020
So we're talking ac3 here

908
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:12,340
So if you have ac3 audio in any television show you've ever captured any television show or movie you've ever downloaded

909
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:20,260
Um, in fact some cameras record an ac3 audio all digital television is a it's mandatory actually for digital television

910
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:25,860
a lot of internet streams actually come in ac3 that are high fidelity netflix can use ac3 to give you a

911
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,860
Like a surround sound

912
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:35,060
Yeah, uh, and if you take out all references to dolby and any dolby properties, you can now ship ac3 technically

913
01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:37,140
This is this is huge. It's out of patent now

914
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:43,060
yeah, and uh, you can find out more at ac3 the number three freedom day.org and uh, if you

915
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:49,140
First of all, if you've ever played for the fluendo media pack like I have a couple of times you were paying for ac3

916
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:54,180
That's going to go away. Now. That's just you can just be included in the in the distro now, I would assume

917
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:56,100
um

918
01:05:56,100 --> 01:06:00,100
And it also means that most live tv content can now be legally decoded

919
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:07,220
Most recorded tv content from like a pvr legally decoded videos from dvd or blu-ray the audio can be legally decoded now

920
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:09,140
um

921
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:11,140
some camcorders and uh

922
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:16,420
Mostly netflix and maybe hulu that uses ac3 in their streams. I'm not sure

923
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:22,180
And maybe amazon anybody that offers but you see it a lot it established. Oh, yeah, man. Yeah, it's all over the place

924
01:06:22,180 --> 01:06:26,100
So pretty much all of the videos I play back on my media box

925
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:28,740
Probably have ac3 audio

926
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,340
Almost all of them

927
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,300
So that's a big deal

928
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,500
And again, you can you can find a link in the show notes if if you want to check it out

929
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:39,780
I I it's funny because it's one of those things where one day you don't even notice it, right? It's just eventually

930
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:46,740
Distros will start. Well, it's been it's been six months. I haven't sued anybody like to get let's just include it

931
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:50,020
And then just all of a sudden you're just legally playing files. You didn't even realize

932
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,020
Right. It's like it used to it used to be

933
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:54,660
back

934
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:57,620
Back in my day

935
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:02,900
We we couldn't even play mp3 files or mp4 files. You couldn't even play an h264 file, right?

936
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,780
And and and now the kids today

937
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:10,980
They're just they're just randomly playing mp3 files or randomly playing h264 files

938
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:15,060
And now their ac3 is just gonna work like nothing. They didn't they didn't buy a codec back

939
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,220
They didn't have to extract it put into a dot folder

940
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:22,900
Right kids today. Yeah, there was no, you know sketchy. Ooh, uh g-streamer bad ugly. Ah,

941
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:27,140
Right. Yes. Oh my god. Oh, oh, man. All right

942
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:31,060
So there's a topic that i've been wanting to discuss and i'm really glad that noah's here because I think he's going to be

943
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,300
Uh somebody that's going to chime in on this. Uh, but before we go I got it

944
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:38,900
I gotta think I gotta do this because I even just recently

945
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:42,980
Just recently spun up a digital ocean droplet tried out an open source project

946
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:47,300
Did a little hmm and ha and and then just destroyed the droplet and probably in two hours

947
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:52,900
I was done a digital ocean dot com go there and use our promo code do unplug to support the show

948
01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:58,580
This is a great way to get a linux rig with a crazy great 40 gigabyte connection all ssd storage

949
01:07:58,820 --> 01:08:05,380
Kvm for the virtualizer with data centers in new york, san franc, singapore, afghan, london, toronto, germany and dimension b

950
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:10,420
They got them everywhere. You have a great control panel. That's really easy to use super intuitive

951
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:14,020
If you're a total noob that does barely kind of understands what a server is

952
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:18,180
Maybe you've never even heard the team the term uh vps before or a droplet

953
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:21,220
You're gonna be able to use this if you've been setting up virtual servers for a decade

954
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:26,260
You're gonna be able to use this and best it this is like do you use the api because i'm oh, yeah

955
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:28,340
Oh, yeah, totally. Oh, man. I

956
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:33,140
That's me throwing a piece of paper around because i'm so excited about the api

957
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:36,660
For me, I use it every single day multiple times a day. What kind of things do you use it for?

958
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:41,300
Well, I what my favorite part about one you can just use it like I mean i've used my own scripts

959
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:47,300
But because it's so easy a ton of community stuff like vagrant, right vagrant has a have a writer

960
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:51,860
Basically any scripting component they probably have a like drop in digital ocean

961
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:55,300
Just you spin up a droplet you run your code there done couple of open source projects

962
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:59,620
I've checked out have a button on their website that uses the api and you click the button and then it

963
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:02,420
It just connects to your account and spins up a droplet with the whole stack

964
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:08,500
I'm going to lts docker a container with I mean, it's just like one button and you have the whole thing

965
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:16,180
And I feel like 2017 is up there right like even before some of the more maybe quote-unquote enterprise providers

966
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:18,660
You'll get a dio plug-in before you're going to get one

967
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:21,780
Yeah, and and you know part of that too is they have incredible pricing

968
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:25,060
So it starts at five dollars a month, but you can pay hourly too, which is nuts

969
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:30,260
And then on top they've layered on these incredible services that are integrated right into the dashboard

970
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:37,940
they're part of the api their their first class like load balancers block storage high ram systems like it's it's

971
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,220
Every move they have made has been really smart

972
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:46,660
And it's I think why they've just rocketed to the top digital ocean.com use our promo code dio unplug that lets them know

973
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:48,900
You heard about it here, which means they keep us going

974
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:53,700
But also it gives you a ten dollar credit try out the five dollar rig or my favorite

975
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:56,580
The three cents an hour rig with a ten dollar credit

976
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:00,360
It really makes it there's there's several projects you could try with that digital ocean.com

977
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:04,980
Give it a go build your back end infrastructure your future website your personal blog

978
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:10,100
Or just toy around and learn more at digital ocean.com dio unplugged is the promo code you use

979
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,660
After you sign up

980
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,060
Let's do a little elephant in the room discussion

981
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:19,060
There is uh, there is a real serious reality

982
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:24,340
It's not something that we're totally shy of but there's a real serious reality that for desktop linux to be relevant and be successful

983
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:31,380
Long term, we're just going to have to have a whole crap ton of web apps universal apps. Maybe some are web assembly some are electron

984
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:32,900
just

985
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,940
A desktop full of them simple node slack

986
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:37,940
skype

987
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:39,940
everyday business tools

988
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:46,180
Web applications now and it's just going to there's everybody has their pet favorites. It's just going to increase right?

989
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:53,060
Um, and I thought I thought this was kind of an interesting blog post about uh setting a just a let's just embrace this

990
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:56,740
And set a dot web app file standard. So it's a file type

991
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:00,600
Dot web app and it's a free desktop specification

992
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:04,580
And if you use something like natafire, which we're going to talk about a little bit more here in a second

993
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:09,940
This would be a way to just make a real simple. Here's the way here's the dot file the dot web app

994
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,660
This is where you create this how you create the menu structure for it

995
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:15,940
This is the icon all this stuff like it's like it's it's like a known standard

996
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:20,580
And in part part of what I read this is like, oh geez, this is this is not the direction. I want things to go

997
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:21,940
so

998
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:23,940
but then I thought about it it's like

999
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:29,140
You have tools like natafire you have people that are distributing their entire applications and electron like n1

1000
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:35,220
Yeah is one that I still use today. I mean how many people use uh, adam or visual studio totally every day. Absolutely

1001
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:38,100
and in some ways

1002
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:44,600
This is critical for future expansion of the desktop I think for linux because it it's platform neutralizing

1003
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:51,640
Uh, but we all are like intimately aware of what the problems are many of them are closed source completely closed source

1004
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:55,320
Many of them require some sort of backend infrastructure, which is also closed source

1005
01:11:55,320 --> 01:12:00,760
And in some cases has pervasive user tracking that violates your privacy and all of them so far

1006
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:06,520
Seem to have a performance overhead when compared to native applications that is less than ideal

1007
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,480
um, and so these are like obvious

1008
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:15,000
Problems with that web applications, but then like at the same part the same time the advocate of me says

1009
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,760
Yeah, but screw all that stuff. I want linux to be the successful prominent desktop platform one day

1010
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,400
um

1011
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:25,740
And you know there are some advantages

1012
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,200
As time goes on I start to suspect that

1013
01:12:30,200 --> 01:12:38,760
Once again, we're never going to agree on a on a universal packaging format. There's going to be app images and flat packs and snaps

1014
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:44,280
And we're never going to have a universal packaging format. It's never going to really be something that all distros support

1015
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:47,400
It's never going to happen, but you know what is universal the web

1016
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,480
so

1017
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,480
Why not bypass all this bullshit?

1018
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:56,200
All this crap that the linux community can't get their shit together around and just deliver a web app

1019
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,360
plus

1020
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:01,560
large industrial vendors like adobe and autocad and others

1021
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,520
especially with things

1022
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,840
Like mozilla's initiative around webgl next

1023
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:13,480
There could be like legitimate performance possibilities in an electron app in a web app

1024
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:20,360
And and they could just bypass dot exe they can bypass dmgs. They can bypass flat packs

1025
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:23,960
Here's the web app. Here's you can download for these different systems. Here's the web app

1026
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:30,360
It almost and then plus the other benefit would be of course that it's available to a shit ton more developers and and people can target

1027
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:37,240
Many platforms so it's much easier to carve out some revenue because you can get a couple of cheapo mac users to pay

1028
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:41,800
You can get a few ten tens of thousands of windows users and a few linux enthusiasts to pay

1029
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,680
And so you're not tied to one platform to make your money

1030
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:49,800
So when microsoft finally kills the desktop and makes it just a linux based os and apple makes ios for the desktop

1031
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:52,040
You you're not completely screwed. So

1032
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:55,400
You're not completely screwed. So you've diversified your income sources

1033
01:13:55,560 --> 01:14:03,320
So it's obvious for developers too because you bypass distribution standards you bypass app stores you bypass packaging issues you bypass dependent on a platform

1034
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:09,720
It's a it mean like if i'm adobe and i'm going to commit the next 15 years of development to something

1035
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,800
It almost seems like a foregone conclusion

1036
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:17,560
Which means as linux users we have to accept that our future is going to be tied to back-end services that require monthly payments

1037
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:24,760
Invade our privacy and web applications that don't run as fast as they should even though we now have these badass kit car

1038
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,560
Style systems with an entirely open source platform

1039
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,400
And we're running these closed source applications connected to closed source backends that run like shit

1040
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:40,440
Is this a reality that we have to face and is there some sort of middle in here that i'm not seeing

1041
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:44,680
What do you think wes and i'm gonna and after that i'm gonna i'd love to toss it around the chat room

1042
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:48,200
I'd like joe's in here. I'd love to toss it to joe. See what he thinks kernel linux is in here

1043
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:51,880
I'd like to get his thoughts, but i'll let you start. I think there's a lot of things they're tied together

1044
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,080
Uh, especially especially the proprietary aspect. Um

1045
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,400
We're gonna have proprietary software. We do already either way

1046
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:05,240
I think there's a there's a legitimate case that's frequently made on this network that we do want that that we want that as part

1047
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:10,360
Of our success whether whether or not an individual linux user wants that or not may be different right? We all have opinions there

1048
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,880
um

1049
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,880
I think there is a good case that you know that we are tied to these backend services. But again

1050
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,440
When you get google drive integration in files on gnome

1051
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:22,200
That's the same thing, right?

1052
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:28,360
Like you're still tied to proprietary service what the front end there doesn't really matter good point where I see it from the development side

1053
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:34,040
I agree. Like there's some things that it makes sense for and some not uh, i'm running hyper.is or it's like the term

1054
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:38,360
It's a terminal written in electron. I don't know if that makes sense. It's pretty snappy honestly terminal

1055
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:43,000
Yes, I mean a generic, you know, you can run whatever shell you want in it. Really? Yeah

1056
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:47,480
Here's a here's a shell. It feels very snappy. I've I only just installed it looks good

1057
01:15:47,560 --> 01:15:51,720
It's in an app image. It does let you then right you have the full html if you want

1058
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,280
My mind is spinning right now and that's on the edge for me

1059
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:55,400
I don't know if that makes sense, right?

1060
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:58,840
And I wouldn't I wouldn't necessarily do like a tiny little app, right?

1061
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:01,560
You don't need a full chrome thing just to draw a little bit

1062
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:07,720
But on the flip side if you've spent your career developing interactive web apps, you're using d3 you're using other things

1063
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:12,040
Are you really going to go spend your time learning gtk? No, maybe qt

1064
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:15,560
I think qt has the strongest case right in terms of cross-platform availability

1065
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:22,360
But what where where electron shines is because it's javascript and it's web and that is reach and if you're a developer with limited time

1066
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:26,280
You're not excited about linux or windows or mac you're excited about the product you're making right?

1067
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:27,880
But okay, so let me ask joe this so joe

1068
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:28,760
What about the users though?

1069
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:32,440
Because like one of the reasons I switched to linux is because I was sick of bad performance on other systems

1070
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,080
One of the reasons I switched to linux is because I want a transparency of code

1071
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:39,560
One of the reasons I switched to linux is because I wanted long-term visibility of where a project was going

1072
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:44,600
And what's the point of having a gpl kernel and gpl user land tools in a gpl desktop environment?

1073
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:49,000
If i'm running a closed source application, is this is this a compromise too far joe?

1074
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:57,480
Well, I think it's not a compromise too far for most people because most pragmatic people will use a bit of proprietary software

1075
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:02,840
On the desktop regardless, but I think that you're kind of looking at this from the wrong angle here

1076
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:08,280
You see you're talking about um these kind of consumer applications like skype

1077
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,120
Although I suppose skype's a bit of a business application, but you see the thing is the desktop is

1078
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:21,800
More or less dead or at least dying and everyone is moving to mobile right except for the professionals using

1079
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:26,200
Big software like people that want to get their work done

1080
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:32,280
Yeah, and that kind of stuff is it's very very difficult to make that into web apps, isn't it?

1081
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:35,080
Yeah, well, I think today it is but I don't know about long term

1082
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:41,880
And so you think that maybe long term that is the way to get I don't know if big video editors and stuff over to

1083
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,760
God, I hope so in some ways

1084
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,160
Because otherwise it's never going to happen

1085
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:50,520
I really think the only choice I think the only the only

1086
01:17:50,980 --> 01:17:55,560
Realistic shot that linux has is that adobe releases premiere for linux at this point

1087
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,100
And the only way they're going to do that is if there's something that is substantially

1088
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:03,900
Especially better to move to that is like the next 10 years plus for their platform

1089
01:18:03,980 --> 01:18:07,500
I would think otherwise why not just keep releasing native builds for windows and mac

1090
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:12,140
The other benefit maybe could be that it it does make it right if you can get better

1091
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:18,540
Web acceleration use of those hardware components other things that you need the differentiated web app from a real app

1092
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,060
Then you've solved it for everyone

1093
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:23,500
But if you've got something like obsidian and you start getting like a standard for audio

1094
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:26,540
And you start getting a standard for local database cache and stuff like that

1095
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:29,020
You get to a point where you essentially have

1096
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:34,140
The workings of anything you could have made out of a java app or anything you could have made out of you know

1097
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:38,460
Something else it's it's it's in a runtime. I I feel like you get actually pretty damn close

1098
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:42,300
What you're talking about is the web browser becoming the operating system

1099
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:42,940
Yeah

1100
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:49,100
In a sense or or an electron app or a natify or something like that where it's it's using those technologies

1101
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,100
But it pretends to be a desktop application

1102
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,140
And I don't I don't like it really

1103
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:58,540
And in fact see current linux I wanted to ask you because it seems like a huge component to all of these is then they

1104
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:01,580
Always it's not just that it's a web or an electron app

1105
01:19:01,660 --> 01:19:07,660
It's also that it's it's cloud dependent and and you have the whole lock-in now to a cloud service

1106
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:12,940
Which has all kinds of uh long-term ramifications, which could be one of them being shut down

1107
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:14,940
And so this could be another issue where all of a sudden

1108
01:19:15,260 --> 01:19:21,100
One of the benefits of desktop linux was with open source native applications a developer might decide to quit one day

1109
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:25,980
But if you if your business depended on it, hey you fork the shit out of that thing run an internal build and hire

1110
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:28,700
Somebody to keep it going and that was an actual possibility

1111
01:19:28,940 --> 01:19:35,680
But right now if nalais decides to pull the plug on n1 i'm totally screwed my desktop application becomes completely

1112
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,180
Non-functional and you that's got to bother you colonel linux

1113
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:43,980
And you know additionally to that when you start looking at independent content creators now

1114
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,580
We're taking our content things that we've spent our money time and effort

1115
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:51,100
And we're putting that up into the cloud and you know

1116
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:55,500
A lot of us would say well, you know in the case of video editing, you know and stuff like that

1117
01:19:55,580 --> 01:20:01,100
Especially for adobe. They wouldn't do anything, you know terrible with it. But a lot of times what you see is as they change

1118
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,660
uh to accommodate

1119
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:06,300
Users that don't want to pay a lot of money. So for example in facebook

1120
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:10,140
When it started out you uploaded a bunch of media. That was all your media

1121
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,700
It was your pictures your videos that kind of thing then later on

1122
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:17,020
They started changing the user agreement so that they could use some of some of that stuff

1123
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:20,700
And so anytime you have content that you've created on somebody else's computer

1124
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:25,660
I think that's that's a dangerous thing anytime you're running your business based on someone else's computer. I think that's a dangerous thing

1125
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,740
hmm

1126
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:28,780
So

1127
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:33,420
I don't have a real way to like spin this into like a happy go lucky hara desktop linux thing

1128
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:38,940
I guess I would just like to to point out that you can have an entirely open source electron app, right?

1129
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:40,220
The whole framework is open source

1130
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:45,100
If you want to improve it to not use as much memory or whatever and you're capable of doing that you totally can yeah

1131
01:20:45,100 --> 01:20:50,060
Now also use electron with offline apps. You don't need to be online either. Yeah now rotten

1132
01:20:50,940 --> 01:20:51,740
Producer michael

1133
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:53,740
I wanted to give you a chance also to sort of touch on

1134
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:58,620
On your thoughts on using nata fire to take some of these applications and make it essentially feel like a local app

1135
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,180
Because that's sort of I mean where we're going

1136
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:07,980
Well, I mean I i've been using nata fire for a little while and i've built like probably 10 of my own apps with it

1137
01:21:08,540 --> 01:21:09,900
um

1138
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,180
It can do a lot of

1139
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:15,180
It's really interesting because its purpose is to kind of like auto build an electron app for you

1140
01:21:15,660 --> 01:21:22,220
You give it uh, tell it what you have in node and npm installed and you have uh electron in your system

1141
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:27,820
And then it just uses electron to build everything for you based on the command the parameters you use in the command

1142
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:31,980
And then it just builds it and it gives you like a full folder that's portable

1143
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:37,340
But it also integrates with your system. So it uses your home folder to store the config files

1144
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:42,320
So you can remake a new version with a new electron when it comes out, uh, you can have notifications

1145
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:45,900
Built into your put whatever pretty much whatever de you want

1146
01:21:46,460 --> 01:21:48,460
um, like there's there's a lot of

1147
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:53,020
Great tools for it. And the best part about it is that you can build your own

1148
01:21:54,060 --> 01:21:56,060
um your own apps

1149
01:21:56,460 --> 01:21:59,820
without having to deal with uh any kind of services like

1150
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:02,220
I got mine. I have like

1151
01:22:02,220 --> 01:22:07,660
Like I have stuff that's on my server that is you know, it is it is a cloud service that is running on my server

1152
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:09,980
That is using electron to do it to use it

1153
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:15,740
That's cool. All right, so that's kind of that's sort of like a that's a middle ground. That's good. That's good

1154
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:19,340
That's a middle ground. I was looking for less depressed than we thought we thank you producer

1155
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:22,380
Michael you gave us the middle ground that we were hoping for

1156
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:22,860
All right

1157
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:25,840
Now if you have a little middle ground and you want to share your thoughts go over to jupitabroadcasting.com

1158
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,380
contact

1159
01:22:28,380 --> 01:22:32,480
Of course, you can also go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com

1160
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:34,380
although

1161
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,380
bit of a shit show right now, so

1162
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:43,740
Probably probably would maybe just find us on twitter or or join us live. Yeah, that'd be good jblive.tv for the live show

1163
01:22:43,740 --> 01:22:51,420
I'm at chris las i'm at westpacethenetworks at jupiter signal also go follow colonel linux at colonel linux on the network

1164
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:55,680
Uh, he's over there doing his thing and tweeting about all his shenanigans

1165
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:59,200
And also we appreciate the mumble room for joining us. You can also join that

1166
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:02,800
Just check out the chat room at jblive.tv do a bang mumble get the info

1167
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:25,780
We do a little mic check and you can join us. We'll see you right back here next tuesday

1168
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:38,800
And the value of this is negative

1169
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:47,840
JBtitles.com everybody go over there. We'll pick our title and then we will get out of here for the tech snap crew

1170
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,820
Thank you for being here everybody jbtitles.com

1171
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:59,920
Uh, also, I just want to point out another way about uh etcher is awesome. Oh, yeah etcher is I forgot about etcher damn

1172
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,640
That's a that is actually the counter example right there etcher for etcher for the win

1173
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,640
And i've actually been uh studying up on app images with uh with electron based stuff

1174
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,360
and uh, it's really cool like

1175
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:18,080
I like app images a lot more than I used to because after researching it

1176
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:20,800
It's uh, I kind of like app images more than flat packs now

1177
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:27,200
The first time I used etcher that was the first time I used uh app image and I was just I was blown away

1178
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,200
Like it was it was one of those moments

1179
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:32,400
Where the thing downloads I double click on it and I click on install and i'm like

1180
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:39,280
Why why is not every application on linux using this and why haven't we been doing it for 20 years?

1181
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:40,640
All right

1182
01:24:40,640 --> 01:24:42,080
I did it on my arch desktop

1183
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,440
Then I did it on my fedora laptop

1184
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:47,440
Then I did it on my bungee laptop the same freaking file runs on every single distro

1185
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:53,360
Share share share share. We need to pick a title jb title share. We need to pick it to jimmy share

1186
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,320
We need jimmy titles. Sure. We need to pick a title jimmy titles.com

1187
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,960
Chris loves that's funny

1188
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,960
Sandboxing now too. Oh, really?

1189
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:06,800
Pack attack solace my solace getting in the limitations with app images as well

1190
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,920
Of course, but there's also limitations when flat packs as well

1191
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:16,000
Well games not the same limitations with an app image you'll run into library issues. Oh

1192
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:19,200
Yeah, so they might bundle some of the libraries

1193
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:23,680
But you're still going to run into the sort of issues that you would have if you just downloaded a terrible and running it from

1194
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:24,720
That route

1195
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:29,060
Whereas if you use something like flat pack, you've got a fully contained root fs essentially

1196
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:36,560
You've got an entire trip environment because they've changed app images changed how they do their stuff within uh, like four or five months ago

1197
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:40,560
They're now using squash fs now. So there's no yeah, that's right, but that's squash fs

1198
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:46,480
That's just a bind mount that's gone into the true. It doesn't have a full troop. So the system libraries can still contaminate

1199
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:51,120
That's one of the problems app image is very very attractive because you can just double click it and go for it

1200
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:57,120
As norah said but you can still get those issues. So they do need to be watched out for if you use a sandboxing

1201
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,280
That's not going to happen

1202
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,840
That's what I just said for example

1203
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:05,520
No fire jail on type of app image. You're not going to have those problems

1204
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:10,560
Or you could just use one that works out of the box without layers, right?

1205
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:15,200
But when you have to install flat pack into your system and then your system doesn't work in any way and then annoying

1206
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:21,120
And it gives you these like ridiculously obscure errors and the only and the actual solution is to reboot your machine

1207
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:24,800
But the but the the system doesn't tell you that because that's that'd be too easy

1208
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,120
You had the quark errors as well then yeah, it's ridiculous

1209
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:35,440
It's like hey you're missing this thing like why am I missing it? Oh because I didn't reboot. Oh, yeah

1210
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,520
Thanks, you could have just told me I need to reboot

1211
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,840
Yeah, it's not kind of has the usability upper hand there a little bit

1212
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:46,480
Yeah, but uh, there's there's a thing I think the app image is only there's it's only flaw

1213
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,000
Not really only flaw because the sandboxing is a problem, but they have a solution for that

1214
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:54,880
The only main thing that they don't have a solution for is the updating method like uh, yeah

1215
01:26:55,440 --> 01:27:00,480
Yeah, they had a self-updater. That would be nice. So they have a built-in updating daemon

1216
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,280
But the app image it has to implement it

1217
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:09,840
It doesn't um, it only does it when you when you launch it. So like it says, okay, here's an update

1218
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:14,960
so it does work, but the app images developer has to use it and you know, there's

1219
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:22,480
It is really cool and also like a mac a lot of people well, it's more mac than not but it is but a lot of um,

1220
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,280
People think that app images bundles everything and they don't

1221
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,880
App images only bundle what's necessary to bundle if the system

1222
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:34,240
If an app image can assume that a package is available, like, you know a super massive

1223
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,600
You know global package. It's not going to be bundled

1224
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,600
You
