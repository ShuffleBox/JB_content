1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Wes, you never have to worry about again.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,540
They have thrown machine learning at recipes.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:06,460
At least I think.

4
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,460
What did you find here?

5
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,260
Well, you already trust machine learning

6
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,780
to drive you around, right, Chris?

7
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,940
So why not let it cook for you

8
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,020
with some generated recipes using TensorFlow

9
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,820
and a recurrent neural network?

10
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,180
How does cream soda with onion sound?

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,700
Mm, about as good as the orange club tea sandwich

12
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,900
with cookies.

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,020
Yeah, these are pretty wild.

14
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,500
It's a TensorFlow model applied to a whole bunch of recipes

15
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,060
and then why not see what it comes up with?

16
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,380
Now they do warn here in the README,

17
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,940
it's all open source of course,

18
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,540
that these recipes are for research purposes

19
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,260
and not for actual cooking.

20
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,220
Maybe you'd make this one, I don't know, Wes.

21
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,580
Let's cook this up before the show

22
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,780
and see if we like it mushrooms with lentil,

23
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,940
stewed with shallots and tomatoes.

24
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,020
It sounds really good.

25
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,940
It has a lot of garlic, so what could go wrong?

26
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:08,420
Hello friends and welcome to your weekly Linux talk show

27
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,620
that has yet to be replaced by machine learning.

28
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,620
My name is Chris.

29
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,940
My name is Wes and I have high hopes for the machines.

30
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,020
They have a lot of sample data to review

31
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,580
because this is episode 359

32
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,140
and this week we have so much to get into,

33
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:27,420
including the death of Mac OS 10

34
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,700
and how this will affect the Linux desktop.

35
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,140
But before we get there,

36
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,140
I wanna say time appropriate greetings

37
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,660
to our powerful assembly of Mumble Room.

38
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,700
Lug members of power?

39
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,180
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

40
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,020
Hello.

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,580
Hello, good evening.

42
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,940
I need to work on that, you know?

43
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,620
I need to work on that name.

44
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,180
It's just, it was like a beta, you know, it's just a beta,

45
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,700
but we have a good crew in there.

46
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,700
Lots of people in the quiet listening as well.

47
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,380
We have 23 members there today,

48
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,260
some familiar faces and some new ones as well.

49
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,220
So thank you everybody for joining us.

50
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,140
Well, let's get into the unplugged program

51
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,220
because yeah, we have a lot to discuss.

52
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,060
First of all, some big community news,

53
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,580
some like things are changing kind of community news

54
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,100
for the Linux hardware future landscape.

55
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,780
And then we'll talk about how Apple switching to ARM

56
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,500
will impact Linux.

57
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,700
We don't do this too often,

58
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,620
but I think in today's world,

59
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,860
you have to acknowledge the entire marketplace

60
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,980
and ecosystem and how that will also affect us Linux users.

61
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,860
And we'll also talk a little bit more

62
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,340
about the longer term picture there.

63
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,300
Plus we have some pics, maybe some feedback and all that.

64
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,740
More so Wes, what do you say?

65
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,700
You wanna just start right in with the community news?

66
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,180
Yes, please.

67
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,100
See, I wanted you to argue.

68
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,820
I thought for sure you'd argue with me a little bit.

69
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,660
Now, you know, I love community news.

70
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,020
It's true, you do.

71
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,020
It's all kind of on topic this week

72
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,260
because it just seems to be the way the industry is trending.

73
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:59,020
There is an ARM-based Japanese supercomputer

74
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,500
that is now the world's,

75
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,260
is it the fastest or one of the fastest?

76
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,660
The part that I cared about, of course,

77
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,220
is that it runs Linux,

78
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,260
but it is a Japanese supercomputer that's taken,

79
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,340
it has taken the top spot

80
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,580
in the biannual top 500 supercomputer speed ranking.

81
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:15,660
Yeah, and it's the first time a computer based on ARM

82
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,020
has done so.

83
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,180
It's Fujitsu's 48-core A64FX system on a chip

84
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,020
that's powering the whole thing

85
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,380
and it's co-developed by Ryken and Fujitsu.

86
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,700
The computer placed in the top 500 high-performance results

87
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,340
with performance numbers like 415.5 petaflops.

88
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,380
That's 2.8 times as fast as IBM's Summit,

89
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,020
which is number two.

90
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,900
That 48-core chip, huh?

91
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,980
Wow.

92
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,580
So right now it's number crunching for COVID-19,

93
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,700
which is pretty cool.

94
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,780
Also, Fujitsu's 48-core ARM chip here,

95
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,900
this is one of those things we don't talk a lot about,

96
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,100
but Fujitsu is kind of a wild duck out there.

97
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,100
They're doing their own thing,

98
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,020
they're making these super cool systems,

99
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,580
but because they don't really fit

100
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,120
into the realm of everyday life,

101
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,540
they don't get talked a lot about.

102
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,540
But this is a nice reminder

103
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,120
that there's some killer Linux systems out there

104
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,240
from Fujitsu.

105
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,400
Yeah, super powerful.

106
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,540
Back in the day, I had access

107
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,620
to this neat flatbed printer they make,

108
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,820
so clearly they're in the hardware game

109
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,180
at serious levels in all kinds of spaces.

110
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,220
It's also kind of interesting here

111
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,580
where normally it's just been the Americans

112
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,780
and the Chinese sort of competing

113
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,260
for fastest supercomputer out there.

114
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,140
This is the first time that Japan's made the list

115
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,580
in the past nine years,

116
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,940
but obviously they came to play and with an ARM system.

117
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,340
I think we'll continue to talk about today

118
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,820
how that's a big sign of things to come.

119
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,040
Yeah, it does seem very fitting.

120
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,660
Debian also has some big news in the ARM department.

121
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,340
Ampere has partnered with Debian

122
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,860
to support their hardware infrastructure

123
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,940
and has donated three of their high performance

124
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,580
ARM64 boxes.

125
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,380
These Lenovo ThinkSystem HR330A servers

126
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,860
contain Ampere's eMag CPU

127
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,380
with an ARM V8 64-bit processor

128
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,580
specifically designed for cloud servers.

129
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,980
They've got a sweet 256 gigs of RAM,

130
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,500
dual 960 gig SSDs,

131
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,660
and a 25 gig dual port NIC on there.

132
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,580
So these are no slouch.

133
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,300
The donated servers have been deployed

134
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,300
over at the University of British Columbia,

135
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,660
just up north from the studio here.

136
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,580
And the Debian system administrators group

137
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,420
has already configured them to run ARM64,

138
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,620
ARM hard float, and ARM EL build daemons.

139
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,140
And all of that stuff is good news

140
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,600
because they're replacing previous build servers

141
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,720
that were running on basically development grade boards.

142
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,140
And Ampere's goal here really

143
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,580
is just to get better software developed

144
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,380
for their cloud built, they say,

145
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,100
the future of cloud and edge computing

146
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
for these very specific systems they have

147
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,340
where they're trying to build features

148
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,900
in at the processor level for this type of work.

149
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,100
They need the software support there.

150
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,940
They need the open source software support there.

151
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,720
And they seem to be big fans of the Debian project

152
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,340
reading through their release announcement.

153
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,540
So it's kind of a win-win.

154
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,740
I mean, come on, who's not a big fan of Debian?

155
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,820
The Dev1 folks?

156
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,380
Yeah, I suppose so, but you're right.

157
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,560
I mean, you know, the more these are out there,

158
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,140
the easier it is to build on these platforms.

159
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,620
And that is maybe one of the things

160
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,180
that can be difficult about the ARM world

161
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,700
is you gotta build for the platform

162
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,220
you're actually gonna try to run on.

163
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,380
Well, that's better for everyone,

164
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,340
especially considering the huge number of packages

165
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,500
in the Debian repos.

166
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,460
Yeah, I've been really enjoying the Pinebook Pro

167
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,580
over the two weeks now that I've been using it.

168
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,240
I do feel like there's been a handful of packages

169
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,380
I wish I could have gotten installed

170
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,260
that are just not yet built for the ARM chipset.

171
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,140
And I think it's not really,

172
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,040
you know, I'm trying to think it's mostly

173
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,920
like commercial applications

174
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,460
that maybe even if the desktop client is open source,

175
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,660
it's connecting to their proprietary service.

176
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,180
I think that's probably the ones

177
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:50,300
that haven't worked the most.

178
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,180
And it's been frustrating, so I'd love to see this grow.

179
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,540
But watching all this ARM news

180
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,580
and reading it from an ARM laptop

181
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,340
has been a bit of a mind job for me

182
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,900
because the Pinebook Pro is already there, right?

183
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,900
The ROK Pro 64, it's already a competitive mobile ARM

184
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,660
platform and we have the PinePhone in studio

185
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,100
and it was much better built than we expected

186
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,140
right out of the box.

187
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,160
That's for sure.

188
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,740
So in a big way for open source and free software,

189
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,740
it feels like ARM is now just an implementation detail

190
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,060
that hasn't just really gotten wide enough adoption yet

191
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,180
for all of the software edge cases to be worked out.

192
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,020
But it just seems inevitable at this point.

193
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,860
Yeah, I mean, these are cloud enabled servers,

194
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,820
AWS, Amazon, they've been working hard

195
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,180
on their Graviton chips too.

196
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,860
So there's gonna be some really nice,

197
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,900
in terms of performance and cost,

198
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,060
instances available over there before long.

199
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,060
And unless you've got x86 workloads

200
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,500
that you really need because of some optimization

201
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,140
or some vendor library that you don't have control over,

202
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,420
if it's all just open source stuff

203
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,140
that you can rebuild, recompile,

204
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,220
or already just runs on top of Python or the JVM,

205
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,620
why not run on ARM?

206
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,020
And I think too about the Raspberry Pi.

207
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,820
So the Raspberry Pi 4, eight gigs of RAM,

208
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,380
pretty good processor now.

209
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,980
Imagine what that thing's gonna be like

210
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,940
when it's the Raspberry Pi 7, Raspberry Pi 8,

211
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,580
maybe even the Raspberry Pi 10.

212
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,420
It's gonna be a very capable little board.

213
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,740
It's gonna probably put what we would consider

214
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:27,020
a standard desktop system to shame today.

215
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,780
And that's just a trend that just seems to continue.

216
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,180
So it's coming, Wes, and the Pine Book

217
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,500
has really made me kind of appreciate it

218
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,520
because the battery life is fantastic.

219
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,860
And I've been on this trip, I'm still on my trip.

220
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,860
I'm actually in Texas.

221
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,020
In fact, not only am I in Austin, Texas right now,

222
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,560
but I am christening my cousin's studio

223
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,040
that he had built down here at his office in Austin

224
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,940
with the very first broadcast right here

225
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,980
on Linux Unplugged in his new studio space.

226
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,980
We're still dialing it all in,

227
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,860
doesn't have all the furniture in here yet,

228
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,740
doesn't even have all the final sound treatment

229
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,620
installed yet, but it is pretty, pretty cool.

230
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,540
Here, I'm gonna lean back so you can enjoy the space.

231
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,380
Are you ready, Wes?

232
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm gonna-

233
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,040
Oh, please.

234
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,300
It's pretty, pretty great.

235
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,740
You see, it drops off.

236
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,920
You hear, I mean, it drops off pretty good, doesn't it?

237
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,760
I mean, really-

238
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,460
It's got some good bones in that studio.

239
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,020
So pretty cool to do the first broadcast right here.

240
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,900
So we're battle testing it for him.

241
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,640
And I might give him a few pointers afterwards.

242
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,140
My first tip was put a rug down.

243
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,260
You gotta put a rug down.

244
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,300
So he went this morning to Lowe's and got a rug.

245
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,820
I mean, you just want as much stuff

246
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,180
to absorb that sound as you can, right?

247
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,440
Yep, so pretty great.

248
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,680
So I'll probably be down here for the rest of the week.

249
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,100
And I'll probably start the long trek

250
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,780
back to the Pacific Northwest, maybe via Montana first.

251
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,060
I just like how wherever you go,

252
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,220
you just end up setting up studios, you know?

253
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,420
So wherever you stop, you're like,

254
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,260
hey, can I just, I'll just rent an extra room

255
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,720
and I've got all this foam paneling.

256
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,860
If you guys could put that up for me.

257
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,700
I mean, that's, you know,

258
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,280
I fill all the RV up with foam, right?

259
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,100
Just for these very purposes right here.

260
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,660
It's like a ball pit, but you're just floating on foam.

261
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,500
So I'm looking at my route back, you know?

262
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,820
I'm looking at that and I'm thinking,

263
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,740
I'm gonna avoid New Mexico as much as possible

264
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,140
because I think I lost five years of life on my RV.

265
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,140
And in fact, I even have a slight oil leak

266
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,020
from my fill pan from my drain.

267
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,060
Just my drain plugs leaking.

268
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,180
But I think it's because the New Mexico roads were so bad

269
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,740
that it just shook Lady Joups down to her core.

270
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,340
So I gotta do like a little bit of maintenance

271
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,980
on her before we head home.

272
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,740
And I think I'll probably go up through Colorado

273
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,840
and Wyoming, through Montana,

274
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,260
and then through Idaho, back to Washington.

275
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,960
So take a nice long trek, you know?

276
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,680
Just work from the road.

277
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,360
I got the kids with me, got the wife, got the dog.

278
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,780
Got the Mi-Fi, so yeah,

279
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,820
why not enjoy the experience of the West?

280
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,500
Got multiple Mi-Fis, Wes, multiple.

281
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,780
Yeah, that's true, you're a pro here.

282
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,260
And so not only have I been rocking the Pine Book Pro

283
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,620
as sort of my, I just want one thing

284
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,100
that I just plug in and keep charged

285
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,780
and don't have to worry about it while I'm on the go.

286
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,220
Pine Book Pro has been great for that.

287
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,220
But I gotta say, so much respect for the Raspberry Pi 4.

288
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,660
People talk about, oh, it runs a little hot.

289
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,840
You know, that was a big discussion for the Raspberry Pi 4.

290
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,060
You better get a heat sink for it.

291
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,020
And people are getting heat sinks with active fans

292
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,740
and just going all out to try to keep the temperature down.

293
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,300
Last night, the booth that I run the Raspberry Pis in

294
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,820
along with my Wi-Fi and my Switch,

295
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,340
and I don't do this, don't do what Chris does.

296
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,100
And where I have my hard drives

297
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,540
that are all formatted in ButterFS,

298
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,780
that space got to 99 degrees last night.

299
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,820
Oh! Yeah.

300
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,300
Now that's Fahrenheit, right?

301
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,660
Yeah, otherwise they'd be melting.

302
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,100
They just kept going, you know?

303
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,500
Like I'm streaming Plex to the TV, the Wi-Fi's,

304
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,580
everything's just working.

305
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,380
If they just, they get hot

306
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,740
and I don't have them under intense load,

307
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,940
if I really had them crunchy,

308
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,180
then they'd probably start having issues.

309
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,420
And I vent them when I get home

310
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,780
and I realize how hot it is.

311
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,380
I like the idea of you, because it's in a seat in your RV,

312
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,420
like the idea that you have to prioritize,

313
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,340
well, am I gonna sit down and relax?

314
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,780
Or am I gonna vent my computers?

315
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,700
No, sorry, son, you can't sit there.

316
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,260
The Pi's are venting.

317
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,660
That actually happened, yep.

318
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,180
I gotta, hey, I gotta vent the computers.

319
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,660
Oh, but I wanna get to it before they all fry,

320
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,140
because what I'm really worried about going

321
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,380
isn't now the Raspberry Pi so much.

322
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,900
I'm worried about the little power bricks

323
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,580
for like the switch or the Wi-Fi access point.

324
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,580
I'm worried about that melting or popping.

325
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,500
So that's my concern at this point,

326
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,220
because the Raspberry Pi will thermal throttle.

327
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,660
It'll even, it'll shut itself down.

328
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,180
So that isn't the big concern.

329
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,380
That's the nice part about this solid state life.

330
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,220
There's not a whole lot of moving parts.

331
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,020
So it's gonna fail, it'll get there eventually.

332
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,420
And actually, the way I realized it's kinda great,

333
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,420
I mean, it's not a huge thing,

334
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,140
but I Velcroed everything in there,

335
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,020
and that, or I should say that loop and hook,

336
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,580
it's not Velcro, it's loop and hook.

337
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,900
No, come on, that's a brand name.

338
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,700
But that creates an airspace under the hard drives

339
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,780
and under the Raspberry Pi,

340
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,920
so there's a little bit more room for air to move

341
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,580
when I do ventilate, so that helps.

342
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,560
But I'm, yeah, I'm pretty impressed

343
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,100
with how well it's all worked.

344
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,860
LadyJuice is so integrated now with the Linux systems

345
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,140
and the automations that it's pretty critical.

346
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,300
So that's, if anything happens,

347
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,240
it makes things very, very, very inconvenient.

348
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,780
But it's all awesome so far.

349
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,120
You drop back like 50 years if that little booth goes down.

350
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,340
Yes, yeah, really.

351
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,220
The one thing I will note for folks,

352
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,140
because I do hear from people

353
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,100
that are building these into their campers

354
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,940
for the summer and stuff like that.

355
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,700
All of these systems expect your home

356
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,580
to remain in one place.

357
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,540
So anything that uses location for your automations

358
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,100
or security stuff, or like for me, like my cameras.

359
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,400
The way I have my home assistant system work

360
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,780
is when I leave an area, the cameras come on.

361
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:00,300
If no one's been home for a while, lights start to turn off.

362
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,660
The heaters go to standby mode.

363
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,380
Like things sort of shut down over time when no one's home.

364
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,680
And then when people arrive, these things reverse themselves.

365
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,780
Or when the sun sets or the sun rises,

366
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:14,980
other things automatically trigger in the RV

367
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,340
to maintain things.

368
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,860
And the first couple of days, I didn't really notice

369
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,380
because I was pretty close to home on the road.

370
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,300
But by the time I got to Utah,

371
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,320
I noticed that something wasn't quite right

372
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,820
with the lights and everything.

373
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,460
And then like things just didn't seem like

374
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,820
they were working quite right

375
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,700
or something wasn't in the state I expected it to be in.

376
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,380
And it took me a solid maybe three or four days

377
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,780
into the trip before I realized, oh yeah,

378
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,660
every couple of days now, I got to go in there

379
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,420
into home assistant into the other systems

380
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,460
and update the location information

381
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,420
because they just expect your house to never move.

382
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,620
Oh yeah, I mean, I don't move around as much as you,

383
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,420
but I move around more than I'd like.

384
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,640
And I've noticed that too, just you change a little bit

385
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,220
and all your systems have already learned like,

386
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,660
oh, these are the nearby cell towers.

387
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,100
Here's where you are approximately.

388
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,140
You don't tell them any of that.

389
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,500
And I don't know how to necessarily tell Google

390
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,180
that I've moved and that my directions shouldn't go

391
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,420
to the old place.

392
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,580
Yeah, it's very tricky on Google home

393
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,140
and it's not even worth it on the ecosystems.

394
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,180
They just are such a pain in the butt.

395
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,060
It's not even worth updating them.

396
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,660
And so you just basically get weather and information

397
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,980
from your home location.

398
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,460
The plus side of that is no one knows where you are.

399
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,180
Yeah, that is true.

400
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,960
That is kind of great actually.

401
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,180
But speaking of Google,

402
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,820
there is more features coming to Chrome

403
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,180
because we've been talking about how Chrome needs more stuff

404
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,900
and more specifically, it's getting a feature

405
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:43,900
that iPhone users and Mac users seem to enjoy, AirDrop.

406
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,000
And they're calling it Nearby Share

407
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,460
and it will expand Android devices, Windows, Linux, Mac OS

408
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,100
and Chrome OS all thanks to its Chrome integration.

409
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,260
Yeah, in other words,

410
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,060
Nearby Share will be part

411
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,940
of the Google Chrome browser feature lineup.

412
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,820
One more feature for this browser that just keeps growing.

413
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,260
Taking care of the whole sharing thing regardless

414
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,680
of the platform and hey, that is kind of nice, right?

415
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,940
Chrome runs basically everywhere these days.

416
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,780
According to a recent discovery

417
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,460
shared by Dinson Francis of Chrome Story,

418
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,620
the feature has actually already been implemented

419
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,320
in the Canary version of Google Chrome.

420
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,260
So if you're running that,

421
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,260
maybe you've seen it show up in a system near you.

422
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,160
That means it's currently

423
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,820
in a rather advanced testing phase

424
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,620
and probably we'll all get to play with it before too long.

425
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,500
I mean, this is so late.

426
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,540
I don't understand like what a handy feature to have

427
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,380
just observing folks in the iOS ecosystem.

428
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,220
I mean, this is a pretty basic technology, right?

429
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,460
I didn't realize how popular AirDrop was

430
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,340
until I started visiting offices again

431
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,520
and people would just use AirDrop for just,

432
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,860
hey, I updated the presentation before you go live,

433
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,020
here's the presentation for one group I'm thinking of

434
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,660
or here we're at the meeting,

435
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,380
would anybody else like a copy of this doc?

436
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,860
And they just AirDrop it to everybody.

437
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,640
And to me, that always seemed like,

438
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,300
well, that's what file shares are for

439
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,300
or God forbid, even an email attachment.

440
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,020
But much like many other things in the corporate world

441
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,700
changed since the last time I was in it,

442
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,300
AirDrop seems to have been fairly adopted.

443
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:21,300
And I note that Microsoft integrated a very similar feature

444
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,140
with the same name, Nearby Share, that's awkward,

445
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,620
into Windows 10 build 1803.

446
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,340
Now, technically, Chris, that's Nearby Sharing

447
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,060
on the Microsoft side, totally different.

448
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,560
Right, my bad.

449
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,260
And I wonder if Google's is gonna be like Chromecast

450
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,540
where there's some cloud involved

451
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,820
sometimes in the actual transmission of the data

452
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,380
or sometimes it's just for session negotiation

453
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,780
or will it be over the land?

454
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,580
Because that seems to be the primary advantage of AirDrop

455
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,780
and the equivalence that we've tested on the Linux desktop

456
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,460
is it's land to land.

457
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,540
Yeah, right, there's totally times

458
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,340
where you just don't have access to the cloud

459
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,140
for whatever reason, even if you wish that you did,

460
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,780
then these features can just keep working without a hitch.

461
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,060
That's a lot of value.

462
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,220
When I'm driving and there's areas

463
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,340
where maybe there's a tiny bit of cell signal

464
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,340
or there's no signal, so, so much of modern technology

465
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,260
is just worthless, just worthless.

466
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,620
And I just don't want any more of that.

467
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,860
There's no reason that a cloud server needs to be involved

468
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,700
for me to discover something on my land

469
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,300
and send something to an IP address on my land.

470
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,380
Right, I was just thinking of, I had a time on a plane

471
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,640
where I had an ebook downloaded on my laptop,

472
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,700
but I needed it on my phone.

473
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:50,260
But I hadn't paid for the internet, of course, on the plane.

474
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,860
Because it's ridiculous.

475
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,200
Yeah, and it just, despite all of the weird hacks

476
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,700
that I tried, I just couldn't get it to go.

477
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,000
And if I'd had this feature that worked offline,

478
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,100
it would have taken me two seconds

479
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,180
and I would have enjoyed my ebook.

480
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,660
Was that before you tried HTTP over DNS?

481
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,540
Yeah, I think so, in my more naive days.

482
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,660
All right, well, let's do a little housekeeping here

483
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,220
in the pod, because we have a few things to talk about.

484
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,580
Number one, the Luplug takeover is happening.

485
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,500
They now have an autonomous zone in our mumble every Sunday.

486
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,460
They also have established an autonomous zone

487
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,980
on the IRC server, irc.geekshed.net pound Luplug.

488
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:33,620
Now, the LuG itself takes place every Sunday

489
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,820
at noon Pacific.

490
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,220
That's the same time we do this here podcast,

491
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,560
but it's just on Sunday.

492
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,060
It's also, somehow, they have leveraged

493
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,900
their new negotiating position to campaign Angela

494
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,060
and they have gotten it

495
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,060
on the actual live production calendar.

496
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,520
A true victory for the Luplug.

497
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,620
So join us every Sunday where we hang out, talk Linux,

498
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,820
come up with ideas for the show,

499
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,920
and if I don't make it, they plot takeovers

500
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,940
of the entire network, so that's fun too.

501
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,660
All of that is in our mumble room,

502
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,100
the same exact software and server we use for this show.

503
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,660
So you get it set up once, you come hang out on a Sunday,

504
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,260
and then if you ever have the opportunity

505
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,620
to join us on a Tuesday, you can.

506
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,700
That's when we record this show, Tuesday live,

507
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,260
noon Pacific over at jblive.tv, also on the calendar.

508
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,420
How about that?

509
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,580
Huh, look at us.

510
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:22,800
It's really all Angela.

511
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,940
So thanks to Angela for doing that.

512
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,820
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar

513
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,100
to get that converted to your local time.

514
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,940
We'd love to see you.

515
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,340
If you're hanging out, I just jump in from time to time

516
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,900
and make it for maybe an hour,

517
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,100
maybe make it for a couple hours,

518
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,980
maybe I make it 45 minutes.

519
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,580
It goes while the conversation's going.

520
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,700
That's how long, and you can just sort of dip in.

521
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,740
It's like a beautiful, crystal clear Linux stream

522
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,300
of fresh conversation.

523
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,260
That's what I love about it,

524
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,760
is it's just a place that you know is gonna be there.

525
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,700
Sometimes you can make it, sometimes you can't.

526
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,460
So you never know quite who's going to be there,

527
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,160
which is partially exciting.

528
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,060
But regardless, you know there's gonna be a community

529
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,960
of folks interested in talking about Linux and open source.

530
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,780
Ready, if you are, on Sunday.

531
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,820
Couple other bits of admin for this show.

532
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,220
You hear us mention the show notes quite a bit.

533
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,060
Linuxunplugged.com slash 359 will be links

534
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,700
to stuff we talk about today.

535
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,720
That's also where you'll find the contact page link.

536
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,100
If you'd like to send us an email

537
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,600
or recommend something we check out on the show,

538
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,220
you can find that there as well.

539
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,620
Linuxunplugged.com.

540
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,460
And with that,

541
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,980
we enter a zone that is truly going to be frustrating

542
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,080
for some of you.

543
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,120
I warn you, you may be triggered

544
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,900
by what happens next on the show.

545
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,360
This week was WWDC.

546
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,380
And I don't think we've ever covered one of them ever

547
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,580
on this show before, very intentionally.

548
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,660
But this year is a little different

549
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,500
because it is the death of Mac OS 10,

550
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,380
and it is the transition of the Apple platform

551
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,740
back to an extremely esoteric custom-built system

552
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,100
that will undoubtedly be very, very locked down.

553
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,380
This is a big moment

554
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,320
because it's Apple's custom system on a chip.

555
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,060
It's not an x86 processor

556
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,560
that's capable of running x86 OSs out of the box right now.

557
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,820
It's something brand new.

558
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,280
Apple is officially moving to its own silicon chips

559
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,420
for Mac hardware.

560
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,640
Calling it a historic day for the Mac,

561
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,260
Apple CEO Tim Cook detailed the transition

562
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,440
from PowerPC to Mac OS,

563
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,140
the move to Intel chips before unveiling their plans

564
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,700
to use Apple's own ARM-powered silicon chips

565
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,860
in the Macs in the near future.

566
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:31,640
The Mac has had three major transitions in its history.

567
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,900
The move to PowerPC, the transition to Mac OS 10,

568
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,060
and the move to Intel.

569
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,980
And now it's time for a huge leap forward for the Mac.

570
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,260
Because today is the day we're announcing

571
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,900
that the Mac is transitioning

572
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,180
to our own Apple silicon.

573
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,340
Wow.

574
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,940
Oh boy.

575
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,940
Now, we don't have all of the details yet,

576
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,460
but what we have so far is a Mac mini

577
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,680
with an iPad processor in it, 512 gigabytes of storage,

578
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,900
some RAM in there, and it's a development kit.

579
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,820
16 gigs of RAM.

580
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,380
And I think this will truly be the end

581
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,240
of any opportunity to ever run Linux on a Mac hardware.

582
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,080
I really do.

583
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,380
I think this is just the end of it natively.

584
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,520
You'll be able to virtualize it, we'll get to that.

585
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,860
But I think it truly is the end.

586
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,100
Now, this is an awkward position for Apple

587
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,100
because Linux can't be ignored anymore.

588
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,940
In their previous transitions,

589
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,060
they didn't have to address it.

590
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,740
When they announced x86 Max,

591
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,520
it wasn't the elephant in the room.

592
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,980
But now it is legitimately part of the real world.

593
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,300
It is part of people's development workflow.

594
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,580
And it even got a mention in their keynote.

595
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,740
Now, as Craig mentioned,

596
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,300
many of our users rely on apps from other environments.

597
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,700
So let me bring up a Linux VM and parallel its desktop.

598
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,160
You can see the graphical user interface

599
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,800
designed for Linux here.

600
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,100
But of course, many developers like to use Linux

601
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,420
for hosting servers.

602
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,380
So let me dive down to the command line

603
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,660
and launch an Apache web server.

604
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,100
And now, I can simply bring up Safari

605
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,580
and browse the website of the server

606
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,380
I just launched in the Linux VM.

607
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,980
Pretty weird to see Linux demoed on the stage.

608
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,280
Well, it's not really a stage,

609
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,140
but on screen at WWDC.

610
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,300
Yeah, right, they're giant developer event

611
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,020
that normally includes mostly just Xcode

612
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,740
and some flashy Mac features.

613
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,000
Yeah, it's remarkable if any other company gets a mention,

614
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,900
let alone a GNOME Shell Debian 10 demo.

615
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,500
That's pretty wild.

616
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,160
So what is the open source story on the Mac?

617
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,620
Because I think one of the first reactions

618
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,460
that people have is,

619
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,740
well, Linux already runs great on ARM processors.

620
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,340
But something that people have to remember

621
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,580
is these are not standard ARM CPUs.

622
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,380
These are custom Apple silicon.

623
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,300
ARM isn't a CPU.

624
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,260
There's not like it's an Intel x86 processor,

625
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,700
where you could buy something that's x86 compatible

626
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,020
that could be from AMD or Intel.

627
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,660
There isn't one ARM CPU.

628
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,340
And so it's a series of technologies

629
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,760
and there's so much more to it,

630
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,220
including graphics, storage controllers, networking,

631
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,580
all of that has to be supported

632
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,060
by the host operating system.

633
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,340
And I think it's pretty clear that Apple's vision for this

634
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,460
is we'll port the open source applications themselves

635
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,460
and the rest is up to virtualization.

636
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,020
We're also passionate about making sure

637
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,460
that open source projects thrive on the Mac,

638
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,540
especially if they benefit

639
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,380
the larger software developer community

640
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,900
and can help accelerating the port

641
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,940
of other software packages.

642
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,660
So we've already done the initial work

643
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,820
for some of the more widely used open source projects

644
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,180
to help the community get started.

645
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,980
And we'll be publishing patches to them in the next days.

646
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,940
They've ported things like Qt,

647
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,260
they've ported things like Mono, FFmpeg,

648
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,540
and others to their ARM processors.

649
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,300
Homebrew, that's a big one that stands out,

650
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,780
and Blender even.

651
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,860
Yeah, but for the actual Linux OS itself,

652
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,660
for that they've updated their hypervisor in Mac OS

653
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,700
and they expect that's how people will run Linux on Macs.

654
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,020
One area that we have worked on removing kernel extension

655
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,140
usage is for virtualization products.

656
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,020
The Mac is the world's best developer platform.

657
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,500
Many developer workflows require using tools

658
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,100
from different platforms or performing server deployments.

659
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,740
To meet these needs, many of you spin up virtual machines

660
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,460
running different operating systems

661
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,860
or lightweight containers like Docker.

662
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,740
And we know that this is critical to your work

663
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,220
and important we support these needs.

664
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,460
That's why we've been working hard with our partners

665
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,300
to support virtual machines on Macs with Apple Silicon.

666
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,340
As you saw in the keynote,

667
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,140
we started working with Parallels,

668
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,140
and I want to walk you through an early port

669
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,100
of Parallels Desktop for Mac,

670
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,580
running on the Apple hypervisor

671
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,580
that's been updated for Apple Silicon.

672
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:49,140
This is running on a prototype Mac with Apple Silicon

673
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,580
that supports virtualization.

674
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,740
Here we have a fully featured ARM version of Debian Linux

675
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,140
running on Parallels Desktop.

676
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,100
Remember, this doesn't require any third party

677
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,620
kernel extensions to be installed now.

678
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,060
I've installed Swift for Linux and started a new version

679
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:08,020
and started a new project with Vapor,

680
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,540
a Swift web framework you may be familiar with.

681
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,860
So we should be clear here, right?

682
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,100
That this is Debian on ARM?

683
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:14,940
Yes.

684
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,180
You can run efficient ARM VMs

685
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,140
on top of their ARM-based silicon.

686
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:20,980
Exactly.

687
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,820
This is Apple supporting Linux VMs that are ARM-based.

688
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,580
They have, I believe, taken Beehive from FreeBSD

689
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:32,300
and ported it to Mac OS and customized it

690
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,460
to run enhanced on their silicon.

691
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,980
It's now all in an SDK you can access.

692
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,260
So instead of having to make your own custom

693
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,820
kernel module basically,

694
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,860
there's just now regular Apple calls to the OS

695
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,460
that you can say like, hey, I want a new ARM VM.

696
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,100
Here's the disk image I want you to use and go at it.

697
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,300
Yeah, I mean, it's not unsimilar to how we do it on Linux.

698
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,140
It isn't a complete solution.

699
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,300
See where Microsoft, they closed the gap

700
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,060
and made a solution around Linux.

701
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:01,420
Apple is essentially offloading this work to Beehive

702
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,620
and Parallels, a commercial company to build the front end.

703
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,380
And then they're deprecating the ability

704
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,620
to actually run native operating systems on their hardware

705
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,460
and saying, well, look,

706
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,740
we've ported a bunch of the open source software

707
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,500
and we've got this fancy hypervisor

708
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,340
that we've stolen from BSD.

709
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,220
So what's your problem?

710
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,300
I think when you zoom out and look at this,

711
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,700
it means the world has one less Unix-like operating system

712
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,900
for the desktop.

713
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:33,900
And it makes Linux the most prominent Unix-like desktop

714
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,340
that is now available for general computers.

715
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,660
So if I take your point here,

716
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,780
it's that Mac OS is, for a while we pretended,

717
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,140
or I mean, and it was, right?

718
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,340
The Hackintosh world maybe demonstrates this best.

719
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,220
It was a sort of general purpose operating system.

720
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,060
Sure, 95% of it ran on Apple hardware,

721
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,100
but it was an operating system that could

722
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,380
and would support other things.

723
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,380
But in theory, the more iOS-like future Mac OS 11, I guess,

724
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,980
that's gonna be even more targeted

725
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,100
at custom Apple hardware and isn't intended anymore

726
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,660
if it ever really was for more general purpose things.

727
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,620
I don't think it's possible.

728
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,140
I think the controller,

729
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,980
which you've already seen at the T1 and the T2

730
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,620
that are in the MacBooks with touch bars and later,

731
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,740
it's never been supported by Linux.

732
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,900
And now they're going to integrate the secure enclave

733
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,780
and encryption and all of that into the system.

734
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,740
That'll never be supported by Linux.

735
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,940
They'll never do that.

736
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,660
I think that's an interesting aspect here.

737
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,980
You touched a little bit on, well, yeah,

738
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,460
I mean, Linux already supports ARM architectures and stuff,

739
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,140
but I think the biggest thing here

740
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,860
is they no longer have that Intel chip at the core

741
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:43,700
that limits sort of how they're gonna customize their board

742
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:47,100
and configure all the other chips running on the system.

743
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,620
Now that entire domain is basically in their hands.

744
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,100
And so, yeah, it's not new.

745
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,820
We already had the whole, the T2 chip,

746
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:56,300
lots of custom hardware and controllers

747
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,820
that just Linux didn't support

748
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,460
because it was all custom done

749
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,660
between the hardware and the software on Apple side.

750
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,780
This is just one bigger step down that road.

751
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,180
Yeah, very much.

752
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,780
And Drew, I know that you worked,

753
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,260
I think as an Apple genius or a certified Apple tech

754
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,860
for a while, ages ago,

755
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,820
back when you could put Linux on MacBooks.

756
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,700
I'm curious to know your perspective on this.

757
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,300
Yeah, I was ACSP and ACT certified for a while

758
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,140
working in the MSP world.

759
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,780
And one thing that I do want to be flat out about

760
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,540
is even though they make the promise

761
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,740
that they're going to be porting

762
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,820
some open source projects over,

763
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,420
I would be hesitant to really put any faith or trust in that

764
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:43,380
because they are so wary of the GPL v3

765
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,420
that they went so far as to roll

766
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,340
their own Samba implementation

767
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,580
rather than go up to Samba 3.

768
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:54,580
I would not expect for them to really bring out a ton here.

769
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,820
It's only going to be things using GPL v2, LGPL,

770
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,660
things that they consider to be friendly licenses to them.

771
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,260
And while that will cover a large portion

772
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,060
of open source products,

773
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,020
we're not looking at a case of Apple

774
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,300
is suddenly going to be a huge boon to open source on ARM.

775
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,700
I just don't think that's going to be the future for us.

776
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,700
Yeah, I could see it causing an industry reaction

777
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,260
where more players move towards ARM

778
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:29,100
and that has the net effect of improving

779
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,460
open source free software

780
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,940
and Linux's support for that platform.

781
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,460
I could see it having that sort of knock on domino effect

782
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,780
at the bigger picture level.

783
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,580
I don't think any direct hardware drivers

784
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,220
are going to be contributed by Apple.

785
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,540
For a brief moment,

786
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,420
when they started talking about Linux up on stage,

787
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:45,340
I thought, what if they did it?

788
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,460
What if they just took a sucker punch to Microsoft

789
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,860
and they went all in on a bootcamp style Linux support?

790
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,740
That'd be pretty great.

791
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,580
But Apple users aren't going to care.

792
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,180
I think it was a very common use case

793
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,500
that if they were going to be using Linux,

794
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,140
they'd be using it in a VM or in a terminal,

795
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,660
SSHed into a server.

796
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,140
They weren't putting Linux on their MacBooks.

797
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,660
This is just something that I've always thought

798
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,780
would be great to see Apple support.

799
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,700
And now it's just, that hope is gone.

800
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,820
For the most end users,

801
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,180
I think running it in a well-supported VM

802
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,420
is actually going to be a pretty good solution for them.

803
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,060
Unfortunately, I think when you look at the state

804
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,060
of software distribution and development

805
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,460
in the open source world,

806
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,580
this is going to fit right in

807
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,140
with where most people are at.

808
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,620
And then something to keep in mind,

809
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,260
there's the Docker angle here.

810
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,260
And that also got a mention in Apple's keynote

811
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,980
and in the State of the Union,

812
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,300
where some of these clips are coming from.

813
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,820
And it seems they're planning to work with Docker

814
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:46,340
to bring some kind of support natively to macOS.

815
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,740
These environments can interact

816
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,500
due to features built into macOS Big Sur.

817
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,380
And thanks to the hypervisor framework

818
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,260
with complete support for networking, storage,

819
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,900
input devices, and much more.

820
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,540
Virtualization technology is used by container solutions

821
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,700
such as Docker.

822
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,380
And we know it's incredibly important for many of you

823
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,860
as it's a very common for server-side development

824
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,340
and testing.

825
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,380
So we'll be working with Docker to enable this

826
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,780
in the coming months.

827
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:15,420
To Docker somehow via some probably virtualization tool

828
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,660
like it's done on Windows.

829
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,740
Right, well, I mean, that's how it works now, right?

830
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:21,620
Docker just spins up a Linux VM in the background

831
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,340
and then the user space sort of connects everything through

832
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,780
with proxies and forwarding.

833
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,780
On macOS already?

834
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,340
Yeah, yeah, that's how they do it now

835
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,180
because they didn't go the Windows route

836
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,580
of having this before fancy API compatibility

837
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,740
and now just even more built-in things.

838
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,780
So instead of OS X or OS 11 now doing,

839
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,420
Windows does that at the OS layer for you

840
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,100
with WSL and on the Mac side,

841
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,500
that's what the fancy Docker desktop app is for.

842
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,660
Yeah, and we're not gonna see something like WSL on Macs.

843
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,820
That's just, it's not gonna happen.

844
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,940
They are too scared of dipping their toes in the water

845
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,500
of something that is a license that requires you

846
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,540
to contribute back.

847
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,900
That's never been their thing.

848
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,900
For lack of a better word, they're takers,

849
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:06,220
they're not contributors to open source.

850
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,180
And we're not going to see something like them

851
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,420
bringing the Linux kernel into Mac

852
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,060
and having it run things natively.

853
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,860
It's just never going to happen

854
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,940
unless there's a huge cultural shift at Cupertino.

855
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,020
You know, that's really interesting.

856
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,740
You were talking about the taker side

857
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:23,580
and I think they kind of hit on it there.

858
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,300
They were talking about how they've already made

859
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,620
some patches that are gonna be contributing

860
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,700
to a wide range of open source software.

861
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,020
But right at the end, they mentioned,

862
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,660
the whole goal of that is it's just like a recognition

863
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,660
that these software libraries are at the base

864
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,500
of so much proprietary software and open source

865
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,860
or mixed licensed software,

866
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,340
that their goal was to get end user software going.

867
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,900
And so they just had to touch these base systems.

868
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,340
And it's an interesting model of take when you want,

869
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,300
contribute when you need to.

870
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,660
It's very Apple.

871
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,300
And you think about their focus.

872
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,380
Their focus really at the end of the day

873
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,860
is all about iOS services,

874
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,180
building that iOS ecosystem platform.

875
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,100
That's really what drives them.

876
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,980
And so you can kind of look at the lens

877
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,820
of these decisions through that.

878
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,980
This is bringing the Mac platform closer together.

879
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,580
It means that the Mac is once again,

880
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,620
kind of its own unique branch of technology

881
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,540
like it was back when it was power PC

882
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,140
or even Motorola based.

883
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,660
I think, now I could be wrong,

884
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,980
but I think this is tremendously wonderful for Linux

885
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,140
on the desktop.

886
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,220
And it's also to FreeBSD's loss.

887
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,500
If you think about it,

888
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,500
imagine just for like a crazy branch of reality moment,

889
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,620
let's picture that, right, FreeBSD was GPO.

890
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:40,460
And then let's picture that Apple decided to adopt

891
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,740
some of the BSD user lens stuff

892
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,140
and bring it in with their mock kernel into Mac OS.

893
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,540
And that every single improvement they made

894
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,940
to any of those tools or any of that user space stuff

895
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,820
over time had to be contributed 100% back up to FreeBSD.

896
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,020
Where would FreeBSD be today?

897
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,580
And I know Apple hates the GPO

898
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,220
and they don't wanna use that blah, blah, blah.

899
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,180
Even though they do have some GPO projects actually.

900
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,180
But I know that for their desktop

901
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,260
and for their consumer systems,

902
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,820
that's not what they're into.

903
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,060
But imagine that moment.

904
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,060
This could be FreeBSD's moment

905
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,140
for those who want to remain on the x86 platform.

906
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,820
This could be FreeBSD's moment,

907
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,020
but instead it will be Linux and Windows.

908
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,540
And I think for those who want a Unix like system,

909
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:26,540
now you have Lenovo, Dell and System76,

910
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,700
Intraware and others that are at the top

911
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,540
of their games right now.

912
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:33,100
Making Linux hardware, top Linux hardware,

913
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,900
the best Linux hardware we've ever seen.

914
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,180
And it's a perfectly functional developer system

915
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,860
that you can install and just continue to upgrade.

916
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,620
And you don't have all these shenanigans

917
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,460
where once a year they're gonna pull the rug out

918
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,780
from underneath you with either a new UI

919
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,700
or a new platform or a new way of distributing apps

920
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,980
or a new app store system

921
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,860
or a new in-app payment restriction.

922
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,460
That kind of stuff just doesn't happen.

923
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:57,380
And it's just goofy nonsense

924
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,460
that people that are creating server-side and web software

925
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,140
just don't even need to deal with.

926
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:03,580
Now, people who are writing iOS apps and Mac apps,

927
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,540
they'll have to deal with it,

928
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,820
but I think Apple will limit the total developer appeal

929
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,540
by moving away from x86.

930
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,380
Right, I mean, they have done a lot to show how games

931
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,660
and other sort of graphical utilities will run,

932
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,700
but you've just got to wonder how many times

933
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,220
is there some weird C library

934
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,180
that you have to get all the right build dependencies

935
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,500
installed for to get it to compile

936
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,860
just because your Python app needs to link against it

937
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,060
so it can use those advanced features.

938
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,700
Now, it does seem like they've already,

939
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,860
they've been paying particular attention to that.

940
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,060
If you look at some of the libraries,

941
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,180
they've already chosen to port,

942
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,700
but sometimes you get into the weeds

943
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:38,660
and there just isn't an arm build for it

944
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,980
and you're not comfortable porting that C dependency,

945
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,420
you might be stuck.

946
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,940
Yeah, I think also the lack of virtualization options

947
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,940
will hurt.

948
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:51,940
When you spend $3,000, $4,000 on a computer,

949
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,500
you want to be able to do all of the things

950
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,420
you needed to be able to do.

951
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,780
And that often for a lot of professional workloads

952
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:02,300
or even hobbyist workloads includes virtualization

953
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:07,300
and emulating full stack, emulating x86 on arm.

954
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,980
I don't care how fast your arm processors are,

955
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,260
that's going to be painful.

956
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,580
And it seems like Apple sort of has built a mechanism

957
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,180
for certain types of Mac software

958
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,060
and they're calling it Rosetta 2.

959
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,620
Now, while we expect most developers

960
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,300
will go native immediately,

961
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,940
we want to make sure that users can run all of their apps

962
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,060
on day one, even if some apps haven't yet been updated.

963
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,300
Now, we've been down this road before.

964
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,420
When we transitioned from PowerPC to Intel processors,

965
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,700
a cornerstone of that transition was Rosetta,

966
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,820
a technology that makes it possible to run PowerPC apps

967
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,060
on Intel-based Macs.

968
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:48,220
Mac OS Big Sur will include a new version of Rosetta,

969
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,620
Rosetta 2.

970
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,780
Rosetta 2 automatically translates your existing Mac apps

971
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:55,820
so they work on new Macs with Apple Silicon.

972
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,500
And this time, Rosetta is even faster,

973
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,140
more powerful, and more compatible.

974
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,420
We will see.

975
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,260
They say it translates the apps at launch time.

976
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:08,260
And if you download the app from the Mac App Store,

977
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,020
in the background, it will translate the calls

978
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,900
almost wine proton style, where it says,

979
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,380
okay, this is an x86 call,

980
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,940
I'm going to translate it to an Apple Silicon call.

981
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,180
And it will pre-catch that for certain types of apps.

982
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,860
And then for apps that you download from the web,

983
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,860
they will figure it out on first launch.

984
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,760
And so that first launch will have a delay.

985
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,860
That's where it's really interesting

986
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,460
because they have the ability both to like

987
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,980
just sort of convert it ahead of time

988
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,500
for a compiled application,

989
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,860
or for something like a web browser

990
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,460
that's running just-in-time compiled JavaScript,

991
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,020
then they can do it just at runtime too,

992
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,700
which I mean, clearly,

993
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,980
that's where a lot of engineering effort,

994
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:49,220
besides building the Silicon,

995
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,060
they spent a lot of time monitoring it too, I'm sure.

996
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,860
It's an interesting bit of technology.

997
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:57,060
I think part of me covers this with a bit of sadness.

998
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,180
It would have been great to see something like Mac OS

999
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,660
just become generally available.

1000
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,900
I would love to see Apple just say,

1001
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,060
yeah, you know what we're going to do

1002
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,900
is we're going to make it the most powerful

1003
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,060
developer workstation for every developer in the world

1004
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,740
like they claim it is by making it available

1005
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,860
to everyone in the world.

1006
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,020
Right, compete on the same terms of like,

1007
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,740
I can buy some sort of decoupled hardware,

1008
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,220
whatever I want happens to suit me best, Mac or otherwise,

1009
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,740
and then run your operating system

1010
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,140
because it's a good operating system with a good ecosystem,

1011
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,500
which that all might be true,

1012
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,620
but I just, I can't run on a ThinkPad or an XPS.

1013
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:34,620
Yeah, and with this transition, Mac OS 10 is done.

1014
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,180
They're done, they ran it for about 17 years.

1015
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,460
They got about 18, 17 years of life out of it.

1016
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,820
Really, they're launching Mac OS 11,

1017
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,340
and that will be a new version,

1018
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:49,100
a new branch with a new UI with these new features

1019
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,800
and aim for ARM compatibility towards the future.

1020
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,120
And I think when we look at this,

1021
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:59,020
we as a desktop are not yet ready

1022
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,260
to fully replace either Windows or Mac OS still.

1023
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,940
And we covered this a little bit last week.

1024
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:06,600
I would love to have seen our desktop environments

1025
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,500
be even a little more robust,

1026
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,020
get even a little more polished.

1027
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,900
I'd love to see a more powerful file system used by default

1028
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,220
in more distributions.

1029
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,540
I would like to see more engineering

1030
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,180
put into some of the finer touches

1031
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,500
to get developers up and running with sets of tools.

1032
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,620
Like you've seen certain distributions invest in,

1033
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:25,820
but it's just unique to them.

1034
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,660
Those are areas where I think like Linux

1035
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,260
could have shored up a little bit

1036
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:32,760
before this opportunity came around, but here's the thing.

1037
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,380
This is to Apple's own admittance, a two-year transition.

1038
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,220
Now, Tim Cook says they're gonna start shipping ARM Macs

1039
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,620
by the end of this year,

1040
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,380
but they say it'll take them multiple years

1041
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:43,780
to actually pull this off.

1042
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,140
We still have time and we still have an opportunity

1043
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,300
to see where the rest of the industry goes here.

1044
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:51,060
And I think Linux is in a really,

1045
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,220
really good position right now

1046
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,660
because of our early work on ARM

1047
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,260
and because of the continued acceleration

1048
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,660
of adoption of ARM in the cloud,

1049
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,340
which will benefit Linux as well.

1050
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,780
I think we're in a good position.

1051
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,620
Yeah, you're right.

1052
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,780
I mean, really everything's been going well from Linux.

1053
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,140
Microsoft recognizes it.

1054
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,900
I mean, Apple clearly recognizes it,

1055
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,620
mentioning Linux at WWDC,

1056
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,340
a powerful ecosystem of easily recompilable software.

1057
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,980
That's about the best thing you could hope for, right?

1058
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:17,920
They had to go set up special relationships

1059
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,340
with folks like Microsoft and Adobe

1060
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,140
to make sure that their flagship products would run

1061
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,900
versus the open source approach where they just said,

1062
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,060
oh yeah, we already fixed it.

1063
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,420
We'll send you the patches.

1064
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,240
Yeah, and it's just gonna be in the OS and good.

1065
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,080
Yeah, exactly.

1066
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,660
I mean, it gives them more control

1067
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,780
and to some extent, if they contribute some other things,

1068
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,180
it might benefit the ecosystem.

1069
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,760
I mean, just running on their platform is good.

1070
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,740
Ideally, you'd hope that they would continue to do

1071
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,020
and contribute some improvements and such,

1072
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,980
but they at least acknowledge

1073
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:46,020
they have to play a little bit of ball.

1074
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:48,980
So what do you think Intel's reaction will be, Byte?

1075
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,560
Well, if I look at how Intel reacted

1076
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,820
when Microsoft went with Snapdragon,

1077
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,580
it will be a lot of lawsuits coming up.

1078
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,980
Yeah, especially it seems like Microsoft got in that area

1079
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:03,580
when it came to the emulation of x86

1080
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,080
and Intel released some statement already saying,

1081
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,580
we're gonna keep working with Apple on other stuff.

1082
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,380
You know, we don't just sell them CPUs,

1083
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,180
but also our CPUs are still better.

1084
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,100
They essentially released that statement.

1085
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,840
Well, I'll just say this before we wrap up,

1086
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,220
if anybody out there in the audience

1087
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:22,060
ends up with one of these Mac mini iPad monsters,

1088
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,100
try putting Linux on there and let us know how it goes.

1089
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:25,280
I'd be curious.

1090
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,340
Okay, Westpane, before we get out of here,

1091
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:33,020
we do have a pick this week that is rad.

1092
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,380
It just, first of all,

1093
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,260
is a great example of how awesome

1094
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,260
a command line application can look.

1095
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,140
And second of all, very handy.

1096
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:41,440
Yeah, this is so cool.

1097
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,860
It's called Unsilence,

1098
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,560
and it's a console interface in library

1099
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,180
to remove just the silent parts of a media file.

1100
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,700
Yeah, even videos or whatnot.

1101
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,540
So say you download a lecture

1102
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:58,460
and the professor pauses, walks back and forth

1103
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,460
and just sort of, you know,

1104
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,720
maybe there's two, three, four, five, 10 seconds

1105
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,100
of silence there, just snip all that out for you.

1106
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,380
Or sometimes Chris is burping on the live stream

1107
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,500
and you just don't want to hear it.

1108
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:09,480
Yeah, you do need something tuned for burps though.

1109
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,660
That is not impossible though.

1110
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,160
Right, customized.

1111
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,460
That's what Drew's for.

1112
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,740
Drew's tuned for burps.

1113
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,380
We appreciate you.

1114
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,380
Yeah, can we develop a machine learning module

1115
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,300
for detecting burps and farts?

1116
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,100
That would make my life much easier.

1117
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,580
Well, we've got plenty of sample data,

1118
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,960
so we should be able to.

1119
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,280
Yeah, there you go, I have a link to that

1120
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,440
and everything else in the show notes.

1121
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,360
That's such a nice app.

1122
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,500
It gives you tons of feedback as it goes through

1123
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,440
and like figures out where all the silent bits are

1124
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,440
and removes them.

1125
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,680
And you know, there's all kinds of stuff

1126
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,280
because it's just some Python and FFmpeg.

1127
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,700
And so if you want to customize this,

1128
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:48,540
you want to make a video

1129
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,780
where it's a whole bunch of jump cuts really quick,

1130
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:51,620
or you want to make a video

1131
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,720
that just contains the silent parts,

1132
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,880
all of that's possible with this library.

1133
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:59,500
Everything is possible with FFmpeg, let's be honest.

1134
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,800
It's the best tool ever.

1135
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,560
And it's already ported to run on Apple Silicon.

1136
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:06,320
Oh, good.

1137
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,080
All right, well, I think that's about all the Apple talk

1138
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,840
we have in us for like the next 360 episodes,

1139
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,160
so that should be good.

1140
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Unless somebody gets their hands

1141
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,320
on one of them development kits,

1142
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,760
then we might bring it up again.

1143
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,560
LinuxUnplugged.com slash contact,

1144
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,640
one more plug for how you get ahold of us.

1145
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,040
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1146
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,280
The show is at Linux Unplugged on the Twitters,

1147
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,200
if you use it.

1148
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,040
And if you don't, I understand.

1149
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,520
Just go tell a friend about the show.

1150
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,880
Spread the word about the big talk show, we appreciate it.

1151
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,400
Let the world know there's an Unplugged out there for them.

1152
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,040
See you next Tuesday!

1153
00:45:37,040 --> 00:46:03,440
士 put your phones in your pocket

1154
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:21,220
So I think, you know, the reality is, is that Macs haven't been for a long time or were

1155
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:24,880
never going to be computers that you could just use for whatever you want.

1156
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:31,160
They are a product that has that product's operating system, like a Nintendo Switch does,

1157
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,160
like a PlayStation or an Xbox does.

1158
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,800
And you've got to think about it in that context, not in a, hey, this is a piece of consumer

1159
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,320
technology that is mine and I can do what I want with.

1160
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:46,460
You have to think of it as this is a piece of technology that is built for very purpose

1161
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,520
specific things.

1162
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,160
And if I am doing those things, perhaps it's good for me, but I can't make it do what I

1163
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:54,160
want.

1164
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,040
And even though it's very expensive and if I spend $4,000 on a laptop, I should be able

1165
00:46:58,040 --> 00:46:59,880
to do everything with it.

1166
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,600
That's just not the reality is there is a use case spectrum now, and it just if it doesn't

1167
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:30,720
fit within that use case spectrum, this is not a computer for you.
