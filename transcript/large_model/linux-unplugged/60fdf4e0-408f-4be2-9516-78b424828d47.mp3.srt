1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
I think PipeWire just landed the killer feature

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,400
that's gonna make every desktop Linux user

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,440
want to transition to PipeWire.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,360
What is it?

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,880
In version 0.3.25, you can now use your phone

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,280
as a microphone to your Linux box through Bluetooth.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,120
What?

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,200
Yeah, and that's an awesome feature.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,920
I think that's something we need to try.

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,320
It makes it now possible to use A2DP

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,960
as a source input device.

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,820
So you can then use your phone as an A2DP microphone.

13
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,040
And you know, Wes, like some of these phones actually

14
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,540
have decent microphones on them.

15
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,440
This could be like a seriously great way

16
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,040
to get audio from a guest or somebody.

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,680
You're just tired of dragging that remote mic around.

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,520
Yeah.

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,200
Or just, you think Joe will let us get away

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,760
with using our phones for doing the show?

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,760
I think we better try without telling him.

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:55,760
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

23
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,680
My name is Chris.

24
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,760
My name is Wes.

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,200
Hello, Wes.

26
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,760
And can I just say, your new 400 after-party face

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,080
tat you got is, well, it's going to heal real soon.

28
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,280
Aw, thank you.

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,520
But you know, you still owe me.

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,920
You said you'd paid for it if I got the show's logo on my face.

31
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,420
Right.

32
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,420
Yeah, we'll get to that.

33
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,460
But first, I want to thank ACG for sponsoring

34
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:18,600
this episode of Linux Unplugged.

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,240
They are the leader in learning for Cloud, Linux,

36
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,480
and other modern tech skills.

37
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,840
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs,

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,520
get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

39
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,980
Well, coming up on the show today,

40
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,920
it's the show that wasn't supposed to be.

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,400
We were going to take the week off.

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,200
And we thought about it a little bit.

43
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,920
We thought, well, actually, there's a lot to catch up on.

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,280
We have a lot that we want to cover.

45
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,400
There's things from 400 we still have to talk about.

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,540
And so we're going to kind of have the no-show.

47
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,600
It's like a no-show this week.

48
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,840
From the wackos that brought you running arch on their server,

49
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,200
we're going to talk about hosting your own email server.

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,400
This is another one of those don't do

51
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,360
as we do kind of episodes, unless you really want to.

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,400
We're going to cover some server basics, what

53
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,760
you need to be aware of, and how we're

54
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,680
going to try to make it all work smooth for us

55
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,180
and what our use case is going to be

56
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,680
for self-hosting our own email.

57
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,640
But we'll get to all of that.

58
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,440
There's a lot to take in there.

59
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,280
The truth of the matter is we just have a lot going on.

60
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,260
We wanted to do something kind of fun with you guys this week.

61
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,960
And we'll take time off in the near future.

62
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,760
We'll take a week off, because we do have a great interview

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,280
all about an individual who didn't know anything

64
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,900
about construction, didn't know anything about diesel engines,

65
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,280
didn't know anything about Linux,

66
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,080
didn't know anything about automation.

67
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,000
And he went out and bought himself a school bus

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,600
and rebuilt it from the ground up as a mobile home

69
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,680
that he works from with his family on the road,

70
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,480
all powered by Linux, using automation

71
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,320
to manage the tanks and the batteries and all of it.

72
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,560
And so it's a great conversation.

73
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,560
If you want inspiration or just a little,

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,880
you can get your project done, that's

75
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,120
the interview right there.

76
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,480
Yeah, it's so inspiring how somebody

77
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,800
who didn't know something just decided, so what?

78
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,040
I'm just going to go learn it.

79
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,320
And he just, at every turn, he had to just go learn something.

80
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,520
And even when it came to setting up a Linux server,

81
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,400
he didn't sway.

82
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,680
He just said, you know what?

83
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,440
I've gotten this far.

84
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,320
I'm going to learn it.

85
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,960
So we will run that story in the future.

86
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,880
It just today didn't feel like the right time,

87
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,960
because we had a lot we want to do.

88
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,960
And we just had an episode that was honestly a little off topic.

89
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,760
So today, we're just going to have some fun.

90
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,140
So before we go any further, let's

91
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,920
bring in our virtual lug, time-appropriate greetings,

92
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,400
Mumble Room.

93
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:42,900
Hello.

94
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,400
Hello.

95
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,080
It's Tuesday.

96
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,760
Why are there 25 of you here?

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,160
We told you for two weeks in a row

98
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,240
we weren't doing a show today.

99
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,960
I don't know if they weren't listening,

100
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,920
or they were listening when we said we were

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,560
going to do a show like today.

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,320
I think everyone's still drunk on beer from episode 400.

103
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,160
That's what I think.

104
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,660
I am.

105
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,160
Yeah.

106
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,960
You know.

107
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,440
Speaking of episode 400, the votes are in.

108
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,080
Our special 400 brew was named by the community.

109
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,960
It's officially named the See You Next Tuesday beer.

110
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
The See You Next Tuesday.

111
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,000
And I'm drinking a little Tuesday right now, Wes,

112
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,640
let me tell you.

113
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,880
Oh, you got things plumbed up again, huh?

114
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,080
Drinking in my beer stein, too, Wes, in my brand new 400 beer

115
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,560
stein.

116
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,480
If you ordered them early, they were already starting to arrive.

117
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,520
Oh, that's great.

118
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,720
It's actually pretty special, in a way.

119
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,600
You know, I mean, I'm sitting here in my studio

120
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,320
drinking a Linux-unplugged beer in a Linux-unplugged beer

121
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:33,840
stein.

122
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,720
Talk about self-hosting, right?

123
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,320
Right, and we're doing an episode

124
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,200
because we just wanted to.

125
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,320
We could have taken the week off.

126
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,000
We said we were going to, but we just kind of wanted to.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,800
So yeah, the beer steins are shipping,

128
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,080
which is really great.

129
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,800
Yours is here, Wes, waiting for you.

130
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,600
Oh, great.

131
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,360
I've been jealous.

132
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,800
I mean, I've already seen a few community members posting

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,560
theirs on Telegram or on the matrix server, which

134
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,080
is awesome.

135
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,400
Please keep doing that.

136
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,440
They look good in your hands out there.

137
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,120
That's true.

138
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,000
I do love seeing that, and I think they do look good.

139
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,840
I'm really happy with how they turned out,

140
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,800
and I'm glad that they're shipping right away

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,680
because Coda Radio listeners will

142
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,240
know that I recently had my butt kicked by a robe.

143
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,880
I was schooled by a robe and didn't like that very much.

144
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,240
It's been a minute, Wes, since I really was schooled.

145
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,120
I went to the hard knocks of business school

146
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,000
for a couple of weeks.

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,400
I think we might need a sandboard clip for that one.

148
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,200
Really?

149
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,360
It was bad.

150
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,120
But I did learn some fundamental lessons, I'll say that.

151
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,440
I just learned them the really, really hard way.

152
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,320
And so towards the end of the show today,

153
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,360
after we get through the news and the email server stuff,

154
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm going to share some very new and first steps

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,960
that I'm taking to grow Jupiter Broadcasting as a business.

156
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,080
It's kind of been just about a year-ish

157
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,600
since the plans to go independent were

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,640
beginning and the thought and the process was starting.

159
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,880
And so I want to do a bit of an update for you all

160
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,400
and share that with you.

161
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,120
We have a couple of big updates there and some lessons

162
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,160
I've learned, some humble pie that I have to eat,

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,400
and all of that.

164
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,800
But we'll get there.

165
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,280
But first, let's do some business

166
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,840
and let's get to the community news

167
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,520
because we have an update from Google.

168
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,040
It seems Google has become concerned

169
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,560
about the correctness of code, as they put it

170
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,040
in the Android platform.

171
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,440
And they say, correctness of code

172
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,200
is a top priority for the security, stability,

173
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,120
and quality of each Android release.

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
Unfortunately, memory safety bugs in C and C++

175
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,960
continue to be their most difficult to address

176
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,840
source of, quote, incorrectness, not bugs.

177
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,620
Here we're talking about the Android underpinnings,

178
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,200
not like the Java or Kotlin or whatever

179
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,240
framework you're using to develop your Android apps,

180
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,120
but all the stuff that runs at the lower levels.

181
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,400
And we should probably give them credit because, I mean,

182
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,560
Google and Android developers more widely

183
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,400
do invest a lot of effort and resources trying to detect,

184
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,280
trying to fix, or just mitigate this type of bug upfront.

185
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,680
And those efforts are pretty effective.

186
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,380
I mean, yes, bugs get through, but a large number of bugs

187
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,200
are prevented from ever making it into an actual Android

188
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,840
release.

189
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,360
And then from me complaining about it on air.

190
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,380
But memory safety issues are still a big contributor,

191
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,600
even given all of that.

192
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,540
Something like 70% of Android's high severity security

193
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:25,040
vulnerabilities are due to memory safety issues.

194
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,720
Oof.

195
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,680
Yeah, that's not great.

196
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,240
So to help combat this, Google is

197
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,880
excited to announce their words that the Android open source

198
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,800
project now supports the Rust programming

199
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,620
language for developing the operating system itself.

200
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,440
Rust?

201
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,000
On my phone?

202
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Wow.

203
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,320
Google notes that adding the new language to the Android platform

204
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,560
is, quote, a large undertaking.

205
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,400
No kidding.

206
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,320
I mean, that comes alongside Java and Kotlin too, right?

207
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,660
They say that there are tool chains and dependencies that

208
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,000
needed to be maintained, test infrastructure and tooling

209
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,480
that had to be updated.

210
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,160
And then here's a big one.

211
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,920
Developers needed to be trained.

212
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,800
And for the past 18 months, Google

213
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,480
has been adding Rust support to the Android open source

214
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,760
project and has a few early adopter projects

215
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,400
that they'll be talking about.

216
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,720
They say scaling this to more of the OS

217
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,720
is a multi-year project.

218
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,440
So stay tuned, and there will be more updates

219
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
from the Google Security blog.

220
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,780
And didn't we see that the Bluetooth stack, Wes,

221
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,320
was one of their first kind of go out there and fix

222
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,280
them projects?

223
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes, it was.

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,080
You know, I hope Mozilla feels secretly good about this.

225
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,280
I mean, I think this is Google admitting Rust is good stuff.

226
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,000
And they're not just talking about it in a small way.

227
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
They're talking about it alongside Java and Kotlin.

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yeah, I mean, it sounds like this

229
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,840
is going to be a first class language you

230
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,000
can use to implement whatever features you might

231
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,960
need in the base OS itself.

232
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,880
And at least once tooling is up to speed,

233
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,680
once all the build infrastructure is there.

234
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,840
But that's a significant investment and endorsement.

235
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,240
I love that we kind of put our eye on this about a year ago,

236
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,920
that the Rust type was really building.

237
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,480
And Google's been, for that entire time, working on this.

238
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,440
Also, speaking of Rust, listener Mike Kelly

239
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,600
was just looking for an excuse to play around with Rust

240
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,040
and wanted to celebrate Linux Unplugged's 400th episode.

241
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,000
And so he combined a little bit of Rust with a fun project

242
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,440
and created a mini website at lup400.com.

243
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,360
And you know what, Wes?

244
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,560
It's all powered in Rust.

245
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,560
Hey, and it sure looks better than any of our websites.

246
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,960
Right?

247
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,680
I didn't really realize you could develop websites in Rust.

248
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,160
Tells you what a noob I am.

249
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,640
And then the other thing he did, which is really adorable,

250
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,160
is he embedded episode one, which nobody should probably

251
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,080
ever listen to, in there.

252
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,840
So Mike, I guess we should get in contact.

253
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,040
It's time for you to rewrite the entire Jupyter broadcasting

254
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,840
website in Rust.

255
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,120
How on brand would that be?

256
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,240
Cool.

257
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,240
That's what we need.

258
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,600
Thank you, Mike, for doing that.

259
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,000
Yeah, we'll have a link if you want to check it out.

260
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,640
Of course, it's open source.

261
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,920
How great.

262
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,120
So this episode, we thought maybe,

263
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,200
and maybe one of the reasons to go live,

264
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,760
is that we'd have an update on that Linux-powered helicopter

265
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,240
on Mars named Ingenuity.

266
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,840
It was set to take its first test flight.

267
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,840
And then by just about now, as we'd be recording,

268
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,720
we'd have the return data from the surface of Mars.

269
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,240
But it turns out that helicopter flight was delayed.

270
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,000
During a high-speed spin test of the rotors on Friday,

271
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,640
the command sequence controlling the test

272
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,960
ended early due to a watchdog timer expiration.

273
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,000
And as you can imagine, those watchdogs are there

274
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,040
to catch things that aren't working very well.

275
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,000
And so it triggered a process of stop.

276
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,160
We have to diagnose and figure out what went wrong.

277
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,480
But Wes, it seems like maybe they actually figured out

278
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,640
what the failure was.

279
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,760
Yeah, that's right.

280
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,920
I mean, at least so they say.

281
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,960
The Ingenuity team has identified a software solution

282
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,720
for the command sequence issue.

283
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,680
I guess over the weekend, they basically considered

284
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,680
and tested all the ideas of what this could be

285
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,800
and how they could address it.

286
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,040
And they concluded that a tiny little modification

287
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,600
and reinstallation of Ingenuity's flight control software

288
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,280
was the most robust path forward.

289
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,880
Although that sounds pretty tough when this thing is on Mars.

290
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,840
I know, it's like, there's nothing straightforward

291
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840
about reinstalling a software package

292
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,720
on a tiny helicopter in the belly of a rover.

293
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,560
Actually, now it's not.

294
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,040
But there's just nothing simple about that.

295
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,200
And that's why it has to go through extensive testing.

296
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,040
The software update will modify the process

297
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,560
by which the two flight controllers boot up,

298
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,400
allowing the hardware and software to safely transition

299
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,680
to the flight state and meet the time expectations.

300
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,640
Yeah, and so it sounds like they actually know

301
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,480
what this changes.

302
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,840
It's not gonna be that big of a deal.

303
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,400
They've got mockups here on Earth.

304
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,120
They've definitely experimented with it before,

305
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,680
but they've actually got to transmit all those updates

306
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,800
all the way there to the rover itself,

307
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,400
get it transferred over to Ingenuity,

308
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,080
and then actually run the update command.

309
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,960
And I mean, we've all updated things on servers

310
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,920
and sort of waited for the prompt to come back,

311
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,040
but can you even imagine?

312
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,760
No, Wes.

313
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,480
No, I am not the personality type for this kind of stuff

314
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,920
because I get anxious when we reboot the Arch server

315
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,200
in the garage.

316
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,280
Yeah, I think this is one of those

317
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,920
measure twice, patch once situations.

318
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,600
Yeah, so okay, so they have to get it tested.

319
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,360
They have to get it qualified, as they put it,

320
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,520
and then they have to upload it,

321
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,400
and then it has to install.

322
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,200
So they don't really have a new test flight date.

323
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,360
They say our best estimate is a targeted fluid date.

324
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,640
We're working towards achieving these milestones,

325
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,280
and we should be able to set a flight date next week.

326
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,360
So possibly by next week's episode,

327
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,680
we'll have an update on when the first

328
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,280
Linux-powered helicopter will fly on Mars.

329
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,120
Here's hoping.

330
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
And really, we should expect these kind of things, right?

331
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,440
This is all brand new science.

332
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,240
A few things are bound to go wrong.

333
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,040
Lino.com slash unplugged.

334
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,960
Go there to get a $100 60-day credit towards a new account,

335
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,120
and you go there to support the show.

336
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,900
Linode is our cloud server provider.

337
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,560
I was just messing around this weekend.

338
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,160
I actually love it for setting up multiple servers

339
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,400
and then trying out different distributions

340
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,720
and different software packages,

341
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,000
and then picking a winner,

342
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,200
and then that's the Linode that remains standing,

343
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
and I just destroy all of the other ones.

344
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,140
They're the world's largest independent

345
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,240
cloud computing provider,

346
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,360
and they make it easy to get your creation

347
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,800
on the internet fast,

348
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,400
no matter what your skill level is.

349
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,480
If you're brand new to Linux,

350
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,800
you're brand new to servers,

351
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,680
or if you've been doing it for a decade,

352
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
they got a technology stack that'll work for you,

353
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,360
and they can help your ideas come to life on the web.

354
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,880
And if you run into any trouble,

355
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,200
Linode comes with amazing,

356
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,200
outstanding 24-7 customer support

357
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,880
by phone or by ticket.

358
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,920
This is like the number one thing I hear now

359
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,040
from our audiences.

360
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,240
Man, I was in a jam,

361
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,640
and Linode stuck with me through the entire thing.

362
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,720
I've got one $5 a month server,

363
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,800
and they still help me out.

364
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,640
On top of that,

365
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,680
they have hundreds of guides and tutorials

366
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,760
to help you get started

367
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,240
and dig through what you need to know

368
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,520
or understand some terminology,

369
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,520
and they have things like how to secure phpMyAdmin

370
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,360
if you're gonna use that,

371
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,520
because honestly, I understand it's a good tool,

372
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,480
but you gotta be a little bit worried

373
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,960
about putting that out in the public.

374
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,280
They have guides to help you manage things like that,

375
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,320
so that way, you have some confidence,

376
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,720
some peace of mind.

377
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,920
That's what's great about their guides.

378
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,360
They give you that kind of confidence

379
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,880
to put this stuff into production,

380
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,000
and they have easy-to-use, one-click applications

381
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,040
for like a LAMP stack or WordPress,

382
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,760
but also some other really kind of really more sophisticated

383
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,240
and complicated things to set up,

384
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,200
from gaming servers to entire e-commerce stacks.

385
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,120
And with S3-compatible object storage,

386
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,000
you can find all kinds of great usage

387
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,480
for things that don't require a server

388
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,720
but still need storage in the cloud.

389
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,040
They have super-fast networking

390
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,480
and 11 data centers worldwide.

391
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,200
Plus, they support shows like this

392
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,960
and events like Linux Fest Northwest,

393
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,240
All Things Open, The Kubuntu Project,

394
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,640
a lot of Linux media out there.

395
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
I mean, they're a pretty special company,

396
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,320
and they have a great service.

397
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,720
They've been around since 2003,

398
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,360
and they've really dialed it in like nobody else.

399
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,480
And now, they're just dedicating to make sure

400
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,240
that if you wanna run something on Linux,

401
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,360
it's not gonna run anywhere better than it runs on Linode.

402
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,200
It's gonna run fast, it's gonna run stable,

403
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,880
and you're gonna get a bunch of great information

404
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,720
and fantastic customer support

405
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,760
and a company that loves Linux behind it,

406
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,480
and you can support one of your favorite podcasts

407
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
at the same time.

408
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,560
So go to linode.com slash unplugged.

409
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,560
Well, it looks like someone spilled beer all over in here.

410
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,560
I think it's time we clean up, Chris.

411
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,880
Yeah, we could do for a spot of housekeeping around here.

412
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,120
So I just wanna mention that if you wanna get

413
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
a little more show, one of the things you can do

414
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,160
is subscribe to the membership program.

415
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,520
That's a great way to get more show.

416
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,640
We have two feeds available, one that is a limited ad feed,

417
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,640
and one that is the full everything we did live feed.

418
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,440
I mean, sometimes it's two hours long,

419
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,000
but there's a lot of content in there.

420
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,720
We try to make it entertaining,

421
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,000
and we make it available as our members

422
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,040
as a way to say thank you.

423
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,160
So if you'd like to become a member,

424
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,280
go to unpluggedcore.com, keep the unplugged program

425
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,760
independent, and reduce the ad load needed

426
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,240
to make the show actually sustainable.

427
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,480
And check out jupiterbroadcasting.com.

428
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:28,440
We got a batch of great shows, like a bouquet.

429
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,800
Yeah, there you go, a bouquet of podcasts,

430
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:36,400
a bouquet of podcasts over at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

431
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,920
And last but not least, join the LUP Lug on Sundays.

432
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,520
They get together, they self-organize,

433
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,120
and they hang out and talk about, well, things you love.

434
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,360
That's in our Mumble Room.

435
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,080
You can get details at linuxunplugged.com.

436
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,840
And then you join Sundays, noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern,

437
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,600
and it's just right there in our Mumble lobby.

438
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,320
And the great thing is, then you're all set up with Mumble.

439
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,640
And you can come to the live show if you get a Tuesday.

440
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,760
Maybe, I don't know, maybe you get the Rona.

441
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,080
You wanna take some time off from work.

442
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,760
They're not gonna ask any questions, you know?

443
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,120
You just come show up in the Mumble,

444
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,840
we won't ask any questions.

445
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,880
I mean, how do you think there's,

446
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,440
now there's nearly 30 people in there right now.

447
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,800
You think one of them, at least one of them

448
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,620
must be calling in sick.

449
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,080
We're on to you, and you could do that too.

450
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,960
Details at linuxunplugged.com.

451
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,760
That's probably our best housekeeping ever.

452
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
By far.

453
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,000
I think so, I think so.

454
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,280
I think, you know, that was good.

455
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,560
You know, we connected with people there.

456
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,160
Well, and you decided to just double down,

457
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,960
and instead of cleaning up the beer you spilled,

458
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,280
you just spilled beer on the places

459
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,800
that it hadn't previously reached, so it's consistent.

460
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Yeah, I like the way it smells.

461
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,020
So, don't host your own email server.

462
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,920
But you know what?

463
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,200
I don't really feel like going into a lecture

464
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,240
of reasons why you shouldn't.

465
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,160
I feel like we've covered it,

466
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,720
but super briefly, it's hard to get it right.

467
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,780
And it's something that people really rely on,

468
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,820
and it's really easy to get sucked into a black hole

469
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,200
where people start rejecting your emails.

470
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,040
And not to mention,

471
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,320
there's a lot of security considerations.

472
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,360
Yeah, and for some reason,

473
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,480
email is like internet infrastructure.

474
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,440
You know, businesses, banks, whatever.

475
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,200
They expect that emails go through,

476
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,680
and you probably expect that you receive your email.

477
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,320
So, if you are gonna play with this,

478
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,560
at least keep that in mind,

479
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,840
and maybe do it on a domain

480
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,280
that you can experiment around with,

481
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,600
and not your main one.

482
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,440
Well, and you gotta figure,

483
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,800
people in our audience, you know,

484
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,680
they maybe have a project they're working on,

485
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,760
or a small team of people.

486
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,940
Or you have like our Lug, right?

487
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,860
Wouldn't it be kind of cool

488
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,920
if our Lug could have an email address,

489
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,680
and members of our Lug could have their own email?

490
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,920
We were thinking for 400.

491
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,520
That'd be kind of a fun thing to do for our Lug,

492
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,080
is create a Lug Lug email address.

493
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,640
And so, that's kind of what we were thinking,

494
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,880
is that's a great example

495
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,760
where you got a small group of people,

496
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,200
you don't necessarily wanna be paying

497
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,480
five plus dollars a month per mailbox

498
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,160
to host it somewhere,

499
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,420
and you just wanna, whatever,

500
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,480
like you just wanna pay whatever the cost is

501
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,800
to run the server,

502
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,840
and create as many accounts as you want,

503
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,560
three to 100 or whatever.

504
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,860
And that's the goal we're kind of shooting for,

505
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,240
is creating a humble mail server with,

506
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,260
that's my word of the day today,

507
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,100
is everything's just,

508
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,720
I got a lot of humility after getting my butt

509
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,560
kicked by a robe.

510
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,600
Mine's not gonna be humble.

511
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,200
Mine's gonna be bold, brazen on the internet.

512
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,040
Good for you.

513
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,120
Mine, everything is humble pie with me.

514
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Cause once you've gotten your butt kicked by a robe,

515
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,640
you don't walk around with your head hanging high.

516
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,400
Let me just put it that way.

517
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,840
But something simple, not too complicated.

518
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,760
And there are actually other reasons,

519
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,220
I think, to host your own server.

520
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,060
Privacy and control being big ones.

521
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,680
You have full control over both the server

522
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,160
and your email itself.

523
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,880
You can view the logs of incoming

524
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,720
and outgoing messages directly.

525
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,480
You can pick the applications you want,

526
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,800
so you can mix and match the server software

527
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,360
and the client software.

528
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,720
And you also are implementing your own

529
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,960
data retention policies.

530
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,240
Perhaps you want to keep things forever,

531
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,800
or maybe you don't want to keep things past 30 days.

532
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,400
You get to choose.

533
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,720
I mean, it's also probably worth saying that email is,

534
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,940
for all of the difficulties we were just mentioning,

535
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,760
it is still one of those things that like,

536
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,320
it just interoperates, right?

537
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,440
You don't have to go officially like register somewhere.

538
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,180
There's not one party controlling it all.

539
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,040
If you want to host it, if you get it right anyway,

540
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,120
you can, and that's cool and worth celebrating.

541
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,520
Yeah, and really, I think there is the cost aspect too.

542
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,360
Right.

543
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,220
This is something everybody has to find a balance on,

544
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,200
but there's this, you're never really gonna pay more

545
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,440
than just the cost of running the server in your time,

546
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,240
where with a lot of hosted solutions,

547
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,280
you're gonna pay per person.

548
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,000
Yeah, or I mean, it can kind of vary, right?

549
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,240
Like they get to choose how they want to monetize

550
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,140
off that service.

551
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,300
And so it might align with your use case.

552
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,920
I've been using Zoho for a while,

553
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,080
so for some of my non-Gmail or other hosted domains,

554
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,120
and it works pretty fine.

555
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,200
I get like aliases, but if I ever did wanna add more users

556
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
or say I started a small business with some friends

557
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,280
and I wanted to add them on there

558
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,600
or for an open source project or something for the show,

559
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,780
it's not very flexible, at least without paying more money.

560
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,380
And that has had me thinking about self-hosting for a while.

561
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,580
Yeah, and there's just sort of like,

562
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,920
can I still do this, you know?

563
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,640
Like, can I still make this work?

564
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,160
Cause I used to do this, but I haven't done it a long time.

565
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,080
And in fact, one of my very first jobs

566
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,120
when I got into IT, like my second or third job,

567
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,480
I can't remember, but it was early into it.

568
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,560
They just let me go on managing their mail server

569
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,780
and it was a deep dive.

570
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,800
And I really kind of became a, I became a pro.

571
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,280
I really got into it for a while.

572
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,800
And I'm wondering like, does that skillset still exist?

573
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,440
Will that come back as we do this?

574
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,960
Is hosting your own email server just like riding a bike?

575
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,120
You know, speaking of that,

576
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm not sure I've seen you ride a bike either.

577
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,400
Oh, well, you know, if we could come up with a show reason,

578
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,240
you'll see me do it.

579
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,840
That's all it takes.

580
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,440
Every mail server out there can really kind of be broken

581
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,940
down into three separate software components.

582
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,400
You have the mail transfer agent that relays mail

583
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,880
between your server and the wider internet.

584
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,300
You have the mail delivery agent that takes mail

585
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:01,880
from that MTA and then sends it to the individual mailboxes.

586
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,280
And you have the interface that clients will connect to it,

587
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,840
which is often like IMAP or even used to be POP3,

588
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,880
which lets users check their email

589
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,840
from their preferred client.

590
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,720
And then there's like additional stuff

591
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,040
you have to kind of consider, right?

592
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,960
Because that's the basics of a mail server

593
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,680
and you have to pick those software components

594
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,400
that you think do the best job.

595
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,080
But there's also security components

596
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,800
to setting up a mail server today.

597
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,320
And of course, there's DNS.

598
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,160
Yes, our old friend, the domain name system.

599
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,320
You're gonna need to set something up

600
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,160
so people know how to reach your email server.

601
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:40,160
You'll need at least a MX record, SPF and pointer.

602
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,400
Starting with MX there,

603
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,680
that's gonna tell people how to send you email, right?

604
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,800
Like I've got an email west at jupiterbroadcasting.com.

605
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,760
And when an outgoing server looks that up

606
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,880
and says, how do I send email?

607
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,920
They go find jupiterbroadcasting.com,

608
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,080
look for the MX record that tells them the server

609
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,120
to point to, and then they can actually connect

610
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,540
and start sending email.

611
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,120
And the important thing to consider here too

612
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,320
is there's security things around DNS as well,

613
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,820
like SPF records, which help establish the legitimacy

614
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,160
of your mail server and reduce the chances

615
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,440
that somebody's spoofing as you.

616
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,380
And the SPF record for your domain

617
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,560
tells other receiving mail servers

618
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,440
which outgoing servers are legit to kind of receive from.

619
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,080
So it's a lookup for them to do

620
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,480
to see if the sender is a legitimate sender or not.

621
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,120
And don't forget to set up reverse DNS.

622
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,520
Yeah, I know, sometimes we just get lazy,

623
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,000
we just do the one direction,

624
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,120
but the reverse DNS for your mail server

625
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,600
really should match the host name of your server.

626
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,680
So people go to query, hey, what's this IP?

627
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,240
Who's sending me this mail?

628
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,080
That needs to match,

629
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,900
otherwise you might get some ugly rejections thing saying,

630
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,340
hey, the reverse DNS does not match your SMTP banner.

631
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,880
And you're not gonna have fun with that.

632
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,640
Oh man, this is really bringing me back.

633
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,560
There is a lot for you and I to consider.

634
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,660
And I mean, I would imagine we'd never probably have

635
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,840
more than 50 email accounts on this box.

636
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,200
But even this isn't getting into like the antivirus

637
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,100
and spam prevention stuff,

638
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,080
because one of the things I did back in the day

639
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,520
was I'd have to route mail through Clam AV

640
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,520
and scan it on the mail server.

641
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,620
So that way, hopefully I wasn't delivering viruses

642
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,800
to Windows users.

643
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,000
Right, and I mean, these days,

644
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,960
I think with web mail being so common,

645
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,880
especially hosted by big parties like Googs or Microsoft,

646
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,080
they do all of that for you.

647
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,280
You probably expect that.

648
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,960
And if you suddenly have an unfiltered inbox,

649
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,880
especially if you've pasted that email around the internet,

650
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,440
that could be a nasty surprise.

651
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,760
And I'm glad you mentioned web mail too,

652
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,440
because that's something else I think you and I

653
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,940
should consider for this project,

654
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,480
because if this is kind of like a vanity account,

655
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,240
it's kind of like an extra account for people

656
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,240
who participate in the community they wanted or whatever.

657
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,080
Like, I don't know,

658
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,200
I haven't really thought through this completely,

659
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,700
other than I kind of picture the use case

660
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,120
being lub lug members who wanna reach out to guests

661
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,840
or organize events for the lug

662
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,400
and wanna come from an email account

663
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,200
that kind of seems sort of semi-official and connected,

664
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,320
like jupitercolony.org or something like that.

665
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,840
But I don't really envision that being more

666
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,880
than a handful of people

667
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,920
and then whatever you and I choose to use it for.

668
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,640
But even there, it's like, well,

669
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,680
okay, so it's not gonna be their primary email account.

670
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,480
So how can we make it accessible to them?

671
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,880
And web mail is probably one of the ways to do that,

672
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,080
but there's a lot of web mails to choose from.

673
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,380
Yeah, I'd like one that doesn't suck, please.

674
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,600
I mean, at least if I'm gonna use it

675
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,160
and not just have to set up a client because it's so bad.

676
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,380
Yeah, this is definitely one I could use some advice from,

677
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,760
from anybody in the mumble room

678
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,720
or people that are listening

679
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,040
that wanna go to linuxunplug.com slash contact.

680
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,760
Assuming we set up kind of a standard mail server set up

681
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,560
with IMAP on the backend,

682
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,360
what would you recommend we use for the web mail front end?

683
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,520
Because our goal here is

684
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,540
to kind of get everybody's feedback from this episode

685
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,920
and go build something by the next episode.

686
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,160
It's a little ambitious,

687
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:48,760
but that's kind of what we hope to do with episode 402

688
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,760
is say, okay, the email server's up and running.

689
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,160
Here's how we built it.

690
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,560
Here's kind of what we considered.

691
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,400
Here's the web mail clients we're going with.

692
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Here's the desktop clients we're going with

693
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,760
and then give away some email addresses on it

694
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,600
and stuff like that.

695
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,480
It's kind of what our intention is for 402.

696
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,560
But I think the number one thing I'm hung up on right now

697
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,240
is what web mail client to go with

698
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,520
because part of me is sort of leaning towards simple,

699
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,440
like squirrel mail.

700
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,280
Classic.

701
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,100
Right?

702
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,000
You know it works, right?

703
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,520
And then part of me is kind of leaning towards something

704
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,320
like round cube or something

705
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
that's maybe a little more modern,

706
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,760
but I don't even know what that would be anymore.

707
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,600
Yeah, that's just it.

708
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,640
It's like, it's been so long

709
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,080
since I've really played in this space,

710
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,720
but you know our talented audience out there,

711
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,480
there's email self-hosters among them

712
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,920
and they've surely got some tips.

713
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,760
I hope so.

714
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,600
I hope so.

715
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,680
And then I'm going to take all of this experience

716
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,160
and see if my current bias

717
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,240
that I still think people probably on the whole

718
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,180
shouldn't self-host email.

719
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,640
That's how I feel today.

720
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,040
We'll see if that's how I feel after we do this experiment

721
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,240
because I felt that way about Arch too.

722
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,080
Exactly.

723
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,300
Let us be your lazy admins.

724
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,360
We'll try it out.

725
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,200
See if it works.

726
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
See how big of a mess we make.

727
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,720
And then you can judge, is it worth the time?

728
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,920
Yeah, and you know what?

729
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,240
Honestly, I thought Nextcloud would blow up on our face too

730
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,560
and here we are like almost two years into using it now

731
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,560
and we've had to make modifications to how we use it

732
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,920
and it hasn't been perfect and it's sinking,

733
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,240
but once we learned kind of how to use it, it's been fine.

734
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,080
Yeah, yeah.

735
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,160
I mean, we definitely like to complain about it sometimes

736
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,840
and there are improvements it could have,

737
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,180
but we haven't kicked it out of our infrastructure

738
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,760
and more often than not, it's a dependable part of it.

739
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,800
Yeah, and then we can update you on how it's going to

740
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,440
and stuff like that and I'm funny.

741
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,020
I kind of enjoy the idea of my prejudice being flipped.

742
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,480
I like the idea that I'm coming into something thinking

743
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,480
we shouldn't be doing this, it's not going to work

744
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,800
and then have it be successful and have to kind of go,

745
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,440
oh, okay, it was worth doing

746
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,020
and then kind of try to come to terms with,

747
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,200
well, why was it worth doing?

748
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,240
What did I get wrong?

749
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
What was I missing until I tried it?

750
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,560
And I think that's a good experience

751
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,540
to share with the audience too.

752
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,280
So that's what I'm hoping we get out of this.

753
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,580
Yeah, this is definitely one of those areas

754
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,800
where you see a lot of different mixed advice from folks.

755
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,120
Some people have no problems doing it

756
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,240
and then you have a lot of, for good reason,

757
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,360
people chiming in saying like, look, this is just hard.

758
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,280
You might have difficulties

759
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,120
and if you don't want to spend hours on your Saturday,

760
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,840
troubleshooting, don't try,

761
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,200
but you can't know until you actually try it for yourself.

762
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,480
I'm coming into the back end of this conversation,

763
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
so I'm not going to ask why you want to do this.

764
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,400
Hello, Wimpy.

765
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,640
Hello.

766
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,400
But you could potentially save yourself some heartache

767
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,680
by capitalizing on things like Mail in a Box,

768
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,680
where there is a community maintaining a deployable,

769
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,400
full stack mail environment,

770
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,760
which pulls on multiple people

771
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,720
with experience in that space.

772
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,320
Wes, we've gotten a lot of recommendations

773
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,880
for Mail in a Box over the years.

774
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,560
I think, you know, probably at least a dozen.

775
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,760
I know there's some competitors,

776
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,640
but that's the one that sticks out in my mind,

777
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,560
even though I've actually never tried it.

778
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,720
Yeah, I haven't tried it either.

779
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,280
And neither have I, and I only cite that one

780
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,560
because it's the name that came to the front of my mind,

781
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,600
but there must be other things like that.

782
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,840
It was interesting, both of you saying,

783
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,640
it's been ages since you've done something like this.

784
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,240
I can't, well, in fact, I can remember the last time

785
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,480
I did anything to do with mail servers was in 2016,

786
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,480
when my last job was to maintain a fleet

787
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,480
of massive mail servers for a CV application

788
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,040
that was sending out like 27 million emails a minute,

789
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,160
like 24 seven or something.

790
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,440
I love those kinds of memories.

791
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,400
You know, looking back at that,

792
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,080
thinking that is crazy today,

793
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,000
like something you would never catch yourself doing now,

794
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,360
right, I would assume you just would never build that again.

795
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,040
Well, I mean, I didn't build it,

796
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,640
I inherited this sort of, you know, of course.

797
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,800
Oh, those are even better.

798
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,880
And you know, things have moved on

799
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,280
in the intervening six years that would mean

800
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,680
that you just wouldn't do it quite like that ever again.

801
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,360
But yeah, I mean, interesting experiment.

802
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,200
It will be, we shall see.

803
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,280
And I guess we know who to ask for help.

804
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,680
Yeah, you're gonna be our go-to mail admin.

805
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,200
I am tempted to try Mail in a Box.

806
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,480
I'm very tempted to try that

807
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,680
because we have gotten it recommended so many times.

808
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,600
You recommend it yourself, Wimpy.

809
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,200
It might be the way we go.

810
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,240
Like I say, I've never used it, it's just the name I know.

811
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,600
The orange one, you have a suggestion for us as well.

812
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,080
Yeah, years and years ago,

813
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,800
when I made the terrible decision of hosting my own email,

814
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:24,720
I used a alternative to Mail in a Box called MailCal,

815
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,000
which is sort of this Dockerise setup.

816
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,880
So you just run a command, it runs everything for you.

817
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,000
And that I found to be really nice.

818
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It uses a alternative to Roundcube called Sogo,

819
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,000
which is sort of materially fancy, looks a bit pretty,

820
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,400
but basically is webmail and calendar and all of that stuff.

821
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,120
And from what I used of it, it was really quite nice

822
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,520
and just sort of got out of your way and just worked.

823
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,800
How did you spell that?

824
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,440
Sogo, S-O-G-O.

825
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,880
Oh, okay, that's easy.

826
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,120
All right, I will definitely look at that.

827
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,320
Yeah, the webmail thing is like,

828
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,600
I'm trying to chew on that one right now.

829
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,400
I'm not sure if Mail in a Box provides a webmail client

830
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,400
I might be worth looking into.

831
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,040
Maybe they've already picked something there.

832
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,720
The other option is that you could go super simple

833
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,920
and just go full on like Zimbra.

834
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
I have run Zimbra for a couple of clients.

835
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,240
I use Zimbra also as a mechanism

836
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,680
to backup exchange servers.

837
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,480
And I recall Zimbra had a fantastic search.

838
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,840
So if you're somebody out there looking for

839
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,400
kind of a suite of tools with really good search

840
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,680
and like a SQL backed email database,

841
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,080
Zimbra is really good.

842
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,480
I don't know if it's still the case,

843
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,800
but certainly back in the day when I was deploying Zimbra,

844
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,080
my citation for successful deployments was Red Hat.

845
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,160
I know they were using Zimbra internally.

846
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,200
Oh, yeah, I've come across it a couple of times.

847
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,680
I'm surprised it didn't take off.

848
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,760
I feel like it was a better exchange.

849
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,600
Yeah, it was designed to be exchange compatible

850
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,360
stroke compliant.

851
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,880
And it was one of these weird things.

852
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,960
It originally grew up out of, you know, Yahoo acquired it.

853
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,280
It got kicked around between, you know,

854
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,160
different organizations over the years,

855
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,760
but it was always very solid.

856
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,920
Yeah, I had some heavy hitting clients

857
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,480
that really used email and we ended up switching to Zimbra

858
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,920
for their archival and search solution

859
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,520
because they just simply couldn't find it in Outlook

860
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,480
when they were looking for stuff fast enough.

861
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,920
And Zimbra was just faster.

862
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,760
So that is a really good one,

863
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,520
but I think that's probably too much

864
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,520
because that's like the kitchen sink approach to email.

865
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,080
It's everything.

866
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,600
Yeah, it's all the things without a doubt, yeah.

867
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,440
That'd be a good, like,

868
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,000
if you were looking to replace Google apps,

869
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,320
you didn't just need core email,

870
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,360
but you needed like a whole suite of functionality,

871
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,520
including calendar and collaboration space.

872
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,600
Indeed, yeah.

873
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,560
You combine that with something like Mattermost

874
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,240
and you'd have a really good self-hostable

875
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,400
internal collaboration suite.

876
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,720
Those two things together would be pretty good.

877
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,720
So I guess we'll wait for the emails to come in.

878
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,800
We'll review our options and then next episode

879
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,880
we'll announce our decision on which way we went

880
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,680
and if it's up and running or not.

881
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,240
We'll see if we get it going.

882
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,800
I hope I haven't overcommitted us, Wes.

883
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,600
I may have oversold, but we're gonna get done.

884
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,920
Yeah, let's find out.

885
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,600
Hopefully at least we'll have some email.

886
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,320
We can get some tests and see how many, you know,

887
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,800
audience mails actually make it into the show.

888
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
Yeah, all right.

889
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,880
Well, before we go, I really,

890
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,360
I really got my arse kicked by a robe recently.

891
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,000
And so I thought I'd share that tale with you

892
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,840
because we're just about a year

893
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,360
into things getting serious.

894
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,880
We're not at the year mark of being independent,

895
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,080
but we're a year mark into the process beginning.

896
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:38,080
And, you know, I thought when I was envisioning one day,

897
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,920
back then, you know, this at this stage,

898
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,920
I was just fantasizing, thinking to myself,

899
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,120
you know, if I were to go independent again

900
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,880
and try to survive, especially during a pandemic,

901
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,080
I know that I'd have to do more than just sponsors.

902
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,880
And the membership program was part of that.

903
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,920
And so thank you everybody who has become a member

904
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,320
because that was a critical part in making it

905
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,120
to as far as we have at this stage.

906
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,920
And I figured advertising would be a critical part of that.

907
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,080
And it has, and that's why, you know,

908
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,600
companies like Linode coming on board,

909
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,800
literally, I'm not exaggerating at all

910
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,200
when I say I made it possible

911
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,880
for Jupiter Broadcasting to exist.

912
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,120
But I also knew that I couldn't just rely on those two things.

913
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,120
I've been doing this for 14 years

914
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,040
and that's like 50 years,

915
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,440
at least maybe 100 years in internet time.

916
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,200
And one of the things I know that's absolutely true

917
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,240
is if you have one or two income sources,

918
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,480
you're gonna die.

919
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,040
Because I've been around when YouTube pulled the plug

920
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,960
on advertising the first time around.

921
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,200
I've been around when Amazon,

922
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,520
which represented like 20% of our revenue at the time

923
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,640
or 30% of our revenue at the time.

924
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,600
I was there when Amazon just one day pulled the plug on us

925
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:53,040
for doing stuff that still other networks

926
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,320
and podcasts and YouTubers are still doing today.

927
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,680
It's really, you know, but you gotta diversify there.

928
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,960
So I knew when I was thinking about,

929
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:04,320
boy, do I wanna make this transition,

930
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,520
I knew I'd have to figure out

931
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,880
my merchandise and swag game one day.

932
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,760
And it's been just embarrassingly too long

933
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,840
since we've had anything new.

934
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,080
It's been over two years now.

935
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,640
And it's something that I enjoy

936
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,160
and it's something,

937
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,080
it's another one of those physical manifestations

938
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,160
of what we make becomes a physical product.

939
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,360
And we recently went on kind of like a archeological dig

940
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,640
here in the studio and we found a bunch of old swag.

941
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,940
And I had an emotional reaction to finding this stuff.

942
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:39,160
And I don't normally have an emotional reaction to things

943
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,220
except for Star Trek ships that those I like.

944
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,900
But mostly like, you know,

945
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,560
one of the reasons I moved into a class ARV

946
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,240
is I wanted to get rid of everything.

947
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,760
I don't really wanna have attachments.

948
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,880
I'm not big on that.

949
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,640
But when I saw this swag, I felt something.

950
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,040
I don't know what you humans call it, but I felt something.

951
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,180
And it was a good something.

952
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,560
And I realized this stuff is special.

953
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,560
We have some really special items.

954
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,180
And I wanna do more of that.

955
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,800
Because it's like, I can look back and I remember,

956
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,920
I see an item and I think of an event,

957
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,160
or I think of a show milestone,

958
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,960
or I think of the way that the audience responded

959
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,520
to an item that we did.

960
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,120
And it makes like the past real

961
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,800
in a way that I kind of lost touch with

962
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,440
over the last couple of years, especially the last year.

963
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,960
And also, getting this figured out

964
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,480
is just a good business strategy, really.

965
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,960
I mean, that's just obvious on its face.

966
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,160
It's critical to making a long-term business successful.

967
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,080
So all of this, knowing all of this,

968
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:42,520
it created this self-inflicted pressure.

969
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,000
Like I've been stressing out really bad to get swag right.

970
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,200
And I wanna do things that are unique and fun

971
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,960
that aren't just like the stuff you find

972
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,220
on every fulfillment website out there.

973
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,440
And so I thought, let's shoot for the moon

974
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,240
and let's do a fabulous embroidered robe called the Coder.

975
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,260
And it'll be a limited item.

976
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,600
It'd be a robe that we can sell on the Coder Radio program

977
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,080
to celebrate 400 episodes

978
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,960
because Coder Radio just hit that milestone as well.

979
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,400
What a glorious dream.

980
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,640
I mean, you know, a custom swag worthy

981
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,940
of the epic history of that show.

982
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,780
Yep.

983
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,040
Tyler's saying right now in the chat room,

984
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,780
he says, Chris, last I still have my challenge coins.

985
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,620
Right?

986
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,440
Right?

987
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,720
I mean, Tyler, I love the challenge coin.

988
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,840
It was the best.

989
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,680
I was just about to say,

990
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,480
I've been sorting out my office and listen to this.

991
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,200
Challenge coin?

992
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,280
Do challenge coins being struck together,

993
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,280
which I found from 2017 recently.

994
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:38,320
I just found a cache of them as well, about 20 of them.

995
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,080
And I love them.

996
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,040
They're very special.

997
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,640
And, you know, they're like limited in a way.

998
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,480
They're like, anyways,

999
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,080
it's just gave me a whole new appreciation for swag.

1000
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,680
But so I wanted to do this robe

1001
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:55,400
and the robe was the dumbest possible idea I could have had

1002
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,640
in like a year, really.

1003
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,000
The last year is probably my worst idea

1004
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,300
in the last three years, maybe four years.

1005
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,480
Now that I think about it,

1006
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,440
it might be my worst idea in the last five years.

1007
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,860
What I learned was that shipping a custom product

1008
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,420
domestically is tricky to ship something that's produced,

1009
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,960
custom hand produced domestically,

1010
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,080
to ship that internationally, holy crap.

1011
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,040
I had like quotes of like $185

1012
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,960
just to ship a $65 robe to Denmark.

1013
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,920
It's just basically not possible at a reasonable cost.

1014
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,000
When you work with these one-off shops,

1015
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,120
their business isn't procurement

1016
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,320
and shipping around the world.

1017
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,360
Their business is taking these items and doing embroidery.

1018
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:42,120
And so they don't have like these depots around the world

1019
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,900
to make shipping more reasonable at international rates.

1020
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,740
And boy, do I have a whole new appreciation

1021
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,640
for Amazon's cheap shipping.

1022
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,880
What a massive market advantage that is for them, Wes.

1023
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,940
They can ship stuff at prices I could never dream of.

1024
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,040
No, I mean, we don't have a bulk discount.

1025
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,140
We don't have established supply lines.

1026
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,060
This is all new.

1027
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,480
We gotta get that drone program up and going, obviously.

1028
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,520
That I think we have the supplies for.

1029
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,080
They have shipping prices that are just not even achievable

1030
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,580
by small businesses like a shop like mine.

1031
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,680
But for the community and for the business,

1032
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,840
I figured I have to crack this nut.

1033
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,800
And I figured the robe would be a learning experience.

1034
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,420
I'd jump into the deep end and I'd learn a lot from it.

1035
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,200
And I did learn a lot.

1036
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,640
But one of the core lessons that I took away

1037
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,200
is that theme of the day is be humble.

1038
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,840
I have to start humble with something like this.

1039
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,680
I went into the deep end with a robe

1040
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,740
and that was such a bad idea.

1041
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,480
If it's gonna be something that becomes part

1042
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,080
of the business long-term, I need to start small

1043
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,380
and then I have to grow it

1044
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:42,840
and I have to learn as it grows.

1045
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,160
I have to build on small success after small success.

1046
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:50,880
So I've been thinking a lot about how to get this right.

1047
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,640
Because I think swag and merchandise

1048
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,580
is gonna be a fun part of the business.

1049
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,880
It's gonna be something that we can,

1050
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,080
we're gonna, I'm gonna, I wanna do limited stuff

1051
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,880
like name brand stuff and items that you'd actually

1052
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,920
wanna buy and just wear in general

1053
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,000
or things and gadgets that you'd wanna pick up

1054
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,600
or used items here at the studio that we're done with

1055
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,160
that are still great, still fully functional

1056
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,180
but we just need something maybe that has more ports

1057
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,880
or does more channels, that kind of stuff.

1058
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:21,200
I wanna have a business that can accommodate all of that.

1059
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,880
So I'm a little nervous to do this

1060
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,200
because I think this could be bad or this could be great

1061
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,380
but I have an announcement to make today.

1062
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,440
I am launching the Jupiter Broadcasting Garage sale

1063
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,740
at JupiterGarage.com.

1064
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,440
I am launching JupiterGarage.com today

1065
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,920
at JupiterGarage.com, go check it out.

1066
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,240
Let the fireworks go, go ahead, I know,

1067
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,720
I know, it's exciting, I know, yeah.

1068
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,920
I don't think you should be selling those to kids.

1069
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,220
Yeah, no, I know but they do so good with the fire.

1070
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,600
You know, they're responsible.

1071
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,320
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, that got close.

1072
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,540
So here's what I'm doing is I have a selection right now

1073
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:09,380
of mostly used hardware items like a FreeNAS Mini,

1074
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,720
a mixer, a compressor, you know,

1075
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,440
gear that I think is really high-end and good

1076
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,960
but we just don't simply use anymore

1077
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,200
and instead of throwing it out,

1078
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,760
I'm gonna sell it for really crazy,

1079
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,720
stupid, ridiculous prices.

1080
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,480
Really stupid, crazy low prices

1081
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,640
just to clear out the space

1082
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,800
because I wanna make room for the new.

1083
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,320
For the new stuff that I wanna do,

1084
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,140
the new swag items, the new merchandise,

1085
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:32,560
the new stickers, getting ready for events to come back

1086
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,840
and I wanna stock swag for booths and that kind of stuff.

1087
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,240
And the way to do that is to get rid of this stuff

1088
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,120
that I've been stockpiling forever.

1089
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,040
And there's things in there that still work totally good

1090
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,200
that are great items that I've always kept just in case

1091
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,280
but I really shouldn't be, I'm just hoarding.

1092
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,560
And I'm just kind of creating the garage experience,

1093
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,080
the garage sale experience but online at jupitergarage.com

1094
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,720
with the goal to make room for the new

1095
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,680
and honestly, quite frankly with you guys,

1096
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,760
total transparency here.

1097
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,360
I just need practice boxing, shipping, the whole thing.

1098
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,500
Like I gotta learn all of this and I need space.

1099
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,240
I need space but here's what I'm gonna do.

1100
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:12,600
So go to jupitergarage.com,

1101
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,480
look at some of the items I have there.

1102
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:16,960
If you're buying one of the used items,

1103
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,740
as space and weight allows,

1104
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,880
I'm gonna stash random retro swag items in those orders.

1105
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,560
Like just as I can, I'm gonna just throw some stickers

1106
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,520
in there or something like that

1107
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,880
or I might wrap a device in a shirt or something like that.

1108
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,920
Just sort of close your eyes

1109
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,400
and grab something at the studio, put it in the box.

1110
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,400
Throw it in the box.

1111
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,800
As long as it's not Levi.

1112
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,000
Right, no.

1113
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,640
But you know what I figured too,

1114
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,780
because I found a couple of caches of retro swag

1115
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,000
and I'm not making any more of this stuff.

1116
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,700
If you just want a random bag of retro swag,

1117
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,760
I'm gonna make that available too.

1118
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,920
They're going on sale right now.

1119
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,660
They're gonna normally be $25 for a bag of swag

1120
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,320
but right now, to kick off the new thing,

1121
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,040
they're gonna be $15 and I only have

1122
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,020
a small handful available.

1123
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,160
I'm doing limited quantities

1124
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,000
so that way I don't get inundated with orders

1125
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,960
and I make sure we get them out the door

1126
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,260
and that we're getting the shipping estimates right

1127
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:06,720
and that if somebody orders international,

1128
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,320
we can fulfill it and I'm literally learning

1129
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,920
with each one of these orders.

1130
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,720
So not only are you gonna make a very small

1131
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,200
financial contribution to the network

1132
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,240
and get yourself some gear or some swag

1133
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,620
but you are basically sending me through bootcamp

1134
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,280
to learn how to do this

1135
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,160
and we're kind of accomplishing something together.

1136
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,760
I'm clearing out some stuff here.

1137
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,400
This gear that's still perfectly usable,

1138
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,800
I'm pounding it on to make sure it works and stuff.

1139
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,200
It's getting a new home and I'm learning

1140
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:35,060
how to basically grow a new part of my business

1141
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,000
that will be independent of sponsorships

1142
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,200
or memberships or anything like that.

1143
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,080
Although that said, with the memberships,

1144
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,920
going forward, right now these prices are stupid.

1145
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,140
Like you wouldn't believe what I'm charging

1146
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,480
for a free NAS Mini.

1147
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,440
There's no discounts because the prices,

1148
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:52,180
they are ridiculous but going forward in the future,

1149
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,680
I will make a standard discount available

1150
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,900
for all of our members.

1151
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,160
So if you're an unplugged core contributor,

1152
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,040
you're gonna get 15% off every order

1153
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,620
and you'll have more information about that soon.

1154
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,040
That's true for all of our patrons

1155
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,200
and for members of any show of ours.

1156
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,640
You're gonna get 15% off any of your orders

1157
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,020
from the Jupiter Garage in the future.

1158
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,100
Right now, as I'm learning how to do this

1159
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,200
and I'm probably gonna be on the other end of profit,

1160
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,300
I'm gonna be paying out of pocket

1161
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,160
for some of this stuff as I learn it.

1162
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,200
I just can't do a discount

1163
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,180
because there's no discount to give

1164
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,320
but there will be one in the future for all of our members

1165
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,680
because my intention long-term will be

1166
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,200
to clear out some of this limited time swag that we have

1167
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,360
to get some hardware out there.

1168
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,360
There's a lot more hardware than what's on there right now

1169
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,760
so there's gonna be more stuff landing.

1170
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,000
And then kind of transition to create an inventory space

1171
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,420
for new original high quality merchandise,

1172
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,840
stuff that isn't just the standard fulfillment T-shirt

1173
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,680
or something like that.

1174
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,080
I mean, I will still do those from time to time

1175
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,280
because who doesn't like a T-shirt?

1176
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,360
And there is a T-shirt with the bearded tux

1177
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,680
holding the Jupiter rocket in a nice kind of low key

1178
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,640
gray and white on black.

1179
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,660
That's available in the garage sale right now

1180
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,120
as well as a hat that has the same bearded tux logo on it

1181
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,620
because that's my favorite tux.

1182
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,140
So there are a couple of those items

1183
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,140
that I'll do from time to time but my goal is

1184
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:12,180
I'm eventually gonna have an entire wardrobe of this stuff

1185
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,260
because I wanna get stuff that I wanna wear

1186
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,000
and when I start rolling that stuff out,

1187
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,220
we'll start doing discounts for members more on the regular.

1188
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,100
And that's gonna be more as my confidence grows

1189
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,820
as I know what I'm doing and I know I can tell somebody

1190
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,580
that you're gonna pay this for international shipping

1191
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,100
or you're gonna pay this if you live in California,

1192
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:30,920
you're gonna pay this if you live in Canada.

1193
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,780
When I get to that point and we're actually getting there,

1194
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,900
then you'll start seeing more stuff roll out.

1195
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,100
That's just sort of as I learn more.

1196
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,900
I'm gonna take it one small part at a time

1197
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,860
but there's always gonna be that core part

1198
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,040
of the Jupiter garage that will be items from the studio

1199
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,580
that we're done with, stuff that is still functional

1200
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,480
and we don't buy crap.

1201
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,700
So stuff that's good and functional

1202
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,380
but we're just done with it, we've outgrown it.

1203
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,660
That's gonna be always a part of the Jupiter garage

1204
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,860
and my intention there is just sell it,

1205
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,220
not really at much of a profit,

1206
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,800
maybe just make 20 bucks or something off of it really

1207
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,980
and let you have something that we're done with

1208
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:09,020
instead of letting it sit and rot

1209
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:11,140
like it does now in a closet or in the garage.

1210
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:12,740
Plus we gotta make room for beer.

1211
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,060
Yeah Wes, that is actually part of this.

1212
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:19,580
When we decided well we're gonna have a beer keg

1213
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,900
and we're gonna have a beer keg fridge

1214
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,600
and we're gonna have a spot to brew beer,

1215
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,140
we gotta have room.

1216
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:26,020
And we retire stuff from time to time

1217
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,020
that's still perfectly good.

1218
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,620
It doesn't make any sense that it just sits around in waste.

1219
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,920
Could go out to an audience member,

1220
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,820
they could help support the network a little bit.

1221
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,740
Yeah, who wouldn't wanna connect to the mumble room

1222
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,300
with a previously used Jupiter broadcasting audio gear,

1223
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,460
right, I mean come on.

1224
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:41,260
That's pretty much it.

1225
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,220
So there's a selection of stuff there.

1226
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,980
There will be more from time to time.

1227
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:48,840
Go to JupiterGarage.com to go see what's there now.

1228
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:53,840
And we have gone through our closets.

1229
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,040
Angela just found a huge stash of stickers

1230
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,380
that will be slipping into rando swag bags

1231
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,380
and orders that people place.

1232
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,060
And I found a stash of last challenge coins.

1233
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:10,040
And then independently there's some really nice

1234
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,020
retro last swag like the zip up hoodies

1235
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,880
with the classic bearded logo and stuff like that

1236
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,980
that will be going up for sale soon too.

1237
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,140
As we just kind of go through

1238
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,060
and make sure everything that's been in storage

1239
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,100
is still in good shape.

1240
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,540
And then we're gonna box it up and get shipping prices

1241
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,820
that make it available at the garage sale.

1242
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,860
That's the plan.

1243
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,700
And then over time I hope to grow that

1244
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,900
into kind of an arm of the business

1245
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,860
that will be part of sponsorships, memberships,

1246
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,480
and swag that is swag like nobody else is doing.

1247
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,380
It's not just boring stuff, but it's stuff

1248
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,380
that you could eventually end up buying.

1249
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,700
One of the things that's on there right now

1250
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,980
is the mixer I used for years of remote productions.

1251
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:49,140
And it's perfectly good.

1252
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,020
And it's got, I tell you what I love about it too.

1253
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,980
Like it's got, you can run it all off nine volt batteries.

1254
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,020
So if you have noisy audio, if you have line noise

1255
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,860
on your electrics and you want a mixer

1256
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:03,500
that's battery powered, this is like the total ultimate hack

1257
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,700
to avoiding line noise is run a battery powered mixer.

1258
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,540
And I used it for years on the road.

1259
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,220
It's still perfectly functional.

1260
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,100
I just now do all that stuff in Jack

1261
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,460
and don't need a mixer anymore, but it still works.

1262
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,740
And it's up on the garage sale.

1263
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,740
I'm very excited about it as you can probably tell.

1264
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:23,180
And I've been going on and on about it for weeks to Wes.

1265
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,020
Just a bit.

1266
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,740
So thanks for putting up with it, Wes.

1267
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,560
I appreciate it.

1268
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,640
There really is a lot of good gear that's been in there.

1269
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,540
And especially as the setup all pivoted

1270
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:34,960
to like Linux focus to more professional stuff

1271
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,960
or just more channels we needed to set up

1272
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,340
the studio right to have guests

1273
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,460
and get all the crazy Jack stuff going on.

1274
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,760
There's just a lot of good gear

1275
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,180
and other awesome items from history that, as you said,

1276
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,780
it really would be a shame to just see them

1277
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,740
rot away on the shelves when we're not using them.

1278
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,460
Yeah, grab a bit of JB history

1279
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,220
and stuff that you could use to make content

1280
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,340
or run right now and the chat room's right.

1281
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,740
I need to update the website with links and stuff.

1282
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,620
I just been getting it all going today

1283
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,380
and wanted to have it ready for the show,

1284
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,540
but I am often just the worst at that.

1285
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:09,780
I really need, the whole JB website needs a refresh

1286
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,560
because my intention was to have it replaced by now,

1287
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,660
but that never came around.

1288
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,860
And now it needs a refresh.

1289
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,100
And links to stuff like this need to happen.

1290
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,260
So hopefully that'll get done soon.

1291
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:23,440
But in the meantime, just go to jupytergarage.com for that.

1292
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,580
Well, Wes, that is the no-show.

1293
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,940
That's the unplanned show that we had today.

1294
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,300
It's almost a show.

1295
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:32,900
It was kind of a show, I think, actually.

1296
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:34,700
I think we just accidentally had a show.

1297
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:35,540
Whoopsie.

1298
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,540
I know.

1299
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,020
If anything we covered today interests you,

1300
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:41,980
then go check us out at linuxunplugged.com

1301
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,260
and get the links at linuxunplugged.com slash 401.

1302
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,240
You heard really briefly there from the orange one.

1303
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,140
He was just recently featured in the self-hosted podcast

1304
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:51,980
with his setup.

1305
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:54,140
You can find that at selfhosted.show.

1306
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,820
Hosting things like your own email server

1307
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,420
is the core of what we talk about there.

1308
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,660
So if you like that, go check that out.

1309
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,700
If you do the Twitter thing,

1310
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,980
you can follow this here podcast at Linux Unplugged.

1311
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:05,740
The network is at Jupyter Signal.

1312
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,140
And the whole gosh darn podcasting network

1313
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,220
is over there at Jupyterbroadcasting.com.

1314
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,300
And last but not least, may I just say,

1315
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:17,340
hmm, if I don't say so myself,

1316
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,180
picture me like a chicken who's like, you know,

1317
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:21,700
fluffing up his feathers right now

1318
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,980
and like getting braggadocious, but-

1319
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:26,500
I'm also picturing high-waisted pants for some reason.

1320
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,980
Yeah, and maybe some glasses.

1321
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,860
But gosh darn it,

1322
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:32,500
if I'm not just getting more and more proud

1323
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,580
of that Linux action news over there,

1324
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,100
if you work in the industry, don't miss Linux action news.

1325
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:39,060
Every Monday morning, Wes and I break down

1326
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,660
everything that matters in the world of Linux.

1327
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:44,300
And something you don't know by listening to the show,

1328
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:47,100
but something I want to tell you is,

1329
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,220
Wes and I put a lot of effort and thought into

1330
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:54,020
how can we say something concisely, efficiently,

1331
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:56,020
and so that it's easy to understand.

1332
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,660
And we try to get you all of the news you need to know

1333
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,300
in less than 30 minutes.

1334
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,780
And we pride ourselves on delivery in a way

1335
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:06,420
that is understandable, processable,

1336
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,900
with the context that you need, that doesn't drag on.

1337
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,900
And so there's a lot of stuff

1338
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,740
that doesn't make it into this show,

1339
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,180
otherwise this would be like a two-hour show.

1340
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,980
And those stories and that information,

1341
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,420
like the recent ports to the M1 platform,

1342
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,940
we went and got quotes from Hector Martin.

1343
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:24,860
We reached out to Hector Martin for contact

1344
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:25,780
and we bring that into the show.

1345
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:28,380
And that's another thing we do with Linux action news,

1346
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,980
is the stories are sourced.

1347
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,180
We try to contact the people behind the stories,

1348
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,220
the people writing the stories.

1349
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:36,580
We try to get their takes and that information.

1350
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,220
We incorporate that into the show,

1351
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,260
either by what we say,

1352
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:41,740
or sometimes we'll play the audio directly from them.

1353
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:44,060
And that's a special kind of effort

1354
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,140
that we spend the last half of our week doing

1355
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,140
to make Linux action news special

1356
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:51,580
and to have information that perhaps you're not hearing

1357
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,300
or reading in other places.

1358
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,500
Yeah, save yourself the time.

1359
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,420
Stop clicking through the clickbait in our Linux.

1360
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,980
Just head over to linuxactionnews.com.

1361
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,220
That's good, Wes.

1362
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,380
That is a, that's good.

1363
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,340
Well, this year podcast, it's gonna be live next week.

1364
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,900
Even when we say it's not gonna be live,

1365
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,060
sometimes it's live.

1366
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,380
See you next week.

1367
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:11,940
Same bat time, same bat station.

1368
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:14,180
So keep the Linux rolling and make it a Linux Tuesday.

1369
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:18,140
Join us live, 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1370
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,700
Links to everything we talked about today,

1371
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:23,460
how to contact us, our mumble server, our matrix info,

1372
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:24,740
that's all over there,

1373
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,500
including subscribe links for RSS feeds, et cetera,

1374
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:32,500
at linuxunplugged.com and get all of it over there.

1375
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,220
Go get your links, go get your show notes,

1376
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:39,220
and then go check out the garage sale at jupytergarage.com.

1377
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:42,740
It's brand new, and I'm going to school,

1378
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,860
and you can help teach me a lesson or two.

1379
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,740
Thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode

1380
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,140
of the Unplugged program,

1381
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:55,140
and we'll see you right back here next Tuesday!

1382
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:32,420
JBtitles.com, let's go name this thing.

1383
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,500
Did you guys see that the GNOME project

1384
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,900
is considering moving the top bar to the bottom

1385
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,860
and creating kind of a layout similar to Chrome OS?

1386
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,860
Yeah.

1387
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:43,860
What?

1388
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,860
I really hope not.

1389
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,860
Really?

1390
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,860
Really?

1391
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,860
It reminds me too much of Windows

1392
00:53:47,860 --> 00:53:48,860
and then also obviously Chrome.

1393
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:52,020
It's like that normally sort of looks unique right now.

1394
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,420
I think that's precisely why they're considering doing it,

1395
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,580
because it looks like Windows.

1396
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,740
Back end of last year,

1397
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:03,140
I think it was probably around October, November time,

1398
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:07,300
the GNOME Foundation had like a show and tell

1399
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:09,720
based on some user accessibility testing

1400
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:10,940
that they'd commissioned.

1401
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:14,720
So this was putting GNOME and other operating systems

1402
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,580
in front of a random selection of people

1403
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,180
or a selection of people with different backgrounds

1404
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:24,180
and different computing backgrounds and what have you.

1405
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,340
And it was GNOME as it was,

1406
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:32,500
what was slated to be at the time GNOME 40

1407
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:39,220
and also including stuff like the endless OS spin

1408
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:43,620
on how the GNOME desktop is presented.

1409
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,920
And long story short,

1410
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,100
those people that are not already familiar with GNOME

1411
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:56,940
gravitated towards the intuitive nature of using endless OS

1412
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:01,300
because it had a lot of similarity with Windows,

1413
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,720
which is what they knew.

1414
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,460
This is a point that I had a conversation with Neil McGovern,

1415
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:07,460
you know, the executive director.

1416
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:08,460
Yes, exactly.

1417
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,460
And he said, yeah,

1418
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,300
that when people use more traditional UI paradigms,

1419
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,660
they got to work faster basically.

1420
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,660
Yeah.

1421
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:17,060
You know, those traditional patterns didn't come out of nowhere.

1422
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,800
You know, they're through long established design research

1423
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,600
and human interaction research.

1424
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:28,080
So it was no mistake that GNOME looked a lot like Windows 95

1425
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:33,780
and Windows 95 had shared some familiar patterns with Mac OS.

1426
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,860
All of those were influenced by the same design research

1427
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,380
and design thinking.

1428
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,500
Which shared some design patterns honestly with Xerox.

1429
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,500
I mean, really.

1430
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,500
Indeed.

1431
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,500
Indeed.

1432
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,940
I mean, it does go back a long way.

1433
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,780
It goes back to the 1960s.

1434
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:50,060
But this is, you know, well-researched,

1435
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:53,020
well-funded research that goes back a long way.

1436
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:57,100
So I am not surprised to learn that GNOME are taking that

1437
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,880
feedback on board and looking to,

1438
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,900
I'm not going to say roll back necessarily, but you know,

1439
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:07,500
there is some sort of stepping away from the path they've been

1440
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,020
on to responding to user feedback.

1441
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:14,940
And user feedback is what people are familiar with is comfortable

1442
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:15,940
and intuitive.

1443
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,940
Yeah.

1444
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,540
I wonder how, I mean, I'm pretty flexible.

1445
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:21,860
I could probably roll with whatever.

1446
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:25,820
But it would be a change, you know, there's forever, I mean,

1447
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,300
with GNOME, I've always had a lot of my items up in a top bar

1448
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,300
in one way or another.

1449
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:31,100
It'd be a pretty significant shift for them.

1450
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,120
Yeah, but what about that mouse travel though?

1451
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,260
That's the part I've seen people kind of talking about the most

1452
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,260
I think.

1453
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:37,260
Yeah.

1454
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,260
Yeah.

1455
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,260
I just use the keyboard for everything.

1456
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,260
Yeah, exactly.

1457
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,980
Nobody knows which buttons to push now.

1458
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:43,460
Yeah, exactly.

1459
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,060
So Wimpy, the Ubuntu podcast is back.

1460
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,300
It's active.

1461
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,300
What else is going on?

1462
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,300
How are you?

1463
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,300
I'm very well.

1464
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:53,700
I hear that everyone else is very well too.

1465
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,700
Yeah.

1466
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,700
Yeah.

1467
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:59,980
You know, he didn't stop by the show today, but a friend of the

1468
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:03,860
show, Popeye has recently left Canonical as well.

1469
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:08,420
So both of you now have left the Canonical mothership, but I

1470
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,420
assume for greener pastures.

1471
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:11,420
Yeah.

1472
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:14,940
Obviously, I have been at Slim now for like five weeks.

1473
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,340
I think I've been working there.

1474
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:17,380
So I'm doing my thing.

1475
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,140
Don't think Popeye's left Canonical yet.

1476
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,660
He's announced that he will be leaving.

1477
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:27,460
A bit like I did, I announced my plans to leave ahead of time to

1478
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:33,660
give people in the community who may have wanted some final stuff,

1479
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,580
you know, from me, time to contact me and round that out and Popeye's

1480
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,580
done the same.

1481
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,220
So, yeah, Popeye's off to something new.

1482
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:43,020
I'm not going to disclose what that is.

1483
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:45,380
He'll do that, you know, when the time is right for him.

1484
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,380
But yeah.

1485
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,220
Well, Popeye, if you're out there listening, you are welcome to join

1486
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:52,180
us when your last day arrives and you want to come and hang out with

1487
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,180
your buddies.

1488
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:54,420
What I will say is this.

1489
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:58,180
Some people have reacted to, you know, there are some people that

1490
00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:02,100
maybe only know about Alan and I and our association with Ubuntu and

1491
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,120
Canonical and the fact that we've both left recently.

1492
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,460
They see as the sky is falling.

1493
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:08,700
That's not the case.

1494
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:14,700
And perhaps, you know, the silver lining to this is maybe the two of us,

1495
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:19,300
you know, old and grizzled, you know, people from, you know, Ubuntu

1496
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:25,340
leaving is a good thing because there is, you know, a vibrant new life

1497
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:30,580
at Canonical who are spearheading community engagement now with, you

1498
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,180
know, Monica and Reese.

1499
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:37,020
And this is their opportunity to take things in new and interesting

1500
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,020
directions.

1501
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:42,660
So I don't think people should be interpreting this as, you know, a

1502
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,660
negative thing.

1503
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:48,260
But the opportunity for a new era of, you know, Ubuntu community to

1504
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,260
shine and blossom.

1505
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,260
I like it.

1506
00:58:50,260 --> 00:59:10,780
And I hope so, too.
