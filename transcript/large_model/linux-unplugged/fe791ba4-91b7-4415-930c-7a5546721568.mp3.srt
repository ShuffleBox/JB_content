1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,020
Well, the reason why I was asking if producer rotten corpse was here is because he had a

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:10,160
write up that was pretty cool over at make use of dot com about the easy way to watch

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,060
Netflix on Linux spoiler alert.

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,060
Really the easy way.

5
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,360
Do you know what it is, Wes?

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,360
Install Chrome.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,360
Install Chrome.

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,360
How could he?

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,360
How could it be easier?

10
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,360
Mm hmm.

11
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,360
Yeah.

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,360
But he walks through that and he also walks through a couple other options you have, like

13
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,840
breaking it off into its own desktop application and the issue where it is with where it's out

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,200
on Firefox and things like that.

15
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,200
So that's really cool.

16
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,160
But we actually had an email into Linux Unplugged just this week that was asking how to get

17
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
Netflix running again.

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,440
So I thought, boy, what a great chance to mention that.

19
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,480
And then kind of great timing.

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,320
Also Joey on OMG Ubuntu has a how to watch Hulu on Ubuntu 14.04, which includes installing

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,740
HAL, I guess, because flash DRM doesn't work on Ubuntu without that.

22
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,120
So it goes through how to get that going on Ubuntu 14.04 or later.

23
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,480
So Hulu on Linux and Netflix use Hulu, you know, only occasionally.

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,780
So I'd be glad to have a guy like this.

25
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,140
Have you read that article carefully?

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,760
You've spotted anything familiar at all in that article?

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,760
Let me see.

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,960
I actually just pulled it up right here.

29
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,960
I'm noticing.

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
Let's see.

31
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
I can add an Ubuntu PPA here.

32
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
It's very nice.

33
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,960
I can stall.

34
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,000
What am I missing as I peruse through it?

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Is there PPA?

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is it whose PPA?

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,520
Well, I noticed that that's actually what jumped out at me to tell you the truth.

38
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
But I don't know.

39
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,440
I mean, is that how do you say a flexi on dot org flexi on flexi?

40
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,440
Tell us about that, Wimpy.

41
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Tell us about that.

42
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,440
That's me.

43
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
Yeah.

44
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,440
Yeah.

45
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,560
Are you is this an issue that you've been working on for Ubuntu Mate edition or what

46
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
is what's going on here?

47
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,560
What's

48
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
Yeah.

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Yeah.

50
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,560
It's built into Ubuntu Mate.

51
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,560
Oh, that's beautiful.

52
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
Gosh, I love that.

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
I love that.

54
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,560
I say it's built.

55
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
I say it's built in.

56
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,560
So actually, I found the upstream project some months ago.

57
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,240
Oh, here's the credit to you right here.

58
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,240
Very nice.

59
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Very good.

60
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
Good for Joey for pointing that out.

61
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,240
I like that.

62
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
Yeah.

63
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Well deserved.

64
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
Yeah.

65
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,720
So the upstream project has done all the hard work.

66
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,560
All I did was add some packaging for Debian and Ubuntu and chuck it in a PPA.

67
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,440
And in Ubuntu Mate welcome, when you install Adobe Flash, it automatically pulls in that

68
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,680
Hal Flash plugin as well, so that you get all the good stuff baked in.

69
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,940
And what I'm currently working on is getting that into the Debian archives.

70
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,600
So then it appears in Ubuntu official archives, and everyone's got access to it.

71
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,820
Jeez, you are really making that a great out-of-the-box experience for regular users.

72
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,000
That is super cool, Wimpy.

73
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,640
But now everybody else can take advantage of it too.

74
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,640
The secret is unleashed.

75
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,640
Mwa ha ha ha.

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,640
For all of you who want to watch it.

77
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,640
That is no secret.

78
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,920
I've been rather poorly doing the job of trying to publicize this.

79
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,840
And Stuart Langridge has been poking fun at me every time he's found the alternative methods

80
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,920
in the online press.

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,560
So I was very pleased that Joey actually did the job that was somewhere down my list of

82
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
things to do.

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Very good.

84
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Which is actually write this up.

85
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
Yeah.

86
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
So yeah, he's done me a favor there.

87
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Yeah.

88
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
Very nice.

89
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
And now others can take advantage of it.

90
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Maybe we'll try it out later.

91
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Yeah.

92
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:27,160
All right, this is Linux Unplugged episode 110 for September 15th, 2015.

93
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:32,240
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's just about to hit the road.

94
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
My name is Chris.

95
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
My name is Wes.

96
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,240
Hey there, Wes.

97
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,880
So I am all stoked to talk about today's episode.

98
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,720
It's funny because our pre-show, we were kind of talking about online streaming, but really

99
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,160
in today's episode, we're going to have an emphasis on offline life like you're online.

100
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,440
I like that.

101
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,280
It's all the things we're used to in the modern era, but without a connection.

102
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Exactly.

103
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
That's my world right now.

104
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,080
And so we're going to cover a couple of really great, well, actually more than a couple of

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,160
really great open source projects that help you live completely offline, but enjoy some

106
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,600
of the perks of being online.

107
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:10,640
Of course, we're also going to get into a block level backup system that is a little

108
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,400
bit cooler than LVM snapshots.

109
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,720
It gives you copy on write essentially to any file system.

110
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,240
It even works with ButterFS if you want to use it with ButterFS and it looks like it

111
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,440
just runs in the background transparently.

112
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,280
We're going to tell you a little bit about that coming up in the show.

113
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,440
And then also we've been talking about Munich and their big Linux switch and all of the

114
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,200
news that's been coming out of that on the Linux action show for about three weeks now.

115
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,320
And we're going to give the final word to our virtual lug as we say goodbye to the Munich

116
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,760
story with how they contribute upstream to open source.

117
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,480
We'll cover that in today's episode, plus a little update on the impending road show

118
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,440
and some really, really great feedback.

119
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,160
So we have a whole bunch of stuff to get into.

120
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,800
So before we go any further, we should probably totally bring in that mumble room.

121
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,480
Time appropriate greetings in virtual lug.

122
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Hey, Pep.

123
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Hey, Pep.

124
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Hello.

125
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Hello.

126
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
There they are.

127
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Hello, everybody.

128
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
So guess what?

129
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Guess what?

130
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,960
We got to get right into it today because we have lots of stuff to cover.

131
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,400
So I want to start with the emails that have been coming to Linux Unplugged.

132
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,720
Dow wrote in with a name for the road show.

133
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Here's my contribution.

134
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,720
Love all the shows.

135
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,720
Good luck with the endeavor.

136
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,100
He says we should call it the Finding Linux Roadshow.

137
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:23,960
So in Linux action show, we named the mobile studio the JB Rover, Rover for short.

138
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,440
Now we have to name this tour.

139
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,280
Each road show will have its own name.

140
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Each tour will have its own name.

141
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,800
So we can refer to it as that.

142
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,480
So Dow suggests we're going to name it.

143
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,800
We're going to decide today on Linux Unplugged what it is.

144
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,240
So yeah, we're going to vote and decide.

145
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,760
So Dow says we should name it the Finding Linux Roadshow.

146
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,840
And that's a good idea because I do plan everywhere I go to try to find if they use Linux.

147
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
Everywhere I go.

148
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
So that's not bad.

149
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
The Finding Linux Roadshow.

150
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,840
That's not bad.

151
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Not bad.

152
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,840
But we have more.

153
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Hold on.

154
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Hold your thoughts.

155
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,840
Because Terry writes in with a few names for the road show.

156
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,200
Now get ready for these ones, Wes.

157
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,440
The Very Open Roadshow, or VORCE for short.

158
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:03,440
The Wide Open Roadshow, or VORCE for short, the Linux Open Roadshow, or Linux on the Move.

159
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,740
So those are a couple of submissions there.

160
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,400
And what I'm going to suggest is while we talk about this a little more, I'm going to

161
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,760
submit, this will be in the show notes as well, I'm going to submit this to the chat

162
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,960
room for voting.

163
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,440
Put them all in there.

164
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
You guys go vote.

165
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
I got to say, so J.B.

166
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,940
Rover was the mobile studio name, but Jupiter 2 was a very common popular suggestion.

167
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,660
So I have a poll up right now for naming the road show.

168
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,000
This will go on while we do the rest of the show.

169
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,860
And chat room and Mumba room, if you could vote away, I just put the link in the show

170
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,680
notes, strawpoll.me, slash 5496571.

171
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
And we get to vote.

172
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,340
See if we got any votes yet.

173
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:45,320
Finding Linux is the Finding Linux Roadshow, and Last Cribs Roadshow is also up there for

174
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
voting.

175
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Because remember, I'm going to Noah's house.

176
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,660
I'm going to do a Last Cribs episode.

177
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
So there you go.

178
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,440
And then one more email kind of in this, and we'll let the votes continue.

179
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,280
Alex wrote in asking the following.

180
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,240
He says, for the road show, I heard you might be passing by Colorado.

181
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,720
In case that is so, it would be great if you'd like to come by for a beer at a microboo.

182
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,720
Oh, cool.

183
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
All right.

184
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
Well, hold on to that thought there, Alex.

185
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
But here's the second thing.

186
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,560
He says, this week, I was at a student's meeting of Linux users at the university.

187
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,000
And it was great to see so many people that were interested in Linux.

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,220
They helped installing Mint or whoever liked to try Linux out.

189
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,960
Some of them were even running Arch.

190
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,200
There were around 10 to 15 people.

191
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Perhaps you'd like to meet them.

192
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,440
They're a new generation of Linux users.

193
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,680
So maybe I could meet them when I come back.

194
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,120
That might be a fun thing to do.

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,120
Yeah.

196
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,320
So Alex asked about meeting up in Colorado.

197
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,480
And Alex, so right now, we may actually end up going through Colorado on the return trip.

198
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,560
But that's all a little tentative at the moment.

199
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,000
So if you go to meetup.com slash jupyterbroadcasting, we have Odyssey West right here in the Mumble

200
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Room.

201
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,040
He's going to be setting up some Mumble, or I'm sorry, some meetups as we go along.

202
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,000
And you'll be able to see where we're at, because we're going to have a Jupiter Broadcast.

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,520
We already have jupyterbroadcasting.com slash rover set up.

204
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,240
It's a live tracker of the journey of where the rover is at.

205
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,640
So you'll be able to see what town it's at.

206
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,360
And you'll be able to tweet me or email rover at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

207
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Rover at Jupiter Broadcasting.

208
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Very own email.

209
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
I love it.

210
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
Yep.

211
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Rover at Jupiter Broadcasting is great for trailer tips.

212
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,760
A lot of people are emailing in with suggestions and tips for the trailer.

213
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,040
If you want to meet up on the road, we'll be checking that inbox.

214
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,080
And all that kind of stuff can go to rover at jupyterbroadcasting.com.

215
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,600
It's also on the contact page.

216
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,720
And if you go to jupyterbroadcasting.com slash rover, you can see where the rover is in real

217
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
time.

218
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
Odyssey Westridge is going to have access to that, too.

219
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,240
And he'll be able to set up some meetups and things like that.

220
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,840
So meetup.com slash jupyterbroadcasting if you want to meet up along the way.

221
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,560
Because, Alex, I think that'd be really cool.

222
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
I'd like that.

223
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,960
So let's try to get that set up.

224
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,840
So let's check in with the votes one more time.

225
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,840
Ooh.

226
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Ooh.

227
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,600
Last Cribs Roadshow is up to the top.

228
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Look at that.

229
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,400
With 47% of the votes so far, Finding Linux is number two.

230
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,480
And the Linux Open Roadshow is number three.

231
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
No votes.

232
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,520
The wide open roadshow and the very open roadshow are getting no votes.

233
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,600
Might be good to keep Finding Linux in your back pocket here.

234
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,080
This one is a Cribs trip.

235
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,080
Yeah.

236
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Right.

237
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Yeah.

238
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
Finding Linux.

239
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,080
That's true.

240
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
When you're out of ideas and you want to hit the open road, you can just go hunt down

241
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Linux.

242
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
That's true.

243
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,080
That's good.

244
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Finding Linux could apply to a future road trip.

245
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,000
Not that we should be influencing the votes, Wes.

246
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Certainly not.

247
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Please.

248
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Please.

249
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Just disregard everything.

250
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's just standing order.

251
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah.

252
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So there you go.

253
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's see what happens.

254
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
And then by the end of this episode, maybe we'll have a name.

255
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
We'll see what.

256
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
We'll see.

257
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,320
If the votes are really super clear about it, we'll see if we have a name.

258
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,240
So this is the last Linux Unplugged recording in studio.

259
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
You'll be in studio.

260
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
Yeah.

261
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,240
But I will not be in studio starting next week.

262
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,320
I'll be on the road.

263
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,400
And there's definitely a few things still to work out.

264
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,760
I don't actually have all of the studio itself assembled in the RV yet.

265
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,560
And I have disgusting tank issues that need to be worked out.

266
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
Extra baggage.

267
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Extra baggage.

268
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,560
Yeah.

269
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Yeah.

270
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,920
There are a few things that are just really kind of still up in the air.

271
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,980
So it's a little crazy.

272
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,240
And I still have, you know, before I leave on Saturday, I still have unfiltered two tech

273
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,920
snaps and a Linux action show to record and see if I can fit in a tech talk.

274
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
So it's going to be nuts.

275
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,920
It's going to be good.

276
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
It's going to be nuts.

277
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
That's all I'm saying.

278
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
And you know, speaking of the road trip, and then we'll start.

279
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,520
Let's talk about Munich.

280
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,800
I am really excited to say that right before we started the show, my first I'm going to

281
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:20,480
get I'm going to have two Ting MiFi devices and they just sent me one of the CDMA devices.

282
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,240
But I'm going to use on the road.

283
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,180
So I'll have Ting sponsored connectivity while I'm on the go, thankfully, which is going

284
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,760
to solve a huge part of the problem.

285
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
That's amazing.

286
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Yeah, it's really great.

287
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,200
And you know, right now Ting is doing a $50 promo for the month of September.

288
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,240
If you go to Linux.ting.com, that'll support this show and give you $50 off Ting service

289
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
for you.

290
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,560
Ting is pay for what you use mobile.

291
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,580
It's $6 a line and then just your usage on top of that.

292
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
That's how Ting works.

293
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,240
They have a really great dashboard and they have no hold customer service.

294
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,520
And that's the core recipe of Ting.

295
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,880
And they really make they make this super, super valuable.

296
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,260
Like it is unbelievable with three lines and paying like $40 a month for three smartphones.

297
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,260
It's amazing.

298
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,280
And the nice thing is if you need like a MiFi device, you just need data from time to time,

299
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,060
Ting could be a great, great solution for you because it's just $6 for the line.

300
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,100
You can even suspend the line when you're not using it.

301
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,900
Go to Linux.ting.com and click on that how much you would save and put your deets in

302
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,240
there and check them out because they've got a CDMA and GSM network.

303
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,080
They have a lot of coverage you can choose from and that also means there's a lot of

304
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
devices you can use.

305
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,440
In fact, very likely you might have already a Ting compatible device, in which case you'll

306
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,120
get a $50 service credit.

307
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,320
And they have some devices that are just absolutely unbelievable.

308
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,400
Like right now the Galaxy S6 is on sale.

309
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,040
The Blue Studio 6LTE is on sale and look at the Kyocero Duro XT.

310
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,920
I think that thing could survive like an alien attack.

311
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,920
It's so cool.

312
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,440
Forty seven dollars for a feature phone and the battery just lasts forever.

313
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,520
And Noah was saying that the speaker on that thing is so loud, too, that that's a really

314
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,480
nice feature because it's designed for construction sites.

315
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,000
So a lot of good phones, everything from the feature phones up to the latest and greatest

316
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
devices.

317
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,160
And you know the Karma Go is new and I've been looking at that Karma Go.

318
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
That might be what they sent me.

319
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,160
I don't know.

320
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,040
They either sent me that or the neck ear unit.

321
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
I'm not quite sure which one I got.

322
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,520
To show them off on some future updates.

323
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
Totally, totally.

324
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,580
Yeah, there's a great range of devices to pick from including all the iPhone devices,

325
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:04,080
the latest Android devices and you can get that $50 credit by going to linux.ting.com.

326
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
Check them out.

327
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Take a read at their blog.

328
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Try their savings calculator.

329
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,560
I think you're going to be impressed on how different a mobile company can be.

330
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,960
It's a really cool setup and Ting's a unique company backed by a great company, Two Cows.

331
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,960
You're probably familiar with them.

332
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,160
You can go to linux.ting.com to support the show and get our discount and a big thanks

333
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,720
to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

334
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,520
Okay, so we've covered the Munich switch now for well, for years in Linux Action Show technically.

335
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,960
But in the last couple of weeks, there's been a lot of hoopla around, do the users want

336
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
to switch away?

337
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,960
Is it a core group of people?

338
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,020
Or maybe it's just these one group of department department users that want to switch away

339
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,720
and some Microsoft spokespersons.

340
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,560
And in all of this coverage, I think one of the things that came up was holy crap, the

341
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,680
Munich IT department is modifying the Linux that they're using.

342
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,560
I mean, they have Limux and the LibreOffice they're using quite a bit, something like

343
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
40 patches to LibreOffice.

344
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,360
Huge patch load to carry.

345
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Yeah.

346
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,960
And a lot of people thought this was a big mistake.

347
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,080
Now one thing we did mention in the show, but I think it kind of got missed is the patches

348
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,640
that they're doing, they are sending upstream.

349
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,640
That's awesome.

350
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,640
That's the way to do it.

351
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,400
So they are, they consider themselves a major contributor to free and open source projects,

352
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,040
sending bug fixes to upstream developers, making available software solutions and sharing

353
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,720
best practices and technical information.

354
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Now this is true.

355
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,280
I know that there are IT folks when they, when some of the things they've discovered

356
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,880
employing large sets of Linux machines they've been sharing.

357
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,800
One of the things they say is the development cycle is long.

358
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,620
And one of the members of the city's Linux client development team was saying that one

359
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,920
of the reasons the wide range of computer hardware is supported.

360
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,880
So this is one of the challenges they have is because the development cycle of Limux

361
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,040
and the applications they use is long, hardware changes fairly quickly.

362
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,440
So they say whatever computer hardware was built in the last 20 years, Munich is running

363
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,020
and it's a central IT department, it's central that the IT department has to support it.

364
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,640
So they have 18,000 PCs, so you can imagine how much hardware breaks per day.

365
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,700
And that's why we always stock half a year's worth of hardware.

366
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,800
And of course sometimes they have to do custom patches to support some of this hardware.

367
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,120
And some of these include patches for like scanners to do certain kinds of document scanning.

368
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,180
They have a web based solution to administer accounts for groups, servers and workstations

369
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,200
with an LDAP distributed directory with information services.

370
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,520
They have fully automated installation services that make software available updates to people,

371
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,480
to all the workstations, over 50 offices across the city.

372
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,520
And they're on the fifth version of Limux, which isn't deployed for everybody but it's

373
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,520
based on Kubuntu.

374
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,600
Now you were just recently playing with automated deployments.

375
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,640
When you hear numbers like this, you know, you look at impressive organizations.

376
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,140
Yeah, that's 18,000 PCs, 50 offices.

377
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,080
When you think of automating something like that, does it boggle the mind a little bit?

378
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
It definitely does.

379
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,560
Yeah, I can't even, I mean, you'd have to though.

380
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
You would have to.

381
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,060
I mean, and I can understand how they have some legacy needs that perhaps smaller, more

382
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,640
nimble organizations are not buckled down with.

383
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,640
Yeah.

384
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Yeah.

385
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,680
I wanted to kind of mention to you guys though, do you guys have any takeaways from our recent

386
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Munich coverage?

387
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,520
Anything, any gaps that you wanted to fill in on the Munich coverage?

388
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Anybody?

389
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,120
Because I know it's been a popular topic in our subreddit, so I wanted to open it up for

390
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,120
discussion here in the show.

391
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Really?

392
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,360
I've got to figure somebody has an opinion on it.

393
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,640
The only thing that's occurred to me, I mean, I know it's been a long time since they started

394
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,720
this effort, but this day and age, do they need their own distribution?

395
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,480
Could they not find a commercially supported distribution and repurpose that?

396
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:33,600
Just tweak the applications that are installed and use Ubuntu or OpenSUSE or?

397
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,320
It does sound like they're doing a lot of work to keep up with everything.

398
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,680
It's a lot to keep in house.

399
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,680
They're starting with Ubuntu, yeah.

400
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,360
Yeah, but it's quite old, isn't it?

401
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
It is, yeah.

402
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Yeah.

403
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Yeah.

404
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,840
The design of, the only thing that I think is silly is the design that they have of like

405
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,280
a six year cycle between different versions.

406
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,440
So there's at least one year they're guaranteed not to get support and they did that on purpose.

407
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,920
Well if you were going to do it today, wouldn't you almost do it somewhat similar sort of

408
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,660
as your own spin off of the distro?

409
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:11,320
Like it would be PPAs that you lay down on top of it and things like that.

410
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,600
Isn't that kind of how you would do it if you were going to do it today?

411
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,200
But it would be as close to mainline Ubuntu as possible?

412
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Yeah.

413
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,580
And I would update every two years.

414
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,580
Borky makes a good point.

415
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,520
They're running KDE, so why don't they base this on OpenSUSE?

416
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:32,120
Yeah, there's like with the studio to spin your own and then the build service to build

417
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
the applications.

418
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,440
And maybe you could have different versions for different sets of hardware if you needed

419
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,440
it.

420
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,080
Truly SUSE could really, the SUSE studio and the SUSE builds or open build service could

421
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,320
provide a ton of infrastructure for them.

422
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Yeah.

423
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,360
Well isn't this the risk when you adopt too early?

424
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Did they?

425
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Okay, Wimpy.

426
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,760
But very frankly, did they adopt Linux too early?

427
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,200
No, I wouldn't want to say that because somebody has to sort of take the first step and Munich

428
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,800
have been sort of the shining light for everyone else to follow.

429
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:08,200
And there have been examples of other organizations and municipalities following their lead.

430
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,120
So I think that's all good.

431
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:14,960
And I think that what's changed is that the Linux landscape has changed a little bit since

432
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,120
they first set out on this endeavor.

433
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
Yeah.

434
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
Yeah.

435
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
Somebody had to do it.

436
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
Yeah.

437
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,440
Somebody at a large scale had to do it.

438
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,040
And it's great to see them contributing some of what they've learned about trying to – hopefully

439
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,920
the next city that adopts it will do a leaner job.

440
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,200
What about my concern though that because they're kind of – I mean I really respect

441
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,840
the work they're doing here and I think it's great that they've taken this on.

442
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,800
But isn't it also not the best example for us?

443
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,560
Because it is sort of an old style of doing an implementation, it feels like every time

444
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,160
the press goes to it every year to look at how it's doing and the story that comes

445
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,440
out is well, they're struggling a little bit but they're still chugging along.

446
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
That feels like not a great use case.

447
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,720
It doesn't get you excited about it.

448
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,720
Yeah.

449
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,200
It doesn't make me want to switch my company over if I'm some CTO, right?

450
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Right.

451
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,120
That I worry about a little bit is I'd love to see some of the companies that are out

452
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,060
there that are huge that have switched over to Ubuntu on the desktop that just have massive

453
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,720
deployments and they don't talk about it.

454
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,880
That I would really like to see.

455
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,440
Because I think if more people talked about it, it's like it becomes like part of people's

456
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
secret sauce.

457
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,720
It's like it's part of their, what keeps them different.

458
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,520
I don't know what it is, exactly why companies aren't talking about it, but if they would,

459
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,640
I feel like it would feel like it was more commonplace.

460
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
But Munich's what we get.

461
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
What's that?

462
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,440
I'd like to know where Munich falls on the spectrum of organizations that have really

463
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,600
customized their installation.

464
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,640
Are there entities out there with 18,000 desktops that just take Ubuntu or Red Hat out of the

465
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
box?

466
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, we know there's gubuntu, so we know Ubuntu's, or I mean we know Google is modifying

467
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Ubuntu.

468
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,360
I feel like we also miss out on some of the maybe enterprise that have some Linux deployment

469
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,360
on the desktop.

470
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:56,560
You know, like maybe developers and some of the IT staff, maybe not the accountants.

471
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,040
Yeah, for sure.

472
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,860
I'm sure that happens quite a bit.

473
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,920
And if you watch Mr. Robot, apparently everybody runs Linux.

474
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,720
You ever watch Mr. Robot, that show?

475
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
Only the first episode.

476
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Oh, really?

477
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
Yeah, I have to catch up.

478
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,240
Well, it's a pretty interesting show, but the one thing that does seem to keep me coming

479
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,800
back every single week is every single week they have gratuitous shots of the Linux desktop.

480
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
That's beautiful.

481
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Yeah, it actually is.

482
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
A Linux desktop.

483
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
A Linux desktop.

484
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Yeah.

485
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Yeah.

486
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,800
I mean...

487
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Not what they say it is.

488
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Oh, I see you're running GNOME.

489
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
It's not GNOME.

490
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,840
Well, sometimes they have run, they've shown GNOME, but it's mostly, it looks like KDE

491
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:29,840
a lot of times.

492
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,160
Like I was watching episode eight of season one last night and it looked like console

493
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,080
came up and he was seeding the slash opt slash something or other.

494
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,520
Do they have like a Linux advisor like big studios have science advisors for their films?

495
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
It seems to have, yeah.

496
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
They do actually.

497
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
That's beautiful.

498
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
Yeah.

499
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,040
They have, it's impressive that they actually run commands and the stuff that it displays

500
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,600
is really what it actually does.

501
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
You guys...

502
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
That's mind blowing.

503
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:58,400
You guys heard us play this clip in last, a couple of weeks ago, but I'm going to play

504
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,600
it again anyways, because it's like, when I heard this, when I heard this clip, I was

505
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,400
like, okay, well now I have to watch that show.

506
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,200
And I'd heard about the show and I was like, Christian Slater, okay, that's fine.

507
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,400
I don't have anything really against him, but not totally drawing me in.

508
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,360
And then when I saw this clip, I was like, okay, yeah, I'm going to watch this show.

509
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:20,300
So I see a running gnome, you know, I'm actually on KDE myself.

510
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,440
I know this desktop environment is supposed to be better, but you know what they say,

511
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,880
old habits, they die hard.

512
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,320
An executive running Linux, but I know what you're thinking.

513
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
I'm an executive.

514
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,320
I mean, why am I even running Linux?

515
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,040
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

516
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
That's great though.

517
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
Thanks Leo.

518
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
That's such a great clip.

519
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,160
When I saw that, I thought, wow, okay, I got to watch that show.

520
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,120
So I don't know how we got on that topic, but if you're a Linux, well, you probably

521
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
listen to this show.

522
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,760
You're probably a Linux user and you want a television show to watch, Mr. Robot's a

523
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,320
good one.

524
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,120
I'm stocking up on a couple of episodes for the road trip, which I'm going to talk about

525
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,160
a little bit on how I'm going to do some of my things offline while I'm on the road.

526
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,640
I think it'll be an interesting challenge.

527
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,120
Yeah, Xavier, you're welcome.

528
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
Thanks for the new habit.

529
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Is anybody in the mumble room watching Mr. Robot?

530
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,760
I watched a few of them, but I haven't kept up to date with it.

531
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,040
I keep watching them in batches and every time I watch it, I'm glad I do, but I don't,

532
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,680
I seem to let it go for a few weeks.

533
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,680
How I do with them.

534
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,680
It's good and it has like a little bit of things that kind of put you off for like a

535
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,560
little bit, but then it pulls you back in with some of the tech stuff and you're like.

536
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,560
It does.

537
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,560
Yeah.

538
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
It actually really does.

539
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,240
Like I really, they say some of the people that are consulting with them are actually

540
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
completely anonymous.

541
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,920
Like they're, they're people they talk to over like Tor chat or something.

542
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Yeah.

543
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,920
So there you go.

544
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
All right.

545
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:48,960
So I want to get into the topic of how I hope to enjoy some of the benefits of being online

546
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,240
while offline in the trailer, because the realities of the trailer are I'm going to

547
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,640
be really limited on connectivity because a I'm either going to be on, on cellular,

548
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:01,480
which will probably be at best limited connectivity on I-90.

549
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,920
And there's not, it's not exactly free.

550
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,960
I mean, yes, Ting's giving to me for free, but I, you know, I don't want to abuse it.

551
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,720
And then, and then if I don't have a Ting connection, then, then I'm really going to

552
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,120
need to be self-sufficient.

553
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,000
And so I'm trying to come up with a couple of different open source projects that I can

554
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
install.

555
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,800
I'm envisioning, so if you're familiar with how RV trailers work, usually there's a spot

556
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,480
where you eat and there's a table and there's two bench seats and those bench seats open

557
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,000
up and underneath there, there's a perfect spot to set up like a NUC server and maybe

558
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,520
like an external mirrored hard drive or something like that and put it underneath the, the seat,

559
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,280
the bench and build a server there and then install some really nice, and I'm not doing

560
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:41,960
this this trip, but I'm going to do some of these on a laptop just to sort of test it

561
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,720
on the drive since I have the laptop.

562
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Version 1.0.

563
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
Yeah.

564
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,800
Version 1.0 is going to be on a laptop, like a beta.

565
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,120
And I'm thinking what couple, what different open source projects could I glue together

566
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,920
to essentially give me an online like experience while on the road?

567
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,080
And there's a few major ones and that's also going to be a continuing topic in this week's

568
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,400
episode of the Linux action show.

569
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,160
We're going to double down and really, really focus on one really important one and show

570
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,440
you how to set it up.

571
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:08,760
But first, before we get to that, I want to mention DigitalOcean, which I'm considering

572
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,320
how DigitalOcean could be sort of like an offsite cache for me.

573
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,440
Maybe I have cron jobs on DigitalOcean that go retrieve things and in one spot I pull

574
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,200
it down, maybe I'm on a Wi-Fi connection, something like that.

575
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,600
So DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

576
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
and easy way for you to spin up your own cloud server.

577
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,360
So if you want to get a Linux server set up, this could be a really great way for you to

578
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,160
spin up something really fast and try it out for two months absolutely for free.

579
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,800
Use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED and you get a $10 credit over DigitalOcean.

580
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:40,360
You can get started in less than 55 seconds and pricing plans start at only $5 a month.

581
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:46,920
And for $5 a month you get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte

582
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,000
of transfer.

583
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,880
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

584
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,320
London and Germany.

585
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,040
But what I really like about DigitalOcean, well what I really like about DigitalOcean

586
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,200
is that it's all running on Linux, it's all using KVM for the virtualization and they

587
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,600
use SSDs for all of their disk I.O.

588
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,060
So that I really like about it.

589
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,960
And they have tier one data connections.

590
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,560
That's stuff I really like about DigitalOcean but the thing that really makes it all sing

591
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,360
is the interface they set on top of it.

592
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,080
It is a glorious interface that is really intuitive to easy and maybe simple.

593
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,640
But I don't want to make it sound like it's not powerful because it is very powerful.

594
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,680
You can do just about anything you'd want in there.

595
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,760
And the nice thing is if you want to get really pro level, they've got a straightforward API.

596
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,040
So go use that promo code DOUNPLUG, try out a five dollar droplet, two months for absolutely

597
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,280
free.

598
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,040
See what I'm talking about, DigitalOcean is cray and I have a feeling they're going to

599
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,640
play a key role in my offline online world.

600
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,080
Because the DigitalOcean droplet can always be online, while the trailer cannot.

601
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,200
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DOUNPLUG and try them out.

602
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,040
Trust me, you can find something, once you just try it for a little bit, it's obvious

603
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,040
what you want.

604
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,040
You will be hooked.

605
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,040
You will be.

606
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
That's right.

607
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,160
DigitalOcean.com and a big thanks to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show and

608
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,440
thanks to you guys for using promo code DOUNPLUGED.

609
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,960
All right, so I want to talk about a couple of different projects that Wes and I were

610
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,200
brainstorming that would help somebody live sort of an online life while offline.

611
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,360
Because this is going to be a key thing for me and I thought this is probably a good mental

612
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,520
exercise to go through anyways.

613
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,160
And one of the things I really want to do while on the road is read.

614
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,160
I want to be able to get my reading and catch up on articles and things like this.

615
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,240
Word and Instapaper are kind of like the go-to for this and that's great if you can connect

616
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,500
to your Instapaper queue or your Pocket queue and download them to your device.

617
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,000
But nothing guarantees that when I decide to fire up the device, the app, on my phone

618
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,600
for the first time in two days, nothing guarantees I'm actually going to have a connection.

619
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,800
So I would really like something that would be sort of storing the articles for me in

620
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:51,080
the trailer, getting them ready to read whenever I want to, when I'm on the local trailer network.

621
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,640
And so that's where Wallabag comes in.

622
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,160
Wallabag is essentially an open source Pocket competitor.

623
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,140
The application is going to suck down the web page for you and store it offline for

624
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,240
reading anytime you want.

625
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,640
We're going to get to other ways you could do this, but this is a very Instapaper Pocket

626
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
kind of way.

627
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,800
And Wes, are you familiar with Wallabag?

628
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,040
I've tried it out a little bit on one of their older versions.

629
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,040
It seemed like a great idea.

630
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,880
I don't know how the implementation has improved.

631
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,880
Are you using Pocket right now?

632
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,880
I have been using Pocket.

633
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,880
So you get the idea.

634
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,880
I sure do.

635
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,720
And the same thing here, you can have a JavaScript bookmarklet that will send it to your queue.

636
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:34,640
They have apps for Android where you can share to Wallabag, and it saves it to your local

637
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
server.

638
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,640
It's very handy.

639
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,640
That's awesome.

640
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,640
Yeah.

641
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,640
So that's Wallabag.

642
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,600
I don't know if anybody in the Mumba Room has an experience with it.

643
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
You feel free to jump in.

644
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
But this is on my try-to-do list.

645
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,720
We've talked about it once before, but it's pretty cool.

646
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,840
And then something else that I've got to really come to terms with is right now I'm a really

647
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,320
big LastPass user.

648
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,080
But if I'm offline for an extended period of time, it might be worth looking into KeePass

649
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,960
and maybe specifically KeePass X, because you were saying maybe I might prefer this

650
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,360
over standard KeePass.

651
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,160
I like it a little more for native Linux implementation.

652
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,080
If you track their Git, they have I think Beta 2 now.

653
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,320
They're using the new KeePass 2.0 format that has a little better, you know, if you have

654
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,960
multiple versions, you can intermingle them.

655
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,880
They won't conflict anymore.

656
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,880
So it's definitely worth a try.

657
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
Yeah.

658
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
I found it to be extremely stable.

659
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,040
So no mono required seems really nice.

660
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
Yes.

661
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
And you see, it's in there.

662
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,040
You are.

663
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Yep.

664
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
So it's easy for me to get up and going.

665
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,200
You can download the stable release, which works very well.

666
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,200
I've had no problems with.

667
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,120
And then the version 2 Beta, which is cool.

668
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,560
Do you have any idea what the process is to move from LastPass to KeePass?

669
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,560
I do not.

670
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
I've actually never used LastPass.

671
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Oh, OK.

672
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,340
KeePass has been meeting all of my needs.

673
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:49,840
If your issue is to have access when you're not online, LastPass actually has a thing

674
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,240
called Yosemite or something where you download your entire vault and it's locked down on your

675
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,600
stuff so you can use it offline and you can use it like a portable app or you can use

676
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,600
it.

677
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Oh, it's Open Sesame.

678
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
So that's what it is.

679
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Open Sesame.

680
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,600
OK.

681
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
All right.

682
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
I got it.

683
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
Yosemite.

684
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
I got to look into that.

685
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
OK.

686
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Open Sesame for KeePass.

687
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
All right.

688
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,600
Now, that seems like that.

689
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
So that might be a good solution for this trip.

690
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
That's a good one.

691
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,600
Yeah.

692
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,600
I thought there was a way, too.

693
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,240
Imacon in the chat room says, pretty sure you can export your LastPass vault to a format.

694
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
KeePass can read.

695
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Oh, that's beautiful.

696
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Oh, and look at that.

697
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,520
Odyssey says, here is your LastPass vault user manual for exporting.

698
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
Cool.

699
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Thank you, guys.

700
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,680
So that might be something I'll look into.

701
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,880
Maybe not for this trip, but maybe for a future one.

702
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,040
So Wes, you were trying to convince me.

703
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,640
The other big thing that I want to be able to do, and I can't think of another way to

704
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,840
do this, and I bet Wimpy is going to back you up on this, you know, right now I'm relying

705
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,720
on Dropbox a lot for file sync.

706
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,720
Yes.

707
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,720
And I want to be able to continue to work across all of my machines, which is really

708
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,960
going to be three computers in the trailer, maybe four.

709
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,840
And I want to be able to update files in them and have them all be able to share the files

710
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,880
so that way I can do show prep on the road, and then when I get a connection, have it

711
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,440
sync back up.

712
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,160
And I think you probably can't get around the fact that, I mean, to do that, I've got

713
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
to use SyncThing.

714
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,160
You've got to use SyncThing.

715
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,760
I mean, there are some alternatives, but I think SyncThing works really well.

716
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,000
It runs great just on a LAN, or if you have your occasional connectivity to your droplet,

717
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,880
you can mirror things up there as you can.

718
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Yeah.

719
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
I don't know, Wimpy.

720
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
What do you think?

721
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,480
Do you think this is the time to switch to SyncThing, or can Dropbox do the job?

722
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,680
I think Dropbox can do the job.

723
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
Without the cloud piece?

724
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,680
Of course.

725
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,080
Well, you only need one instance of Dropbox, don't you?

726
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,520
You don't need all of your machines running Dropbox.

727
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:39,480
You could have all of your machines running Dropbox and use LAN syncing, or you just export

728
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,720
your Dropbox folder from one machine over NFS and mount that Dropbox instance on the

729
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
other machines.

730
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,720
That's true.

731
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
That would be one way to do it, would be to have a...

732
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,560
Because I do want to have access to all of the files on all the machines, because it

733
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,760
could be notes sometimes and things like that, but if I had them all over NFS and then just

734
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,800
had Dropbox running on the NFS server, that could be a way to do it.

735
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,800
As long as you stay in the trailer.

736
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
I don't know if you'll be...

737
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
Oh, that's true.

738
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,600
You know, if you go work in a coffee shop or you're eating Noah's, you can sync yourself.

739
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,080
I often will be Wi-Fi hunting.

740
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,480
That's a really big component of it.

741
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,680
But if the Dropbox, you know, the local LAN sync works fine, then you'll...

742
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,840
LAN sync seems to only work when it actually has connectivity to the cloud server to get

743
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,000
the master index with Dropbox.

744
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,400
No, it needs LAN sync to do the first initial upload, and then once the first initial upload

745
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,920
of the files is done, the rest goes over the LAN.

746
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,320
This is a challenging one.

747
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:39,160
I'm not sure what to do here, because it's too big of a transition to make before Saturday.

748
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,820
But the more I think about it, if I want four computers to be able to all work off the same

749
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:48,000
files and be able to take one of those four to a coffee shop and still have all that work

750
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,840
updated, that's got to probably be syncing.

751
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,840
With maybe...

752
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,840
What's the VPN client?

753
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,840
Oh, Tink?

754
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,560
Yeah, with Tink.

755
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,480
So that way, when I'm at the coffee shop, I'm connected back to the...

756
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Well...

757
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,960
And you can have the droplet with it, too?

758
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
That would be how to do it.

759
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Yeah, the droplet, yeah.

760
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,800
Yeah, the droplet could be in the Tink network, too.

761
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
Oh, yeah.

762
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,800
No problem.

763
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Oh, man.

764
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
You don't...

765
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,800
The Tink bit is optional, though.

766
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
Yeah, it's totally optional.

767
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
You don't need Tink.

768
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,800
Yeah.

769
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
I was thinking...

770
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
Keep it simple, Chris.

771
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
No, well, here, let me...

772
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,800
I've listened to a couple of your, you know, ideas, and I fear that you're overcomplicating

773
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
your connectivity requirements.

774
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
That's true.

775
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
I'll tell you what I was thinking.

776
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,440
What I was thinking was it'd be nice if the trailer had Wi-Fi connectivity to have it

777
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,040
be able to also be getting the files.

778
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,840
Like, say, I'm working back here at the studio, and the trailer has Wi-Fi connectivity.

779
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:34,120
It'd be nice if the changes here were already back at the trailer when I got there, if it

780
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,520
has a persistent connection.

781
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,040
And the only way I can really think to do that is to have the...

782
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,520
To either have, like, the trailer, every time it connects, have, like, dynamic DNS, updated

783
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,760
DNS record, or use Tink to just make sure it's always on the same network.

784
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
I don't know.

785
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,760
That's not...

786
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Again, that's not all, like...

787
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,120
That's not all right in this first trip, anyways.

788
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
That's all...

789
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,120
And there's a lot of permutations that could work there.

790
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
I just think it's gonna be...

791
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,760
I think it's going on the project list, though.

792
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
I think solving this...

793
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,960
I don't know how I'm gonna solve it, but this particular problem is going on the...

794
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,240
Is on that list.

795
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
All right.

796
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
GB Infrastructure Initiative.

797
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
Right.

798
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,440
The mobile studio needs a good Linux infrastructure.

799
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,560
And then last but not least, this one is probably the one all of you were guessing in the chat

800
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
room.

801
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,840
I think I might just archive some websites with wget.

802
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,420
And it turns out, like, the command...

803
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,600
If we have the command in the show notes, it's crazy easy.

804
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,480
There's an option in wget for website archive.

805
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:27,040
So like, we were thinking maybe we'd use ARIA 2, or, you know, there's a lot of different

806
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,600
methods to pull this particular problem off.

807
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,160
I mean, you could even just send a Lava to Wallabag.

808
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,640
But the nice thing about wget is it can just archive the single website.

809
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,240
So we have the command there.

810
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,000
And if you want to try it out, you can.

811
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,120
I think I will beg you for some reading, like, just grab a few sites, pull it down, and then

812
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,120
read them later.

813
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,120
Yeah.

814
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,160
You've got all your CSS images, everything.

815
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,520
I could VPN to the trailer from Starbucks, Xavier.

816
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,240
That's exactly what I was thinking.

817
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,520
So Mamba Room, did you guys have any other...

818
00:32:53,520 --> 00:33:00,340
So any other suggestions of open source projects that kind of help replicate the online experience

819
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,640
when you're offline with no connectivity?

820
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,240
Chris has got a real bad internet addiction, and he needs help.

821
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,640
This is exactly it.

822
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,080
I need the slight sensation of being on the internet, even if it's just like a Nicorette

823
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,080
gum.

824
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,080
I need...

825
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,080
I need something.

826
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,080
Keep him going on his long journey.

827
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,560
Because when I turn off the MiFi, right now...

828
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:23,440
So here's what happens right now is I have a couple of different hotspot devices to

829
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,720
connect to, depending on what signal is the strongest that morning.

830
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,200
And then when I turn them on, all of a sudden I get a LAN, and all the devices connect,

831
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:33,560
and all of a sudden they can all talk to each other and self-discover, and it's amazing.

832
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,520
And then when I want to save bandwidth, I turn off the MiFi device, and my LAN collapses,

833
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,560
and none of the devices have any IP addresses, and nothing can talk to itself.

834
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
The Dark Ages.

835
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:47,440
It's like they're all just individual monsters, just in the dark, bumping into each other.

836
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
And then I decide, okay, I want to do something online.

837
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,680
So I turn the MiFi device back on, and the LAN comes back online.

838
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,920
And it feels so quiet.

839
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,920
And it's been cool for about a week and a half or so, or whatever it's been, but today

840
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,800
and last night I'm kind of like, okay, I would really like to have some solid connectivity.

841
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:09,760
So I'm just curious what other projects you guys might suggest that I could use to kind

842
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
of get that experience.

843
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,460
If you wanted an offline search type thing, you could do local search with Yacy.

844
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,460
That's true.

845
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
Oh, yeah.

846
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,460
That's a good one.

847
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,460
That's not bad, actually.

848
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,460
When I want to look something up but don't have connectivity...

849
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,440
Now, will Yacy do archiving, because I'll have to be able to read the results offline.

850
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
Yeah, it can.

851
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
By default, it doesn't.

852
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,320
It just indexes, but you can make it archive, too.

853
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,280
Grab a TP link and get a USB mobile dongle.

854
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,380
So Inagogo, you need to tell me more about that.

855
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:37,560
If you would email Rover at JupiterBroadcasting.com, because I'm trying to figure out how the NUC...

856
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,220
So the NUC is also going to be my firewall, I assume, and I need to know how that NUC

857
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:44,560
is going to jump between different cellular connections for the LAN.

858
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,120
Winby, do you have any input on Wi-Fi and things like that in an RV?

859
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,120
Yeah.

860
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,880
So I've got what we would call over here an SUV, which I think is more or less the same

861
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,880
kind of thing.

862
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
Okay.

863
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,680
And I've got wireless and Ethernet in mine.

864
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:12,720
And I used one of these travel routers, you know, so it's battery packed router and wireless

865
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:19,500
end, and it's got a USB port on it that I plug a 3G, 4G USB dongle into.

866
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,480
So that device, that router uses the 3G, 4G to get an internet connection and provides

867
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,520
the LAN and it has one Ethernet port.

868
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,500
So I can have one hardwired device, not that I ever use it.

869
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,920
So I could plug that into the NUC, for example.

870
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,920
For example.

871
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,920
Yeah.

872
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:46,080
And that way, when you don't want internet connectivity, but you do want the LAN, you

873
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:54,200
simply unplug the USB dongle and you retain your LAN, but you've physically removed yourself

874
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
from the internet.

875
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Yeah.

876
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
Yeah.

877
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
That's exactly what I want.

878
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,680
And that's got that, you know, that's got caching DNS and all of that stuff on it and

879
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,680
DHCP.

880
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,680
Ooh.

881
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,680
Okay.

882
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,680
All right.

883
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
Okay.

884
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
Do you have a link to that one?

885
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,600
I'll look it up and post it in the IRC in a second.

886
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,600
Thank you.

887
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,600
Yeah.

888
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,960
Ever resourceful mumble room.

889
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,680
You suggested MPD.

890
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,680
That would be one option.

891
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,680
And I was thinking, what was the, anybody remember the alternative to subsonic?

892
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,680
What was that?

893
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,840
Remember how there's a sub rage or something like that?

894
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:28,560
There was a, there's an alternative subsonic that's come out recently that would also possibly

895
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
it's kind of like replaced.

896
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,280
That would basically be replacing Spotify.

897
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
Yes.

898
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,640
But other than that, that was kind of where I was starting to kind of, I mean, I have

899
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,440
a couple ideas that I'm saving for last that are huge, but other than that, that's kind

900
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,240
of what I've come up with.

901
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:44,960
So if you go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com in the subreddit and look for episode one

902
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,480
10 and give me your ideas for open source projects that give you that online experience

903
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,480
while you're offline.

904
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,760
And the thing I love about this is it's not, it's mad Sonic.

905
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
Yeah.

906
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
That's what it was.

907
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Thank you guys.

908
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Mad Sonic.

909
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
I think I love about this idea.

910
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,940
It's not just for those of us that are living on a metered cellular connections, but it's

911
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,840
also great for just that whole bringing things offline again, moving things out of the cloud

912
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,000
and bringing it back on your own land or your own droplet or what or whatever.

913
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,720
Oh, Winby, did you find it?

914
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,720
Very good.

915
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
Yeah.

916
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

917
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,720
Zoomtel.com.

918
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,720
Oh yeah, that's nice.

919
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,720
I have the 4506AG.

920
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,720
Okay.

921
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,200
I'll put a link to that in the show notes for people that are looking for something

922
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
similar out there.

923
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,320
So that is perfect.

924
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,020
So it runs off, I don't know if you have them in the US, but we have what used to be called

925
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,920
cigarette lighters, but they're now just used to power stuff.

926
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
Yeah.

927
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,920
That's what I use in the trailer.

928
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,920
Yeah.

929
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
Nice.

930
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
Yeah.

931
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,440
And it also has a battery pack in it.

932
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,720
That's perfect.

933
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,740
So when it comes off the power, it's charged and it runs for a few hours off its own battery.

934
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,480
So it's the travel one that you have?

935
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,480
Yeah.

936
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,320
I have the 4506AG, the travel router wireless end.

937
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:01,780
You sold me with the DC power connector, to be honest with you, because I need everything

938
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,780
to run off of DC.

939
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,240
I don't even know if you can make a NUC run off of DC power, but if you can, I need it

940
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
to.

941
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,440
So, Staple sells them, perfect.

942
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:19,600
But what you will need is a USB, a compatible USB dongle, and they've got a detailed list

943
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,600
of what the compatible options are.

944
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:28,040
And they have the, I bought mine on Amazon and it had the option to buy the car kit.

945
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
The car kit.

946
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
Yeah.

947
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,920
I'm looking at it right now on Amazon.

948
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Very good.

949
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
Yeah.

950
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Yeah.

951
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,920
Let me see what I need.

952
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,920
Jesus.

953
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,920
What?

954
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
How can it only be $30?

955
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
Yeah.

956
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
It's as cheap as.

957
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,920
Yeah.

958
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,920
Holy crap.

959
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,920
Holy crap.

960
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:45,920
That's great.

961
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,920
Yeah.

962
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,160
I think I'm going to put this on the list for something to look into after this trip.

963
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,480
Now you don't have the ability to hook up to like an ethernet connection on the WAN

964
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,020
side, do you?

965
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,720
You can use WAN on the ethernet side.

966
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,560
You can either use it as LAN or WAN.

967
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,360
It's a selectable thing in the UOS.

968
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,320
So when I have the trailer parked here at the studio, I could run ethernet out to the

969
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
trailer network?

970
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,320
Yeah.

971
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,660
Oh my gosh.

972
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,660
That is so exciting.

973
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,320
I'm putting that on the list right now.

974
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,680
Man, thank you.

975
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,680
Perfect.

976
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
That's exactly what I.

977
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,680
You can plug right into Noah's network.

978
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,680
Yeah.

979
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
Exactly.

980
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,680
Exactly.

981
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,080
And then I'll have the NUC sitting behind that.

982
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,720
So that way the LAN's IP address and DNS always stays the same or something.

983
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
I mean, I don't know.

984
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
That could be.

985
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Yeah.

986
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,880
It does port address translation and UPnP and all that stuff.

987
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,880
So yeah, there you go.

988
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,640
So do you say you have the 4506A or what I'm looking?

989
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,640
Yeah.

990
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,640
4506AG.

991
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
AG.

992
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,640
Yeah.

993
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,640
OK.

994
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,640
AG.

995
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,640
Well, geez.

996
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,640
That's great, Wimpy.

997
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,640
Good pick.

998
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,640
So I'll have to make sure I put the right one on my list.

999
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,640
All right.

1000
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,440
Anybody else have any other suggestions for replicating online experience?

1001
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,520
NUC does need DC input.

1002
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,360
So it might be possible to get the NUC to do that.

1003
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,360
Very cool.

1004
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
All right.

1005
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,600
Do you have any suggestions when you're listening?

1006
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,600
Oh, look at that.

1007
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,720
Well, look what Rekai just found.

1008
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,720
You can use any.

1009
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,640
Oh, that is so awesome.

1010
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,440
You do not need a DC to DC converter.

1011
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Oh, my gosh.

1012
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,980
It's perfect.

1013
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,720
So it looks like other people have already had this same thought process.

1014
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,080
That's why it's the next unit of computing.

1015
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
That's right.

1016
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,080
That's right.

1017
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,080
Yes.

1018
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
Yes, yes, yes.

1019
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,080
That is so cool.

1020
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,080
That is so awesome.

1021
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,280
12 volts, 36 watts.

1022
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,520
That's amazing.

1023
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:36,080
That means I could run the NUC off of total battery power that's charged by solar panel.

1024
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,000
The homeland on the trailer would be run off of the solar panel.

1025
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,520
Okay, I'm just going to absorb that for a moment.

1026
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,920
I'm going to sit with that for a second.

1027
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,160
Now I think I'm going to tell you.

1028
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
Oh, go ahead, Wimpy.

1029
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160
You had another one?

1030
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,440
The 4506?

1031
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,560
That's the list of compatible USB adapter.

1032
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,560
That's probably good to have, too.

1033
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,720
I will also add the link to that in the show notes so that way we all have that because

1034
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,200
I'll probably come back to this episode to look for it myself when I'm ready to make

1035
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
the purchase.

1036
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,200
So that's cool.

1037
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
All right.

1038
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,920
So now I have been looking at different ways to do backup for some of our production machines.

1039
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,400
And it's not just because I love rolling releases that I want to find a really good

1040
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,400
backup.

1041
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,120
That might be part of what's niggling at the back of my mind.

1042
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:24,280
So I have been looking at a kind of a slick way to do a real easy snapshot and restore

1043
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:29,840
system that doesn't take a whole bunch of storage space, doesn't require like a blank

1044
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:35,540
dedicated volume, and doesn't require a specialized file system that I'm not completely comfortable

1045
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,680
using yet.

1046
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,920
And so I'm going to tell you about that.

1047
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,680
But first I want to tell you about our friends over at Linux Academy because you can check

1048
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,400
them out and maybe take your skill sets up to the next level.

1049
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,960
They're sponsors of the Linux Unplugged program.

1050
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,960
I want you to go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1051
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,880
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged gets you our special 33% discount.

1052
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,200
Now what does Linux Academy have?

1053
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,880
Well it's a training ground full of stuff based around Linux and open source.

1054
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:04,200
Self-paced courses, over 1,800 videos, they have scenario based labs so you get real hands

1055
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,720
on training with it.

1056
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:13,640
I think it was probably early 2004, 2005, I decided to go into community college to

1057
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,720
get training.

1058
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,800
Not nearly as efficient as this.

1059
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,480
Now like the concept of going in a few nights a week, how do people have time to do that?

1060
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
I don't know.

1061
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,680
I don't know how they do that to be honest with you.

1062
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:32,000
See Linux Academy, not only is it all self-paced and so you can just go at it with your own

1063
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,560
time availability, but if you really want to get specific about it, they have time availability

1064
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,560
selectors.

1065
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,600
So you can go in there and say okay on Monday I have this much time, Tuesday, Wednesday,

1066
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,120
Thursday, Friday I have this much time, Saturday I'm taking a break, Sunday I'm taking a break,

1067
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,120
right?

1068
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Or whatever you want to do.

1069
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,120
Or maybe you want to do it only on the weekends.

1070
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,340
You tell Linux Academy how much time you have and they automatically generate courseware

1071
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:53,080
that matches your availability including reminders for exams, things like that.

1072
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,280
They have seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from.

1073
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,360
They automatically adjust the course where they have them cool nuggets and they've just

1074
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,240
recently updated the nuggets too and I'm going to be honest with you guys, these might be

1075
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,280
some nuggets that are worth your time.

1076
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,320
So these nuggets are like two to 60 minutes, just a deep dive into a specific course.

1077
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,640
Aliases and escapes in Bash.

1078
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,940
You know you could be saving time with better aliases.

1079
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,880
The comma is your friend in Bash.

1080
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,720
Command history shortcuts in Bash.

1081
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,200
Those are all extremely useful nuggets.

1082
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,320
You just go in there right there and get it.

1083
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,040
Alternative command line for the email, privacy, web browsing with privacy badger, manipulating

1084
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:30,640
logs with sed, dig for DNS, user key loggers, Linux signals, a short tutorial, that's a

1085
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,640
great one.

1086
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,640
Check them out.

1087
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,200
You can go to linuxacademy.com slash nuggets but start by going to linuxacademy.com slash

1088
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,600
unplugged and also if you're interested in doing some training or writing some practice

1089
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,000
exams or maybe you want to do some backend work for Linux Academy, they're hiring.

1090
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,600
You can email them career at linuxacademy.com.

1091
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:53,080
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and if you want to get a gig, career at linuxacademy.com.

1092
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,760
Big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1093
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,760
Okay.

1094
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:05,680
So Wes, it's called, I think, I'm going to say Datto block driver, D-A-T-T-O Datto.

1095
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,740
It's a Datto block driver.

1096
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:09,320
Now here's how they set it up.

1097
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,080
Now they recognize, and I like this, they build the case that Linux has some basic tools

1098
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:15,000
for creating snapshots of file systems.

1099
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Most use copy on write schemes to allow point in time consistent snapshots.

1100
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:25,120
Currently, both LVM and device mapper on which LVM is built support copy and write snapshotting.

1101
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,940
Unfortunately, both have limitations that render them unusable for supporting live server

1102
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:31,660
snapshotting across desperate Linux environments.

1103
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:35,780
For example, LVM snapshotting requires an unused volume in order to track your copy

1104
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,960
on write data.

1105
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,120
So enter the Datto block driver, Datto BD.

1106
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,800
It solves the above problems.

1107
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,720
It is an open source Linux kernel module for a point in time live snapshotting.

1108
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:54,060
Datto BD can be loaded onto a running Linux machine without reboot and used to create

1109
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,840
an image file representing any block device at the instant the snapshot was taken.

1110
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:03,900
After the first snapshot, Datto B tracks incremental changes to the block device and can therefore

1111
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:08,460
efficiently update existing backups by copying only the blocks that have changed.

1112
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,280
With a single command, Datto DB can almost instantly create a point in time snapshot

1113
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,160
device representing the snapshot state.

1114
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,200
Between snapshots, disk writes are tracked so incremental changes can be quickly and

1115
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,440
efficiently applied to an existing image file.

1116
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:27,560
Datto DB is designed to run on any Linux device from small test virtual machines to live production

1117
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,840
servers with minimal impact on IO or CPU performance.

1118
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:35,760
Since the driver works at the block layer, it supports the most common file systems including

1119
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,760
extended XFS and even ZFS and Butterfess.

1120
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,840
Although file systems with their own block device management such as ZFS and Butterfess

1121
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,520
cannot be supported.

1122
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,520
So Butterfess is not supported.

1123
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,960
Kind of a bummer but I guess not necessary since Butterfess has copy on write support

1124
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,960
in itself.

1125
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:00,080
All copy on write data is tracked in a file on the source block device itself eliminating

1126
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:06,320
the need to have a spare volume in order to store that snapshot.

1127
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:12,240
So in summary, Datto DB brings functionality of similar to like volume shadow copy on Windows

1128
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,960
to a broad range of Linux installs, file systems and kernels.

1129
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,000
Are you impressed at all Wes?

1130
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I'm very curious.

1131
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
You know they say efficiently.

1132
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,800
I'm interested in what the overhead might be.

1133
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,360
It'd be very fun to try this on some running systems and see what happens.

1134
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,000
All right so let's put it to the mumble room.

1135
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,360
Is anybody in the mumble room?

1136
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:35,480
Now remember Chris is going to be on the road next week and it would be great if we all

1137
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,720
met back here for 1.11 with a real good like story.

1138
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,120
Is anybody in the mumble room willing to try this out?

1139
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:47,440
You can do it on a virtual machine or an actual machine this week and report back next week

1140
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,440
on how it went.

1141
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,440
Anybody?

1142
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,440
Yeah, I'll give it a go.

1143
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,440
Oh I love it.

1144
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,440
That was easy.

1145
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,440
Yeah.

1146
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,640
So I'll have it linked in the show notes.

1147
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:02,720
I'm just really curious you know if it really can easily I don't know like maybe the test

1148
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,800
would be update a system and see if it's easy to go back or recover date exactly how it

1149
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,800
works.

1150
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,800
Could be kind of neat.

1151
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,160
Yeah but I've got a machine here that I'm using as my main workstation which I'm about

1152
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,480
to upgrade so I don't really mind if it goes horribly wrong so I think what I'll do is

1153
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:24,480
do some backups, do some updates and do some backups and roll back and then I'll do a full

1154
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,640
distribution upgrade and try and roll back and see what happens.

1155
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,640
Oh I can't wait.

1156
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,640
I'm really excited.

1157
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,000
This is exciting, yeah.

1158
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,480
So Datto block driver, D-A-T-T-O, Datto, oh very neat.

1159
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,560
They got me when they said that it makes it super fast to do incremental updates because

1160
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:44,320
that made me think that you know once you get the first one done then it's not really

1161
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,000
that much of a tax to fire off a quick homo free to an update or something like that.

1162
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,480
And I love the idea that you could just plug it you know add this to a running system.

1163
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,480
Yes.

1164
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:56,400
I didn't use a copy on write file system but I'd really love to be able to you know especially

1165
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,400
if you're running a rolling release.

1166
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,680
And especially if you know you don't really you know you have a system where extended

1167
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,840
four is just fine for you, something like that and speaking of extended four did you

1168
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,080
guys see that the next kernel update is going to drop extended three support or at least

1169
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:10,080
the explicit driver?

1170
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,080
Okay.

1171
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:12,080
Oh is that what it is?

1172
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:13,080
Not the support for it.

1173
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,080
Okay.

1174
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,920
So it'll still be there if somebody has extended three.

1175
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,920
Well it'll load it.

1176
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:18,920
Like a module type.

1177
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:19,920
Yeah exactly.

1178
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,760
Extended four now will be the extended three support.

1179
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,760
Right.

1180
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,760
Yeah because it can read it too.

1181
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:25,760
That's interesting.

1182
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,760
So it's not really a big deal at all.

1183
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,760
Not really at all.

1184
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:28,760
It's an interesting discussion though.

1185
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:30,760
Even if you didn't have it like who cares?

1186
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:35,920
It is an interesting discussion and if you look at the mailing list yeah and how they

1187
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,240
kind of go through and decide like you know the thought process behind it, what's it going

1188
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,800
to break, do we really want to run this risk and okay well if we have the backwards compatibility

1189
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,020
here and we can module it.

1190
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:49,000
So Corky says that Linus blocked it.

1191
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
He did.

1192
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,760
It looked like at least on the mailing list that then there was further discussion in

1193
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,800
the file system development that they are willing to say that the ext4 does not enforce

1194
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,920
new features so that you could if you had an ext3 then you use the ext4 driver and wanted

1195
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,400
to go back to a kernel just using the ext3 driver it would still work and they were willing

1196
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,400
to support that.

1197
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,400
That's my understanding.

1198
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,760
And I think I read that today or yesterday so it's pretty recent Corky if you maybe missed

1199
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,760
it.

1200
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,120
But it doesn't really affect anybody that's running ext3.

1201
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,480
The other thing that was interesting is that it points out that they're keeping or probably

1202
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,740
keeping ext2 just because it's a really good example file system so maybe anyone interested

1203
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:29,320
in Linux kernel development or file system development that's a good one to go study.

1204
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,320
It's simple but effective?

1205
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,320
Yeah.

1206
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,320
Huh.

1207
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,320
That is interesting.

1208
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,640
And if you wanted to implement a new file system there's a skeleton you can use.

1209
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,640
Start with something I suppose.

1210
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,640
Yeah.

1211
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:40,360
I mean it has it's pretty it's pretty road proven as I say because I'm thinking about

1212
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,480
road trips you know.

1213
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,480
It's very important.

1214
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,480
Yeah.

1215
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,080
So that brings us well at least towards the end of this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

1216
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:50,720
I'm really I'm really actually pretty happy.

1217
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:57,080
We had a really good turnout for what is sort of universally known in like the news business

1218
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:04,560
as the slowest weeks of like this starting you know a couple of weeks ago till now is

1219
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,600
like in the US like our Congress goes on vacation like the news people go on vacation Anderson

1220
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,120
Cooper goes on vacation.

1221
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,520
Yes even Anderson Cooper goes on vacation.

1222
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,920
Oh my gosh it's Anderson Cooper everybody.

1223
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,160
Megyn Kelly goes on vacation but not the mumble room.

1224
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,520
The mumble room still showed up and I was a troopers.

1225
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,520
You guys really are.

1226
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,520
I hope you will show up next week.

1227
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:28,840
I have no idea what my connection is going to be like but it'll be fun guys.

1228
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,840
Yeah I'll also be remote.

1229
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:34,400
I'll be remote with you but if all goes as planned my audio is going to be recorded locally

1230
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,920
ham radio will be slapping it all together delivering to Rekai for video production and

1231
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,480
hopefully it'll still sound pretty good even though I'm on the road.

1232
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,480
That's the goal.

1233
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:44,560
The live show you'll hear me on the remote connection but in the downloaded version I

1234
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,880
should sound pretty good.

1235
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,880
That is the intention at least.

1236
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,880
We'll see how that goes.

1237
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,920
You'll find out episode 100 and 11.

1238
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,640
Join us on Sunday's episode of the Linux action show.

1239
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm going to take this topic of enjoying online life while you're offline and I'm going to

1240
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,160
zoom into an open source project that needs way more attention.

1241
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:05,040
Wes turned me on to it a few weeks ago and I think a lot of people are going to be talking

1242
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,040
about it after we talk about it.

1243
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,120
I think there's already some people in the IRC I've seen using it.

1244
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,640
Don't spoil it dude but I'm really excited and Noah and I have been using it for a little

1245
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,080
bit so that way we can give you our impressions on it after a couple of weeks of marinating.

1246
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,000
So it fits in so perfect with our topic today.

1247
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,040
So if this at all it was an interest to you and you want to deep dive into something check

1248
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,520
out Sunday's episode.

1249
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,280
Actually I keep saying Sunday but I think we're recording on Friday that way we can

1250
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,800
record while I'm still in town.

1251
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,760
So we'll be live on Friday for the Linux action show for release on Sunday for download.

1252
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,720
All right well that right there will bring us to the end of this week's episode of Linux

1253
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,720
Unplugged.

1254
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,440
We should be live next week at our regular time.

1255
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:45,040
Go over to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

1256
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,920
If you want to suggest an offline open source project linuxactionshow.reddit.com look for

1257
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:55,920
the 110 feedback thread or you can email us at jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact.

1258
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,760
I got a magical drop down right there.

1259
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:58,760
It's incredible.

1260
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,760
It's great.

1261
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,840
Also don't forget jupitabroadcasting.com slash rover to follow the road trip as it's live

1262
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:08,800
and rover at jupitabroadcasting.com to email anything about the road trip.

1263
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,120
All right Wes well I will talk to you from afar next week.

1264
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,120
Oh this will be fun.

1265
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,120
All right everybody.

1266
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:15,720
Well thanks for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged and we'll see you right

1267
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:44,560
back here next week.

1268
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:57,800
Well look at that.

1269
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,840
Wimpy says he knows one of the guys that works at Datto.

1270
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:00,840
Really Wimpy?

1271
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,840
That's interesting.

1272
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,840
Tell me more about that.

1273
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:06,680
Well I didn't realize until I started looking through the github.

1274
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:13,900
His name's Dan Fury and he did some work in Arch a little while ago and I took on some

1275
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,320
packages that he'd been maintaining in the AUR.

1276
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:23,280
He'd been doing some work on Compiz and I just thought hang on a minute that username

1277
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,280
looks familiar.

1278
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,280
That's great.

1279
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:34,360
He's the guy pushing the source and in the same github account they've got a PDF which

1280
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,600
goes into some detail about how this all works.

1281
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,600
Very cool.

1282
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,280
Nice spot.

1283
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,600
It's the basis of a commercial product, dattobackup.com.

1284
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,600
Interesting.

1285
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:53,600
So although the code has only landed in github about a month ago this appears to be battle

1286
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,600
tested.

1287
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,600
It's proven in production.

1288
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,600
I heard about it.

1289
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:57,600
I was emailed in.

1290
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:02,000
Somebody said I've been using this for a little bit and I thought okay well that's interesting.

1291
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Let's take a look at it.

1292
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,320
Datto.com is products built around this solution.

1293
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,320
Fascinating.

1294
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,160
Look at that.

1295
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,360
So yeah that's nice that it has a commercial back and it's battle tested.

1296
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,760
JBtitles.com also last chance to vote on the roadshow name.

1297
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:23,240
Right now Last Cribs Roadshow is currently winning with 42% of the votes.

1298
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,180
Finding Linux coming up number two.

1299
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,560
On titles we have Linux Unhitched and Last Cribs Trip.

1300
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,760
I don't know.

1301
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,220
Keeping Linux online.

1302
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,220
Going offline.

1303
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:35,720
No place like slash home.

1304
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,720
Classic.

1305
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,000
No place like slash home.

1306
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
That's true.

1307
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,640
That's not bad.

1308
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,920
Feel like we could do something more around the going offline thing.

1309
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,280
Yes.

1310
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,280
So what do you think?

1311
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,480
JBtitles.com.

1312
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,720
Last chance to vote.

1313
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:50,720
Anything grabbing you there Wes?

1314
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,440
Do you like any of those in particular?

1315
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,480
Well let me take a look.

1316
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,640
Yeah take a look.

1317
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,640
So that's...

1318
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:57,640
Is that Datto?

1319
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:58,640
That was a big NAS they had there?

1320
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,640
That's interesting.

1321
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,240
I wonder if they sell it to NAS creators.

1322
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,240
Yeah.

1323
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:10,360
They've got some cloud to cloud solutions as well.

1324
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:14,320
No place like Tilda.

1325
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,320
Keeping Linux online.

1326
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:21,240
I don't know I feel like something offline.

1327
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,340
How to download the internet.

1328
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,840
That's almost there.

1329
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,640
Going offline almost sounds like the show's ending.

1330
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,080
I don't know if I like that idea.

1331
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,040
Yeah that's weird.

1332
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,040
Linux Unhitched is close.

1333
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,160
Yeah it's close but not quite it.

1334
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:36,000
Linux Hits the Road is not quite it because that feels like that could be next week's

1335
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
episode.

1336
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Linux Unplugged disconnects.

1337
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,920
That could be next week's episode title too though.

1338
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,920
Yeah.

1339
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,480
Ah this is close.

1340
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,600
How about live offline like you're online.

1341
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,120
Is that too long?

1342
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:55,240
Is that dumb?

1343
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,360
Linux Unplugged unplugs the internet.

1344
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:06,320
Linux Unplugged gets away.

1345
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,320
This should not be this hard.

1346
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,440
This should not be this hard.

1347
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,480
Alright so hold on real quick.

1348
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,480
Let's just focus in here.

1349
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,480
We can do this.

1350
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,480
We can do this you guys.

1351
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,480
We can do this.

1352
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,480
I have faith.

1353
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,120
And the value of this is negative.

1354
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,680
Alright well there's no place like slash homes not bad but that could break the internet

1355
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,680
too.

1356
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:27,840
Ah let's see.

1357
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:31,800
Offline Online Solutions Offline Action Show.

1358
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,440
Offline Online Solutions kind of funny.

1359
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,120
I kind of feel like Linux 11 oh that's a little weird never mind.

1360
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:42,360
I kind of feel like maybe there's no place like slash homes the way to go.

1361
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,360
Is that awful?

1362
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,480
Oh my gosh we've got to find something.

1363
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:46,480
We've got to find something.

1364
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:53,520
What about no place like 127.0.0.1?

1365
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,120
Yeah that's not bad either.

1366
00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:03,680
Offline Online Solutions Offline Action Show Linux hits the road why is this so hard?

1367
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,240
I think that we should all make those businesses fail.

1368
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,680
Dang it RMS you're just distracting me.

1369
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,120
I'm bringing down the economy.

1370
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,080
Icarus says off the grid that's pretty good.

1371
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,440
Linux off the grid what is it?

1372
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,440
What is it?

1373
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,600
He said off the grid in the RV but I just tweaked that and make it something like I

1374
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:26,200
don't know.

1375
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,960
Linux living offline.

1376
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,680
Return of the local host I like that Shadow 7.

1377
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:36,200
Return of the local host isn't bad.

1378
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,940
Off great Linux.

1379
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:44,080
So I think Linux living offline or what was the other one?

1380
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,080
Most recent one?

1381
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,080
Yeah the one you just said.

1382
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,080
Return of the local host.

1383
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:50,920
So I think that's the return of a local host or living Linux offline.

1384
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,880
Which one do you guys like better?

1385
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,000
Wouldn't it be better if return of the local host was used when you returned and were a

1386
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,640
local host?

1387
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:03,000
Okay if we can remember.

1388
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,840
Living Linux offline.

1389
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:05,840
Living Linux offline.

1390
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:06,840
Is that good?

1391
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:07,840
What do you think of that?

1392
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,840
You don't like it?

1393
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,840
It's okay.

1394
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,840
Okay.

1395
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,840
I'm not vetoing.

1396
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,640
Yeah but you're not jazzed up.

1397
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:14,640
Goes off the grid.

1398
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,640
Huh?

1399
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,640
Linux goes off the grid.

1400
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,640
Old man voice there.

1401
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,640
Huh?

1402
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,640
What'd you say?

1403
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,640
What'd you say?

1404
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,640
What was it?

1405
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,640
Come on.

1406
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,640
Come on.

1407
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,640
Come again.

1408
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,360
Uh gosh dang it you guys.

1409
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,900
Gosh dang it.

1410
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,900
Gosh dang it.

1411
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,900
This is too tough.

1412
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:33,900
All right here we go.

1413
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,900
This is it.

1414
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:35,900
This is it.

1415
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,900
This is it right here.

1416
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:37,900
No take backs.

1417
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,900
Okay.

1418
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,900
Okay.

1419
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:40,900
Okay.

1420
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:41,900
Okay.

1421
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:49,680
I kind of think return of the local host just because we probably won't remember to use

1422
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:50,680
it when I get back.

1423
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:51,680
Well probably.

1424
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,680
We are the worst so.

1425
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,680
There's a thing I could just say.

1426
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,120
I think I could remember.

1427
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,120
I don't know.

1428
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,880
I feel like I feel like if we if we hold on to it I think no I feel like we should use

1429
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:02,880
it.

1430
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,880
Google calendar.

1431
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:04,880
No it's not.

1432
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,880
It's not that much worth it.

1433
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,160
I think we are so we need a good title right now.

1434
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,360
I say we can come up with another.

1435
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,600
I have faith.

1436
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,600
Faith of the heart.

1437
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:15,800
I've got faith that we can make it up again.

1438
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,540
Surviving offline is a real goof.

1439
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,540
Is real good.

1440
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,540
Oh.

1441
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:20,540
That was real good.

1442
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:21,540
Okay.

1443
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,540
Amazing.

1444
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:23,880
The one little difference that makes.

1445
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:24,880
Thanks the anime.

1446
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:25,880
All right.

1447
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:26,880
Thanks you guys.

1448
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:49,880
We're done here.
