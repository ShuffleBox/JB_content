1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Here's a new product category, APC, you know, creators of UPSs.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,120
They're generally a little higher market priced.

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:15,440
I was looking for something to just power my modem and my firewall, and I came across

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,240
this APC Backup Connect, and it's $47 on Amazon.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,280
But here's the crazy thing, straight up, straight up, straight up, it has major, major limitations.

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,200
Like it only has two AC outlets on it.

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,960
It's designed to just be a tiny battery for lower end appliances, which was exactly what

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
I needed.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,520
But look at this, Beard.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,220
You see this, you see that battery section there?

11
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,560
That's removable.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:48,680
So the UPS battery, which has a charge indicator and two USB ports on it, slides out.

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,680
So you can actually, you can pull the battery out of the UPS and use it as a portable charger

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,440
for your devices, which is kind of neat.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,240
And you can buy a spare one.

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,240
That's true, too.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,840
Yeah, you can buy modular ones.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
Yeah, that's another nice feature.

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
Oh yeah, hot swap mode.

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
Yeah.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,840
Yeah.

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,840
Shit's busy.

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:18,000
You get a lot of messages, that sucks, and you run out of battery power right when you're

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,640
on the train looking at porn.

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,180
That's where APC's PowerGo comes in.

26
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,320
Don't forget to get the tickets and that client meeting, then grab your coffee, stop looking

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,960
at porn, grab your extra battery, because Android has horrible battery life.

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,960
What?

29
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
We can't say that?

30
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,960
Oh.

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:45,120
Thankfully, your APC portable power still runs even when you're out of power, getting

32
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,360
your most important network gadgets online.

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:57,480
Network and internet, still online even though your computer doesn't have any goddamn power.

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:03,360
Never disconnect, not even for a damn moment, with APC's portable power.

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,860
You'll never get a moment's rest, APC.

36
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:27,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 209 for August 8, 2017.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,960
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that I think is trying all of the

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
IPAs.

39
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
My name is Chris.

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,960
My name is Wes.

41
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,280
Hello, Wes, and hello, Mr. Beard.

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Beard joins us again.

43
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Good to have you guys.

44
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,360
Now, we have quite a show, quite a show.

45
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,960
So today is the conclusion of the Slackware challenge.

46
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,760
We'll be giving you my results and Wes's results after running Slackware for the week.

47
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,480
We're going to talk about Red Hat's more official plans without ButterFS.

48
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,000
The new Firefox is so damn fast, we got to talk about Firefox again.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Plus, we got a meetup to announce.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,200
Friend of the show has some new code he's pushing out there.

51
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,200
Things like GTK4 might be sooner than we expected.

52
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,320
Of course, there's a lot of community news and updates, and we're going to talk about

53
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,760
a new tool, something that is built right into your Linux.

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,760
It just needs a little wrapper, and it is some damn fine security.

55
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,760
We'll talk about it.

56
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,200
We'll talk about it coming up in a little bit.

57
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,820
And then, of course, of course, towards the end, we'll get into some also Slackware alternatives

58
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,880
that are based on Slackware, that if you want to dip your toe in the waters, but you're

59
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,280
not sure you're quite ready yet, you're not sure, you're not sure if you're ready to be

60
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,080
a full slacker, there might be a couple of options out there for you.

61
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
How about all that, right?

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
That's exciting, yeah.

63
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,360
We got a big show this week, lots of stuff, so we can't go any further without bringing

64
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,900
in that mumble room.

65
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,640
Time appropriate greetings, virtual dog.

66
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,640
Pip pip.

67
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Hello.

68
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Hello.

69
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
Hello.

70
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,640
Hello.

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
Cheerio.

72
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Good day to you.

73
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Man, Pippi is Pippi.

74
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,160
Pippi with the pip pip is on the money, like, you know, latency be damned.

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,760
He is primed and ready to go.

76
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,320
It's always nice to see all of you guys in there.

77
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
Impressive.

78
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
Yeah.

79
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
Hello, everybody.

80
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Thank you guys for joining us.

81
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,760
So this is our Slackware episode.

82
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,800
After all of the years, literally 20 of them plus, me skirting around ever trying out Slackware,

83
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,880
it finally happened.

84
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
It's a milestone.

85
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,240
Mostly thanks to you bastards, really, for calling me out of that episode where I wasn't

86
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
here.

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,400
And so I figured I had to try.

88
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
It's all right.

89
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,880
I'm just talking up the next distro.

90
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,360
Oh, I like this.

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,560
Oh, you guys.

92
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
So I thought before we go any further, we got to start this episode with some proper

93
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:44,680
hate and cover one central repository for all of your anti-System D needs from distros

94
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,720
to articles.

95
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,900
That's right, everybody, without-systemd.org, a Wiki for all your resources on life without

96
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,280
System D. And of course, the most poignant arguments against System D, like the fact

97
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:07,000
that it has broken promises, it's a bit immature, it has scope creep, it has absurd bugs, it

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,100
has poor design, and it's ignorance of fundamental operating system concepts.

99
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,400
None of those are opinions, of course.

100
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
None of those.

101
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,160
I'm surprised they don't have the Leonard dictatorship on there.

102
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Yeah.

103
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,640
Well, I think that might be implied with the poor design and ignorance, like that's sort

104
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,120
of poking at Leonard, isn't it?

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,120
It's a little bit, ouch.

106
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Yeah.

107
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,280
So then they have a bunch of external links to like modern init system designs, all of

108
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:39,320
the GNU slash Linux distributions that run without System D. And good god, good god.

109
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,960
Now, some of these might be running without System D simply because they haven't been

110
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,720
updated since System D was announced.

111
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,160
But some of these are...

112
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,960
Yeah, what stands out to you?

113
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Well, Slackware.

114
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Mm-hmm.

115
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,640
Slackware definitely stands out to me as one that, you know, I mean, everybody knew it.

116
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,400
Of course, Gentoo's still on the list.

117
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,460
Everybody knows that one too.

118
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,280
Other than that, ArchBang, I guess ArchBang was the other one that kind of surprised me,

119
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,560
and Chromium OS, which is still rocking upstart.

120
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,960
Still rocking upstart lives on.

121
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,960
That's too bad for them.

122
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Wow.

123
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Wow.

124
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,120
Why you gotta be so judgy?

125
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,080
Maybe it works great for them, Wes.

126
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,200
Maybe it's a real good, solid piece of code for them.

127
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,480
Well, when you don't have to run any local software, you probably don't need System D.

128
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Yeah, maybe so.

129
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,000
Chromium OS is based on Gentoo anyway, so.

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yeah.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah, that's right.

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,040
And they also cover some of the BSDs, which would be, surprise, surprise, all of them.

133
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,800
I like that they have like a set, as if there's BSDs that do use System D.

134
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,640
No one's managed to port System D over just to bother people yet?

135
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,120
No, they're still working on their own replacement.

136
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Because that seems like the ultimate troll activity.

137
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
System BSD.

138
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Give them time.

139
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
Give them time.

140
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
It'll come.

141
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
It will come.

142
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,560
So I just thought that'd be a good way to start our Slackware episode out with the definitive

143
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,100
resource on System D. I like their logo too.

144
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,280
It's real innovative.

145
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:57,080
They've taken System D, and maybe my favorite thing about it, and I wouldn't normally call

146
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,000
this criticism out because, you know, who am I to say, but when you look at their logo

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,320
there, see if I can, can I zoom in a little bit?

148
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Yeah, there we go.

149
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Boom.

150
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,320
Look at that.

151
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
I have action zooming right here.

152
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
Zoomed and enhanced.

153
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,360
I like the circle around the circle.

154
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,880
Yeah, there is the circle around the circle.

155
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,360
They obviously just took a circle and a line clip art and they grabbed it from somewhere

156
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,680
else because you can see like it's been cut out.

157
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,880
Did something else jump out at you about their logo that maybe is a little incorrect?

158
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,000
The S is capitalized.

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's right.

160
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,680
Now, I normally wouldn't mention this, but if your entire purpose as a project or a site

161
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,600
is to be so super informed on System D that you are trying to educate the world not to

162
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:45,400
use it because you know more than they do, wouldn't you know how to write it?

163
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,000
Too busy hating it.

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,360
Is that a dumb thing to like, but that just really weirds me out, the fact that they're

165
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,080
so obsessed with this, but yet they can't get that detail right.

166
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,920
Depending on how they did it, if that no symbol is an image and the System D under is text,

167
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,600
the Wiki might've auto-capitalized it.

168
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
No, it's all image.

169
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,880
It's all one image.

170
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
It's a little JPEG.

171
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,840
Maybe they're doing it as like a, you know, as like a slam.

172
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
Yeah.

173
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,840
Cause you know what?

174
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
They do it throughout the, well, they don't do it.

175
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,660
So they do it in any of the title sections.

176
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,660
That's where they do it.

177
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
There too.

178
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,660
See, that's why I said it might be the Wiki.

179
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,660
That's probably automated.

180
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,660
Yeah, that part would be.

181
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,660
Yeah.

182
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,660
Yeah.

183
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,280
I think we mentioned the blink tag also, cause that's fun.

184
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
That is good.

185
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
Although it's not blinking.

186
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
Yeah.

187
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,280
Cause it doesn't really work anymore.

188
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,200
No, but they do have a blink tag up at the top, which is solid on the top of a Wiki page.

189
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,400
Kind of fitting in a way.

190
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,240
Last week there was a story that we weren't really going to talk about, but like it kept

191
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,400
coming up in the chat room.

192
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
So we ended up talking about it.

193
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
You remember the ButterFS story?

194
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,400
Oh yeah.

195
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Yeah.

196
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,320
It was announced last week that Red Hat is officially deprecating, I guess Red Hat and

197
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,760
Red Hat is officially deprecating ButterFS and Red Hat has clarified their position on

198
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,480
that since the last episode.

199
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,640
Michael over at Ferronix is writing that it is going to be deprecated in all future versions

200
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

201
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,720
And so you might be wondering, what are they going to do in its place?

202
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,960
Red Hat says, no, we're not looking at ZFS.

203
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,740
They say, yeah, people probably want ZFS, but that's not something that we're going

204
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
to do.

205
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,740
And I don't really know.

206
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:16,120
I wish they could really come out and really just sort of simply iterate, or not iterate,

207
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:21,200
but simply outline, I suppose, on what the blockers are for ZFS because it just would

208
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,400
clear people's minds up on the subject.

209
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
It's got to be the lizenings.

210
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
Oh yeah, clearly.

211
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
The doors.

212
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Clearly.

213
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,240
But it would be really interesting to know why one company believes that it's not a problem

214
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
and the other company does.

215
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,120
I would just love to know the answer behind that.

216
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,400
I love feeling Red Hat's just being conservative.

217
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,200
Yeah, or maybe they have to follow different rules because they're predominantly a U.S.-based

218
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
company.

219
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
Something like that.

220
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,840
And maybe they haven't seen a real ask from their clients.

221
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
I don't know.

222
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
I doubt that.

223
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,840
See, that's where I...

224
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,380
See, because I think a lot of the enterprise people who haven't dabbled in the enlightened

225
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,600
parts of the file system world, they have SANS and other technologies they're already

226
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,600
using.

227
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Yeah, and they don't care.

228
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,040
So I see a lot of benefits for even just root file systems, or any time you need snapshots,

229
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
et cetera.

230
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,800
But I'm not sure that that's a really large opinion in old school enterprise Linux.

231
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,680
One of the things that sort of informs my opinion on the back end is just watching the

232
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:15,640
sales explosion for IX systems for all of their ZFS-based storage appliances.

233
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,820
People are coming to them and saying, build me this around ZFS.

234
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:23,800
They have people coming to their doors because IX is a go-to ZFS company.

235
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
So I don't know.

236
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,600
It probably depends on the market, right?

237
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,520
Depends on the... Yeah, because I bet you what you outlined is probably really true

238
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,320
as well.

239
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
It's interesting regardless.

240
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
You're right.

241
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,360
It's interesting to have a little more clarification on what they've reached here.

242
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,480
But Red Hat may have another solution in the works.

243
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,280
It's something they've been working on for a little while.

244
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,440
You may be familiar with it.

245
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,320
We covered it briefly on Linux Action News Episode 13 on Sunday.

246
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
It's called Stratus.

247
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:57,320
And it's a overall umbrella project for combining different built-in storage solutions in Linux

248
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:04,160
already, like LVM, and RAID management, and copy-on-write capabilities, and excellent

249
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
compression utilities.

250
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:12,440
In fact, they just made a software purchase where their core focus is compression on SSD.

251
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,760
And Stratus initially plans to use Device Mapper and the XFS system to bring a layered

252
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,920
approach to taking these tools that already exist on Linux that essentially achieve what

253
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,520
ZFS does, and put them in sort of a stacked system where you extend existing tools instead

254
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,000
of creating entirely new stuff whole cloth.

255
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,520
You use the XFS file system, which I think is one of the best file systems on any operating

256
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:46,400
system on the planet today, and you take a customer-driven sort of demand.

257
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,560
What Red Hat seems to have outlined is we have a lot of customers coming to us that

258
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,480
have super-fast SSD storage, they have super-fast CPUs, and they have a shit-ton of containers.

259
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,040
And they want to compress those containers on disk, they want to read the compressed

260
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,720
version of the container, have their super-crazy-fast CPU decompress it crazy-fast, and execute

261
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,880
the code.

262
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,880
And that's one of the things that ZFS is really good at.

263
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,760
But if you think about it, ZFS is a bit of a bastard, and Alan Jude's not going to like

264
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,480
me saying this, but in a way, it does something that nothing else out there does that we really

265
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,700
never talk about.

266
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,920
And it's the fact that it is a layer-violating monster.

267
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,360
It takes all of these tools that used to be at different parts of the OS stack and smashes

268
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,440
it all down to the file system layer.

269
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,660
Not necessarily a bad idea, because then you have some cohesiveness between the tools,

270
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,520
but it's also a little untried.

271
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,520
So I like this idea of taking existing, known-good, production-ready tools already in Linux and

272
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,660
stacking it on top of XFS.

273
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,280
That's what Stratus is, and it's going to do copy-on-write, it's going to do compression,

274
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,560
it's going to do encryption, it's going to do device mapper management, all that volume

275
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:55,520
management stuff, snapshots, all that stuff, and it's going to be a sort of whole project

276
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,520
solution replacement to ButterFS.

277
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:06,240
I'll be the hater in this case, because I feel like the exact thing you don't want in

278
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,520
a file system is a bunch of utilities being developed independently of each other that

279
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
you're smashing together.

280
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,520
Yeah.

281
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,120
So if a Stratus project could come in and sort of work cross-project to sort of unify

282
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,120
it, that could work.

283
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,320
Yeah, assuming that all the projects are happy to work with each other.

284
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,800
Yeah, that's true.

285
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,040
But Unix philosophy and such.

286
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Yeah.

287
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,840
Yeah, I also think it's very possible that it could be excessively complex.

288
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,920
This could be way too complex, and so it may not be very approachable.

289
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,000
It raises the floor of the potential issues that you could have, because you're working

290
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,600
with a bunch of independent components.

291
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,960
So every place that you have separate components talking to each other is a potential breakage

292
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
point.

293
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Yeah.

294
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Okay, now I'm on your side, because I'm going to also...

295
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,760
Well, that's true, but I don't think it's going to be a huge number of projects in this

296
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,760
case.

297
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:03,280
And some of them, like XFS, still, but do you want even one in your file system?

298
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,160
Because here's an example where I think it makes a difference.

299
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:12,720
So one of the nice things about ZFS is you could have an array of ZFS drives in a Linux

300
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,800
box, and the host ZFS box totally dies.

301
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,000
You could take that array, attach it to a BSD machine, an Ubuntu machine, an Arch machine,

302
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,240
anything that has ZFS support, and that all comes right back up online, and you have access

303
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,240
to the data.

304
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,560
And one of the things that makes that possible is the ZFS feature flag.

305
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,580
So when they build ZFS, they say, these are the features of this version of ZFS.

306
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,400
It's like a stable API.

307
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:39,160
So the client utilities know what to expect from that version of ZFS.

308
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,000
So even if I take something I created on Ubuntu 16.04, which might be an older version of

309
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,880
ZFS than what I'm using on an Arch rolling box today, it's still going to work just fine.

310
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,760
Because the feature flag setup, it was designed with this very eventuality in mind.

311
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,240
I don't know if you're going to get that same cohesiveness from an array of projects, like

312
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
in Project Stratus, because...

313
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,640
I think you could add that on the top.

314
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,200
You could, but what happens if you move from, say, a Red Hat Enterprise 8 box, and you attach

315
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,960
it to a Red Hat Enterprise 10 box?

316
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,680
I mean, the tool differences, the tools in Project Stratus...

317
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
You're right, you would then have to...

318
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,680
It could be hugely different.

319
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
...have to have support for those.

320
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,480
So either Stratus would implement the conversion between them, or you'd have to rely on the

321
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
underlying tools.

322
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,600
And I don't know anything about the architecture of Stratus, so I don't know which way how

323
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,600
that might play out.

324
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Yeah, that's right.

325
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,600
You're right.

326
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,120
And since it is like LVM and XFS, it's pretty solid, pretty tried and true, not very fast

327
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
moving.

328
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
It could go that way, I guess.

329
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,760
I just don't know enough yet to preclude that as a...

330
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,600
But that kind of points something out.

331
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:44,320
If you have to account for migrations, then you're going to have to account for different

332
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:51,720
mixing variants of the tool sets underneath it for each migration, which seems super complicated.

333
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,400
Especially if different distros go in different directions with it, like they take Stratus

334
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
and they...

335
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,720
Monkey Comm, what do you think?

336
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:04,760
Have you actually seen that happen in the wild where you can take a ZFS array and move

337
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,000
it to a different operating system and just have it recognize everything?

338
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I have moved a ZFS array from one version of an older FreeNAS to a newer version of

339
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
FreeNAS.

340
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,680
I definitely have done that myself, but I don't know if I've done one from FreeNAS to

341
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Ubuntu.

342
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,460
But as long as the major ZFS versions are the same, as long as the on-desk format and

343
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,640
feature sets are the...

344
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,240
I think the other thing to think about here is, I wonder, how many of these projects does

345
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,200
Red Hat already employ people to work on?

346
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,920
Because that would be perhaps a large factor, too.

347
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,200
Do they feel they already have a significant stake or control where they have confidence

348
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,360
in the direction of the projects?

349
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,720
I don't know.

350
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,000
This is interesting, though.

351
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,120
It really is like a giving up on ButterFS.

352
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
It really is.

353
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,500
We weren't totally sure when we were talking about this last week, but it's absolutely

354
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,860
Red Hat saying...

355
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,860
What about SUSE?

356
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:49,860
Yeah.

357
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,860
I don't know.

358
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,860
What about SUSE?

359
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
Did we talk about that last week?

360
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,860
Where does that leave SUSE?

361
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,860
No, I don't think so.

362
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,880
Well, I would say look back to see what they did with RiserFS.

363
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,040
How long until the rest of the community moved on from RiserFS did it take them to go to

364
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,280
something else?

365
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,280
And that might be your answer.

366
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,520
They seem to like to stick around.

367
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,220
Plus, they've really built a lot of pretty nice tools on top of ButterFS.

368
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,220
So if I were them...

369
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,080
It would be neat to see some of those ported right over to ZFS, and then I would use...

370
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,080
I mean, the tools are kind of neat.

371
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
Yeah.

372
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Yeah, yeah.

373
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,800
Do they use ButterFS for a default file system?

374
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Yeah.

375
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,240
ButterFS is default, and the package manager can take snapshots using ButterFS.

376
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,560
There's some new other tools they're working on.

377
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,600
Don't they have some boot environment similar stuff as well?

378
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,600
Yeah.

379
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,160
There's some other tools they're working on they're using ButterFS as well.

380
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,400
And maybe they'll just keep plugging away at it and keep making it better.

381
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,840
It's not like they can't just keep...

382
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Right.

383
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
Yeah.

384
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,840
You know what's kind of funny?

385
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,560
If Canonical did this, people would lose their minds.

386
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,240
But when Red Hat does it, people are not doing the not invented here thing.

387
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,560
Well, it's because nobody thinks it's going to be adopted outside of Red Hat.

388
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,560
I mean...

389
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,120
Well, people said that about SystemD.

390
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Yeah.

391
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
Yeah.

392
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,880
It's all up on GitHub right now if you want to check it out.

393
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,560
There's also, let's see, stratus-storage.github.io.

394
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,680
Yeah.

395
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
And I think one of the things...

396
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
It's hard to find.

397
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
They don't advertise it, but it's...

398
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
No.

399
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
There's not a lot of talk about this.

400
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
No.

401
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
We should probably get somebody on the show to talk about this.

402
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
That's a good idea.

403
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
That would be the thing.

404
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,440
Because I think one of the reasons it's not getting a ton of attention is because it's

405
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,200
just improving existing tools.

406
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,640
It's not like some radical rebirth of a brand new way of doing things.

407
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
Well, that, and it's also enterprise focused.

408
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,560
Yeah, I suppose so, yeah.

409
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,200
There is a big radical update today, though.

410
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,160
I just installed it today, just a few hours before the show.

411
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,760
Firefox 55.

412
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,160
Holy crap, guys.

413
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,000
I was like, okay, we're probably gonna stop talking about Firefox for a little bit.

414
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,480
We've been talking a lot about Firefox.

415
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
No.

416
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Holy crap.

417
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,200
Firefox 55 is legit.

418
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,800
Initial features also besides the new fancy rendering that is crazy fast and the...

419
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,960
I haven't used the new dark minimal theme, but man is it great.

420
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,400
Web VR, I think, is also landing on the Windows version.

421
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
Oh.

422
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,400
That doesn't help me.

423
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
No.

424
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,400
In fact, they have a little promo video.

425
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,720
Let's check this quick little video out, really.

426
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,680
Oh, yeah.

427
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:00,400
So she's painting, and of course, there's sort of like Kickstarter music playing in

428
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
the background.

429
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
It's like, I don't know what else to call that.

430
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,400
I'd buy that painting.

431
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,720
A Steve Jobs looking guy sits down, and now they're talking silently.

432
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,400
No, she just walked right away.

433
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Yeah.

434
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
I wonder if you could turn that into VR.

435
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Don't look at her.

436
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
That's private.

437
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,480
No more stupid painting in real life.

438
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,600
Now you can paint in VR.

439
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,400
And so the web VR is actually a technology that Noah and I saw demoed a couple of years

440
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,160
ago at OSCON running under Linux.

441
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,560
So I thought it was kind of odd that it's actually not shipping on the Linux version

442
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,320
of Firefox 55.

443
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,640
But holy smokes.

444
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,960
First of all, it seems like to me that every single web page I could throw at it loads

445
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
faster.

446
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Let's do a little live test.

447
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,360
Give me a complicated website.

448
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,280
I got Firefox loaded up right here, 55 on my machine, using their new minimal dark theme,

449
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,440
which is slick.

450
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,160
How about the Amazon front page?

451
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Amazon.com?

452
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
All right.

453
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
You can download it anywhere in this browser.

454
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,160
It's Amazon.com.

455
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
It looks nice.

456
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,160
Can I just say?

457
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,160
Yeah.

458
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
And boom.

459
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Amazon.com is loaded.

460
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,160
That was fast.

461
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
That was suspiciously fast.

462
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Yeah, it's nice.

463
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
It's nice.

464
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
What's another complex?

465
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,160
Twitch, maybe?

466
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,160
Twitch?

467
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
OK.

468
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Twitch.

469
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Is it twitch.tv, right?

470
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Twitch.tv.

471
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
And it's loading.

472
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Pow.

473
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,400
And also one of the things they've done is Flash is click to start now by default.

474
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Is that right?

475
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Yes, finally.

476
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,000
And this is also, I think, the one where electrolysis is turned on for everyone.

477
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,040
Do you know if that's right, Michael?

478
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,600
No, 54 is when it came on for everyone.

479
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
And then it's in 50.

480
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Well, when it came in stable.

481
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
OK.

482
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,080
And then it's not on for everyone, but whatever.

483
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,560
58 is the one where...

484
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
57.

485
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,840
57 is the one where the traditional plugins go away, the traditional extensions.

486
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,200
Yeah, 57 web extensions only.

487
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,440
I mean, this is really good.

488
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,440
This is...

489
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,520
I know you've been saying this, but this is really good.

490
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,280
This is really fast.

491
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Really good.

492
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,520
I'm very excited for Firefox and where they're going.

493
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,440
I am a little worried that when they kill off extensions, it's going to be super challenging

494
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,240
for Firefox.

495
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,000
I was looking at some of the extensions I use and I don't even think more than one or

496
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,800
two of them have been updated, including I think even last...

497
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,720
There's actually a website that lists what's being changed.

498
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,760
It's a really absurd link URL, so I can't remember what it is, but it's on the Mozilla

499
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,400
site, they have a web extensions port thing, and there's a lot of things that are being

500
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,720
ported that haven't finished being ported, but they are still being in the works, and

501
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,520
they should be done by the 57 release at the very latest.

502
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,120
Some of them will be 58.

503
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,800
But there's a lot of extensions that are also just being destroyed, unfortunately, because

504
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
there's one thing I use.

505
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,560
The tab groups extension was just abandoned like six months ago.

506
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,760
I remember that, I use it as well.

507
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:47,040
The guy was like, well, I'd have to rewrite the whole thing and I don't want to, so sorry.

508
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,080
Joey over at OMG Ubuntu also points out that you'll find a new performance section under

509
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,220
preferences general, where you can choose to use recommended performance setting or

510
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,040
you could dive in and manually enable or disable hardware acceleration, which is probably going

511
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,840
to be dependent on what your distro supports.

512
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:10,160
And you can set a multi-promise, I'm sorry, a multi-promise, a multi-process content limit.

513
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
That's really interesting.

514
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Mm-hmm.

515
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,320
One of my favorite things about this, it used to be we had to go into about config in order

516
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
to do this.

517
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,320
Yeah.

518
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,660
The new feature is making it a lot easier, but you can have it where by default there's

519
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,200
four processes in the electrolysis structure, but you can make it as many as you want.

520
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
Holy crap.

521
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
I'm turning that up.

522
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Yeah.

523
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Oh, wow.

524
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,120
I'm turning that up to a six.

525
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,000
So Chris, how does this, does this change any of your feelings about Firefox?

526
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yep.

527
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,600
Because I think there's been kind of two problems, right?

528
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:45,080
There's been technical criticisms as well as more cultural societal criticisms.

529
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,720
Well, I feel like I'm not alone.

530
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,700
Maybe I'm hopping on a bandwagon I didn't realize, but I feel like there is a lot of

531
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,160
underdog type coverage for Firefox right now.

532
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:03,800
CNET just ran a piece called Firefox Fights Back with like intense artwork and just like

533
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,840
a... Is this some sort of browser wars video game

534
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
I can play?

535
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Right, right.

536
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,840
It's a super stylized piece from CNET about Firefox 57 that's going to be out in November.

537
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,200
This was a logo that was, this was a design art thing that someone made, that the event

538
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,400
made to announce the 57 thing.

539
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Yeah.

540
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
It's cool.

541
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
This was like a couple months ago they made that.

542
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,000
I was kind of thinking it was something like that.

543
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,200
And so I noticed a general turning in the opinion about Firefox, but for myself what

544
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,120
really has really sort of... Of course I've been watching them persistently improve Firefox

545
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,300
for a while now, so that plays a role as well, but for me it's really Chrome has started

546
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,600
to exhibit issues that I had in Firefox that made me switch to Chrome and that is that

547
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,600
my extensions, I uninstall an extension to sort of like slim down my Chrome install and

548
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,640
then over time depending on what computer I sit down at or something my extensions get

549
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,860
re-added back and then I have way more extensions than I ever had and then of course there's

550
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,520
like only two or three extensions I really need and one of them is crashing constantly

551
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,420
on the computer here on the live stream.

552
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,600
So I've just really kind of been in a tough spot with Chrome.

553
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:16,220
Plus I'm getting increasingly more uncomfortable with Google all the time and the power that

554
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,680
they're using, the power that Chrome is giving them.

555
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,440
So I've just been kind of curious where Firefox is going and man if they aren't really there

556
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,480
now like you can... I feel like with 55 if you've sort of been sitting back and just

557
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,280
sort of watching from a distance using Chrome in this meantime, I feel like with 55 you

558
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,960
really feel it.

559
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,980
It's like the release where it really hits you and you're like, okay dang.

560
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,580
It's about three times faster.

561
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,400
It's very noticeably faster than 54.

562
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,400
That is pretty great.

563
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,760
What platform did you try it on Chris?

564
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,240
I was... Well it's on this machine here which is under Arch.

565
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,680
They're both Arch boxes.

566
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,520
I haven't tried it much else because I was just trying it before the show today.

567
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:00,400
But on the system upstairs and on this system which are identical in spec, it's just super

568
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
fast.

569
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
No real extensions.

570
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
I installed Privacy Badger and that was it.

571
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,880
That was my only extension I installed because I didn't want to break electrolysis and I

572
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,480
wasn't sure where that line is or not.

573
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
There may be in it.

574
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,280
There's a testing ability.

575
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,560
You can actually test to see if an extension is breaking it by running an experimental

576
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,400
thing inside of Firefox.

577
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,520
Did you see... Did you have Firefox installed there on your Slackware install, Wes?

578
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Oh no.

579
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,240
I guess it came with it but an older version.

580
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Yeah.

581
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
It's 24.

582
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Oh.

583
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
ESR.

584
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
It's Firefox 24.

585
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Yeah.

586
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Woo.

587
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,240
I got Chrome installed now though so it's fine.

588
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,240
Okay.

589
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Well we'll talk about that.

590
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,240
But yeah.

591
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:43,340
So there was during the week running on a Firefox 24 and then I go over to the Arch

592
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,600
machine and I'm running on Firefox 25.

593
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,600
It was pretty funny.

594
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
It was like, oh.

595
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,600
Well.

596
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,900
It's only an installation away, Chris.

597
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,360
It is the ESR release out of all fairness.

598
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,360
Right.

599
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
It is an ESR.

600
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,560
I saw also... I saw Firefox like...

601
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,000
It's a very old ESR.

602
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,480
I saw like 52 or 42 also available for Slackware somewhere in the... So there's a more modern

603
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,480
version available as well.

604
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
52 is an ESR as well.

605
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
Yeah.

606
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,480
Yeah.

607
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,320
But you know, 24 ESR is definitely not maintained by Mozilla anymore.

608
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,680
No.

609
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,620
There is some cool things like the page shot that's coming in or it was a screenshot basically

610
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,060
but it's in 55 now.

611
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:26,200
And also the... As far as people like getting weary of Google and wanting to get excited

612
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,960
about Mozilla's work, the common voice integration they're doing with the new voice system and

613
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
the...

614
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Voice search.

615
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,960
Yeah.

616
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,960
Yeah.

617
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
The voice search.

618
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,320
But also the Mozilla SEND structure, the SEND 2 is an open source feature so you can actually

619
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,280
like run your own instance if you want to.

620
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:51,640
So instead of having like multiple products that are somewhat related, they're just focusing

621
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:59,320
now on different features and stuff to have a cohesive community approach of a good suite

622
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
for a browser.

623
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,320
Yeah.

624
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
Yeah.

625
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
I think SEND's an interesting project.

626
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
I'm really glad that it's available for self-hosting too.

627
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,640
I think that's sort of its killer feature.

628
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,480
I've been following them more and more for Linux Action News and I like what I see.

629
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,000
I think some things though still make me scratch my head to be honest.

630
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,820
I try to stay mostly positive about the Mozilla Foundation but there are some things they

631
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,120
get into, I'm like, what a waste of time and money.

632
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,120
But for their core thing, Firefox, this is the best Firefox I've ever seen.

633
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,040
I would definitely say it's worth the upgrade to 55, definitely.

634
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
And 57 is already coming in November.

635
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Ooh.

636
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
That's exciting.

637
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,040
Yeah.

638
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,080
Also, little side note, get a little more of a producer Michael there.

639
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,680
He was on the most recent episode of Late Night Linux as one of their co-hosts.

640
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
He did a great job.

641
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
Good work on that, Michael.

642
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,680
That's awesome.

643
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
Yeah.

644
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,600
And check out Late Night, or I'm sorry, you can also check out Joe on Linux Action News,

645
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,280
which I've now mentioned several times.

646
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,720
But it's because we've been covering all of this on there.

647
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Yeah.

648
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,920
Anyways, more info from OMG Ubuntu, which we will have linked in the show notes.

649
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,320
And I think I'm going to, I'm not saying I'm making a big switch, I'm not making a big

650
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,800
deal out of it.

651
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,200
I'm just going to use it more.

652
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,520
I'm just going to start using it more for more stuff.

653
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,520
And then 57 switch.

654
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
Makes sense.

655
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Maybe.

656
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Maybe.

657
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,920
I mean, I'm just going to, basically I'm just going to get spun up and running alongside

658
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,920
Chrome.

659
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,920
It'll have a place.

660
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:23,160
And then if I see if I can just make the hop over, you know, see eventually if I can't

661
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,160
get there.

662
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,160
Why do you even have to choose one over the other?

663
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,160
Why not just use both?

664
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
Right.

665
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,160
I think what would happen is one might become the primary driver, which always is the one

666
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,600
with the canonical bookmarks and all that kind of stuff and the canonical extensions.

667
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,160
And then one would become like my backup browser.

668
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,960
What you need is a cross browser bookmark syncing.

669
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,360
So they're both bookmarked.

670
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
Yeah.

671
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,040
There was something that did that for a long time.

672
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,320
My other problem is the links.

673
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,240
Like when I want it to open, like which one's my default, like a gnome extension to switch

674
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,240
your default.

675
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
That would be nice.

676
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
Right.

677
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,320
I just don't want everyone, every, I want every application to let me right click and

678
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
open in the browser.

679
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,880
A little switch in your, your task bar that, that switches between Chrome and Firefox.

680
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,600
Like a middleware for all mime types that opens up with a like, what do you want?

681
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
We're getting crazy.

682
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,600
Let's take a moment.

683
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,600
Let's calm down.

684
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Let's talk about digital ocean.

685
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Woo.

686
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Right.

687
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
I bet you could do it with their API Chris.

688
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
I bet you could.

689
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,440
They got a great API and a dashboard for days.

690
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,440
Digital ocean.com.

691
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,680
Go over there, log into that dashboard or create an account and apply our promo code

692
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,400
D O unplugged.

693
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,720
And you get a $10 credit.

694
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,680
You can spin up their $5 rig two months for free or use their hourly pricing to bang around

695
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,760
in a new open source project you're trying out.

696
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,640
You can get deployed in seconds and all of their machines from their best price to their

697
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:40,600
crazy big dogs that are monsters are all SSD based with lightning fast, 40 gigabit networks,

698
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,120
team, team account capabilities.

699
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,920
So you can work together with folks.

700
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,520
Like so, so if you got like say an ultra speed and a Jupiter broadcasting kind of situation,

701
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,200
highly available block storage so you can grow the storage on your droplet as you need

702
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,200
it.

703
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Pre-built open source applications.

704
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:58,600
You can get spun up or start with the machine from the very bare metal and you can use our

705
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,200
HTML5 console to get some fancy features.

706
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,000
And then they got boss mode where you can do monitoring and alerting, stand on top of

707
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,980
performance, receive alerts when things go down and load balancing as a service and firewall

708
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,660
at the network level so you can set rules and then they block it at the network level

709
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,680
so that crap never even hits your droplet.

710
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,440
DigitalOcean.com use our promo code D O unplugged.

711
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,440
Damn what a good service.

712
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,520
They just posted two days ago, or maybe about that, or maybe three days ago, how to install

713
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,560
WordPress with Caddy on CentOS 7.

714
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,080
So you want to get set up with Caddy and WordPress and this is a really nice way to manage WordPress

715
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,320
and you want to do it on CentOS, they got a guy.

716
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,320
Oh what?

717
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,320
What?

718
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,320
You don't want to do it on?

719
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,320
Well they got a guy for Ubuntu 6.0.4.10.

720
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,320
Oh my God, how do they do it?

721
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,320
I wanted Fedora though.

722
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,320
Just follow this.

723
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
Just follow this.

724
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Okay.

725
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,600
And they even have free BSD up there on that DigitalOcean.

726
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
Go check it out.

727
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,440
DigitalOcean.com use our promo code D O unplugged.

728
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,120
Check out that dashboard for days.

729
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,200
You just got to create that account first.

730
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
You want to know something Chris?

731
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,960
I think their dashboard sits on top of their API that everybody else uses.

732
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,960
It is an API client.

733
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,040
And I think that's why the API is so complete is because their dashboard is a client of

734
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,200
their own API, which is a pretty hip way of doing things these days.

735
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,560
You got to admit.

736
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,560
They're real pros over there.

737
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,560
They take it really seriously.

738
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,560
And it means that-

739
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,560
That's all their stuff is so good.

740
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
Yeah.

741
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,040
We use it every single live broadcast.

742
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,400
So you know it's good stuff.

743
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,400
Like we rely on it 100% here.

744
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Every day.

745
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
Yeah.

746
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,920
So DigitalOcean.com use our promo code D O unplugged after you've created your account

747
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:32,440
and a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring.

748
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
All right.

749
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,440
I'm very excited.

750
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,360
I just decided before I went on air that I'm going to do a meetup, a last minute meetup

751
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,080
in just a few days on August 21st.

752
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,800
Something amazing is happening here in the States.

753
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:49,780
On August 21st, the United States will be treated to a total solar eclipse.

754
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:54,000
One that will span the country from sea to shining sea.

755
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,760
It will be the first time that's happened in nearly 100 years.

756
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,720
So this eclipse, solar eclipse, is going to be going right over just 200 miles south of

757
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,720
Seattle.

758
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,720
Like prime right over.

759
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,480
And I'm like, OK, I got to see this.

760
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
I got to go to this.

761
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
I got to go.

762
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,200
I mean, if it's only 200 miles away, I can jump in my truck and I never seen the Corona

763
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,200
before.

764
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,200
I can make that drive in five hours.

765
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
I got to go.

766
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,200
I got to go.

767
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,320
So I've decided I am going to go on Monday the 21st down to the Oregon coast Pacific

768
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,400
Wayside Crest is where I'm going to be at, which is about an hour and change east of

769
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,840
Salem.

770
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,400
And it's just north of Lincoln City.

771
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:37,120
The sun and the moon are going to go directly over Lincoln City, like square smack dab.

772
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,800
And we're just north of Lincoln City.

773
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,400
And we're going to be on the coast, the Oregon coast, watching this eclipse over the water.

774
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,560
It's going to be amazing.

775
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,040
So I thought, you know what?

776
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,200
If anybody's in that area, this is a this is a really once in a lifetime opportunity.

777
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,060
If anybody's in that area and wants to meet up, maybe we should do it.

778
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,060
Maybe we should do it.

779
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,060
So I set up a meetup.

780
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,720
As you go to meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, I think you'll you'll see it there.

781
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,960
I also have a link in the show notes if you want to join me and Hidia.

782
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,320
So so, Chris, have you ordered any of the the special solar glasses?

783
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,120
No, but I did get an ND filter for my drone, which is the priority.

784
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,360
So what you're saying is you're going to go to Oregon to see a solar eclipse and then

785
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,120
you're going to look at a drone screen to watch it.

786
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,120
Exactly.

787
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,120
Yeah, it's HD.

788
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,360
I'm going to order you some of those glasses.

789
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,640
Yeah, I know.

790
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,480
I know it's going to be crazy, Micah.

791
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,960
It's going to be crazy.

792
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,700
Crazy amounts of people in Oregon, I would imagine.

793
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,480
I'm planning to sleep on the side of the road.

794
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,760
I'm not even going to try to book.

795
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,840
And this thing at this place that I'm having the meetup at is just like some like pull

796
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,960
off on the side of the road.

797
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,720
But it's right there on the on the water.

798
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
It's got like parking.

799
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,560
So I figured we give it a go.

800
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Is there good Wi-Fi, Chris?

801
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,840
Well, I don't know.

802
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,840
I could try to bring a Wi-Fi.

803
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,600
If there's a good Wi-Fi, you could do a J.B. Eclipse stream like they're saying.

804
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
So cool.

805
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,600
Oh, my gosh.

806
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,080
You know, if it's possible, I'd definitely consider it.

807
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,920
That way for people that don't live in the path.

808
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
That would be really cool, actually.

809
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,360
Yeah, if we have a good signal there, I'd consider it.

810
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,360
It's going to be on the coast.

811
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,280
So we're either going to have great signal or no signal.

812
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,040
So again, it's going to be Monday, August 21st.

813
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,760
The eclipse happens around 10 a.m.

814
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,040
It's going to run to about 1 p.m. for the viewing.

815
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,560
So I figure we'll just have the meetup for that.

816
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,040
It's Pacific Wayside Crest, and I have the address in the show notes as well as a link

817
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,040
to the meetup.

818
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Could be fun, right?

819
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,040
Oh, yeah.

820
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,320
Ooh, Chris, are you going to become a citizen scientist?

821
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:25,120
Do you often mix unknown chemicals together?

822
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,480
I think that's all it takes.

823
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,680
I think that's the start of Breaking Bad.

824
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,680
Right?

825
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
I'm getting confused.

826
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,680
I think that's what's in an IPA.

827
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:41,360
So I'm really excited because I'm just going to take Highway 101 down right on the gorgeous

828
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,360
coast.

829
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,000
I mean, people talk about the California coast and all that.

830
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
It's nice.

831
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,320
The Oregon coast is really a gem.

832
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,720
It's one of the gems of the United States.

833
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,400
If you ever want to come to the States and do a road trip, take the 101 coast.

834
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:58,080
The only thing you're risking, though, being on that side of the mountains, is them clouds.

835
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
Oh, yeah.

836
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,080
Rain.

837
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,680
Also, constant construction on Highway 101.

838
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,680
Yeah, right.

839
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,680
It's constant construction.

840
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,400
But we're going to come down 101, end up just south of Pacific City, just a little north

841
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,400
of Nesquen, north of Lincoln City, east of Salem.

842
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,240
And gosh, what a cool event.

843
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,200
Linux geeks hanging out, looking at an eclipse.

844
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,460
We should also just mention that we're really very lucky.

845
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,400
There's no reason that the area that the moon and the sun take up in the sky should be so

846
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
close.

847
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
Right.

848
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
But they just happen to be.

849
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,480
Well, the size difference, the location.

850
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
It's amazing.

851
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
Really, we'll get off this now.

852
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,860
But the sun is 400 times larger than the moon.

853
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,220
But it's also 400 times further away from the earth.

854
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,360
So they wound up being about the same size in our sky.

855
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,320
Just a wonderful natural chance.

856
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
It's great.

857
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
It is so great.

858
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
I have another question.

859
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:50,040
Between the sun and the moon, which one runs Windows and which one runs Linux?

860
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,880
Definitely the moon, because nothing's ever changing with the moon.

861
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,000
It's just boring and plain where the sun is constantly regenerating.

862
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,880
Is that why the moon gets bigger in the fall?

863
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,520
They install system data?

864
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
No.

865
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,440
And then the fall, it's the big, it's the fall creator's update or whatever the hell

866
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,260
Microsoft calls it.

867
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,640
So anyways, if you want to hang out with me, meetup.com slash Jupiter Broadcasting, link

868
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,640
in the show notes.

869
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
I just think that'd be really cool.

870
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,560
I'll probably do a little vlogging while I'm down there, do some drone shots.

871
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,560
You never know.

872
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,120
Could turn out crap, but could be a lot of fun.

873
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,920
I want to give shout out to a friend of the show, Michael Dominic from Koda Radio, who's

874
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:29,640
getting some love over at betanews.com this week for his new launch over at The Mad Botter,

875
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,980
which is the Alice AI bot.

876
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,980
And I love it.

877
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:38,160
It's such a great idea because it handles all these things that as humans we're horrible

878
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,920
at, like generating reports on the fly, nagging clients to pay.

879
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,920
I hate that.

880
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,680
I hate pinging your project members to get status updates.

881
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
It's really cool.

882
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,000
Great guy telling me to finish the show notes.

883
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Yeah.

884
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,120
This guy, this guy, he sees J-Bot, he takes the idea and he monetize it and he doesn't

885
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,040
even throw back me any money.

886
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,680
Well he says that Alice was born out of the challenges he faced when managing a distributed

887
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,680
team.

888
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,040
Now I actually, I grok it because we have that too to a degree and the bot can just

889
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,920
sort of smooth over a few areas.

890
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,600
So it's pretty cool to see him getting that.

891
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,320
If you're curious about it, check it out.

892
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,960
He's got a great new website, themadbotter.com, where you can look at it.

893
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,520
And also listen to last week's Coder Radio, he talks about some of the frameworks he used

894
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,000
to create this and the backend stuff.

895
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,680
It's a pretty cool project.

896
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,120
Did he say what language it was in?

897
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,120
Well it's all in the, I don't remember, but it's all in the Coder, yeah he did, but it's

898
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,280
all in the Coder Radio that we did.

899
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,360
Now let's talk about GTK4.

900
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,000
It may be here sooner than we thought.

901
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,160
Of course, Gwadek just wrapped up in Manchester and the GTK maintainers got together and started

902
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,600
talking and they got together a list of current blockers for GTK4 and the list isn't as long

903
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
as you might suspect.

904
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:51,480
I don't think we have a timeline on any of these, but they're working on a really cool

905
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,760
constraint based layout feature.

906
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,080
They have also, they're working on a finished GL renderer.

907
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,960
They are doing event cleanup, they're handling keyboard events better, they're working on

908
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,000
non fallback text rendering.

909
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,440
It's just a, it's like a few things that once these couple of like big and important, but

910
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,800
not all of that major things get wrapped up, we essentially will have GTK4 upon us.

911
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:24,360
Which is good, however I can think of a handful of places, except that aren't even caught

912
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,900
up to GTK3 yet.

913
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:29,640
So it's almost like they're getting lapped.

914
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,640
What's that Alexa?

915
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,640
She's not sure.

916
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
Alexa?

917
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
How are you feeling?

918
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,640
You good?

919
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,200
I'm doing great.

920
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Good, good.

921
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,960
Great reading season, and I love a good story.

922
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
Wow.

923
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,600
The bitch needs to shut her mouth.

924
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
Shut up.

925
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
She likes a good story, Chris.

926
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
I think it runs XFCE underneath.

927
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,040
It just doesn't have a display port.

928
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
Well she interrupted.

929
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,800
The mumble room is more behaved than the Echo.

930
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,480
Chris, maybe she just wants to learn about Linux.

931
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,480
Don't be rude.

932
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Speaking of the mumble room.

933
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
I feel fine.

934
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
I love a good story.

935
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
There you go.

936
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,640
Anybody in the mumble room have thoughts about GTK4?

937
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
Things still on GTK2?

938
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Anybody care?

939
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,360
Any fun?

940
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:11,400
I think that it's going to be an interesting thing, mainly because how many things that

941
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,380
are based on GTK are going to be just sticking to the LTS so they don't have to have this

942
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,880
massive headache.

943
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,000
Like Mate has already pretty much pointed out that they're going to do it.

944
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,800
I don't know if they made an official announcement, but there's been talks on the mailing list

945
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,320
and stuff that they're going to stay with the LTS of GTK3.

946
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,920
And how important is GTK4 other than GNOME users?

947
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,200
I'm going to bet very little.

948
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,240
Yeah, I agree.

949
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,640
So do you guys ever have a friend who shows up and just sort of drops the bomb that they

950
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:47,520
got this brand new amazing car or a huge powerful new laptop and they just try to be all sly

951
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
about it?

952
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,520
Like they want you to know, but they don't just want to come out and say, I bought something

953
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
new.

954
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,520
So they're like, oh yeah, that, yeah, I've got.

955
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,520
Could you read this?

956
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
It says BMW.

957
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,920
Chris, I already talked about my video car.

958
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,040
I know I'm just going to say it just like the video card.

959
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,360
I feel like that's what our friends over at Purism are doing today.

960
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,880
They're like, hey, go ahead and just share your input on our upcoming phone that everybody

961
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
obviously knows.

962
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,880
Wait, what?

963
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Yeah.

964
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Yeah.

965
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,120
And then like, then they say, we know your time's precious.

966
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,680
So we've made filling out the survey only a few minutes, but then the link to the surveys,

967
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,440
I think it's crossed out.

968
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,000
I don't know why it's crossed out.

969
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,480
So apparently the survey was made a year ago.

970
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Okay.

971
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,240
So apparently, apparently this is a thing that was floating around again on the web.

972
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,400
This whole phone thing, this whole, like we're going to make a phone thing.

973
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,600
I'd like to know if there's any, any smoke to this rumor or any fire to the smoke of

974
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,240
a rumor because I've seen this floating around a couple of times.

975
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,000
Are we making a phone?

976
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,720
Are we really going to do this again?

977
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,440
Are we really going to do that?

978
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,440
Is that really?

979
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,000
They, they say they're making a phone and they're using the core base bands that are

980
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,720
built into it so they can have like, I forgot what they were, what they were using to make

981
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,440
it compensate for it so that it will be, you'll use a regular distro.

982
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
Yeah.

983
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,600
It's, and it, they've been talking about it for quite a long time.

984
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
Yeah.

985
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Well, it's just been not very, yeah.

986
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
Well, yeah.

987
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,120
But I've been saying like that, that's where they, last September they were talking about,

988
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,680
you know, we're interested in it.

989
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:20,240
They officially announced they were going to do it like seven months ago, but they do

990
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,240
it, they, when they announce things, they do it and it's like, and this is the sly thing

991
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,240
that you're saying.

992
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:31,720
Like I, I talked to them in a conversation and they were like, oh, well, you know, and

993
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,800
also we're, I'll go ahead and tell you we're working on a phone.

994
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Like, oh, okay.

995
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,800
It's like, you might want to tell people that.

996
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,240
I'm really, part of me wants to sit here and mock this.

997
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,480
Like how have we not learned this lesson?

998
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Very painfully.

999
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:51,900
But then, then I also sit here and I think, well, shit, I, there's not actually like one

1000
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,560
phone that I really would like, I'm super happy with right now.

1001
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,280
There is still room to build the right phone for me.

1002
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,600
Well, my question is why are they trying to put a desktop Linux distro on a phone when

1003
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:08,960
they're not, well, they're making a custom, it's, it's distro, it's a, it's a distro,

1004
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,780
desktop distro like underneath, but it's like, it's like how blow up plasma mobile is going

1005
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,780
to be.

1006
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,780
Yeah.

1007
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,780
But that's my question.

1008
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,640
Why don't they just use something like sailfish or plasma mobile that already exists rather

1009
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,640
than trying to reinvent the wheel again?

1010
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,920
As far as, well, plasma mobile is not ready and sailfish is unreliable.

1011
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,560
So put your development effort into that because it, well, yeah, this is a hard line because

1012
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,880
I agree with that part.

1013
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:37,800
I feel like they should be focusing on the laptops, like get the laptops just solid and

1014
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,160
shipping and you know, get all that.

1015
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,200
I know they're working on all that, but like to me, it just, that's where you have maybe

1016
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,160
the most buy-in already and you know, I want a Linux, great Linux laptop.

1017
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,160
Yeah.

1018
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,960
Are you desperate for a new phone?

1019
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,520
No, but I mean, we always talk about how Ubuntu failed at the phone, but I couldn't even get

1020
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,520
one if I wanted to when they were even making them.

1021
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,520
So it's like, what I get frustrated about is when everyone says that Ubuntu failed to

1022
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,520
deliver their phone, it was the hard version.

1023
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,960
Well, doesn't that tell you that them getting into this area might not be as easy as it

1024
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
sounds?

1025
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,320
I think Ubuntu is trying to build for the carriers.

1026
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:21,920
They wanted to have that phone in Verizon stores and AT&T stores and they were going

1027
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920
head to head.

1028
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,280
If they would have just produced something that could run on the hardware that we get,

1029
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,520
then there we go.

1030
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,900
That is what Pureism is doing.

1031
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:36,480
They're talking about making one phone and the OS is specifically for that phone.

1032
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,760
I don't think that's a bad idea.

1033
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,680
I mean, that's how they solved the baseband issue.

1034
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:48,040
Poby, do you think this is worth trying still, especially maybe this type of approach?

1035
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:58,680
Having some experience in the open source-y phone area, I think it's difficult because

1036
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,760
each of the vendors took a completely different strategy.

1037
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,240
Like Mozilla took a completely different strategy with their Firefox phone than Sailfish did

1038
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,460
with theirs, than we did with ours, than Tizen do with theirs.

1039
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:20,560
The Tizen model is Samsung throw a giant bucket of money at it and that's what makes it happen.

1040
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,960
But the others chose completely different methods.

1041
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:30,280
If Pureism have a different strategy that differs from the failed strategies of Canonicals

1042
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:34,560
and Mozilla's, then maybe they have something.

1043
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,100
I'm not quite sure what that strategy would be that would be successful, but good luck

1044
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,100
to them.

1045
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:43,140
I do wonder if there is some room for low-volume handset manufacturers to do something that's

1046
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,640
different than the rest of the market.

1047
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,440
Minimac, isn't there a bigger problem though here?

1048
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:51,160
It's the ecosystem, the apps, the whole ecosystem.

1049
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,200
It's again another operating system with the application gap problem.

1050
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,780
See Ubuntu Touch had the good idea that they tried to do some web pages, use some web pages

1051
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:10,160
into apps with that, that would have been a lesser problem with the application gap.

1052
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,640
But if you have an operating system again where you have to develop some applications

1053
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,200
and everything, you will have some huge problems.

1054
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,000
It's always the same.

1055
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,040
I think the solution is obvious and it's been around for almost 10 years now and we've all

1056
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:29,040
had the solution.

1057
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,040
WebOS.

1058
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,040
WebOS.

1059
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,040
Oh my God.

1060
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,040
Oh wow.

1061
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,160
You know what else was a solution before WebOS?

1062
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,160
I love it.

1063
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,880
I think Nokia came out with that Mamo, which was just a Linux tablet.

1064
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1065
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,080
It was actually pretty good.

1066
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,200
Yeah, yeah.

1067
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,560
Then MeeGo.

1068
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,560
It's funny you say that.

1069
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,560
MeeGo was cool.

1070
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,560
Oh, that's so true.

1071
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,560
That's all so true.

1072
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,040
Like we kind of did arrive on the solution, but it was just too early, I guess.

1073
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,080
Yeah, too early and their hardware was crap, but the software was amazing.

1074
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:03,240
I still have my Palm Pre plus, which is awesome, except for the hardware itself is crap.

1075
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,240
Yeah.

1076
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,280
Like the battery was atrocious, but the software is amazing still and you can still technically

1077
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,280
get it.

1078
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,040
It's just, I don't know.

1079
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,040
We have it.

1080
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,040
People use it.

1081
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,040
Just do it.

1082
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,040
There was a lot of really good ideas in it.

1083
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,400
I think that's why it still gets mentioned even today.

1084
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Never will die.

1085
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
It never will die.

1086
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:22,400
All right.

1087
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:24,080
Well, we have some Slack to get to, don't we?

1088
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:29,600
But we also have a really cool application that uses just the built-in container features.

1089
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,520
Actually, that might be even giving it too much credit.

1090
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,280
It really just uses the built-in namespacing feature of Linux to give you some excellent

1091
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,320
security for anything that might be internet facing.

1092
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,800
It's like on-demand sandboxing.

1093
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,160
We're going to talk about that in just a moment.

1094
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,020
First, I want to thank Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1095
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,020
This is just such a...

1096
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:53,880
I couldn't even imagine a sponsor this great when I was starting Jupyter Broadcasting.

1097
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:59,960
It's such a great fit because it's Linux focused, Linux enthusiasts, creating a platform for

1098
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:02,040
people to learn more about Linux.

1099
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:07,840
And that's what they work at every single day, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1100
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,680
That's where you go to sign up and get a free seven-day trial so you can try the platform

1101
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,080
out as well.

1102
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,480
Self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux, cloud, and DevOps topic.

1103
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,200
They give you hands-on scenario-based labs that really help you learn how to use this

1104
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,200
stuff.

1105
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,760
You get away with the self-experience of actually having hands-on with the material, which for

1106
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,260
me is a total anxiety solver.

1107
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,720
That goes from I'm totally anxious about a job to I got this.

1108
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,680
And if you ever get stuck, they have full-time human instructors that are there to help,

1109
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,560
ready to give you any advice that you might need.

1110
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,520
They spin up their cloud servers on demand.

1111
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,620
You select a distribution, the courseware and the cloud servers match that automatically.

1112
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,620
You're busy.

1113
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,620
We're all busy.

1114
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,400
So they have a course scheduler that works with your busy timeframe, helps you stick

1115
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,660
to your learning goals.

1116
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,560
If you just wanna deep dive and get certs, well, of course, they've got courses created

1117
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,440
specifically to prepare you for that.

1118
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,380
And Learning Pass, so if you wanna go down a series of courses and content planned by

1119
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,800
instructors for specific entire tracks of a career, they've got that too.

1120
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,200
Flashcards that are forked by a community that's stuffed full of Jupyter broadcasting

1121
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:07,200
members.

1122
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,400
It's such a great platform, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

1123
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,920
Grab the iOS or Android app as well so that way you get value on the go.

1124
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,240
And enjoy the downloadable stuff that works like offline, like their audio and their study

1125
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,240
guides.

1126
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,200
It's just great for taking on the go when you wanna listen to something offline, linuxacademy.com

1127
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,740
slash unplugged.

1128
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:30,280
And thank you... gotta get the bell in there.

1129
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,760
Thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the unplugged program, linuxacademy.com slash

1130
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,400
unplugged.

1131
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:41,400
So FireJL is a suid program that, or a SUID program, that reduces the risk of security

1132
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:47,560
breaches by restricting the running environment, say of Firefox or Chrome, for example, to

1133
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,680
a Linux namespace, which is pretty cool right there.

1134
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,040
And it uses a couple other technologies that are all just baked right in to the Linux kernel.

1135
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:00,140
Stuff in the network stack, the process table, the mount table, it's written in C, it has

1136
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:06,760
virtually no dependencies, it runs on any Linux computer with a 3.x kernel or newer.

1137
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,760
Okay?

1138
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,600
If I got your attention, how great is this?

1139
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:13,280
This is one of these things I just love about Linux, I just love this, I get so fired up

1140
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,200
about this, because this is so fantastic.

1141
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:20,100
And so you know it's gonna be easy to get going, because there's no daemons running

1142
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,800
in the background, there's no complicated configuration files to edit, the sandbox is

1143
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,440
super lightweight and the overhead is low because it's just using the namespace stuff

1144
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,000
built into the fricking kernel, and all the security features are implemented by the kernel,

1145
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,640
so as long as the kernel's good, this security of FireJL is good.

1146
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:42,920
So it's dumb, dumb, dumb easy to get working, you can just say, for example, if you want

1147
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:49,460
a FireJL VLC, who knows what that crazy VLC's doing, not nearly as trustworthy as that MPV,

1148
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:57,300
you could just write in FireJL space, I kid, I love you guys at VLC, FireJL space VLC,

1149
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:03,280
and it will start VideoLAN client in an isolated namespace, still has access to the network

1150
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:10,600
and can still do your business, but is completely, it could be violated, it could be violated

1151
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:15,440
with a zero day from Edward Snowden directly, his personal stash, and it's contained into

1152
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,560
this namespace.

1153
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:21,720
So if you have something that's internet facing, maybe like probably something like transmission,

1154
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,660
maybe you're doing torrents or something like that, and you have a listening port for remote

1155
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,300
web management, FireJL that son of a gun.

1156
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:35,840
That's a good phrase right there, that's the takeaway for the whole episode, just FireJL.

1157
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:41,040
There's also a graphical interface, which I haven't checked out, but it's called FireTools,

1158
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,960
what, what, what?

1159
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:51,640
The graphical interface is clunky and awkward, and it's not really a GUI, it's just like

1160
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,360
a little overlay thing, so most people wouldn't use it.

1161
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,840
Okay, so nice, so I've not tried it.

1162
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,720
It's better to put it in your.desktop file or something.

1163
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:04,160
Okay, so that would then, when you use the.desktop file, you would launch it with FireJL

1164
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,840
just to isolate it at start.

1165
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,840
Yeah.

1166
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,840
I like that.

1167
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:13,640
And also, I've been using FireJL for a long time because the best way to do security sandboxing

1168
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,200
of App Images is to use FireJL.

1169
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,760
Oh, tell me about that.

1170
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:22,960
Well, I mean, essentially it does the same thing that FireJLing a regular program would

1171
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,560
do, but the main thing about it with App Images is because App Images doesn't really have

1172
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:32,760
a security mechanism built into it, so FireJL kind of wraps that around giving it a sandboxing

1173
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:38,480
of an App Image, so you can have everything stored in its individual sandbox and namespace

1174
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,920
with App Images while at the same time App Images are still integrated with the theme

1175
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:48,480
and font and, you know, home folder config files and stuff like that.

1176
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,360
That is, that is, that is great.

1177
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,520
Veratuno, you've also used FireJL for a while.

1178
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,800
Yeah, I mean, I'm quite sure you mentioned on last, which you quite well picked up in

1179
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,560
the first place, but the cool thing about FireJL is that it will make SIM links for

1180
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:07,820
your common applications like Firefox and Thunderbird or whatever else, and the configuration

1181
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,580
files are very, very simple to look at because it basically gives you a set of directories

1182
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:16,720
to whitelist and blacklist and all that sort of stuff, and gives you restrictions to kind

1183
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:23,080
of read-write access to individual file system parts, which is quite good, but also quite

1184
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,280
annoying sometimes in Firefox because if you forget to sort of, like, you know, whitelist

1185
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:33,240
your download directory, then you're stuffed, but if you want to try and read from another

1186
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,160
directory to try and upload to a website, then you have to, you know, think about that

1187
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:42,000
effort ahead of time because obviously you're restricted to the file systems that you've

1188
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
actually specified in the config file.

1189
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:48,480
So the other thing that's nice for Arch users out there is there is an AUR package that's

1190
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,840
FireJL-Extras, which has a bunch of extra security profiles, and for Fedora users, there's

1191
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,760
a copper build for it.

1192
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,840
There's also some Ansible, what do you call a role, right?

1193
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,840
It's an Ansible role.

1194
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:02,840
Is that what it is?

1195
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,000
There's Ansible roles for FireJL as well, which is pretty nice, and then there's a Bash

1196
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,160
script you can use, which maybe, I haven't used this either, but maybe producer Michael

1197
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,440
has, could be better than the GUI, it's called Firewarden, which is a Bash script to open

1198
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,680
a program with a private FireJL sandbox.

1199
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:24,520
Yeah, I've tried it, but I prefer the FireJL business, it's just a simple command, yeah.

1200
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:29,720
I use it for app images all the time, but I do want to point out one thing, it's a little

1201
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,720
weird.

1202
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,720
Oh yeah, go ahead.

1203
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:35,960
A security tool like this, who makes it?

1204
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,080
I have no idea who makes this.

1205
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:43,120
Like if you go to their website, no names, no GitHub accounts, nothing.

1206
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,560
There is absolutely nothing you could find about who makes this or anybody.

1207
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,080
Is there something great for security that you're trying to rely on?

1208
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,520
Look at this, a little conspiracy bacon here on the Linux.

1209
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:58,360
The only reason I use it is because it uses built-in kernel stuff, but it is pretty weird.

1210
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,360
Yeah, you're right.

1211
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:03,360
I mean, it's not like they're rolling their own crypto and creating their own sandbox

1212
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,240
technology, they're just a wrapper.

1213
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,800
But it is, that is weird.

1214
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,800
Now you got me looking.

1215
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,800
Now I'm digging around.

1216
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:14,480
You won't find it on their GitHub or their WordPress, and it's a WordPress site, it's

1217
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,000
not even like a real site.

1218
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,400
So these are like NSA namespaces that just send everything right back to them.

1219
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
No, it's the Russians.

1220
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,360
No, I believe it's speaking to China.

1221
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,360
Don't you know that?

1222
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,360
Oh yeah, you're right.

1223
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:27,360
It's nowhere Russia now.

1224
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,360
You're right.

1225
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,360
Sorry, it's Russia now.

1226
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,360
Get with the times.

1227
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,360
I know, it's hard to keep track.

1228
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,360
Or it could be North Korea.

1229
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,360
Yeah, yeah, definitely, definitely.

1230
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,600
Yeah, I really see nothing.

1231
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:36,600
You're right.

1232
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,320
That is so weird.

1233
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:42,240
Anyway, FireJail looks like a pretty cool tool, even if producer Michael has me now

1234
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,240
freaked out.

1235
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,960
Now that we've gone all conspiracy, can I completely derail us?

1236
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,960
Yeah.

1237
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,240
I would like to mention that currently, Deb Comp 17 is going on.

1238
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,240
Yeah, right now.

1239
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,520
In our Canadian to the North area in Montreal.

1240
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,200
I wonder if Alan Jude's gonna go.

1241
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Something tells me he'll probably miss that one.

1242
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:02,040
It started on Sunday, but it goes until the 12th.

1243
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,040
That's very long.

1244
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,560
And if there are some streams going on there too, but don't go, don't leave, oh God, oh

1245
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,040
God, we shouldn't, oh God.

1246
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,840
Watch directly after.

1247
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,560
I wonder if they'll post them somewhere.

1248
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,560
After TechSnap.

1249
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,440
I don't know if they already do that.

1250
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,440
Yeah.

1251
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,440
I wonder.

1252
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:20,240
On the Meetings DB on the video page, can post it and I'll see.

1253
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,600
I might go check that out then.

1254
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,440
That could be some good stuff in there.

1255
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:26,320
I'd love to go to something like that one time.

1256
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,320
I gotta get my passport.

1257
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,680
I really gotta get my crap together on that.

1258
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,520
So they still have four days to go.

1259
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,560
Oddcamp is also, we should give the guys for Oddcamp a plug, because that's coming up like

1260
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:35,560
super soon.

1261
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,640
I don't know what their ticket situation is or none of that.

1262
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:44,920
I got no affiliation with them, but Oddcamp 17 is going on August 19th and August 20th

1263
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:45,920
in Canterbury.

1264
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,400
So, and look, it's proudly sponsored by Intraware.

1265
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:54,320
You might check it out because they're selling, they still have tickets for sale on the website.

1266
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:55,320
And so that's coming up as well.

1267
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,600
Actually, the tickets are free.

1268
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,300
You can optionally, it's pay what you want.

1269
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:06,360
So you can either get a free ticket and not pay or you can pay every year we've done this.

1270
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:12,760
But if you choose to pay, then that money goes towards funding the event.

1271
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:19,800
And usually the community that optionally donates actually qualifies for like gold level

1272
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,320
sponsorship because they all throw in enough money.

1273
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:24,600
It works out quite well.

1274
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,180
Well, there you go.

1275
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:31,000
So you can find out more at oddcamp.org if you're near Canterbury.

1276
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
What about you, Poppy?

1277
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Are you going to make it?

1278
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
I'm not sure.

1279
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,520
I've got a whole lot of family stuff going on that weekend, so I may, I may not.

1280
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,920
It might be a last minute thing.

1281
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,680
Isn't that always the way it goes?

1282
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,600
You have nothing for like three weeks and then boom, everything on that one event.

1283
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,600
It all hits at once.

1284
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,920
Joe from Linux Action News is going to be there.

1285
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:48,920
Yep.

1286
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:49,920
Yep.

1287
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,920
I'm definitely not going.

1288
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,920
Okay.

1289
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,200
I definitely would love to be able to go to next year's.

1290
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,000
That's kind of like a personal milestone is like, get my crap together.

1291
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,200
The problem is I got to go get my passport and it's, you can't just like submit a picture,

1292
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,200
go online and order it.

1293
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:06,000
Like you got to go to like two or so different physical locations, like three times.

1294
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I don't know.

1295
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,280
It's a damn process and ain't nobody got time for that.

1296
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,920
Chris got no time for processes.

1297
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,880
They want Americans leaving Chris.

1298
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,520
I haven't even gotten my oil change into my truck for like 4,000 miles overdue.

1299
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,800
When am I going to get time to go get my passport done?

1300
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:23,000
And you got to go get a picture taken somewhere, we're on some crappy camera, give me a break.

1301
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,360
But I'll get around to it and then hopefully I'll make it to Oddcamp 18.

1302
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,280
Can that Alice bot help you with that?

1303
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,080
No doubt.

1304
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,760
That would be good.

1305
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:38,400
I really just need like a clone or I need somebody to create like the Mycroft AI system

1306
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,980
instead of Mycroft developing their own AI, they need to create an AI framework in which

1307
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:49,400
it can watch all of the Jupiter broadcasting content in its totality and then synthesize

1308
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:55,600
a version of me based on its observations, which would probably be a little extreme,

1309
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,680
but okay.

1310
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:03,080
And then make decisions for me automatically online, like pay bills, respond to emails,

1311
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,720
then I'd have time to go out and get my passport.

1312
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,640
So Mycroft should pivot and work on that, create an AI framework that analyzes an individual

1313
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:14,180
and then recreates their personality and then it gets close enough where it can make decisions

1314
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:15,180
for them.

1315
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,800
Isn't that already what Google's doing?

1316
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,160
I feel like they're doing that on the back end for ads and stuff.

1317
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,160
Yeah.

1318
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,400
We just need somebody doing that in the open source space, we're behind.

1319
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,720
I don't want to think anymore.

1320
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:25,720
Yeah.

1321
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,720
Somebody needs to do it.

1322
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,040
Just somebody just, yeah, yeah.

1323
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,040
Beans with hair.

1324
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,040
Exactly.

1325
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,040
That's all I want.

1326
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,040
Make it even call it beans.

1327
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:37,560
Well, they should change it to beans and it'll be the bean system.

1328
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:38,560
Anybody with me?

1329
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,560
Nobody?

1330
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:40,560
Nobody?

1331
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:41,560
I'm just out on my own on this one, huh?

1332
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,560
Okay.

1333
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,560
Good enough.

1334
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,560
Well, let's talk about Ting then.

1335
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,920
Everybody right now, linux.ting.com.

1336
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,920
Everybody loves Ting.

1337
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,600
Go there and get yourself a mobile device that you only pay for what you use.

1338
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:55,220
It's just $6 for the line, there's no crazy contracts, no agreements, quote unquote.

1339
00:58:55,220 --> 00:59:00,600
It's just pay for what you use, a fair price, nationwide coverage, with a great dashboard,

1340
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,320
$6 for the line.

1341
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,840
And no magic beans involved.

1342
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,840
No.

1343
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,920
I mean, maybe if those are your own, but that's not Ting's thing.

1344
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:09,920
That's your own thing.

1345
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:10,920
That's how you go.

1346
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:15,320
You go to linux.ting.com to get $25 off a device if you want to buy one from Ting.

1347
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,520
Or if you bring one, check their BYOD page because they have a CDMA and GSM network.

1348
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:24,280
So you can bring quite a bit of devices, a lot of low powered IoT devices work with that

1349
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:25,280
too.

1350
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:27,640
It's pretty slick for $6 a month.

1351
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:30,280
And also while you're there, linux.ting.com, check out their blog.

1352
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:35,560
They got a solid post right now on fiber optic internet and talking about the future infrastructure

1353
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,560
of America.

1354
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,680
And I like the argument that they make here.

1355
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,680
It's pretty solid.

1356
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,720
They included an embedded video with one of their executives.

1357
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,980
It's all pretty nice and it's pretty good talking points for yourself too.

1358
00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:47,980
Check it out.

1359
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,980
Go to linux.ting.com.

1360
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,680
Learn more about Ting.

1361
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,880
Just a smarter way to do mobile.

1362
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,520
It's really how they'd have to do mobile in the US today if they were to start over, if

1363
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,520
the industry had to reboot.

1364
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:57,640
They'd have to do it this way.

1365
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,120
Nobody would accept anything else.

1366
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,440
Once you switch, it's everything else looks so crazy complicated.

1367
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,440
It's really nice.

1368
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,440
linux.ting.com.

1369
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,160
Thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

1370
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:08,160
linux.ting.com.

1371
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:12,480
I tell you what, Chris, I might have to look at their phone shop soon because this phone

1372
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,120
is not doing so hot.

1373
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,320
Really is it starting to give out on you?

1374
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,560
Well, I stopped reading the SIM the other day when it got really warm.

1375
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:20,560
Oh, that's right.

1376
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,560
Yeah.

1377
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,040
And Chris has been having problems with his Nexus 6.

1378
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,040
Is that right?

1379
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,520
He's going to give us an update on the next user, but he's been doing some ROM hopping.

1380
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,520
So that's kind of interesting.

1381
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,920
I've been doing some distro hopping.

1382
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,120
Tried out Slackware this week.

1383
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:37,480
What an experience it was too.

1384
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:38,480
So I'd never done it.

1385
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,040
I'd always, you know, by the time I got into Linux, SUSE was already a thing.

1386
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:44,840
So I just skipped right over Slackware and I went with SUSE.

1387
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,120
And then later Red Hat and Mandrake and all those.

1388
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,120
Gen 2.

1389
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,120
Of course.

1390
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:53,000
So Slackware is one of the OG Linux.

1391
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,080
It's the oldest distribution that's still being maintained.

1392
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,080
It's 24 years old.

1393
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,400
We should have shown one of those charts of all the distro history.

1394
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,400
Yeah, right.

1395
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,400
Right.

1396
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,400
Yeah, no kidding.

1397
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,400
You can find them though.

1398
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,400
It started in 1993.

1399
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,720
It was originally based on Soft Landing Linux system.

1400
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:12,080
Slackware has been the basis for a bunch of other distributions as well, like SUSE, like

1401
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,660
I just mentioned.

1402
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:18,240
Its initial release was July 17th, 1993.

1403
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:25,320
The version we tried out today, version 14.2, was released on June 30th, 2016.

1404
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,800
So it's just over a year old by just a couple of days.

1405
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,800
So the release that Wes and I have been running is just over a year old.

1406
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,880
Came out last June.

1407
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,000
So I thought let's start with the installation because it is very much an old school type

1408
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Linux.

1409
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,880
It really took me back actually to early days of Debian to some degree too.

1410
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,520
You boot, in this case I booted from a USB disk.

1411
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:49,200
I tried to get the CDs, but I just didn't have enough time for them to make it for the

1412
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,200
show.

1413
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,340
And it's like a six disk set, which is adorable.

1414
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,600
Or you can get one big DVD.

1415
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:59,640
So I got the DVD USB image, flashed that to a thumb drive, and I booted my system.

1416
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:03,080
When it boots up, it immediately drops you to just a login prompt.

1417
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:04,080
The installer does.

1418
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,280
You just go to a login prompt, and you are prompted to log in as root.

1419
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,000
So it just tells you to log in as root.

1420
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,200
You hit root, and it just logs you in.

1421
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,840
There's no password.

1422
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:17,480
And then it tells you with the message of the day to type in setup.

1423
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,760
Or to run fdisk and start partitioning your crap.

1424
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,960
A little bit like the Arch installer in that way.

1425
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,960
Yeah, yeah.

1426
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:27,600
And so you can, you know, there's various ways you can set up your partition schemes.

1427
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,000
You can do it manually before you launch the installer.

1428
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,880
Or you just type in setup, and it launches the Slackware setup.

1429
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,880
Here's the important part, Chris.

1430
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:36,880
Does it support ButterFS?

1431
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:42,600
I actually don't think I did see ButterFS.

1432
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:47,520
It was really almost immediately at this point, I was left feeling, this is already something

1433
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,800
that all of the other Linux distributions literally solved 10 years ago.

1434
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:56,880
And that was, they took the installer, and they removed as many steps that were not necessary.

1435
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,280
Like making me log in when I only have one login option, and there's no password.

1436
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:02,360
Just log in for me.

1437
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,400
There's nothing else I can do, so just log in for me.

1438
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:09,960
If I can either only partition my disk, or start the setup, just ask me which one of

1439
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,520
those things I want to do, and then do it.

1440
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,760
Or at least it could be a little more explicit in that, like, that part especially, like,

1441
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:18,480
I don't mind a few simple steps, but that part was confusing because, like...

1442
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,480
You just drop to a terminal.

1443
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,760
And it doesn't even say that there's no password.

1444
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,120
You just have to, you find out, you hit enter, and you're like, okay, it worked, great, but...

1445
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,680
Yeah, you had no idea.

1446
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,280
Maybe it's just a step to get rid of all the noobs.

1447
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,280
It almost worked.

1448
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,280
It's a new filter.

1449
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,280
Yeah, almost.

1450
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,640
But it seems like modern Linux has worked out those unneeded steps.

1451
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,880
This again, it feels more like Linux from another time.

1452
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,280
In a way, that feels kind of good, too, though.

1453
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,280
It does, yeah.

1454
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,280
It's not all bad.

1455
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:46,360
It uses an old-school Ncurses installer, which has always worked really well for me.

1456
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:50,080
I've never had a problem with Ncurses UIs.

1457
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,640
Simple works on pretty much anything.

1458
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:54,280
You can do it over VGA.

1459
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:58,040
And I did the option, I wonder if you did this, too, where it says, what packages would

1460
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,040
you like?

1461
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,960
And one of them is just install everything.

1462
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:02,960
Recommended.

1463
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,960
Yeah, it is in...

1464
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,520
Yes, I did, which that itself was...

1465
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,400
This is totally...

1466
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,480
It also feels like a different time, a different era, and it's kind of nice.

1467
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:12,640
Yeah, so I did the same thing.

1468
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,920
I installed all the things.

1469
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:18,620
Then the thing I liked at the end of the installation, which I wish all Linux installers, like at

1470
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:22,200
least maybe give me a checkbox at the beginning to turn this option on, is it prompted me

1471
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:25,080
to create a USB boot stick that was like your...

1472
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,080
That was interesting.

1473
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,680
Yeah, here's your rescue USB stick.

1474
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:30,960
You create this, and if you can't get your system to boot, dummy, put this USB stick

1475
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,040
in and we'll take you right to the root of your file system.

1476
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,180
And I was like, that's a great idea.

1477
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,680
Every Linux distro should offer that.

1478
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,680
Yeah.

1479
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:39,680
So I like that aspect of it.

1480
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:40,680
Did you do that?

1481
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:41,680
No.

1482
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,680
I skipped it as well.

1483
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,680
That's a great idea that I'm not going to use.

1484
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:47,920
Well, because I only had the one USB on me that had the Slack one, and I was like, well,

1485
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,100
if this doesn't go well, I'm going to need to do it again.

1486
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:54,640
So what you guys were saying is that you came to Slack not ready to play with Linux.

1487
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:56,360
Well, I'm only using it for the week.

1488
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,360
I knew I wasn't going to be sticking around.

1489
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:00,480
If I had been installing it with a DVD and then I had a flash, or if I just had a second

1490
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,760
flash drive, which I think was just in a different bag.

1491
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,800
So did you get X, did you go all the way up to X and do a desktop?

1492
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:08,800
I got KDE on there.

1493
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:09,800
Did you?

1494
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,800
I went with Mate.

1495
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,800
Oh, see, that's nice.

1496
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,800
Yeah, it was.

1497
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,800
It actually was.

1498
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:14,800
It was just fine.

1499
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:19,560
And I'm not such a Mate connoisseur that I can't tell a super old version of Mate from

1500
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:20,560
a...

1501
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,800
I can tell it's an older version, but I can't tell how out of date it is.

1502
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,800
So to me, it's like, that's fine.

1503
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:24,800
This works.

1504
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,800
This is doing the job.

1505
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,400
Well, you just missed the new super key hotness.

1506
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,640
That's the only thing I knew.

1507
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:34,880
I got a little antsy pretty quick when it came to software availability.

1508
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:38,880
And at first, I ran into like, God, all these packages in the repo are so damn old, and

1509
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,880
all this stuff is just too ancient.

1510
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:41,960
I can't use this.

1511
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:43,400
It was nice, though, to like...

1512
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:45,320
It was so strange to have all the things.

1513
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,320
You know what I mean?

1514
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,920
There was just like nine gigs of software that I already had, building things.

1515
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,160
I don't need to install any build dependencies because they're all there.

1516
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,160
Yeah.

1517
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:57,120
But I pretty soon found myself coming across slackbuilds.org.

1518
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,120
Yeah, yeah.

1519
01:05:58,120 --> 01:05:59,120
Did you go to Slack Builds?

1520
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,120
Yeah.

1521
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:01,120
That's how I got Chrome.

1522
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:02,120
I got Slack on there.

1523
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:03,120
Oh, you did, huh?

1524
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:04,120
Which Slack for Slack was kind of hard to search for.

1525
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,120
Yeah.

1526
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,120
That is funny.

1527
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:07,120
That is the modern terminology, dude.

1528
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,120
Actually, I took...

1529
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,120
I didn't see...

1530
01:06:09,120 --> 01:06:10,120
So they have Chromium on there.

1531
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:14,640
They don't have Chrome, but I was able to take the Slack Build script for Slack because

1532
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,760
it's just both Chrome and Slack give you a deb, and I just converted it.

1533
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,360
So now that I made one for Chrome.

1534
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:21,360
So this is...

1535
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,360
So let's talk about this for a second.

1536
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:29,200
So Slack Build.org is pretty cool, Slack Builds, I should say, Builds with an S,.org.

1537
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,700
They say their goal is to have the largest collection of Slack Build scripts, which Slack

1538
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:38,520
Build scripts is the very mechanism that Slack is put together with, Slackware is put together

1539
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:39,520
with.

1540
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,360
They want to have the largest collection of Slack Build scripts available while still

1541
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,920
ensuring that they are of the highest quality.

1542
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,200
So they test every submission prior to including the repository.

1543
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,200
Nice.

1544
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:54,500
So it's not that this is a repository of software, but it's a repository of Slack Builds that

1545
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:58,640
link out to other software and they QA them before they list them in the directory.

1546
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,640
That's pretty handy to have.

1547
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,040
I mean, the ones I use, they did just work.

1548
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,320
It's curated build scripts.

1549
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,320
Yeah.

1550
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,320
And that...

1551
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,320
I'm like, okay.

1552
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,320
All right.

1553
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,320
I can...

1554
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:09,640
Especially since you already have a bunch of the dependencies and they kind of know what

1555
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:10,640
those are.

1556
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,000
It seems pretty...

1557
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,040
It's less of a moving target than the AUR maybe.

1558
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:15,040
Yeah.

1559
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,040
I...

1560
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,040
Oh, go ahead.

1561
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:20,000
I was going to say it's like a higher quality AUR because it's getting testing.

1562
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Yeah.

1563
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,800
And it's more focused in some degree.

1564
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:27,720
And there's some stuff, like I said, like Firefox is still not the latest in there.

1565
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:35,880
So I thought a lot about who Slackware is for and if there is a space for like an Antigros

1566
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,440
equivalent of Slackware.

1567
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:38,480
Is there room for that?

1568
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,640
Is there room for a Mangero equivalent of Slackware?

1569
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,160
I looked around a little bit and I did find a Salix, I think is how you say, S-A-L-I.

1570
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:46,160
Salix or Salix.

1571
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:47,160
Salix.

1572
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:48,160
Yeah.

1573
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:51,960
Which is a distribution based on Slackware that is simple, fast and easy to use.

1574
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,160
They say stability is their primary goal.

1575
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,400
It's fully backwards compatible Slackware, so Slackware users can benefit from the Salix

1576
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,360
repositories which is kind of neat.

1577
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,720
They can also use extra quality source software for their...

1578
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:07,360
They can use it as an extra quality source.

1579
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:09,480
It's available in several different...

1580
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:13,760
They have a Matea version, they have an XFCE version of Fluxbox, Openbox.

1581
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,680
I don't see KDE on here though.

1582
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:20,980
So they have several different versions, 32-bit and 64-bit, and it's sort of like an easy

1583
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:26,040
face for Slackware, which I don't really know if there's a market for, because it seems

1584
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,040
like...

1585
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,000
Well, but why is there a market for that in Arch and not Slack?

1586
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:37,720
I feel like Arch is more new Linux.

1587
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:44,800
So there's more, when your market is new Linux, then you also have a bunch of new users that

1588
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,660
are looking for an easy on-ramp to that, I think, maybe.

1589
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,660
So I was...

1590
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,400
Okay, from the new user angle, I can see that.

1591
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,400
Yeah.

1592
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,720
Because here's where I was going with this, is to answer your question, I think it'd be

1593
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,940
better to answer, well, who is Slackware for, like as a desktop?

1594
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:01,080
Who is Slackware for as a desktop user?

1595
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:04,200
And I think that's a little bit of a different question.

1596
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:08,720
And I did some thinking as I was using Slackware about this, trying to get an idea of like,

1597
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,720
who would I recommend this to?

1598
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:19,560
And it struck me that there's several different analogies you could make, but I like the analogy

1599
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:23,440
that there are simple cars versus easy-to-use cars.

1600
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:27,840
The easy-to-use car will have cruise control, it'll have power steering, it'll have power

1601
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:32,800
brakes, it's going to have like climate control, like my truck even has individual zone climate

1602
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:38,520
control, powered mirrors, automated sunroof, these kinds of things that are really easy

1603
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:39,520
to use.

1604
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,600
And it has like some sort of voice control system.

1605
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,440
The simple car doesn't have any of that.

1606
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:48,560
Maybe it has manual windows, it has really basic steering, maybe it's a manual stick,

1607
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,120
it's not some fancy six-speed automatic.

1608
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,440
Now you're talking my language.

1609
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:52,440
Right?

1610
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:54,940
It's got like, it's just windows that you just pull open and pull closed.

1611
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,600
But the thing is, they never break.

1612
01:09:57,600 --> 01:09:59,980
They literally just will operate.

1613
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:05,080
You see these cars from the 80s and earlier that are just simple built that are on the

1614
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:08,120
road still.

1615
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:12,680
And it's funny, Mike, my RV has a huge truck engine in it.

1616
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:18,640
And because it's in a different market, it's actually simpler to look under the hood of

1617
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:23,480
my RV and do work on my RV than it is my truck, because my truck's like a more modern, quote-unquote

1618
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,440
easy-to-use vehicle.

1619
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:28,020
And this is where I see ARCH.

1620
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,680
The simple car is just reliable, solid, it's exactly what you expect.

1621
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:35,880
The easy-to-use car with the automatic transition is going to have more problems.

1622
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,740
There's no automatic anything in Slackware.

1623
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:43,600
If both cars are priced around the same, which in Linux that is true, most people would probably

1624
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,800
just take the easy-to-use car, which is why things like Ubuntu and ARCH and Red Hat obviously

1625
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,800
are larger than Slack.

1626
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,080
You're calling ARCH easy-to-use right here on the public, look at that.

1627
01:10:53,080 --> 01:10:55,860
When you use Anagros and stuff, yeah.

1628
01:10:55,860 --> 01:10:59,000
And I think it's probably easier to manage software on ARCH.

1629
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,000
But yeah.

1630
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,520
Well, I mean, if you want new things, I would say Slack's easier to just get up and, like,

1631
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,200
if you installed it with a graphical GUI.

1632
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,260
I guess that's where I see, like, the GUI part is, like, if you had an Anagros installer

1633
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:12,880
for Slack, you could just do that and then not touch it.

1634
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,880
If you had that, like, if you get a modern OBS from Slack builds and then just leave

1635
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,680
that running, I think that'd be a very stable system.

1636
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,680
Yeah.

1637
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,560
Yeah, I mean, the thing about Slackware, too, is that it's good to build on top of it, it'd

1638
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:28,200
be good to deploy somewhere that you just want to put in a corner and have run forever.

1639
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:33,120
People who value reliability, maintainability, modifiability, I guess, is that a word?

1640
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:35,420
Am I making up a word there?

1641
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,760
And predictability, too, with Slack, I would say, with Slackware.

1642
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,920
I'd say predictability as well.

1643
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:44,080
I'd say those are people that would be well-positioned to use Slack.

1644
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,840
So are we going to use Slack in the studio?

1645
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:47,840
That's just...

1646
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:48,840
No, it's not my cup of tea.

1647
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,840
It never has been.

1648
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:50,840
That's why I was never particularly drawn to it.

1649
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,840
I don't have any criticisms of it.

1650
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:52,840
It's just not my cup of tea.

1651
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:57,040
But what was interesting to me was that it felt like it was kind of like I use a little

1652
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:01,680
bit of CentOS, Ubuntu, and Arch really as my daily driver between work and personal

1653
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,800
life.

1654
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,920
And by and large, the conventions are pretty similar.

1655
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,840
Like Ubuntu obviously has the Debian heritage, so it does things from Debian ways and Etsy

1656
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,880
alternatives, all that stuff.

1657
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:11,880
But most of it's the same.

1658
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,880
Slack was different.

1659
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:13,880
Yeah.

1660
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:16,640
The default paths for users, the root were different.

1661
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,160
I was trying to get it up like...

1662
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:21,720
This is the first time I've ever used Lilo.

1663
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:22,720
How do you...

1664
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:23,720
Oh, right.

1665
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:24,720
Yeah.

1666
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:25,720
Yeah, it's...

1667
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:26,720
Oh, man, I haven't used Lilo in ages.

1668
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,560
So I accidentally hit don't install it when I rebooted.

1669
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,560
Oh, really?

1670
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,560
So props to Slack.

1671
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:35,440
Slack is like the easiest thing to boot because by default, it uses a huge kernel that has

1672
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,280
all the modules built into it.

1673
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:38,280
And so I just...

1674
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:41,480
I Kexec'd from Arch, but you don't have to have a kernel command link.

1675
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:47,360
All I did was say like root is dev SDA 4, and then I hit Kexec, and it just rebooted

1676
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,400
right into Slack.

1677
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:54,640
But what I noticed trying to get like trying to get it set up through like a chroot or

1678
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:59,160
system dnspawn was that like some things are just different, like on their kernels where

1679
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:04,400
the EFI variables are different path under slash sys than on Arch, and different where

1680
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:05,400
all the executables live.

1681
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,640
I wonder if they would be the same as they are in SUSE, because I've noticed that's true

1682
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,640
when I use SUSE too.

1683
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,640
Oh, interesting.

1684
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:10,640
Sometimes some of those things are different than they are.

1685
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,960
So it's really just a lot of fun to be of a different heritage in Linux because it's

1686
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:14,960
like...

1687
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:15,960
It does feel like a different lineage.

1688
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,960
There's so much that we take for granted when a lot of the things that we have are

1689
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,600
not Linux or even GNU Linux by default, it's just modern convention.

1690
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:26,520
I would tell you, I would say too, there was a genuine sense of nostalgia when I was using

1691
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:29,640
it, which is almost worth just doing for that.

1692
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:35,640
If you enjoy like looking back at older hardware and a different era of computing when things

1693
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:41,460
were a little different, but also you had more control, it made me feel nostalgic.

1694
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,800
And so I enjoyed using it just for that.

1695
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:48,680
In fact, I would love to take this even further and get like an old computer running with

1696
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:52,040
Slackware on there and do the full install, like I would have done back in the day when

1697
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:54,040
I was on a dial-up connection.

1698
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:57,400
Like I would much rather take a Slack laptop than an Arch laptop on a plane, if you're

1699
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:59,360
on a 12-hour flight or something.

1700
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,360
It's true.

1701
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,240
Or you're on a damn MiFi all the time like I am.

1702
01:14:02,240 --> 01:14:03,240
Right.

1703
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,240
Yeah.

1704
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,180
And then go set up and get my Gopher client working and go get on Usenet.

1705
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:08,720
So what did you think of...

1706
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,940
How do you reconcile between Slack and Arch?

1707
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:15,240
Because I feel like there's a lot that is sympathetic between them, the desire for simplicity

1708
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:16,240
over ease.

1709
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:17,240
The KISS principle.

1710
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:18,240
But there's also...

1711
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:19,640
They're very divergent in other ways.

1712
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:20,640
Yeah.

1713
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:27,400
To me, Slackware would be perfect on an old Intel computer that I'm serving up web pages

1714
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:31,360
for, and it's something that I don't want to touch for three years.

1715
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:35,780
Arch is something that I'm touching several times a month minimum.

1716
01:14:35,780 --> 01:14:37,280
That's where I draw the line.

1717
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:41,040
So is Arch the hipster, got to have the new software version of Slack?

1718
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,280
I've been avoiding that hipster word the entire time.

1719
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:46,240
Yeah, but Rekai's used it like six times, so I'll use it once.

1720
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,240
You don't have to say it.

1721
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,240
Yeah.

1722
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:53,480
I think your term there, Wes, that you have chosen to use at this juncture is probably

1723
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:57,240
a close insinuation of what the potential possible situation should be.

1724
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,640
Or the difference between people who are trying out a lot of new software versus using the

1725
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,440
same software that they know works.

1726
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:03,440
Yeah.

1727
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:08,800
New breed, hipster-y distro, and Slack is for the old graybeards.

1728
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,800
Yeah.

1729
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:10,800
That is one way to put it.

1730
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:16,480
I also would actually say it could be a bit of a science history project for new Linux

1731
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,480
users.

1732
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:22,560
So say you're new to Linux in the last five years, and you want to know what it used to

1733
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,240
be like for us Linux users that have been around since the 90s.

1734
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,240
Give this a spin.

1735
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:31,940
It gives you a taste of it without having to actually really sit there and load it from

1736
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:34,840
floppy disks and really grind it out.

1737
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,840
Yeah.

1738
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,360
And you'll get a new appreciation for grub.

1739
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,360
Yeah.

1740
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:39,360
That's true.

1741
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,240
I tell you, Lilo is fast as hell, though.

1742
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:44,360
Man, it was great seeing Lilo again.

1743
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,660
Talk about making me nostalgic.

1744
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:49,760
Just seeing words on an end-curses screen, seeing Lilo on an end-curses screen, it just

1745
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,760
made me...

1746
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,760
That was good times.

1747
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:53,760
It was worth it just for that.

1748
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:55,280
It was worth it for the Lilo.

1749
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,880
You rekindled that relationship with that old girlfriend.

1750
01:15:57,880 --> 01:15:58,880
Yeah.

1751
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:01,280
It was like going to a high school reunion, literally.

1752
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,040
It was like literally going to my high school reunion.

1753
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:06,160
That's about how long it goes.

1754
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,160
So here's a question.

1755
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,160
What?

1756
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:13,480
Are you willing to try another older style distro, but that includes some newer concepts?

1757
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:19,320
I mean, sort of, I'm kind of ready to start on my personal journey of picking the distro

1758
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,320
for me.

1759
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,320
You're ready to start settling again.

1760
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:22,320
Yeah.

1761
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:23,320
Well, this can be a separate thing.

1762
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,320
Okay.

1763
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,320
What do you got?

1764
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,320
So there's this distro called Crux.

1765
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,320
Oh, yeah.

1766
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,320
Oh, yeah.

1767
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,320
We've talked about it.

1768
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,320
Yeah.

1769
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,640
It's a BSD file system, right?

1770
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:37,480
Well, the thing I noticed about it is that it uses a ports package system.

1771
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:38,540
Like the port system?

1772
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:39,540
Like the BSD port system?

1773
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:40,540
I'm not sure.

1774
01:16:40,540 --> 01:16:41,540
It says ports.

1775
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:45,640
Crux is a lightweight x86-64 optimized Linux distribution, targeted to experienced Linux

1776
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:50,960
users, delivered by a tar.gz-based package system with the BSD style init scripts.

1777
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,960
It's not based on the other Linux distribution.

1778
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:56,000
It also utilizes a port system to install and upgrade applications.

1779
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,520
If I recall, it was an inspiration for Arch back in the day, right?

1780
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,640
And maybe even some of the original Arch people worked on it, I think.

1781
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:07,360
Well, you know, so they had a server failure.

1782
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:08,360
It says tomorrow.

1783
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:09,360
Yeah.

1784
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:10,360
Okay.

1785
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,360
Inspired by Crux.

1786
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,360
How is that possible?

1787
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,360
Isn't that 2000?

1788
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:14,360
No.

1789
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:15,360
No.

1790
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,360
No.

1791
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,360
That's European style dating, isn't it?

1792
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,360
Isn't that...

1793
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,360
So the month is in the middle?

1794
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,360
July 9th.

1795
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,360
Yeah.

1796
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:22,360
Okay.

1797
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:23,360
July 9th.

1798
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:24,360
Okay.

1799
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,360
All right.

1800
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,120
So during the week of July 9th, they had a server downtime.

1801
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:30,120
That's the last...

1802
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,120
It looks like...

1803
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:32,120
Oh, okay.

1804
01:17:32,120 --> 01:17:33,120
Here we go.

1805
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,600
February, they released Crux 3.3 of this year.

1806
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,600
So the project's still active.

1807
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,800
Yeah, I'd be willing to give it a go.

1808
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,360
I suppose if the audience wants us to.

1809
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:46,820
I mean, I don't want to sit there and blow my week if people aren't actually interested

1810
01:17:46,820 --> 01:17:49,720
in Crux, but I'd be willing to give it a go if people want to let us know.

1811
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:51,160
Let us know in the comments.

1812
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:54,140
You know, I'll watch for the first couple of days, and if we see people saying, give

1813
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:57,480
it a go in the comments, and they want to hear what using Crux is like, I'll do it.

1814
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,480
I don't know.

1815
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:02,000
I kind of like the idea of us just looking at some of these more esoteric distros.

1816
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,080
Going back in time, in a sense.

1817
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,240
That are maybe not the most mainstream things.

1818
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:08,880
I actually think this is something that open source is uniquely good at, because the source

1819
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,480
code sticks around, like when proprietary software has a new version, the old version

1820
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,480
dies.

1821
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,480
Yep.

1822
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,480
Yeah.

1823
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,080
Once it's no longer hosted on their site, and no one has an archive of it, it's dead.

1824
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:18,080
Yeah, right.

1825
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,400
But with open source, you can still get the old stuff, you can still build it.

1826
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:27,560
We can look at some of these sideline distros, and find out what they do good that the main

1827
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:29,840
guys aren't doing, and maybe highlight that.

1828
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:30,840
Yeah.

1829
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,880
I mean, I do think that is a common trend in our world, is like, things succeed partly

1830
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:37,800
by technocratic merit, and partly by momentum.

1831
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:41,400
And there's a lot of things, I think, in particular, we would say about Unix, perhaps.

1832
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:44,960
That old ideas, some that were old and weren't modernized, but that have very good principles

1833
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,640
or ideas that just haven't, that are yet to be mined by the new mainstream.

1834
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:50,440
Hmm, that's very true.

1835
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:56,280
Mubbleroam, any passing or closing thoughts on Slackware, or old Linux, before we wrap

1836
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:57,880
up for the day?

1837
01:18:57,880 --> 01:19:02,840
Going once, going twice, yeah, okay.

1838
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:07,900
That's about, that sentiment right there is about, I would expect the overall actual interest

1839
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:08,900
in Slackware.

1840
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:11,040
I actually had a lot of fun on the Slackware challenge.

1841
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,040
I'm glad that we did it.

1842
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,040
Yeah, me too.

1843
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,040
I really enjoyed it.

1844
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:15,040
I don't think it'll be in my life.

1845
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,040
Now I can say I've used it.

1846
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,840
Like, I don't expect to continue to use it.

1847
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,200
I think that probably if I was going to go off Arch, something like Solus, Gentoo even,

1848
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:24,640
I would do a Gentoo challenge, like 2017 new style.

1849
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:27,040
Oh my god, now that's a can of worms.

1850
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,040
Oh my.

1851
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:29,040
I don't know if you're interested in that.

1852
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:31,440
And on that bombshell, I say we...

1853
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,440
All right, all right, coward.

1854
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,840
All right, I mean, I'm down for it.

1855
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:37,840
Win, win.

1856
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,520
We can pick a good time for both of us, but next week would be fine.

1857
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:46,640
All right, so next week, let us know in crux, next week, it's going to be the Gentoo challenge.

1858
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:47,640
I'm down for that.

1859
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,040
I'm down for that.

1860
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,040
Wow.

1861
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,120
It's been a long time.

1862
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:53,720
It's been a long time since I ran Gentoo Mumble Room.

1863
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,200
Thank you guys very much for making it here.

1864
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:57,120
I really appreciate having you guys.

1865
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:58,600

1870
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:47,120
The Discord Alliance grows.

1871
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,840
The Discord Alliance, discord.me slash Jupiter Colony.

1872
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:51,840
More and more people getting in there.

1873
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,560
The haircare channel, we mentioned that recently, is getting some attention.

1874
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,880
Yeah, there you go, there you go.

1875
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:58,880
Also the first place I actually-

1876
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:04,880
I honestly thought haircare was about, let's talk about big beards and grooming and stuff

1877
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:05,880
like that.

1878
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,480
You know, beard, you know, that wouldn't be bad actually.

1879
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:11,000
I also kind of think we should create a Rick and Morty channel because-

1880
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Oh my gosh, no kidding.

1881
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,840
I got so much Rick and Morty to talk about.

1882
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:14,840
Really?

1883
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:15,840
Oh man.

1884
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:16,840
Anytime.

1885
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:17,840
Anytime.

1886
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:18,840
I'm your guy.

1887
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:19,840
Yeah?

1888
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,840
I love it.

1889
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:21,840
Have you seen Pickle Rick?

1890
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:22,840
Of course I've seen Pickle Rick!

1891
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:23,840
Watched it the night it came out.

1892
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:24,840
What do you think I am, some barbarian?

1893
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:25,840
So good.

1894
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,840
Who's not obsessed with the show?

1895
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:27,840
I love it.

1896
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,840
I love it.

1897
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:30,840
Firefox is on fire.

1898
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,600
There was something I said at the end, like I was in it for the Lilo or something like

1899
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:35,600
that.

1900
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:36,600
That could also be a good title.

1901
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,240
What did I say?

1902
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:43,080
So I honestly remember news like from several years ago when EFI was becoming popular and

1903
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,000
Lilo was like going to be dropped.

1904
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,040
So I guess they eventually did add EFI support to it and I suppose that's the only way it's

1905
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:51,040
used these days.

1906
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:56,000
We could do some wordplay and be like Lilo with Slackware.

1907
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,920
I was in it for the Lilo is too long.

1908
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,400
I was in it for Lilo.

1909
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,400
They had me at Lilo.

1910
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:05,400
How about that?

1911
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:06,960
Yeah, that's not bad.

1912
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:08,760
That's L-I-L-O, right?

1913
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:09,760
Yeah.

1914
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:14,120
L-I-L-O and it's all uppercase L-I-L-O, right?

1915
01:22:14,120 --> 01:22:15,120
That's technically it's all uppercase.

1916
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:16,120
Linux loader.

1917
01:22:16,120 --> 01:22:19,480
Yeah, you guys are going to do Gentoo but you're not going to get the real experience

1918
01:22:19,480 --> 01:22:22,280
because they do stage three installs now.

1919
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:24,360
Well, we don't have to do stage three.

1920
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:25,640
No one said we had to do stage three.

1921
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:28,600
Yeah, but it's not recommended anymore to not use stage three.

1922
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:32,600
I used to actually always do a stage two install.

1923
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,600
So is Lilo…

1924
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:37,720
I do a stage two when I install Ubuntu.

1925
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:40,240
Lilo and Stitch is…

1926
01:22:40,240 --> 01:22:43,820
It's funny because I was a Gentoo user, the way I backed into Ubuntu is I would always

1927
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:47,880
install the Ubuntu server version and then install the desktop meta package on top of

1928
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:48,880
it.

1929
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:50,920
That was always because I didn't want to use the live CD.

1930
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:54,500
I wanted to use the command… because that's how you install a Linux and then I eventually

1931
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,360
backed out of that.

1932
01:22:56,360 --> 01:22:57,360
Weirdo.

1933
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:58,800
I know.

1934
01:22:58,800 --> 01:22:59,800
So what is it?

1935
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,840
What is the capital L-I-L-O?

1936
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:02,840
Is that the…

1937
01:23:02,840 --> 01:23:03,840
Okay, good.

1938
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,840
It is.

1939
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:05,840
All up case.

1940
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:06,840
Yeah.

1941
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,320
It was throwing me off when I searched for it is Lilo and Stitch or whatever that cartoon

1942
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,320
is.

1943
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:13,880
I was also… it's kind of… it's nice to boot without a… in it ramfs too.

1944
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:15,240
That was nice of Slack.

1945
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,240
Yes.

1946
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:19,680
The other thing that I haven't had to answer in a long time is what resolution do you want

1947
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,680
to run your console at?

1948
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,680
I hadn't had to answer…

1949
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:22,680
And all the font choices?

1950
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:23,680
Did you spend some time playing with those?

1951
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:24,680
Yeah.

1952
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,680
That's a good time.

1953
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,800
That is like warning, there's a safe choice here and there's also a version that might

1954
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,480
make it so your consoles don't work.

1955
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:34,800
So pick carefully.

1956
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:35,800
Nobody loves… what?

1957
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:36,800
Nobody likes Had Me at Lilo?

1958
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:38,760
What's the matter with you guys?

1959
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:40,120
That's good.

1960
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,600
You Had Me at Lilo is good.

1961
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:44,080
We could do Lilo and Slack.

1962
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:46,720
Lilo and Slack.

1963
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,960
Lilo you complete me.

1964
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:49,960
Lilo and Slack.

1965
01:23:49,960 --> 01:23:51,840
You Had Me at Lilo I think is pretty good though.

1966
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,920
I mean, but also the other one that's winning right now is Defecating Butter FS.

1967
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:01,960
That's great.
