1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
That whole like Firefox is fast thing I remember going to FOSDEM three years

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,200
ago and seeing two years ago maybe a demo of Servo their Rust rendering

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:18,320
engine and it was like ridiculously fast it was like I can't describe it was just

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,560
like an image appearing on the screen the rendering time it just looked like

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,560
they just opened a PNG like and it immediately appeared and there was an

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,680
flicking backwards and forwards through pages they were going through various

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,960
Wikipedia pages and because the renderer was very early on in its development

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,600
so it couldn't render every page they all used Wikipedia as the example

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,320
but they were skipping through Wikipedia pages and it was like they were all

10
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,880
cached locally and he made a point of clearing the cache and saying nope we're

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,720
loading each one and going to it new and they just look like flicking between

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,960
PNGs but when I ran Firefox locally it's nothing like that so in those three

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,160
years they've lost something from that or the webs got more complicated well

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,880
yeah maybe you know they just demo oh well there's that I do I don't this is

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,160
one of those things that I always feel like a bit of a dork for describing as

16
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,600
one of the things that I like about Firefox but because it's so like

17
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,960
intangible but one of the things I like about using unity over some other

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,280
desktop environments like these certain intangibles and for me on Firefox with

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,720
with the new rendering engine it's like I just prefer the way it loads the page

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:28,040
it's about I feel like Chrome and Firefox are about neck-and-neck maybe

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,000
Firefox has a bit of an edge right now but it and it definitely has an edge on

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,240
the the impact it puts on my system compared to Chrome but like I just the

23
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,440
way like the way my brain reads websites it feels like Firefox gives priority to

24
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,160
rendering those elements first interesting where Chrome seems to like

25
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,360
chug on the whole page and then dump it on the screen or something I don't I

26
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,280
can't even fold I'd almost have to like get a high frame rate camera and record

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
the two of them loading shit maybe I should do that actually unusual it

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,000
doesn't I do remember early browsers there was definitely a tendency to

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,300
render fields and stuff yeah it feels like we're back I feel I should take out

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,160
my phone and try the high frame rate slow-mo video recording and record

31
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,760
Chrome loading the page and then the record Firefox loading the same page

32
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,440
play it back and see if then I can figure out what it is well you could you

33
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,900
could just open the developer tools on the right hand side and it gives you a

34
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,880
timeline of what's loading so you can actually see it lists everything that's

35
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,960
loading and you couldn't you know you it will tell you what is it but I remember

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,680
one of the UDS is we had in Brussels many years ago like I think at 2010 this

37
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,160
would be there was a chromium developer who was giving a presentation about how

38
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,520
they sped up chromium and how they made it faster and he the demo that he gave I

39
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,880
may have said this before on the show sorry the demo that he gave he was just

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,320
launching chromium from from nothing and as a demonstration of a comparison he

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,000
opened known calculator next to it and he just kept opening them one after the

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,640
other and going chromium calculator chromium calculate and just showing and

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,320
you could see chromium would load faster than known calculator and if you watch

44
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,320
them calculate you could actually see it draw each of the buttons on the screen

45
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,160
and he said I'm not I'm not having a go at the known calculator devs and someone

46
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,240
shouted out that's a good job because he's in the audience right he said this

47
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,760
is an example like all this complication you've got with the GTK toolkit doing all

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,920
of that work and we've stripped that out and the browser which is way more

49
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,120
heavyweight than no calculator loads tons faster than just a simple

50
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,680
calculator and it's a lot of it is that perception of how how quick you watch it

51
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,240
draw exactly like you were saying you can kind of see where it's drawing the

52
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:47,920
page. This is Linux Unplugged episode 228 for December 19, 2017.

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,400
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's all prepared,

54
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,240
battened down and our hatches are ready for the holidays. My name is Chris. My

55
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,440
name is Wes. Hello Wes and welcome to the last live Unplugged of the year. Boom!

56
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah we still have more shows in the can coming up in the feeds and on the site

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,560
and all the usual places but we are kind of excited because this is our last live

58
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,880
production of the year. Goodbye 2017. And we're going out with some great

59
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,960
community stories and we're gonna try something fun since we thought it is our

60
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
last show let's let's let's just do something that we've always kind of

61
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,040
wanted to do and it's the Linux commands you should never use. Like a few commands

62
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,440
that are guaranteed to wreck your box. Just don't do it. Don't do it. We're gonna

63
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,720
tell you about them. Maybe you're maybe a new Linux box came to you for the

64
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,440
holidays and you want to know how to destroy it immediately. We got you

65
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,800
covered in this week's episode but we also got a bunch of really great

66
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:59,240
community news and for the love of all that is Linux I really hope we're almost

67
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,520
in the homestretch for the Gentoo challenge but we will find out later

68
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,360
today. We will have to wait. Stay tuned and find out. So we have a lot to get to

69
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,960
and like I said it is our last live show of the year so it is at this moment we

70
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,280
must bring in the virtual lug. Time appropriate greetings mumble room. Hello.

71
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,920
Good evening. Oh I believe I heard a beard in that mix too and a poppy and a

72
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,480
wimpy. Good to see you guys. Mr. Veratunde is in there. CM. Hey citizen. Mini Mac.

73
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:34,680
You guys. You're my mumblers. I love you. I love you. Let's let's start out with

74
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,840
something you could be looking forward to in the summertime because it is the

75
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,040
thick of winter right now. In fact I think it's damn near winter solstice. You

76
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,520
know when is winter solstice? Do you know? Let's take a look. Hey Alexa. When is winter

77
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,240
solstice? I'm just I'm just kind of curious. Usually right around the 21st.

78
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,240
December 21st. We're pretty darn close and it's pretty darn

79
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,960
dark outside. So let's talk about the summer for a little bit. Oh dreams of the

80
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,200
summer. What can we look forward to in Linux in the summer of 2018? Well. Probably

81
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,480
some stupid drama. That's my that's my bet. Yeah yeah yeah I think you're

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:17,560
probably right. But Linus Claus has an answer for us. We could ask him. You

83
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,560
actually fully control and most likely can mathematically predict. This is

84
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,200
Linus at a recent Linux Foundation event the keynote where he's

85
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,600
being interviewed by Dirk and he says all right tell me about Linux kernel 5.0.

86
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:41,080
So when are we going to get Linux 5.0? Oh well I have I have been known to start

87
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:46,920
losing track of numbers when they go into the 20s and 30s. Fingers and toes?

88
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:53,880
Yeah no I yeah when I had to take off my shoes to count kernel releases. Can I

89
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,120
just say that I love that I love that this is how Linus decides when it's time

90
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,160
to rev the number. It's not like some like Phil Schiller marketing scheme or

91
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,080
Sanjay planning the next big phase of Azure and the version numbers got to

92
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,920
jump from 8 to 10 so that way they can pretend like 8 never happened. Nope it's

93
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,260
just I don't know that seems to be like the numbers are too high to me and I

94
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,840
can't really keep them all straight so I feel like I should change it. You know

95
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,880
it's it's psychological for me it turns out 13 and 14 they're easy to remember

96
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,040
but when you're looking back and you can't recall the difference between 23

97
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:38,080
and 24 or the the numbers smaller numbers stand out more so I suspect that

98
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:45,160
we'll hit 4.19 and and instead of 4.20 I might decide it's time to

99
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,240
5.0. The numbers don't mean anything at all they have not meant

100
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,240
anything in a long time. It was actually very stressful when back when they did

101
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:03,160
it was a horrible model for development. I remember I mean even back in the 1.0

102
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:12,200
days just trying to like draw the line in the water in the sand of this is 1.0

103
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:18,480
and this is when our internet code is actually working was really tough and

104
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:26,080
very stressful and then you never end up doing the right decision anyway so

105
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,760
jettisoning that entirely and saying no the numbers don't mean anything they do

106
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:35,480
keep incrementing but we just try to make them sound like easier to remember

107
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,560
than than any other kind of meaningfulness has made my life much

108
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,240
easier and I think pretty much everybody enjoys it now and there are still the

109
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,160
few people when I make 5.0 and they expect lots of new features they're

110
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,720
disappointed yes so if I get my math right that means next summer ish

111
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:05,800
probably I also did some numerology and decided that every 2 million get objects

112
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:13,520
is when when I need to do a new major release but since our development is

113
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,760
accelerating that actually might be sooner than next summer so it really

114
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,520
depends on I it's a random number and I want people to be aware that it's a

115
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,600
random number and has no meaning so there you go be arbitrarily excited for

116
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,040
no reason at all that we may get Linux kernel 5.0 in the summer hey yo are you

117
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,000
arbitrarily randomly excited for no reason very much so me too I can't help

118
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,760
it it's 5.0 it feels like then we get to have even though it's not true and it

119
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,720
makes no more sense you can shame people for being on older kernels like yeah

120
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,400
you're still three something we're on five now and your Android device is

121
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,280
running kernel 3.4 Wow exactly I have the whole talk it's about a

122
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,880
half-hour linked in the show notes if you'd like to watch it it's a wide

123
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,760
ranging discussion as well as a blog right up from its FOSS if you'd rather

124
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,760
read it now OMG Ubuntu put together one of those

125
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,360
traditional end-of-year posts the best of 2017 Linux I thought we just go we go

126
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,360
through with the mumble room see what they think this is mostly put together

127
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,880
by Joey's readers and then he voted then he I think added a few spices and dash

128
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,920
here and there the number one distro of 2017 is Ubuntu 1710 according to Joey

129
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,320
obvious reasons there because of a huge huge release but number two what do you

130
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,560
think a number two the number two Linux distribution of 2017 solace 3 solace

131
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,120
getting the nod here as an as like the number two competitor to the Ubuntu 1710

132
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,920
release that's that's pretty big news I would say yeah although thinking about

133
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,660
it I don't know who else I would give it to I mean it seems obvious that it

134
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,000
should be solace in fact it's a it's remarkable that solace is shot this far

135
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,320
up on these kinds of lists already right I do think it does speak to things that

136
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,320
we've noticed and maybe commented on throughout the year but it's sort of a

137
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,760
it's like a big win that it's deserved seems like huge I think what do you

138
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,480
think mumble room is do you agree with solace being the number two distro of

139
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,640
the year what about that what about that Ubuntu mate sorry I just I had to poke

140
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,600
wimpy a little bit love installed in a bunch of mostly way more than I've

141
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,720
installed solace that's what's up yeah yeah I have to get stuffed and put you

142
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,920
on a shelf that's brilliant I have to say I I'm surprised I personally I was

143
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,800
surprised at how much take up there's been of 1710 I mean I know it was my

144
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,160
like significantly different from previous releases that we've put out

145
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,320
over the last like three three to eight years but it we're seeing a ton more

146
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,200
people running 1710 than 1704 1704 is like probably proportionally what a

147
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,800
normal a normal interim release would be it's like not a huge amount of take up

148
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,280
most people stay on the LTS but we're seeing comparable numbers of people

149
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,880
running 1710 as run the LTS there's that many people who have jumped on it what

150
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,200
do you suppose that tells us I'm trying to interpret what that means people like

151
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,200
new stuff could it be actually that you know the people who left Ubuntu because

152
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,760
they went no unity and now they're doing no more flood back to it that's what I

153
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,840
was wondering definitely there's definitely I think anecdotally there's

154
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,900
some evidence that that's happened that people have come back to Ubuntu but I

155
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:27,760
think also there was a lot of interest around 1710 and there was a lot of good

156
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,160
communication from the desktop team about why people should care about 1710

157
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,880
and I think that piqued their interest for a long time you know that that that

158
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,400
hasn't been there and you know there was a lot of new stuff and a lot of things

159
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,360
that they knew that were coming and yeah people have have really flocked to it

160
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,720
the common wisdom though before the 1710 release was that you know we get some I

161
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,680
mean this is my interpretation was we get some pickup but for the most part

162
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,680
everybody will stick on the LTS now I wonder if as this development pace

163
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,360
continues if that trend will continue or if 1804 will become really sticky oh

164
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,640
that'll be Italian when that tells if it's gnome or if it's new stuff well we

165
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,240
tend to get two bumps when the LTS comes out because the people who are on the

166
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,080
interim release so people right now who are on 1710 will get offered 1604 the

167
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,680
moment it comes out as an upgrade option and sorry 1804 we'll get that as an

168
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,800
option when when it comes out but people who are on the previous LTS 1604 won't

169
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,080
get that offered to them by default until the point one release a couple of

170
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,160
months later so to iron out all the all the bugs so they don't we don't get

171
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,480
everyone from 1604 coming to 1804 on day one of the release they come a little

172
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,600
while later so we tend to get two bumps but I think we're gonna see two

173
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,680
similarly sized bumps for people coming from 1710 because there's a ton of

174
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,840
people on that and a ton of people coming from 1604 later so I think by

175
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,320
like middle of next year like August next year we're gonna see a huge number

176
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,640
of people on 1804 more than probably we expected yeah okay that's that makes a

177
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,040
lot of sense so I'm jumping ahead a little bit in Joey's list here the

178
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,760
number five event or Linux thing in 2017 was Ubuntu for Windows the subsystem

179
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,400
for the Linux subsystem for Windows and the arrival of Ubuntu on the actual

180
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,600
Windows Store in July and then it became available in the fall creators update

181
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,000
for anybody that wants Windows 10 and wants to go check that box and open

182
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,800
Sousa and Fedora I believe are in route still although I'm not positive might be

183
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,800
in there I thought they landed okay I think Sousa might be but I don't know if

184
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,000
Fedora is I checked kind of recently I a few weeks ago but I'm a little it's

185
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,280
been a few weeks yeah wow what do we think of that um do we agree is this has

186
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,620
this been a good thing I don't know if I agree it's been a good thing I think I

187
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,560
deviate I agree that it was a moment it's certainly noteworthy there I don't

188
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,360
think it's the sky falling everyone will just use Windows subsystem I don't

189
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,640
think that I think there are people plenty of developers plenty of

190
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,880
developers yeah and I'm sure Michael Dominic would speak to this who are either

191
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:21,360
forced or encouraged to use Windows at work but they want a typical Linux user

192
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,280
space somewhere on their machine and this is perfect for that and I we get a

193
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,960
fair amount of feedback from people telling us that is where they use it it's

194
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,200
just at work where they have to yeah that's what I've heard too but I've also

195
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,680
heard people say yeah I was thinking about switching but I'm not switching

196
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:42,160
now I have heard that yeah I so I think WSL is going to continue to evolve but

197
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,440
there's also a number of things that it just can't do right now so depending on

198
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:52,200
how exotic your requirements are you may run out of rope with WSL yes but but it

199
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:58,240
does a job to provide it does a far better job to provide a familiar Linux

200
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,200
work environment than you know SIGWIN and MinGW yes of that nature yes yes

201
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,760
very very very much so so it looks like beard just checked in here and yeah

202
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:16,040
Ubuntu is in the store right now leap 42 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 are

203
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,200
in the store but no centos or fedoras or nothing like that I'd love to see centos

204
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,400
I love the idea of the Windows store being taken over by loads of different

205
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,960
yeah I do love the idea of them being some of the most popular apps in that

206
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,760
store because let's be honest that stores filled with trash so it's could

207
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,960
be it could be possible arch Linux in there yeah he wraps it up with a few

208
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,760
other things like Adam IDE being one of the better desktop ID ease along with

209
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,080
all the packages and Geary as the best alternative to Thunderbird which I don't

210
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,560
know if I agree with Geary either I I may I may give the nod to mail spring

211
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,720
but perhaps I'll definitely give them not to mail spring for the best mail

212
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,480
client right now yeah yeah it's one of those it's one of those where Geary is

213
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,800
great in a world where there's not other platforms that have better mail clients

214
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,160
not to disparage Geary because it's one of my favorites mail spring is

215
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,720
competitive on all platforms Mac Windows or Linux it's a very competitive

216
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,360
application it's a very good-looking application a lot of thoughts gone into

217
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,440
the design it's a very responsive in terms like I can have it vertically

218
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,640
stacked in a small space on my desktop I can have it maxed out over a 2k display

219
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,160
a lot of work has gone into mail spring and an alias before it so I'm gonna talk

220
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,320
I think I've been I've been pinging back and forth with the developer he's a

221
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,960
busy guy it's the holidays and I've been pinging him last-minute every time but

222
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,960
in the future I think we might do a segment on it because I think it's a

223
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,200
very nice very very very nice mail client and it's in better shape than I

224
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,920
think it's ever been when it was the latest I've been using it I just wish

225
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,800
it support GPG but hello oh well I'm sure the future holds many great things

226
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:02,520
that you mail regularly that uses GPG okay all my family friends release

227
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:11,720
really so you're some some users of all of the people using GPG I haven't had I

228
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,600
used it on and off over the years but nobody else I email sticks to it so then

229
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,080
I always feel like the fool that's they almost feel like I'm fronting like I'm

230
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,440
like I'm showing off because nobody else sticks with it and then it's like okay

231
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,320
I'm that guy there's even there's even blogs from the GPG developers explaining

232
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,500
why they don't use GPG for mail because it's just a poor solution huh well we're

233
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,840
all doomed we're all doing it cause poor solution poor implementation

234
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:39,120
it's difference yeah the implementation is the issue yes yes yes good good

235
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,800
point because unless everyone's doing it it's irrelevant one of my favorite

236
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,760
projects to follow this year just on the back burner has been be cash FS if

237
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,160
William was here he'd tell you why but yeah I just really am excited about this

238
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,920
next-generation file system this may be eventually the one that I end up putting

239
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,760
on my workstations and Kent has taken a look he took recently a little time off

240
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:06,280
over the hot over the summer but he's been back since then and he's been

241
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,160
banging out a lot of different features and I just want to give us a quick

242
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,200
update he says the biggest thing he's been spending his time on lately has been

243
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,280
improving the test infrastructure which is awesome and chasing bugs he said

244
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,040
there's also been major and cool improvements on the core IO path the

245
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,600
recent change is that now whenever generating new checksums be cash FS

246
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,640
verifies it against the existing checksum by generating multiple

247
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,800
checksums that cover all existing data one of which covers just the data we're

248
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,000
keeping and then merging the checksums we calculated and verifying the equal to

249
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,400
the original checksum this means that even if you don't have ECC memory memory

250
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,440
corruption can't lead to silent corruption or bit rot of existing data

251
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:49,880
so this is in my opinion some nice stuff so a lot of times people are always

252
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,080
talking especially when you're talking about large ZFS implementations one of

253
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,440
the most common questions that comes into tech snap when they're talking

254
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,960
about setting up ZFS is do I need ECC memory and a lot of times the answer is

255
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,200
no but geez it sure helps and now with be cash FS you sort of have that safety

256
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,960
net which is way more economical on laptops and desktops and low-end arm

257
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,920
devices ECC memory has a big cost overhead and performance overhead to a

258
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,040
degree so and not that this checksum checking doesn't but be cash FS is so

259
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,920
damn fast it's just it's beautiful to see this happen in the file system and

260
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,400
it's gonna be one of those banner features once it ships and people ask

261
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,120
is this thing production ready this will be one of the things people cite I'm

262
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,320
very happy about that development also coming down the pipeline is quota

263
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:41,960
support which he says has been the cause of much wailing and gnashing of teeth for

264
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,560
now the less said about quotas the better I didn't follow I've not followed

265
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,880
the drama there but then here's the big thing he just slips in very very last

266
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:55,760
sentence of this rather long patreon post he says lastly be cash house be

267
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,840
cash FS has its first corporate sponsor a big thank you to elements TV and if

268
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,160
you need me to storage appliances you should definitely check them out so

269
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,480
apparently elements TV making a little long-term bet on B cash FS really cool

270
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,720
to see that it's really cool to see yeah and he I just don't feel like you know I

271
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,840
can't I can't be emotionally invested in butter FS and but there's just some

272
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,640
things that like as great as XFS is that just not what it has been designed to do

273
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,320
right if you're here you hope this is the new hope of Linux file systems and

274
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,240
I'm glad to see anything's are programmed if you're listening you're

275
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,320
like well what is what is so great about it do a site search and look on our back

276
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,360
catalog where we talk about it where William goes into some detail about it

277
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,760
and if you're excited like we are you can help out Kent at patreon.com slash

278
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,440
B cash FS before we move on anybody else in the mumble room want to wax

279
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:51,160
poetically about B cash FS or are we are we all actually I have I have I don't

280
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:57,020
know I don't know who I should ask cuz it's on the community hub but little

281
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,320
birdies around me it told me many little bits and details about this and I have

282
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,040
kind of a picture but I have a suspicion that poppy or wimpy may know a lot more

283
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:10,800
it's multi pass and it's it's not a password manager no no it's a totally

284
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,040
new project coming out of canonical that manages virtual machine instances that

285
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:21,200
are running up into it uses cloud images it's a QMU KVM on the back end and I

286
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,200
imagine it's it's gonna be hot stuff but I really don't know much more about it

287
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,200
than that I've I've seen I've seen little rumors and bits and pieces about

288
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,160
it I saw some murmurings at a boon to rally where people were behind closed

289
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:40,760
doors and I oversaw a lot of that but I haven't seen any concrete

290
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,400
pictures but I bet you somebody in our mumble room knows a little more about it

291
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:59,320
who wants to buy you spoke first okay so multi pass is to KVM what Lex D is to

292
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:07,400
containers so Lex D is a tool for provisioning thin containers and multi

293
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:14,960
passes away for standing up full-blooded virtual machines on a burn to really

294
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,680
quickly so you just snap install wait for not just on a bun to actually because

295
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,800
you can snap install multi pass in fact I was joking with I key about this the

296
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,960
other day that this is what all solace users have been crying out for now they

297
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,400
can snap install multi pass and then they can multi pass launch and it will

298
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:43,240
provision and fire up a 1604 funny VM on on solace very good so yeah it's just a

299
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,680
really fast way so it's designed as a developer tool so if you've used things

300
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,200
like vagrant in the past for example it's a much simpler way to actually

301
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,160
stand up a bunch of VMs running different supported releases of Ubuntu

302
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,400
so that you can flesh out your dev environment hmm and I think you'll see a

303
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,800
bit of noise about multi pass in 2018 it's definitely the one to watch yeah

304
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:12,000
since I got to I also noticed that what seems to be some rather banner features

305
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,480
again is a it can fetch and cache images from the cloud of like a what I presume

306
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,680
to be like a preset up virtual machine sort of like a la docker images and then

307
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,120
it can periodically refresh to make sure that the image is staying up-to-date

308
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:32,400
that seems like some pretty big features yeah yeah it's it's good stuff so they

309
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,880
use the what's called the cloud in it images which are updated frequently so

310
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,360
when when something in the archive changes that affects those images those

311
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,040
images get respun and then are available to you fresh and immediately hmm are

312
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:54,560
there any plans for API support or similar interesting question I'll

313
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,360
decline to comment for the time that's acceptable I will say you mentioned

314
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,680
vagrant I'm definitely excited vagrant could be so slow I already use LexD for

315
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,080
some similar things but having like a full virtual chase virtualization is

316
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,080
sometimes what you need mm-hmm I'm excited sometimes you need it yeah

317
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,520
sometimes you do yeah we have a couple use cases here in the studio where we're

318
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:16,120
still using virtualization we're on a very old Proxmox installation and when

319
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,600
multi pass came out I said to Wes he said this might be what I used to redo

320
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,040
some of these virtual machines because it's an early it's early days for the

321
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,920
project this post is made December 13th although it's been in the works for a

322
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:32,000
bit but it's it's sitting on top of KVM and other technologies that are tried

323
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,320
and true so there's not a lot of risk for me to try to spin up a virtual

324
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,520
machine based on this because Ubuntu is a known quality KVM is a known quality

325
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,920
snaps a known quality yeah like between like that and the tooling from like from

326
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:47,480
snap and LexD I've really I've really enjoyed what's come out of a bunty there

327
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,280
so I'm sure this will be an equally pleasant experience yeah what the bus

328
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,560
I'm not so sure on the name but I like the idea the name will become relevant

329
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:04,800
in the future I think so I've got a number of VMs stood up with a multi pass

330
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:11,240
different versions of Ubuntu and what I've been doing for fun is installing

331
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:18,120
inside those the Ubuntu Marte meta packages and then X to go yeah and then

332
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,240
connecting into them for running instances of Ubuntu Marte on different

333
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,320
releases of Ubuntu that's I don't do it for those purposes but I do something

334
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,800
similar with several Ubuntu Marte instances I do that exact thing but I

335
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,320
use it so I can test stuff across different versions of Ubuntu Marte you

336
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,000
know it's it's just really convenient much much simpler to get versions up

337
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,140
again then you know using virtual box or some other UI you can you can poke it

338
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:51,480
around it's nice and I'm looking forward how it's going to develop over at 2018 I

339
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,600
smile that it's a snap because it's it's just it's so funny that it's not just

340
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,920
boom it's everywhere it's everywhere that runs snaps it's there now that's

341
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,000
pretty great speaking of being there one of the things that freaks people out

342
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,160
about Thunderbolt 3 is you're on the PCI bus you're right there that direct

343
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,360
memory access too late you've seen everything and there is finally a

344
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,120
project in the works to tackle this problem I think this is probably Beards

345
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,000
favorite story of the week because I think he told me about this on Sunday it

346
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,680
was like early on on you remember what was it about the story that stuck out to

347
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,880
you Rekai because I was like okay well that sounds that sounds interesting why

348
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,240
do I care about this again I don't know it just it just seemed like it's nice to

349
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,920
have security on every part of your system yeah sure I suppose what I do

350
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,680
like about it is that it's like a full-fledged solution here this is

351
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,080
coming out of the skunk works at at Red Hat I believe and one of the things

352
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,080
that'll do is it'll even give you a prompt say in the gnome notification

353
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,280
area which is kind of awesome so you're sitting there you go hey hey yo homes

354
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,000
some rando just hooked up an unknown untrusted Thunderbolt device to your

355
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,160
system are you cool with this and that I think is a pretty great feature because

356
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,880
unlike USB Thunderbolt allows wide access to devices you could just read

357
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,880
the memory and you could in theory attach a malicious device to that thing

358
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,480
and just dump everything the system that's in the IO I mean yeah it's it's

359
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,300
it's pretty critical that this thing gets secured especially on a system that

360
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:28,800
might have randos sitting down at it the only the only thing that I wonder is

361
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,280
what happens for some of these use cases where some we have had issues where a

362
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,200
hard roller reconnect and disconnect and reconnect and disconnect and reconnect

363
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,440
and disconnect there could be kinds of problems where now you're where you have

364
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,360
another step where you have to say yes approve yes approve yeah I could see

365
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,880
some instances in troubleshooting of course this is probably just something

366
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,800
that people that don't live in a production environment don't have to

367
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,000
deal with very much but hopefully bolt just nails that right between a good way

368
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,880
to give a security without causing a bunch of inconvenience when troubles or

369
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,280
an easy you know like whatever I don't care just I know I'm on secure right now

370
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:07,560
I was reading up on it and I think if it recognizes a hardware device that's been

371
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,400
previously accepted it'll just write okay yeah it does look like that I

372
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:16,120
suppose that's true so I hope it's not going to ask me to authorize a device

373
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:24,840
using an on-screen prompt when my device is booting with an external I suppose

374
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,480
that is I'll explain now full disclosure with an eGPU attached when you boot your

375
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:39,560
system you get no output whatsoever until the display manager has loaded a

376
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:46,000
little little spooky yeah yeah I mean you know I do really like the UI

377
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,480
implementation like in the gnome drop-down menu it even gives you like

378
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,800
scanning peripherals like it's it's it's using a DBUS API to list the devices and

379
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,560
enroll them and then emit new signals to the desktop environment when a new

380
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,000
device is attached it so it does feel like it's very dependent on the desktop

381
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,480
interface but I just can't imagine they wouldn't have thought of that use case

382
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,160
scenario I do think that this is also good for there's devices that are

383
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,600
starting to count now that require these security levels so it's nice that Linux

384
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,560
is getting this early on before you know there's devices that you can't use yeah

385
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:23,440
yeah and there again not to make it all about us but there is a very serious use

386
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,920
case where we take devices that have USB C and Thunderbolt 3 specifically on them

387
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:34,960
to cons fest whatever you want to call them rallies and we take hardware there

388
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,480
and we set up and we record and we broadcast and our peripherals connect

389
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,840
over these buses so we really you could so easily have somebody walk up to the

390
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,280
booth and they could lean in while they're talking to you they could plug

391
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,080
in something to an open port and screw with you and do in we're live on the air

392
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,520
don't get any ideas people I shouldn't have said any of that forget all of that

393
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:02,960
gotta cut all that out it does it for us it really is that the the struggle is

394
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,400
real well as more and more laptops have these ports people are using them there's

395
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,080
more peripherals you want to use it could be vulnerable you macbook users

396
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,040
you all right that before we go any further let's take a moment and go to

397
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,280
linux.ting.com everybody now linux.ting.com sign up for a better way to do

398
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,300
mobile the way that if you're outside the States often seems like mobile

399
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,080
should just be done the way if somehow we had some sort of DeLorean and we

400
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,780
could go back and reset the whole cellular industry and they had to

401
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:33,040
compete on their own merits today this is what they would do you pay for what

402
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,440
you use it's I don't know it almost seems like it's too obvious but this is

403
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,840
this is the model it's six dollars for a phone and then you pay for your minutes

404
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,840
your messages and your megabytes and whatever you use that's what you pay

405
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:51,200
it's simple $23 is about the average bill once you've made some calls and

406
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,840
downloaded some stuffs and texted some peeps maybe done a few tinder hookups I

407
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,560
don't know whatever you're into West don't judge it's usually around 23 bucks

408
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,640
per month there's no contracts nor the termination fee nationwide coverage they

409
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,600
got the GSM and they got the CDMA you know about that that means if you got

410
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,440
one of them devices you could bring it over to ting and you can get $25 in

411
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,800
service credit now if your first bill is gonna be less than $23 you just paid for

412
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,480
more than your first month what now say your phone's busted it's old you need

413
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:23,120
something new they have a bunch of great devices you can buy directly and they'll

414
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,200
give you $25 off one of those in fact I think they got a big sale on the on like

415
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,720
the nice Motorola devices you'll go over there right now go to Linux dot ting

416
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,560
comm and then click on the shop page if you want a nice Android device that

417
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,800
doesn't break the bank yeah yeah they got the moto 2017 lineup on sale right

418
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,960
now so you can apply our discount at Linux dot ting comm you can get the

419
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:50,360
moto x4 unlocked no contract nor the termination fee no blocking updates for

420
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,840
their ting experience everything with a great Android experience nice

421
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,600
performance beautiful screen it expands expansive RAM or memory $324 I'm so

422
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,400
excited I my brain doesn't even comprehend how that's possible they've

423
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:10,080
also got the e4 plus for a hundred and forty four dollars under $200 for a

424
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,040
great Android experience and they have those physical home buttons which are

425
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,920
apparently going out of style these days couldn't they couldn't fit that in on

426
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,240
the latest iPhones no Linux dot ting comm go there sign up in a big thank you

427
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,120
to ting for sponsoring the unplug program Linux dot ting comm

428
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,840
Firefox quantum was a good release we were just talking about in the pre-show

429
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,240
how I've been using it more and more and then they went and did that thing with

430
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,280
the extension that we all know about you know the one where they injected the

431
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:41,600
mr. robot looking glass extension disabled it by default and then had a

432
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,200
whoopsie daisy said we're sorry and retracted it I've already covered this

433
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,960
in Linux action news I don't really have much more to say about this but I wanted

434
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,120
it I wanted to hear your thoughts Wes oh and then we gotta open up the gentoo

435
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,560
challenge but then I wanted to hear your thoughts what do you think about this

436
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:00,720
move Mozilla made to push down the add-on it's disabled by default if you

437
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,160
participated in the feedback program you got this installed and it looks like the

438
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,920
angle was going to be some sort of tie-in with mr. robot where people

439
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,600
watching the series could go unlock a game and they would discover oh my gosh

440
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,560
it's already in my browser oh my gosh Firefox and mr. robot work together on

441
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:20,480
this it's so cool I just love Firefox so much I'm gonna use it for the rest of my

442
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,880
life and so they pushed it down to everybody's computer because I was

443
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:26,560
obviously what was going to happen and it looks like Mozilla wasn't even paid

444
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,600
these rumors I have not confirmed this it looks like Mozilla wasn't even paid

445
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:35,520
a dime for this so this wasn't like they sold out to the mr. robot series it was

446
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,960
like we're gonna capitalize on the momentum of Firefox quantum we're gonna

447
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,440
capitalize on this somewhat popular geeky television show and blow everybody's

448
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:49,080
mind and it really backfired I think yeah I definitely I think I'm sad I'm

449
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,520
sad how much it has backfired and the you know the amount of negative press

450
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,120
personally I'm not I'm not thrilled about this I like like mr. robot

451
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,520
justified I don't necessarily need this add-on but being being shipped from

452
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,160
Mozilla I by using their browser I am in some ways implicitly just trusting the

453
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,040
software they ship if this seems like it would fall under the same domain so I

454
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,920
wasn't actively actively offended I also don't think it was a great move and I

455
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,560
was quantum had a really good release and so it's sad I can see why maybe they

456
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:22,880
would think that this could capitalize on that but it maybe also shows some

457
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,600
some wrong priorities or people who hadn't really thought this through at

458
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,160
Mozilla and it's really it's just sad that this this reaction maybe will make

459
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,480
people less ready to try out what really is quite a good browse yeah and it does

460
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,960
go geez what how did you not see how this wasn't gonna be received what what's

461
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,100
wrong with you guys does anybody in the mumble room have any thoughts that they

462
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,440
want on the story okay go ahead I wanted to give that I want to give you guys so

463
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,320
I I'm I'm kind of a little disappointed and companies make mistakes and people

464
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:57,720
can be very caught up in internally in their own thoughts and I know we've made

465
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,120
mistakes in the past that canonical where we've thought something would be a

466
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,440
good idea and there's been a gigantic backlash and we completely didn't expect

467
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,680
it because inside our own bubble the thing we did made sense but outside if

468
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,160
if you're if you're not an Amazon subscriber and you're not part of the

469
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:21,440
the culture that knows what mr. robot is this is just offensive it's it's

470
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,720
cultural arrogance on the part of Mozilla to think that anyone outside

471
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,400
that bubble gives a shit about mr. robot because they don't right it might well

472
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,720
be a popular program in the United States of America and a few other

473
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,520
countries but nobody else gives a damn and I think it's arrogant on their

474
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,120
behalf to think other people would yeah and insensitive to what it's probably a

475
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,120
large percentage of their user base like maybe that's not who they want to add

476
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,040
especially people who are fans of mr. robot they're gonna be the more

477
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:53,840
technically aware more privacy concerned group out of anyone watching any

478
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:59,600
television show either way it's not a great way yeah yeah it really shows a

479
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,440
lack of understanding and and the echo chamber effect I think is what poppy

480
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,600
sound like if they if they bundled like maybe if the extension was something

481
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:12,200
like hey we're gonna bundle tour in there or we're gonna buy yeah right yeah

482
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,120
as an option like things like that might have made more sense that might not been

483
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,240
used even I think tree I appreciate that the the extension that they did install

484
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,320
they only did it for English language install so but that still represents a

485
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,880
significant chunk of people who don't live on the continental u.s. you know

486
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:34,240
would have received this thing so yeah I think it was a little bit sad I think it

487
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,080
was a little bit overblown in the community that people went a bit nuts

488
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,160
about it but you know I can kind of see why it does seem to be there's building

489
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,520
momentum at getting angry at Mozilla that's really the core thing they've

490
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,240
got to figure out how to address is the mob is ready to get into justice mode at

491
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,280
a moment's notice these days and Mozilla's names ending up on that list

492
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,480
more and more but on the positive side of this whole thing unless anybody else

493
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,280
has anything they want to say I think the positive side of this has been

494
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:05,240
Vivaldi has received a lot of publicity a lot of people in our discord rooms and

495
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,320
our telegram group and on other places are so I'm trying out Vivaldi I'm

496
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:12,440
switching to Vivaldi when people say what should I try instead I'm seeing

497
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:18,560
Vivaldi linked a lot which you try brave brave is just awesome yeah yeah you

498
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,160
actually want a browser that is interested in your privacy then brave

499
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,080
is the way to go because that's just baked in that's their whole USP right

500
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:31,280
yeah and brave got a little news this week because they've launched now as a

501
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,960
snap you can snap install brave which is kind of awesome so it's a great chance

502
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,360
to try it out I believe they're adding some preliminary support for IPFS as

503
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,440
well and really so all kinds of interesting development activity can also

504
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,720
snap install IPFS oh geez let's keep it roll you know what else you can snap

505
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,840
installed now apparently VLC 30 RC one is available as a snap or the video is

506
00:38:52,840 --> 00:39:00,320
the video land team looking at snapping is this is this happening yeah wow I've

507
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,440
been working with one of the VLC developers on this for a few weeks now

508
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,040
and we worked through some issues to make sure that hardware accelerated

509
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:16,420
video playback works out the box oh you know all of the platforms so it does the

510
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:20,280
right thing there are still some TV issues there's some theming issues those

511
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,360
are down to us in the snap world there's nothing VLC is our fault so we're

512
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,080
addressing those but it's um it's really nice because it's hooked up to their CI

513
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:34,320
so direct builds of VLC 3 goes straight to the snap store awesome get the

514
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,300
latest builds straight from there yeah that means it's really integrated in to

515
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:42,960
to the process which is great so odd to keep the to keep things rolling speaking

516
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,000
of Kota radio earlier Mike might be here happy to hear this that jet brains is

517
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,160
also getting on board with snaps and shipping 21 I think well I don't mean I

518
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,320
know they have 21 different tools I don't know how many are gonna be snapped

519
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,320
up but I know that the one that some of our audience might be interested in is

520
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:07,960
the pie charm stuff as well as the PHP storm webstorm go land oh cool very nice

521
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:16,480
so I've been working with one of the jet brains they they currently have 12 of

522
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,560
their products in the stable channel and they have two others that are in the

523
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,840
candidate and beta channels at the moment that they're hoping to push out

524
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:31,240
by the end of the year and then they'll be looking at other products in their

525
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:36,440
portfolio to see what they want to snap but yeah they've they've been working

526
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,400
very hard over the last six weeks or so bring in more and more of their

527
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,640
products to the store that's encouraging yeah yeah lots of done the jet brains

528
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,160
tools I wasn't super familiar with them and still I started working with them

529
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,440
and they're very very good I have to say yeah yeah Mike's been raving about them

530
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:57,000
for a little while I mean if you do if you do enterprise Java that's what you

531
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,200
use that's just that's just how it works so and a lot of those people do it on

532
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,680
Windows or I mean on a bunch of these days so that's you know that is a solid

533
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,680
ending for 2017 for snaps you know for an initiative that really was birthed

534
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,960
and really got into momentum this year that's a pretty that's a pretty

535
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:17,880
triumphant ending to that and a good positioning for 2018 we feel like I feel

536
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,040
like the the reasons for me to run arch are getting fewer and fewer if flat packs

537
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,440
and snaps and app images bear out I am really gonna get to that point where I

538
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:36,440
could have a solid stable Linux core with a LTS core and then fairly up-to-date

539
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:41,840
fluid user land application which has been the most achievable achievable for

540
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,440
me on arch but now it feels like it's almost going to be achievable anywhere

541
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,040
and then there's just gaps to close if we could get get the upgrades a little

542
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,920
smoother I'm oh man I'm I'm very excited about the future there's overhead there's

543
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:58,040
changes there's there's things to be worked out like Poby was just saying

544
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:02,040
with the theming but we have time to get there and we're making good time we're

545
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,120
making good progress yeah and that for the things that it works you know like

546
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,560
really well with it it's it's just amazing well I want to talk about one

547
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,600
more thing that caught my attention this week I don't know why I never noticed

548
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,600
this before but you know etcher right the the USB writing tool I actually

549
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,720
think it's pretty good we've covered it before is that electron it's electron

550
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,080
isn't it is yeah freaking a lecture on app to write USB thumb drives Wow welcome

551
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:33,080
to 2017 they have a command-line node app yeah 2017 indeed they have a little

552
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,960
piece of hardware they're working on have you seen at your pro no this thing

553
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,920
is it almost feels like a fantasy it's got one two three four five six seven

554
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,880
eight nine ten eleven twelve three four five six seven something like 17 or

555
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,680
some nonsense USB ports plus a master source port and an embedded touchscreen

556
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,480
that is etcher just running on the touchscreen it's like the electron app

557
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,000
just running on a dedicated screen in a hardware slab that could be best

558
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,040
described as a large USB hub and they they say it's they currently have this

559
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,120
thing able to write to dip 500,000 different SD and USB drives per month

560
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,400
are they etcher is already an etcher is already known for doing this so they're

561
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,840
like you know what we're gonna do we're gonna create a standalone hardware

562
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:18,800
device that allows you to write multiple cards or USB discs at once at the best

563
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,560
speeds we can possibly get to compared to any traditional method multiple writes

564
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,720
at the same time it does 60 megs per second it can do 750 megabytes megabytes

565
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:35,400
they're saying megabytes a second total you're gonna have a limiting factor of

566
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,680
just the total speed of the USB drives but 16 different cards you can hook up

567
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,760
to this thing with also there's I guess there's a whole bunch of SD card slots

568
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,280
that you can't see in the picture as well they say for the first the pricing

569
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,960
is gonna be competitive but I don't see an actual price on here but this thing's

570
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:55,240
I mean how would you do I'm trying to describe this to the audio audience like

571
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,400
this thing looks like almost like something out of Star Trek but like

572
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,160
retro star yeah like the original series it looks like Captain Kirk would like

573
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,360
something they would have where you could plug in a bunch of stuff you could

574
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:11,440
totally see how like hardware clinical or yeah very very just minimal interface

575
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,880
look at them go though so that's the etcher pro I don't really they just

576
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,520
have a subscription to find out about it it's interesting that this whole etcher

577
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:22,880
thing you know came out from from the resin that I owe people yeah and etcher

578
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,960
is just this you know thing to help them burn their software on USB Drive to get

579
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,160
you to install it which is why they you can see why they I mean they're like

580
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,040
well we'll make this for ourselves and then if we want a huge hit seemingly

581
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,040
it's yeah look at all these people that download right well now we'll make a

582
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:38,480
hard drive device that will make a hardware device to do and if a few

583
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,560
people want that and you can just see where their thought process on the from

584
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,640
beginning to end I have used some some products like that way back in the day

585
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,600
to you know to replicate a whole bunch of USB drives and a lot of them are not

586
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,520
you know their interfaces are not great they're pretty minimal so this is maybe

587
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:58,240
it's a maybe there's a target in the luxury USB mass writing market I'm not

588
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,440
sure that's a thing you know very tuned it points out that Noah could use

589
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,080
something like this when he's trying to switch people over to Linux I think

590
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,240
that's pretty good and Cody the dragon says maybe they should call it the

591
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:16,560
sketch so it'd be the etcher sketch boom yeah well but that's pretty good though

592
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,760
I think that's what I think they should actually do that just yeah yeah you know

593
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:24,040
what else is great digital ocean digital ocean comm go over there and spin up

594
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,320
some infrastructure I was reminded recently that there's so many great

595
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,880
features of digital ocean that I often go off in the woods and I'll talk about

596
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,440
spaces or I'll talk about this crazy modern stuff you know they say they say

597
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,160
Chris you really got to talk about that dashboard it's a dashboard for days is

598
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,400
what they say to me they say double down on the dashboard Chris is a dashboard

599
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,440
for days if you're a total noob or you're an expert server administrator

600
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,920
you're gonna find that dashboard wonderful they have an API to that

601
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:53,080
matches in fact I think the dashboard is a client of the API but I I digress

602
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,320
everything you want to deploy you're gonna be able to deploy within seconds

603
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,160
everything's backed by SSD drives and they have team support if you want to

604
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,520
work with a group and one of the features that probably gets a little

605
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,240
under talked about besides the dashboard is the snapshot and backup

606
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,960
functionality for just very little additional you can build in backups to

607
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,360
your digital ocean droplet which gives you a real peace of mind regardless of

608
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:17,760
what you're doing and you combine that with monitoring alerting that you can

609
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,160
collect metrics monitor performance and receive alerts to app optimize

610
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,840
performance or know if something's down and that's at no additional cost it's

611
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:30,360
just it's a really really good system and they've built in a way where you can

612
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:34,760
do work really fast you get an idea you go from idea to actually deploying a

613
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,960
system hey I want to try this thing out on github hey wouldn't it be cool if

614
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,400
next cloud could do this and you go from that moment to actually trying it within

615
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,480
just a couple of minutes it's really enabling digitalocean.com go there

616
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,600
create your account and then use our promo code do unplugged it's one word

617
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,520
you put it together you apply it after you create your account you get the $10

618
00:46:56,520 --> 00:47:00,560
credit spin up that $5 rug rig run it for two months for free you know I'm

619
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,880
saying digitalocean.com it's just so much more pleasant to use than like any

620
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,680
of their competitors the APIs are simple and clean the UI is beautiful that

621
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:12,760
dashboard for days Oh days years even digitalocean.com use the promo code do

622
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,320
unplugged big thanks to digital ocean for sponsoring the show and thanks to

623
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:20,920
everybody out there for using the promo code do unplugged all right I gotta

624
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:27,520
admit it Steven got me Steven VN Steven over usually writing for ZD net but now

625
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,840
picking up a gig for HP Enterprise filling out their website he wrote the

626
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,440
Linux commands you should never use and I gotta admit he got me because this is

627
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,680
this is an idea we've kicked around for the show for a little while but never

628
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,860
really just put the list together we've actually even made jokes about it on the

629
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:48,880
show oh crap you know what I just realized Wes oh my god

630
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,120
fascinating we gotta start the gentoo challenge right we're over halfway into

631
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,400
the show what's going on all right we're gonna get to this in just a moment I'm

632
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,480
sorry that was not an intentional tease but I want to see this thing through I

633
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,680
got to get this over I was recently told by a listener that this might be the

634
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,760
worst audio the least compelling segment we've ever done the show yeah probably

635
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,720
true I feel good about that which reminded me of the satire piece that

636
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,040
swampy posted over at pseudo satirical and the headline was man loses will to

637
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:23,000
live after a gentoo install a man has been left hospitalized and his family

638
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,160
left distraught in the aftermath of a grueling install of gentoo the Linux

639
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,840
operating system the 32 year old man was admitted on Thursday and is currently

640
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:35,160
in stable but serious condition after he reportedly lost the will to live sources

641
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:39,000
say he was installing gentoo late on Monday evening and on his main computer

642
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:45,000
and this was his quote first serious attempt all right that's so how you

643
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,680
feeling right now good in all seriousness how many weeks I know it's

644
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:54,380
not weeks but how many episodes have you been doing this this is the third I

645
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:57,720
think the fourth third or fourth yeah so we're just doing it during the show

646
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,400
we're just doing it during about three you're about three or four hours in to

647
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,880
install about two and a half I'd say okay all right two and a half hours yeah

648
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,840
if I get a USB stick other than to in fact a blank USB stick and I have to

649
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:17,800
download the ISO yeah put the ISO on the USB stick sure and then install the

650
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:22,800
system I'm done in like 20 minutes tops right right so for all of the extra

651
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,520
performance you're gonna eek out of this install of gentoo do you think it's a

652
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:31,240
false economy oh you're asking that question before we've gotten there I

653
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,680
mean how can we answer really well because I think I think it's probably

654
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,040
the last gentoo challenge you're gonna do because you're gonna lose the will to

655
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:44,480
live as well a Christmas holiday I would say for most people probably not it is a

656
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:49,260
lot of fun I will say I really enjoy it's been it's fun to configure a

657
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,720
kernel it's just a lot of fun and there's a lot of neat options value

658
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,360
and visiting down this one you can do that in other distributions and upon

659
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:00,720
doing our it doesn't matter gentoo it's it's feels like it's it feels like it's

660
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,320
just part of the process a few of the houses I grew up in and Angela's house

661
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:08,280
they had this crawl space under the house and like you don't go there very

662
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,440
often but when you go under the crawl space of a house you kind of

663
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,820
reacquaint yourself with some of the mechanics of the of the plumbing the

664
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:19,260
electrical oh yeah that hack job we did a while ago and it's sort of good to

665
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,080
just have a real intimate understanding of actually how all these things connect

666
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,280
together in your home that you live in every day but at a certain point you go

667
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,680
above that crawl space and you just want to get you don't want to move on with

668
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:34,560
your life so I do feel like it is hmm in this day and age not particularly worth

669
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:40,920
it if I was on a system that was very old or 32-bit or maybe even arm if I

670
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,680
could use dis CC or something like that then maybe then maybe or if you're just

671
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,760
a you know a very skilled user who has a has an interest in maintaining all the

672
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,760
little bits and pieces of what goes on in their operating system you you will

673
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,400
enjoy it all right Wes well are you ready for the the official check and how

674
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,080
we doing over there in the agenda corner West well we're we're working on

675
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,800
emergent sway right now really yeah does that so when you do that does that oh

676
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,720
yeah oh I hear the build going now yeah that's it right there oh look at that

677
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:14,320
building away so that it does that is that pulling in Whelan and all that

678
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,560
stuff as a dependency how's that working yep we should be good to go after all

679
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:22,120
this is done so you are building not just what sway but also Whelan now do

680
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,280
you think that's gonna finish I installed that earlier but oh yeah do

681
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:32,360
you think that's gonna finish 51 of 120 right now that's where we're at we may

682
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:36,120
not get to a graphical environment this episode we're so close though all right

683
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,280
I will also say this has been slow partially because we've been doing it

684
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,960
uh you know in a virtual machine and and while doing the show and I had not

685
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,000
installed gentoo for years I did install gentoo on another system just play

686
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,240
around yeah me too second time is so much easier like oh yeah oh yeah you've

687
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,680
done arch one oh yeah it's like oh yeah it's simple it's really not that

688
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,160
complicated oh yeah I didn't if you don't go in the weeds probably in like

689
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,760
an hour I could have gentoo depending on build speed and as our friends in the

690
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,800
mumble room might say we're really just kind of taking a piss here at gentoo but

691
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,400
in the reality if we really wanted to buckle down and get this done it's it's

692
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,800
not that difficult it doesn't take that long but we want it if we're gonna do

693
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,400
this damn thing we're gonna have a little fun with it that's what we

694
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,880
figured all right Wes well before the show's over we'll we'll check back in

695
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,040
with you okay that sounds good all right all right so let's move on that that

696
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,040
that wraps up the gentoo well check-in I guess that doesn't wrap up the challenge

697
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:30,760
yet I'm doubtful we're gonna get to graphical environment this episode geez

698
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:34,160
though that'd be great for our last live episode to actually get to a graphical

699
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,320
boot so the systems booting at this point oh yeah well done sir you're doing

700
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,120
well you're doing well which kernel do you remember was it which version

701
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:46,560
probably not now you can't check well maniac all right so the Linux commands

702
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,360
you should never use we're gonna start with the obvious one right here at the

703
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:54,920
top RM dash RF slash the first one that I ever learned the hard way back when it

704
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,120
was much easier to actually delete your running system now it's a little more

705
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:02,840
difficult but I've just short version I've told the story thousands of times

706
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,640
probably but my favorite one of my favorite things I ever experienced about

707
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:08,760
Linux was the fact that I could delete my running system and then the fact that

708
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,440
components of it just continued to run as if I hadn't just deleted my entire

709
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:15,680
file system so I have the slow realization of what I had done this like

710
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:20,800
what is that doesn't seem like that's hmm well my my gnome session is still

711
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,640
going my terminal still working and then having this slow discovery as my system

712
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,480
completely fell down around me and more and more things stopped working and then

713
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,960
I said hey guys come over here cuz I'm in the middle of a school lab come over

714
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,080
here guys and I'm sure look at this thing I deleted my entire file system

715
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,760
and it's still running let's see what else I can do what else is in RAM and it

716
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:45,120
was like it was this massive fascination how powerful single-handedly that I could

717
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,640
delete my own because this would never happen on a Mac or Windows that I could

718
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,520
delete my own file system and then keep using it to a degree to debug the fact

719
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,560
that I just deleted my own file system so yeah maybe you should go RM RF your

720
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:57,480
system it's a lot of fun I mean if you're done anyways maybe do it to

721
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:01,160
someone else's system or a better yet a virtual machine oh well sure but I mean

722
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,480
like if you're on a system and you're gonna nuke and pave anyways after you got

723
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,980
all your stuff backed up right before you just go wipe the old disk anyways

724
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:11,040
want to have a little fun see how far you can get see which desktop

725
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,600
environments last the longest I bet you I bet you could get pretty far you'd be

726
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,760
surprised depending on how much is in memory the bashfork bomb of course which

727
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,000
is kind of hard to translate to audio but you'll go find you can find the link

728
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,480
in there then he points out how easy it is for noobs and I want to see what you

729
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,820
think he's probably right how easy it is for noobs to accidentally overwrite their

730
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:36,720
hard drive because you can basically pipe anything to Dev HD a accidentally

731
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,000
LS dash LA and then you go to pipe that to like a file you're being dumb you're

732
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,720
a noob you write in slash dev slash HD a and hit enter and the next thing you

733
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,080
know you've just overwritten the HD a device with the output of LS dash L what

734
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,920
do you think is that a destructive one there West is that like you think that

735
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:55,720
I've never heard anybody doing that I've never heard a single person doing that

736
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:00,320
I have not either not not to the actual to the device it is pretty easy to

737
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,360
overwrite a file especially if you're run into similar name files or like

738
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,000
versions that have like you know change just changed letters or numbers after

739
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,200
them I will say in general the command line is not a very forgiving environment

740
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:15,040
in a default configuration now if you have you know backup snapshots or even

741
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,400
there's even just you know helper helper things to make RM for instance more

742
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:23,080
friendly then it's not so bad but when you're coming to Linux or just Unix in

743
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:27,560
general really one of the things that is hard for longtime Windows users to

744
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:33,400
understand is nothing returned is generally a success a lot of times that

745
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,400
means failure in the Windows world like you run an application and nothing

746
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,720
happens that's a failure whereas in Linux you run a command line application

747
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:44,560
and and it just returns the command line it generally means it's success it

748
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,840
succeeded in what you wanted to do right and so it's this weird kind of like

749
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:52,400
mental like space you gotta get you got a bridge but the command that I would

750
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:58,960
bet more often screws not just noobs but experts is DD because that's really

751
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,520
where you could accidentally just put the wrong thing in there put the wrong

752
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:08,280
dev SDA device in there the right I mean it'll do what you tell it to do and see

753
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,640
here's a little more plausible because using DD you generally are working

754
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,960
working with a device of some kind so you're already mucking about here it's

755
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,520
pretty easy to just play oh well I typed a two but I meant a one there or an A

756
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:24,160
instead of a B and everything's okay right let's let's get this out to a

757
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,800
wider audience Chris your friend and my Joan Ressington has another podcast

758
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:34,080
called late night Linux yeah and one of his co-hosts is Jesse who's a very good

759
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:39,640
friend of mine but Jesse had made a bit of a faux pas earlier in the year where

760
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:47,880
he managed DD pop OS over his hard disk not onto the USB stick and this

761
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:54,040
caused all kinds of confusion because he accused pop OS of silently installing on

762
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:58,440
his hard disk whilst he was testing it on the live environment which actually

763
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:04,080
happened to be his hard drive now let's let's just say to everybody stop using

764
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:10,120
DD this is this is a recipe for disaster everyone has a ID deed over my hard disk

765
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:15,600
story we've already talked about Etcher and if you don't want a electron

766
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:21,560
applications then gnome disks has a facility to restore a disk image and you

767
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:27,000
just say restore disk image here's where my ISO file is point it at your USB

768
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,440
drive that you've plugged in and it will stick an ISO image on your USB stick

769
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:36,760
without any of the confusion of whether you've got the right device selected or

770
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:41,680
not so that's for 2018 let's all make a resolution that we're going to stop

771
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:49,880
using TV for putting ISO images on USB sticks very tune it sounds like you have

772
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,520
a horror story of overriding a drive recently but not drive but I was

773
00:57:54,520 --> 00:58:02,600
actually building a open WRT image and it was a i386 image and I accidentally

774
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:06,200
did a make kind of install type thing and what it did it would basically

775
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:15,040
installed busy box i386 on my AMD c64 laptop and what that does is beat box

776
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:20,280
will replace all the kind of core binaries with sim links to busy box and

777
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,760
basically trash your system because you now cannot LS you cannot any of the

778
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,400
other crap scare us that we used to you do to try and pick the system and so I

779
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:35,240
had to spend time okay on the system copying across 64-bit binaries over the

780
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:39,400
sim links to restore the system enough that I can actually get the system

781
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:45,120
oh man yeah now Beardsley you have like a belt and suspenders approach to DD

782
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:56,000
rescue or I mean to DD it's DD rescue I kind of gave it yeah yeah the dash GUI

783
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,040
might be the the easier part there okay so I was just gonna say this I've

784
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:04,120
actually now I shouldn't say this cuz it's gonna happen to me because it's it

785
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:08,880
happens to everybody eventually I've never DD over the wrong drive before

786
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:15,360
I've never made that mistake but I have made the format the wrong drive mistake

787
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:23,880
mkfs extended 3 slash dev slash and I had I had several USB discs attached and

788
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:29,240
what I would do was this clunky manual system where I would I would edit and

789
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:33,000
edit and edit and then I would fill up my scratch drive and I would I would

790
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,080
fill up my output drive and then I would use our sync to kind of like collect the

791
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:41,400
entire project the project files and the output file and move them all onto these

792
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:47,480
large USB enclosures that were like four terabytes because it had two mir two

793
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:51,960
terabyte drives yeah it was like hard it was supposedly hardware mirror in this

794
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:56,880
enclosure the idea being I load this up with about a about three months worth of

795
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,960
content and then I put it on a shelf and I write a lay I put a label on the side

796
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,440
of it and say these date ranges of episodes okay yeah make sense so I had

797
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,920
this I was like I'm like pretty far into this just about have the whole drive

798
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,880
filled up pretty proud of myself for actually finally for one year getting my

799
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,520
crap together and saving I'm saving our source files until I went to go format

800
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,000
one of the discs in the computer and instead I immediately instantly

801
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,680
formatted that USB Drive just wiped it all out right then and there and and I

802
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,680
hit enter and then I reread it and I was like oh that doesn't look right I'm

803
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,200
like what I should probably don't check that and then I did like a quick mount

804
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:36,160
you know that's always my go-to to like what it where is everything at yeah so I

805
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:43,200
open up another tab do a quick mount okay then I tab back over oh my god

806
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:48,040
realization and then the command line returns right it just like and then of

807
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:50,920
course I'm like and this is you can probably find it in text app like I

808
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:55,480
tried some data recovery stuff and this is a long time ago now but it was it's

809
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:59,240
one of those moments so yeah make sure when you're formatting you're formatting

810
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,960
I've also probably I've probably done it with G parted too I just I don't have a

811
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:07,480
story for it oh so I have done that one so be wary of of that I think something

812
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:16,120
else and this is one that SJW or SJW no it's not something else it's SJN what he

813
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,520
points out is one of the other things that's pretty common is for noobs that

814
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,480
are trying to get tips online to do the whole grab like a command that W gets a

815
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,720
shell script and executes it and just paste it right in the terminal we've all

816
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:31,880
seen the websites really nice fancy websites you go there and they've got

817
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:35,040
like that syntax that you can just highlight right there and paste it into

818
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,680
your terminal and have a go and why should you care they're a pretty well

819
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,520
known name and that's pretty I think it's impossible to tell newbies not to

820
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:46,720
do that to be honest I think the risk to reward ratio is is too skewed and I

821
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,520
don't think there's any way you can properly tell a newbie not to do that

822
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,840
because at the end of the day they just want sublime text or whatever it is that

823
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,320
they're trying to install not to be a pessimist but that is such a dangerous

824
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,320
slippery slope right and I mean so there's like dangerous for multiple

825
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,360
reasons right one of them is some of those scripts are poorly written and so

826
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:08,000
if they are incomplete to download could execute something that is not is not

827
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,560
properly run but will still execute you can engineer scripts to not do that so

828
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:16,640
in that in that case in the best case situation it's about as secure because

829
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:21,000
they also don't expect any newbies to really verify that the script is

830
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,560
anything they probably don't know what it's doing they don't have the capacity

831
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:28,720
to audit it true but it's really just an unfortunate situation in general any

832
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:33,520
other like don't do this to kill your system tips for anybody that got a

833
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,840
Linux computer under the holiday pole this year does anybody have a going away

834
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:43,340
parting I'll add just at the start you find has the dash delete flag which can

835
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:47,320
be really useful but if it's you put it before any of the other arguments you

836
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,960
used to filter your find it will just delete everything my god that's one

837
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,840
thing to watch out for that's a good one with always that's like with special

838
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,800
with those things it's always best to like do one run just finding the files

839
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,880
yes leave that to a log file to put in the ticket for later and then run the

840
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:05,840
delete command and always always always double check when you're when you're

841
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,520
new to the command line before you execute anything is rude one of the

842
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:13,960
things that I do if I am like just double checking down before I format a

843
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:18,620
drive after I had that horrible circumstance where I deleted nearly 4

844
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:23,080
terabytes worth of source material what I do now is I write the command in

845
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:26,240
usually like g-edit but whatever you want whatever you have that's your

846
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:33,120
favorite scratch pad up and I I then I run the mount command I look at my mount

847
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:36,560
points like I make sure and I would have one of the things I will do I know this

848
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:40,400
is going really I'm being pandemic here but I will I will do I'll type mount

849
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:45,720
I'll see my output I'll highlight the output like the dev slash SDA one I'll

850
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:49,720
highlight that with my mouse cursor and then I'll use the X middle click paste

851
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:54,240
to paste that into my command syntax in g-edit so that way there's no typo it's

852
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:58,720
a one-for-one I know it's a copypasta and then I complete the whole command

853
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,840
out I type out the rest and then I copy that and paste that into my terminal

854
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:06,680
execute that when I'm doing it like a like a format just because I want to

855
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,840
like double triple check it right and it can be like you can accidentally get you

856
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:14,200
know returns in your in your copies or other things where things execute before

857
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,960
you've had a chance to completely review the command so I think that's great

858
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:21,320
right like yeah compose in a scratch pad and then you can run in a terminal yeah

859
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:27,560
yeah we have we have more in the post so you can go check out his SJV ends whole

860
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:34,160
post over at the HP Enterprise blog which I thought was interesting look at

861
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:38,920
HP Enterprise trying to trying to get in a little bit they have enterprise dot

862
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:43,120
next which is their insights and resources to help IT pros shape the

863
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,960
future of business it's the new enterprise blog for HP Hilly

864
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,520
Packard and I think it's very very interesting that they hired SJV in who

865
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:55,080
is a Linux writer and they want posts about Linux what does that tell you

866
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:59,320
Wes suppose they know their customers the people who they want to send emails

867
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:02,840
and get them to click and then maybe talk to their boss about buying HP

868
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,880
Enterprise speaking of talking to your boss about buying something why don't

869
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,360
you talk to your boss about buying a Linux Academy subscription this is I

870
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:12,960
think a great way to go if you have any kind of training budget because Linux

871
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,880
Academy is such an outstanding value this is a win-win it's a win-win for the

872
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,160
employer but even more so it's a win-win for you if you just want to advance your

873
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,760
career or just challenge yourself or just learn a new skill set Linux Academy

877
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,120
platform to learn about every Linux cloud and DevOps topic or those major

878
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:43,120
big infrastructure things like Azure and AWS and OpenStack they have learning

879
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:47,440
paths which is series of content and courseware plans specifically for your

880
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,800
education and like I was saying at the beginning here they also have great

881
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:55,960
support for like team accounts and and you have these profile pages that you

882
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,200
can you can use for a lot of different reasons like a github public profile

883
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,240
where you can kind of bragvertize about some of the accomplishes that you've

884
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:05,160
completed but you can also use it as a way to say here's the things I've done

885
01:06:05,160 --> 01:06:08,040
with the training budget so it's a great way for you to really turn around and

886
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,400
show this has been worth your time the reason I mentioned that is that's

887
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:15,840
something that can easily be hard to quantify in a corporate environment if

888
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:19,320
there's not a really clear rigid structure and you can avoid all of that

889
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:22,560
hassle of a super rigid structure which is the tools built in the Linux Academy

896
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:56,720
what's going on over there West 71 of 120 I thought so so yeah this is not the

897
01:06:56,720 --> 01:07:01,880
fastest rig in the universe in fact far from it we have to well we can't always

898
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,960
we can't always just be talking about what it's like on like six core and 12

899
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:09,680
core systems like we do have to sometimes run it really part of this was

900
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:14,120
like what's it like for the casual Linux user who's never installed gentoo

901
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:18,640
before to just come over and you know they're not a newbie but they think we

902
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:24,120
need beard to act as official judge because he could be our impartial

903
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,800
decider here but I would agree with impartial but okay all right yeah

904
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:34,000
decide what do you think about for the sake of getting through the challenge

905
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:39,200
since it's quote the worst content of the show ever what what if what if we

906
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:44,360
let the build finish yeah like we don't boot we don't reboot like we let the

907
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:48,680
builds finish if they air out or finish we let them finish or air out and then

908
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:54,040
pause the virtual machine you really emphasize an error out there I saw look

909
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,720
on your face earlier and it was like oh shit the build just stopped kind of a

910
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:01,600
look I thought so I was a little worried oh no okay it's just slow but here's the

911
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:06,440
alternative or the alternative is when the theme music ends the Linux unplugged

912
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,320
outro music ends who s has to hit pause immediately on the virtual machine which

913
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:14,720
is more in line with the original spirit of this whole thing that is part of I

914
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,800
have not let anything finish I have right like so I think beards got to be

915
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,680
the decider if we let this one go through and then we pause it or if we

916
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:28,120
pause it during the outro music I say we let it go through okay all right judge

917
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:32,880
judges decided beardly so then hopefully that means next week we may be able to

918
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,640
boot up and get right into sway which would be the first time I've ever seen

919
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:38,840
sway I mean I have an idea of what it looks like but it'll be the first time

920
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:41,840
I've ever had to make sure then we can show it on air too so yes so that'll be

921
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:45,640
that we'll come up with a little way to do that too which will be maybe

922
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:48,800
impossible from Waylon now that I think about it I don't even I have seen one at

923
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:53,880
least screen recorder I'm doing some research in Oh Wayland you already bring

924
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:59,600
me I'll also have in the show notes if you want to read that satirical thing

925
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,920
about the man who became suicidal after installing gentoo that'll be linked to

926
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:07,520
the show notes but okay I feel good about that I feel good about that and

927
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,740
nobody you notice nobody in the Bumble room is participating in the gentoo

928
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:15,080
challenge anymore perhaps the worst idea ever but I submit it would have been

929
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:18,360
even worse video content people like this is just horrible audio content I'm

930
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,000
like yeah you know what have been worse if you are watching us do it that's

931
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,920
even that's even worse so you have spared us all of that now this is our

932
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,760
last live show of the year but we will be back at the beginning of next year

All right, for one last time this year, we got to pick a title.

978
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,940
We got to pick a title.

979
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:18,560
You know, I resisted the urge to do like a predictions episode this year because that's

980
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,180
pretty common, but I did sneak a couple into Linux Action News, so we got some Linux Action

981
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:23,180
News.

982
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,180
Ooh.

983
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:25,180
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

984
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:26,180
Are we getting title suggestions?

985
01:13:26,180 --> 01:13:27,180
What do you think, Wes?

986
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:30,400
Something about BcashFS being a hope.

987
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,760
Yeah, yeah.

988
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:32,760
Help us BcashFS.

989
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:33,760
Yeah.

990
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:36,240
That's not bad.

991
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:39,240
It does play on the Star Wars hype right now.

992
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:44,280
Etcher, because DeeDee is scary, says architect.

993
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,280
Multi-pass!

994
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:52,400
Yeah, if we did artwork, we could have What's-Her-Face from Fifth Element, who, yeah, yes, of course,

995
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:54,520
I bet you guys have been hearing that a lot recently.

996
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,520
Yep.

997
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:01,080
Yeah, I tried not to make the joke in the show too much because I figured that's one

998
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:02,080
that everybody-

999
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:03,080
No, we love it.

1000
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,080
We love it.

1001
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:08,880
Does multi-pass support custom images at the current point?

1002
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:13,480
You can create, you can customize the cloud images and use those, yes.

1003
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,480
Okay.

1004
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,480
Oh, beautiful.

1005
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:16,480
Okay, I figured, but yeah.

1006
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,160
I love those cloud images.

1007
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,400
Those images are great.

1008
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,400
What about rm-rf?

1009
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,400
Slash.

1010
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:25,320
Yeah, that's the ultimate customization, but being really picky.

1011
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,320
For the title?

1012
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:31,440
No, use the bash fork bomb as the title.

1013
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,680
Bash fork, just the word bash fork bomb?

1014
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:36,080
No, the squiggly brackets and everything.

1015
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:39,080
You know, that could actually break somebody's podcast catcher, I bet.

1016
01:14:39,080 --> 01:14:43,320
I will say that is like, if you're trying to find someone who's like, if they're familiar

1017
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:48,400
with bash, it's a reasonable thing to make them explain to you.

1018
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,400
What do you think?

1019
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:54,080
Bash fork bomb is actually kind of funny.

1020
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,920
But I also like rm-rf.

1021
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,160
I can't believe we've never done that.

1022
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,400
How about rm-rf 2017?

1023
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,400
Yeah, there you go.

1024
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,720
That's not bad either.

1025
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:05,600
That's pretty catchy.

1026
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:09,960
And mean something, sort of.

1027
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:10,960
It's not bad.

1028
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,960
It's not bad.

1029
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:15,000
So basically, I'm going to paste it in the Discord and tell me if you guys like the way

1030
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,000
that looks.

1031
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:19,160
Because I can't just, now that I actually see it, I don't know if I like it.

1032
01:15:19,160 --> 01:15:21,600
But I'll paste it here and see if I like it better on screen.

1033
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:25,720
Doesn't that look weird to you?

1034
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:28,880
That looks weird, right?

1035
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:33,000
Sorry, give me five minutes to find where on Discord you posted that.

1036
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:34,480
Well, you just look on the live stream if you know.

1037
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:38,000
It's on the, it's in the, oh yeah, right, right, right.

1038
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,360
What if I took out the slash, I think just slash.

1039
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:42,360
I think, well.

1040
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,360
No, I'd have a trailing slash.

1041
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,360
2017 slash.

1042
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:45,360
Yeah, there you go.

1043
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,360
I like that.

1044
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,360
Really?

1045
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:48,360
That would make the difference?

1046
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,360
Without the leading slash, maybe.

1047
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,360
Oh, okay.

1048
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,320
Because I kind of don't like the leading slash.

1049
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,720
Because it's a directory beneath where you are.

1050
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:55,720
Yeah.

1051
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:56,720
Yeah.

1052
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:01,440
Or even just plain 2017 is all right, as Rekai suggests.

1053
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:05,000
Yeah, I kind of just like rm-rf though.

1054
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,880
But I could, all right, so now if we do just without the slash at all.

1055
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,120
Hmm, yeah.

1056
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:15,000
Okay, oh, okay.

1057
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,480
All right.

1058
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,560
Hmm, I think I like it best without the slash.

1059
01:16:19,560 --> 01:16:21,880
I think you get it without the slash, right?

1060
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,160
Yeah, I think you're right.

1061
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,160
It's a bit nerdy with it.

1062
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:26,160
Well.

1063
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:53,240
Yeah, yeah, now it's not nerdy.
