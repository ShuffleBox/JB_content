WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.920
So we're all familiar with the perpetual joke

00:01.920 --> 00:06.360
about Linux on a toaster, but Linux on a microwave,

00:06.360 --> 00:08.320
it's real and it's here.

00:08.320 --> 00:11.440
Sensory's truly natural embedded speech recognition

00:11.440 --> 00:14.520
and natural language platform improves the ease of use

00:14.520 --> 00:17.120
and feature accessibility in consumer products.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.740
This domain-specific assistant

00:18.740 --> 00:22.340
allows natural language voice controls on small appliances,

00:22.340 --> 00:23.680
such as a microwave,

00:23.680 --> 00:26.040
without requiring an internet connection.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.120
No confusing setup and no risk of lost privacy.

00:29.120 --> 00:30.040
Just what you've always wanted.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.640
Sensory's truly natural.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.640
Now you have voice control for a microwave.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.080
I like that we're on the other side of the hype cycle now,

00:36.080 --> 00:38.160
where suddenly, privacy's in vogue again.

00:38.160 --> 00:39.480
Open the door.

00:41.120 --> 00:41.960
Ha ha ha.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.000
Listen to these guys.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.680
They're using their voice to control their microwave.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.800
Voice genie, cook for one minute and 10 seconds.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.000
Start in one minute and 10 seconds.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.940
Voice genie, pause.

00:55.940 --> 00:57.520
Now. Pause.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.080
I love that it's all local, Wes,

00:59.080 --> 01:01.240
but where do we draw the line?

01:01.240 --> 01:02.560
Do we really need voice systems

01:02.560 --> 01:04.040
that are all independent and separate,

01:04.040 --> 01:05.920
built into each and every device?

01:05.920 --> 01:08.420
Am I some old-school 80s network engineer

01:08.420 --> 01:10.160
that I want everything centralized?

01:10.160 --> 01:12.640
I want one system that's aware of everything,

01:12.640 --> 01:14.840
that can communicate with the endpoints.

01:14.840 --> 01:17.280
Not each endpoint having its own voice assistant.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.640
I mean, I think there are advantages

01:18.640 --> 01:20.040
to having things integrated,

01:20.040 --> 01:21.680
but until you get real standards

01:21.680 --> 01:23.240
that do respect your privacy,

01:23.240 --> 01:25.920
this might be a nice compromise.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.640
One of the things that they laud here

01:27.640 --> 01:29.240
when they're trying to sell this all-offline,

01:29.240 --> 01:32.520
customizable thing is you can use a particular brand

01:32.520 --> 01:33.960
to talk to instead of having to say,

01:33.960 --> 01:36.920
hey, big name cloud company, do this for me.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.360
But I don't know, it's all powered by Linux,

01:38.360 --> 01:40.800
so I think I would say something like,

01:40.800 --> 01:43.520
okay, Linus, start Linux Unplugged.

01:43.520 --> 01:48.520
Hello, friends, and welcome back

01:52.600 --> 01:54.120
to your weekly Linux talk show.

01:54.120 --> 01:54.960
My name is Chris.

01:54.960 --> 01:55.960
My name is Wes.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.400
Hello, Wes, is that a travel size

01:58.400 --> 01:59.800
of talcum powder you brought?

01:59.800 --> 02:02.320
Oh, yeah, it's actually smaller than you know.

02:02.320 --> 02:05.240
You never wanna be in somewhere and not smell fresh, Wes,

02:05.240 --> 02:07.200
so I appreciate that, you know?

02:07.200 --> 02:08.720
You're a guy that cares about that.

02:08.720 --> 02:09.760
This episode is brought to you

02:09.760 --> 02:10.920
by the all-new A Cloud Guru,

02:10.920 --> 02:12.480
the leader in learning for cloud Linux

02:12.480 --> 02:13.560
and other modern tech skills.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.880
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.520
Get certified, get hired, and get learning

02:18.520 --> 02:20.920
at acloudguru.com.

02:20.920 --> 02:22.320
Well, it's not all about talcum powder today.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.720
Coming up on the show, we're taking a look

02:24.720 --> 02:27.040
at a bit of a distro underdog.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.640
We may have found a bit of a diamond in the rough

02:29.640 --> 02:31.960
that has a few tricks that we were surprised

02:31.960 --> 02:35.120
to come across, and today, finally,

02:35.120 --> 02:37.560
after weeks and weeks of playing around,

02:37.560 --> 02:40.840
I'm going hands-on with the Odroid Super Go,

02:40.840 --> 02:44.600
which is a Linux handheld gaming, not tablet.

02:44.600 --> 02:45.920
Actually, it's more like a Switch.

02:45.920 --> 02:48.040
You know the Nintendo Switch Lite?

02:48.040 --> 02:50.520
It's like that, only it runs Ubuntu

02:50.520 --> 02:51.760
and it's got an Odroid in there.

02:51.760 --> 02:52.600
I'll tell you all about that.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.440
Wait, what?

02:53.440 --> 02:55.760
That's really cool, Wes, I can't wait to show it to you.

02:55.760 --> 03:00.160
And also, I have a battery emergency.

03:00.160 --> 03:02.480
My battery is in bad shape in my new ThinkPad.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.320
I can't believe it.

03:03.320 --> 03:04.640
It's already in bad shape.

03:04.640 --> 03:07.280
So I'm going to share the tools that I'm using

03:07.280 --> 03:09.840
to try to save my ThinkPad's battery

03:09.840 --> 03:13.120
and maybe, hopefully, extend its life.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.400
But before we get into all of that,

03:15.400 --> 03:17.200
I want to say time-appropriate greetings

03:17.200 --> 03:19.120
to our virtual Linux users group.

03:19.120 --> 03:20.440
Hello, mobile room.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.640
Hello, Chris, hello, Wes.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.880
Hello, everybody, 25 of you in there hanging out.

03:26.880 --> 03:29.320
We have some in the on-air, some in the quiet listening.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.160
Just the backup we need.

03:31.160 --> 03:32.520
They are our wingmen.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.600
You can join our Mumble Room.

03:33.600 --> 03:34.720
It's open to the whole world.

03:34.720 --> 03:38.080
The information is linked up at linuxunplugged.com.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.560
Hey, before we get into the rest of the show,

03:41.560 --> 03:44.600
I want to put a special request out there for your questions.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.520
We want to do a Q&A episode.

03:46.520 --> 03:47.840
Any topic is open.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.080
You can ask us anything,

03:49.080 --> 03:51.160
and we'll answer as many as we can on the show

03:51.160 --> 03:54.320
about the show, about JB, about Linux,

03:54.320 --> 03:55.560
whatever it might be.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.040
We'd like your questions, because at the end of the month,

03:58.040 --> 04:00.320
I'm taking a family trip to Bozeman, Montana.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.480
I love Bozeman, and every year I try to make it out there,

04:03.480 --> 04:04.680
make it going a little early,

04:04.680 --> 04:06.920
make it a little earlier this year.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.800
And while I'm gone, we want to record an episode

04:09.800 --> 04:12.400
that can go out in the feeds while I'm out in Montana

04:12.400 --> 04:14.520
that will be the Ask Us Anything episode,

04:14.520 --> 04:16.040
and that's coming up really soon.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.520
So if you're listening to this episode

04:17.520 --> 04:19.560
around the time it was released,

04:19.560 --> 04:20.640
you have until the weekend,

04:20.640 --> 04:22.960
because we're likely going to be recording this Sunday,

04:22.960 --> 04:23.800
potentially.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.240
So go to asklup.com,

04:26.240 --> 04:28.400
and there's just a really simple form there.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.200
You can fill it out and send us in your question,

04:31.200 --> 04:33.560
or you can just use the contact form, like always,

04:33.560 --> 04:34.400
or the email.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.640
We're going to be using both.

04:35.640 --> 04:38.560
Asklup.com and submit your question into the show

04:38.560 --> 04:40.280
and ask us just about anything,

04:41.240 --> 04:43.640
because, well, we thought it'd be really fun.

04:43.640 --> 04:48.640
We've never, ever done that in 405 episodes.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.160
We've never done an Ask Us Anything episode.

04:51.160 --> 04:53.360
And you know, it's a great chance to get another domain,

04:53.360 --> 04:54.640
asklup.com.

04:54.640 --> 04:57.240
So go there and submit your questions into the show.

04:57.240 --> 05:00.080
So let's start with the Odroid Go Super this week,

05:00.080 --> 05:02.000
that handheld device I was just mentioning.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.080
And Pycrash, right off the top,

05:03.080 --> 05:04.480
I know you have a question about it.

05:04.480 --> 05:09.320
For me, the Odroid, it was more like a Game Boy

05:09.320 --> 05:13.320
or maybe something like a retro handheld,

05:13.320 --> 05:14.360
something like that.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.200
Yeah, that's fair,

05:15.200 --> 05:18.640
because it is more about the retro games, absolutely.

05:18.640 --> 05:22.520
And so the Odroid Go Super was announced in December

05:22.520 --> 05:24.360
for a price of $80.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.680
And it has remained completely sold out everywhere

05:27.680 --> 05:28.960
until this week.

05:28.960 --> 05:31.840
It's actually back in stock and available for purchase.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.840
So I wanted to tell you guys all about it.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.480
And yeah, overall, it's like a Game Boy

05:36.480 --> 05:38.800
in terms of some of its functionality,

05:38.800 --> 05:42.600
but the build, it's like a Nintendo Switch Lite,

05:42.600 --> 05:43.800
which isn't surprising.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.200
The original Odroid Go from 2018

05:46.200 --> 05:47.960
looked like a Game Boy itself.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.200
And then they had an Advance later on

05:49.200 --> 05:50.880
that looked like a Game Boy Advance.

05:50.880 --> 05:55.200
But this is a shocking price, $80.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.560
That's less than half the price of a Nintendo Switch.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.960
And it has support for PlayStation 1 games,

06:00.960 --> 06:03.840
PlayStation Portable, Nintendo 64,

06:03.840 --> 06:07.160
Super Nintendo, Atari, MAME Station,

06:07.160 --> 06:08.560
a lot of classic game consoles.

06:08.560 --> 06:09.880
It is missing a few.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.600
It is missing a few, but it's got a lot.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.480
With a five inch LCD display

06:14.480 --> 06:17.200
running at 854 by 480 resolution.

06:17.200 --> 06:22.200
It's got a Rockchip RK3326 quad core Cortex 835 arm processor,

06:23.480 --> 06:26.400
a Mali G31 MP2 GPU.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.280
Oh, and it's booting up right now as I'm using it.

06:28.280 --> 06:29.840
A 4,000 milliamp battery.

06:29.840 --> 06:31.080
So it's decent battery life.

06:31.080 --> 06:34.600
I charge it over USB-C and really have had no complaints

06:34.600 --> 06:37.160
because I pretty much always have it plugged into my desk,

06:37.160 --> 06:39.040
but now it's been unplugged for about a day and a half

06:39.040 --> 06:40.480
and I'm still at full charge.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.360
A gigabyte of RAM on this thing.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.480
It has a mono speaker.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.760
It has a headphone jack.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.360
It has a USB two A port.

06:46.360 --> 06:48.240
So you can plug dongles in

06:48.240 --> 06:51.200
because it does not come with wifi built in.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.800
And it just takes a five volt, 1.5 amp charger.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.800
And this thing, this thing all fits in your hand

06:57.800 --> 06:59.600
with a really, really good comfort level.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.360
The buttons I'd say are not the best.

07:02.360 --> 07:03.880
They're not quite Switch quality,

07:03.880 --> 07:05.640
but they're better than some of the earlier builds

07:05.640 --> 07:07.720
that you'll see reviews that are based

07:07.720 --> 07:09.200
on earlier versions of the Odroid.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.120
They improved it when they moved on

07:11.120 --> 07:12.480
from the transparent case.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.920
I still don't love the buttons, but they're pretty good.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.040
And they're laid out a lot like you'd see on a Switch.

07:17.040 --> 07:20.280
You've got a D-pad, you've got two thumb joysticks

07:20.280 --> 07:22.920
and you've got a Y, X, B and A keys.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.480
And it ships with Ubuntu 18.04.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.040
Well, actually it doesn't ship with anything,

07:27.040 --> 07:29.440
but they make it very easy to get Ubuntu 18.04 on there.

07:29.440 --> 07:30.880
It doesn't ship with a micro SD card.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.680
You have to supply that on your own.

07:32.680 --> 07:34.480
So no wifi and no micro SD card,

07:34.480 --> 07:36.960
but those are pretty easy to come by these days.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.520
And the five inch screen on this thing is just glorious.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.440
The screen really is the high point.

07:42.440 --> 07:45.040
Now you don't normally get a screen this good

07:45.040 --> 07:46.460
for an $80 device.

07:46.460 --> 07:50.380
And it really makes these old games just absolutely pop.

07:50.380 --> 07:54.360
And I really enjoyed the nostalgia aspect

07:54.360 --> 07:57.000
of playing like my old Game Gear games,

07:57.000 --> 07:59.680
my old Star Trek games that I used to play forever.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.500
And the fact that at the end of the day,

08:01.500 --> 08:02.960
when I'm done playing with this thing,

08:02.960 --> 08:04.620
I have Ubuntu 18.04.

08:04.620 --> 08:07.860
Well, that makes up for a lot of the,

08:07.860 --> 08:09.400
oh yeah, here's Spider-Man.

08:09.400 --> 08:10.460
Yeah.

08:10.460 --> 08:11.860
Sounds good.

08:11.860 --> 08:12.700
Yeah, it's fine.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.020
That's not even up all the way.

08:14.020 --> 08:15.980
The fact that it has 18.04 on there makes up for a lot.

08:15.980 --> 08:18.500
You can SSH into this thing and install packages

08:18.500 --> 08:21.600
and you know, it's a real full Linux box.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.860
And then what they do, Wes,

08:23.860 --> 08:25.340
and this makes it really kind of approachable

08:25.340 --> 08:26.660
for the rest of the family.

08:29.020 --> 08:29.860
Yeah.

08:29.860 --> 08:32.460
What they do is they ship it with their image

08:32.460 --> 08:33.900
with emulation station on top.

08:33.900 --> 08:36.500
So it's Ubuntu 18.04 underneath,

08:36.500 --> 08:38.940
and then emulation station on top of that.

08:38.940 --> 08:41.940
And that is a graphical themeable emulator front end

08:41.940 --> 08:44.540
that allows you to get access to all the games in one place.

08:44.540 --> 08:47.140
And it works really well with controller input.

08:47.140 --> 08:49.100
And the default theme is clean.

08:49.100 --> 08:52.500
It's a nice PS3 style UI, easy to use.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.340
Yeah, this looks really nice.

08:54.340 --> 08:55.340
I mean, both professional

08:55.340 --> 08:57.180
because it's got all the logos built in here,

08:57.180 --> 08:59.220
you know, kind of a slick, slidey UI,

08:59.220 --> 09:01.460
but also just clear and easy to use,

09:01.460 --> 09:03.300
familiar to someone who's used a different,

09:03.300 --> 09:05.180
you know, but similar kind of game platform.

09:05.180 --> 09:06.620
Emulation station is what's up.

09:06.620 --> 09:09.860
I mean, you could put just about any ROM on this

09:09.860 --> 09:10.700
you kind of want.

09:10.700 --> 09:12.140
I mean, even lineage OS on this thing.

09:12.140 --> 09:13.780
It's got, you know, it's an old drive in here.

09:13.780 --> 09:15.500
You could do it what you want.

09:15.500 --> 09:18.460
But emulation station has that family acceptance factor.

09:18.460 --> 09:19.740
And I'm really glad they made that

09:19.740 --> 09:21.420
their default Ubuntu image.

09:21.420 --> 09:24.940
Because if you can use a console, a game console,

09:24.940 --> 09:29.220
you can use the UI on this tiny little handheld Linux computer.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.300
And the fact that all the games are just listed there,

09:31.300 --> 09:33.780
all of the different emulators, simple, easy,

09:33.780 --> 09:35.540
the family approval factor has been high.

09:35.540 --> 09:36.620
They pick it up and they go

09:36.620 --> 09:39.860
like they would with any commercial device,

09:39.860 --> 09:41.860
like they would with a multi hundred dollar device.

09:41.860 --> 09:43.980
And I've loaded up with a bunch of great games.

09:43.980 --> 09:45.180
So they don't even have to think about it.

09:45.180 --> 09:46.980
They just sit down and start playing.

09:46.980 --> 09:47.860
How was that process?

09:47.860 --> 09:48.860
Was it easy to get them loaded?

09:48.860 --> 09:50.260
Was there just a folder you could dump them to

09:50.260 --> 09:51.100
on the SD card?

09:51.100 --> 09:52.380
Did you do it over USB?

09:52.380 --> 09:53.220
How did that work?

09:53.220 --> 09:54.580
You got a couple of options.

09:54.580 --> 09:55.700
This is where I think maybe Wes,

09:55.700 --> 09:59.820
it's kind of a little bit for more technically savvy people.

09:59.820 --> 10:02.540
If you don't have any experience with computers,

10:02.540 --> 10:03.620
it's going to be tricky because-

10:03.620 --> 10:05.620
So people who like to mess with computers.

10:05.620 --> 10:06.460
Oh.

10:06.460 --> 10:09.380
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

10:09.380 --> 10:12.500
Yeah, you have to either use Samba or SCP

10:12.500 --> 10:14.820
once it's up on the network to get the files on there.

10:14.820 --> 10:17.260
You could probably pop in the SD card

10:17.260 --> 10:18.460
and mount them and find them there.

10:18.460 --> 10:21.860
But what they've done by default is they've turned Samba on

10:21.860 --> 10:23.860
and they've shared out a couple of directories,

10:23.860 --> 10:25.700
a config directory that you need to say,

10:25.700 --> 10:27.780
enable Sega CD support,

10:27.780 --> 10:30.100
and which I have links for information on that in the notes.

10:30.100 --> 10:31.180
And like another directory

10:31.180 --> 10:32.820
for all the different ROMs that are supported.

10:32.820 --> 10:35.540
And it has each architecture that it supports in there.

10:35.540 --> 10:37.300
And then you just drop the ROM files in there.

10:37.300 --> 10:39.100
Over Samba is kind of the best way.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.420
And that's with you like bridging

10:41.420 --> 10:42.820
with the USB 2 port then,

10:42.820 --> 10:44.260
like you're plugging that into your phone or something

10:44.260 --> 10:45.980
or right into a network device?

10:45.980 --> 10:48.740
I opted just to plug in an ethernet dongle

10:48.740 --> 10:49.740
into the USB-A port.

10:49.740 --> 10:50.980
Oh, sure, right.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.580
Cause this is, this thing's just running Linux.

10:52.580 --> 10:54.540
So USB ethernet adapter, right?

10:54.540 --> 10:57.220
Anything the Linux kernel supports, this thing supports.

10:57.220 --> 10:58.380
And so I've got an ethernet adapter

10:58.380 --> 10:59.300
that works great with Linux.

10:59.300 --> 11:00.420
It's USB 3.

11:00.420 --> 11:01.620
This is only a two port,

11:01.620 --> 11:03.620
but I plug it right in and works.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.340
I just love the image of that too, right?

11:05.340 --> 11:06.940
Like that's not something you generally would see

11:06.940 --> 11:08.140
on a switch version of this.

11:08.140 --> 11:09.980
It's just this nice dongle hanging off the side

11:09.980 --> 11:10.820
with an ethernet jack.

11:10.820 --> 11:12.900
And that's how you know it's meant for nerds.

11:12.900 --> 11:13.900
You know, it works too.

11:13.900 --> 11:14.740
Cause if you think about it,

11:14.740 --> 11:18.940
you're mostly playing all retro ROMs on this thing.

11:18.940 --> 11:22.500
And you don't add a lot of those at a rapid pace.

11:22.500 --> 11:23.660
You kind of get them all on there

11:23.660 --> 11:24.740
and then you're kind of done.

11:24.740 --> 11:25.580
Right.

11:25.580 --> 11:26.780
And they don't have network connectivity.

11:26.780 --> 11:28.300
So you don't need it for that.

11:28.300 --> 11:29.660
Right.

11:29.660 --> 11:31.860
So besides the initial setup,

11:31.860 --> 11:34.260
I haven't missed having wifi.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.740
And the fact that this has great battery life

11:36.740 --> 11:38.060
and we can take it in the car

11:38.060 --> 11:39.380
and my kids don't need to ask

11:39.380 --> 11:42.540
if they can like tether to my phone to use their app.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.460
You know, they can just play games and it just works.

11:44.460 --> 11:48.500
And at $80, I feel much more comfortable

11:48.500 --> 11:50.640
buying a few of these for my kids

11:50.640 --> 11:52.660
than I do switches at $300.

11:52.660 --> 11:55.340
And the fact that I could just duplicate the SD cards

11:55.340 --> 11:57.740
so they all have the same games and the same UI.

11:57.740 --> 12:00.660
It's a much more manageable experience that way.

12:00.660 --> 12:02.800
I don't know if I'm necessarily going to keep it for myself,

12:02.800 --> 12:05.220
but I think I'm going to take emulation station.

12:05.220 --> 12:07.500
And I think I'm going to put that on a Raspberry Pi,

12:07.500 --> 12:09.340
my Pi 400 potentially,

12:09.340 --> 12:11.660
and use that as a great, and hook up a controller

12:11.660 --> 12:13.180
and just use that as a way to play retro games.

12:13.180 --> 12:15.780
Cause emulation station is fantastic.

12:15.780 --> 12:17.580
And you don't need a Odroid for that.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.760
You can put it on pretty much any system.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.600
And then I'll let my kids play with this.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.060
Oh yeah, they've even got windows support on here.

12:24.060 --> 12:25.860
Raspberry Pi dedicated images,

12:25.860 --> 12:30.300
as well as support for Debian and a package in the AUR.

12:30.300 --> 12:35.300
I just put a little SanDisk Ultra 256 gigabyte

12:35.380 --> 12:36.600
micro SD card in it.

12:36.600 --> 12:39.380
And you know, these ROMs,

12:39.380 --> 12:42.020
with the exception of like the PlayStation portable ROMs

12:42.020 --> 12:46.040
and the Sega CD ROMs, all the other ROMs are tiny.

12:46.040 --> 12:47.100
They're tiny.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.460
But man, the Sega CD games were not as good as I remembered.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.220
I haven't been able to emulate a Sega CD

12:52.220 --> 12:53.060
in a very long time.

12:53.060 --> 12:56.380
My dad got one, way back in the day.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.740
And I guess he didn't like it,

12:57.740 --> 12:58.780
cause he ended up giving it to me

12:58.780 --> 12:59.700
and I put it in my bedroom.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.180
And at the time I didn't really connect the dots

13:01.180 --> 13:03.780
and it was because my old man didn't like it very much.

13:03.780 --> 13:07.180
But then I loaded the Sega CD up on this thing

13:07.180 --> 13:09.400
and started the old Jurassic Park game.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.080
And it was like a low rent version of Myst.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.020
It was real bad, Wes, so bad.

13:15.020 --> 13:17.580
But you got all that nostalgia.

13:17.580 --> 13:19.620
There's a lot of great ways to play retro games.

13:19.620 --> 13:20.540
We are not lacking.

13:20.540 --> 13:22.020
There's RetroPie.

13:22.020 --> 13:24.220
There's this Odroid Go Super.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.340
This though, I think this sort of takes the cake

13:26.340 --> 13:28.800
because it's the controller, it's the Linux box.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.100
It's all in one.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.000
And it's got that beautiful five inch screen

13:32.000 --> 13:34.580
that just crushes it for these old retro games on there.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.500
And then once it's set up,

13:36.500 --> 13:38.180
it's essentially appliance level.

13:38.180 --> 13:40.540
It just, you turn it on, it boots fairly fast

13:40.540 --> 13:43.460
for an entire complex operating system on there.

13:43.460 --> 13:45.420
And you're off to go to the races.

13:45.420 --> 13:47.260
And if you want to be crazy and SSH in there

13:47.260 --> 13:50.300
and install a web server or something, you absolutely can.

13:50.300 --> 13:52.820
So for 80 bucks, I think it's an easy recommend.

13:52.820 --> 13:54.820
I describe it like this.

13:54.820 --> 13:58.460
It feels like a device that's about 90 to $100

13:58.460 --> 14:01.260
in manufacturing quality for $80.

14:01.260 --> 14:02.620
Hey, that's not a bad deal.

14:02.620 --> 14:05.460
Right, you do have to add your own wifi,

14:05.460 --> 14:08.660
your own storage and likely your own power too

14:08.660 --> 14:10.840
because I don't think mine came with a power adapter.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.300
It just uses USB-C.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.380
It does seem like a nice deal for that price though

14:14.380 --> 14:15.420
just in that if you want something

14:15.420 --> 14:17.060
kind of hanging around a portable device

14:17.060 --> 14:19.260
that you can use for gaming if you're into that

14:19.260 --> 14:22.060
or maybe you get bored with some of the ROMs that you have

14:22.060 --> 14:24.420
but you can also just use it as an extra Linux machine

14:24.420 --> 14:25.260
to hack on.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.780
I mean, I'm already kind of imagining some fun projects.

14:27.780 --> 14:30.380
Like I wonder if our software would use to control

14:30.380 --> 14:32.340
the mixer in the studio would run on there.

14:32.340 --> 14:33.900
Yeah, and I think the takeaway from this

14:33.900 --> 14:35.420
is check out Emulation Station too

14:35.420 --> 14:37.760
if you're not interested in buying a piece of hardware.

14:37.760 --> 14:41.260
This reminds me of this cartridge that I got.

14:41.260 --> 14:44.980
It's called the EverDrive and it's a Super Nintendo cartridge

14:44.980 --> 14:47.980
that you plug into a physical Super Nintendo console.

14:47.980 --> 14:49.860
And what makes this cartridge special

14:49.860 --> 14:52.420
is it has an SD card slot in the top of it

14:52.420 --> 14:55.100
that you can pop in there loaded with ROMs.

14:55.100 --> 14:58.060
And so you can take every SNES game that ever existed

14:58.060 --> 15:01.580
and put it on this SD card and pop it in the cartridge,

15:01.580 --> 15:03.460
put that in your Super Nintendo

15:03.460 --> 15:06.780
and you get access to every Nintendo game from one cartridge.

15:06.780 --> 15:07.940
It's really great,

15:07.940 --> 15:10.140
but you have to have all of that old retro hardware.

15:10.140 --> 15:11.060
And I have that here in the studio.

15:11.060 --> 15:12.140
We got a Super Nintendo.

15:12.140 --> 15:14.300
We even got a CRT monitor for it.

15:14.300 --> 15:17.100
We have the controllers and it works great.

15:17.100 --> 15:19.300
But you get all that kind of same experience

15:19.300 --> 15:20.580
with this Odroid,

15:20.580 --> 15:23.180
and you could probably on something else, I admit,

15:23.180 --> 15:25.480
but the Odroid lets you do it all in one package.

15:25.480 --> 15:26.320
So I really like it.

15:26.320 --> 15:27.980
The Odroid goes super for 80 bucks.

15:27.980 --> 15:29.900
We'll have a link in the show notes.

15:29.900 --> 15:30.740
It's not a sponsored thing.

15:30.740 --> 15:31.720
They didn't pay or anything like that,

15:31.720 --> 15:32.900
but I wanted to pick it up for you guys

15:32.900 --> 15:35.700
and I've been holding onto it while it's been out of stock.

15:35.700 --> 15:37.540
And Wes, you got a chance to play around with it too.

15:37.540 --> 15:39.260
I'm curious, what were your kind of initial impressions

15:39.260 --> 15:40.660
of the build quality and stuff?

15:40.660 --> 15:41.820
Yeah, really not bad.

15:41.820 --> 15:45.260
This green seemed quite bright and I liked the colors.

15:45.260 --> 15:48.780
The joysticks left a little bit to be desired.

15:48.780 --> 15:52.340
I mean, definitely not like full regular sort of game,

15:52.340 --> 15:56.200
you know, first class game controller level, but not bad.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.420
I mean, I think it would work,

15:57.420 --> 15:59.380
especially for some of these, you know, classic games

15:59.380 --> 16:00.860
where you don't need that fine of control.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.980
Anyway, the D-pad felt not bad

16:02.980 --> 16:04.560
and there were a lot of buttons.

16:04.560 --> 16:05.580
Not all of them were great,

16:05.580 --> 16:07.100
but it seemed like you could make it work

16:07.100 --> 16:09.380
for a variety of use cases.

16:09.380 --> 16:13.860
Linode.com slash unplugged.

16:13.860 --> 16:15.980
Linode is our hosting provider for everything

16:15.980 --> 16:17.580
that we've built over the last couple of years.

16:17.580 --> 16:19.840
And if you go to linode.com slash unplugged,

16:19.840 --> 16:23.940
you get a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

16:23.940 --> 16:25.400
And you can try everything out

16:25.400 --> 16:26.460
that we've been talking about.

16:26.460 --> 16:28.420
And unlike entry-level hosting providers

16:28.420 --> 16:31.740
or the big clouds like AWS that try to lock you in

16:31.740 --> 16:33.140
and tie your hands down,

16:33.140 --> 16:35.200
Linode gives you the tools to get the most

16:35.200 --> 16:37.900
out of their crazy fast systems.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.500
You get 11 data centers to choose from

16:39.500 --> 16:41.340
and every service level is backed

16:41.340 --> 16:44.300
by the best customer support in the business.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.580
And when that matters,

16:45.580 --> 16:47.460
it really makes all the difference.

16:47.460 --> 16:49.660
It's not just like one great thing about Linode

16:49.660 --> 16:50.580
that we go on about,

16:50.580 --> 16:53.780
but it's all of the very aspects of Linode coming together

16:53.780 --> 16:55.480
that makes them our go-to choice

16:55.480 --> 16:58.860
for anything we're gonna build today or in the future.

16:58.860 --> 17:01.260
It's really kind of a special combination

17:01.260 --> 17:04.580
of super fast hardware, really dedicated staff,

17:04.580 --> 17:07.740
people who see deeply into the future of Linux

17:07.740 --> 17:09.580
and are really passionate about that.

17:09.580 --> 17:13.220
And kind of a mission to focus on a core set of products

17:13.220 --> 17:15.180
and make them as good as possible.

17:15.180 --> 17:16.780
And now they are the largest

17:16.780 --> 17:18.340
independent cloud computing provider.

17:18.340 --> 17:20.220
Been around since 2003.

17:20.220 --> 17:22.740
And they always ask themselves that what layer

17:22.740 --> 17:23.980
can we now bake in Linux

17:23.980 --> 17:25.420
when they're building the next thing.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.000
On their blog, they have the story

17:27.000 --> 17:28.980
about becoming their own ISP.

17:28.980 --> 17:30.060
And this was a while ago.

17:30.060 --> 17:32.220
And so the areas that they were gonna use Linux

17:32.220 --> 17:34.780
and networking was really pushing the envelope.

17:34.780 --> 17:37.500
But again, they saw where Linux was going.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.300
And so they built towards that.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.420
And if you're not catching out Linode's tutorials

17:41.420 --> 17:42.620
that they've been doing with HackerSploit,

17:42.620 --> 17:44.620
you're missing out on some of the great chances

17:44.620 --> 17:46.220
that Linode makes for you to learn

17:46.220 --> 17:48.960
and kind of get insights into securing servers

17:48.960 --> 17:50.180
on the public web.

17:50.180 --> 17:52.720
One of my favorites recently is learning the various tools

17:52.720 --> 17:54.580
for commands and logging and monitoring

17:54.580 --> 17:56.740
and just checking on the health of your box.

17:56.740 --> 17:58.080
We'll have a link to that.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.780
But really go over to linode.com slash unplugged.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.620
Get that $100 for your new account

18:02.620 --> 18:04.020
and try this stuff out for yourself.

18:04.020 --> 18:05.460
Go build something,

18:05.460 --> 18:08.540
or maybe use this as an opportunity to learn something.

18:08.540 --> 18:11.420
They have really quick ways to take snapshots

18:11.420 --> 18:13.300
and destroy systems and rebuild systems

18:13.300 --> 18:15.580
and bring them right back to where they're at from backups

18:15.580 --> 18:17.780
if you wanna try learning something as well.

18:17.780 --> 18:19.780
There's a lot of ways to host something.

18:19.780 --> 18:21.680
And there's a lot of various companies

18:21.680 --> 18:22.720
that are gonna let you host.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.220
They're gonna do it.

18:24.220 --> 18:27.060
But none of them, none of them are as good as Linode.

18:27.060 --> 18:30.220
Go see why we choose Linode every single time.

18:30.220 --> 18:32.620
Linode.com slash unplugged.

18:32.620 --> 18:37.620
All right, let's do ourselves a spot of housekeeping.

18:37.620 --> 18:40.620
I'm curious, I didn't ask you before the show, Minimac,

18:40.620 --> 18:43.860
but I'm curious to know how the Luplug went this Sunday.

18:43.860 --> 18:44.860
It went really well.

18:44.860 --> 18:45.860
We had a good attendance.

18:45.860 --> 18:47.180
We had over 20 people.

18:47.180 --> 18:52.180
And we had a deep talk about the Minecraft project.

18:52.180 --> 18:56.460
The recording is about one hour, one and a half hour.

18:56.460 --> 19:00.060
And yeah, it was really, really fun.

19:00.060 --> 19:03.340
And yeah, it was really, really cool.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.180
That's great.

19:04.180 --> 19:05.500
Again, I have to thank all the people

19:05.500 --> 19:07.560
from the Minecraft community.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.780
Yeah, I saw some really great tweets afterwards.

19:09.780 --> 19:11.540
It seemed like it was a really good coming together

19:11.540 --> 19:13.660
of two different communities and sharing ideas.

19:13.660 --> 19:14.680
That's great.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.100
Look what the Luplug's becoming, man.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.580
That's so awesome.

19:17.580 --> 19:18.420
I love to see that.

19:18.420 --> 19:19.780
It happens every Sunday.

19:19.780 --> 19:21.940
And you know, every now and then we crash a live party.

19:21.940 --> 19:24.060
Do you guys have plans this Sunday if we were to crash?

19:24.060 --> 19:26.460
Would we interrupt anything?

19:26.460 --> 19:28.460
Well, it will be a normal Luplug,

19:28.460 --> 19:30.940
but if you are recording afterwards,

19:30.940 --> 19:33.660
I guess the whole community will join the show.

19:33.660 --> 19:34.820
Heck yeah.

19:34.820 --> 19:35.860
That's great.

19:35.860 --> 19:38.300
If you'd like to join the conversation in between episodes

19:38.300 --> 19:39.980
or catch up with some of the hosts on the network,

19:39.980 --> 19:42.420
join our telegram at jupiterbroadcasting.com

19:42.420 --> 19:43.580
slash telegram.

19:43.580 --> 19:46.700
And also the Jupiter garage sale remains.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.380
A few sway bags are left, but more importantly,

19:49.380 --> 19:51.100
it's the very, very last

19:51.100 --> 19:54.420
of the Linux Unplugged 400 beer postcards.

19:54.420 --> 19:56.940
I've been including a personalized message

19:56.940 --> 20:00.860
and a postcard with our LuP 400 CNX Tuesday beer on there.

20:00.860 --> 20:03.540
In every rando retro swag bag order,

20:03.540 --> 20:04.940
we slip one of those in

20:04.940 --> 20:08.340
and there is just a small handful left.

20:08.340 --> 20:10.860
So you've been thinking about getting some retro swag

20:10.860 --> 20:12.660
and you'd like to get one of those LuP 400

20:12.660 --> 20:14.700
limited keepsake postcards.

20:14.700 --> 20:18.100
Well, jupitergarage.com now, they go really quick.

20:18.100 --> 20:20.260
So go grab one if you'd like one,

20:20.260 --> 20:21.220
because I think they're pretty neat

20:21.220 --> 20:22.980
and we're not doing them again after this.

20:22.980 --> 20:25.820
So it's a limited time to get that LuP 400 postcard.

20:25.820 --> 20:30.100
And that is the housekeeping.

20:30.100 --> 20:32.500
So this last week,

20:32.500 --> 20:36.380
we really kind of saw Nitrix pop up on our radar

20:36.380 --> 20:38.860
for a reason that isn't typical.

20:38.860 --> 20:41.500
This is a distribution that we wanna talk about today.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.820
It's really kind of something special.

20:43.820 --> 20:47.020
And we were pretty impressed when we jumped in there,

20:47.020 --> 20:50.500
but unfortunately the reason why it was on our radar

20:50.500 --> 20:53.140
is kind of a negative one.

20:53.140 --> 20:56.580
They published an open letter to DistroWatch

20:56.580 --> 20:57.860
stating amongst other things

20:57.860 --> 20:59.860
that for a better part of three years,

20:59.860 --> 21:02.100
they've remained silent about ongoing efforts

21:02.100 --> 21:05.020
at DistroWatch to affect people's perception

21:05.020 --> 21:06.660
of their Linux distribution.

21:06.660 --> 21:08.260
They go on to say they've tried their best

21:08.260 --> 21:11.140
not to engage with DistroWatch's hostility

21:11.140 --> 21:14.580
and their disregard to inform viewers and listeners,

21:15.620 --> 21:17.220
and they've also tried to reach out and correct facts

21:17.220 --> 21:18.380
when mistakes were made.

21:19.260 --> 21:21.500
Going through the blog of the lead developer

21:21.500 --> 21:24.060
of the distribution and reading their open letter,

21:24.940 --> 21:27.260
you know, it seems like they've had a real struggle

21:27.260 --> 21:30.380
with DistroWatch and a lack of exposure there.

21:30.380 --> 21:33.060
And when DistroWatch has reviewed Nitrix,

21:33.060 --> 21:36.500
seems like they've made numerous somewhat obvious mistakes

21:36.500 --> 21:39.340
that have been very upsetting to the distribution.

21:39.340 --> 21:42.500
And I normally wouldn't talk even about something like this

21:42.500 --> 21:43.500
because we can't really speak

21:43.500 --> 21:45.140
to their particular experiences.

21:45.140 --> 21:46.660
Right, we don't make the distro

21:46.660 --> 21:48.460
and we didn't do those reviews.

21:48.460 --> 21:51.940
Yeah, my personal experiences with DistroWatch

21:51.940 --> 21:54.900
does sort of lead me to believe their accusations

21:54.900 --> 21:57.060
as kind of out there as they are,

21:57.060 --> 21:58.660
and as intense as they are,

21:58.660 --> 22:02.140
my personal experience having experienced some,

22:02.140 --> 22:04.580
I would say hostilities from DistroWatch,

22:05.540 --> 22:07.140
it would kind of line up with what they're seeing.

22:07.140 --> 22:08.380
So they may actually be onto something

22:08.380 --> 22:10.260
and we thought, well, what could we do?

22:10.260 --> 22:11.260
We could do our part

22:11.260 --> 22:12.820
and help them get a little exposure here

22:12.820 --> 22:16.740
because, you know, you can look at this distribution today

22:16.740 --> 22:19.540
and you can see it's really likely going somewhere

22:19.540 --> 22:20.860
if the developers can stick with it.

22:20.860 --> 22:25.140
And Nitrix 1.40 was released on May 2nd of this year.

22:25.140 --> 22:26.580
It's based on Debian SID

22:26.580 --> 22:28.780
and a little bit of neon in there, it seems.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.180
And well, it's really kind of a mix

22:30.180 --> 22:32.860
of a lot of Debian based systems,

22:32.860 --> 22:35.620
but it's really rocking a few special components

22:35.620 --> 22:40.020
like a hyper modern plasma on top of a Debian base.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.740
That was enough to get my attention.

22:42.740 --> 22:44.660
But then as we dug into the distribution,

22:44.660 --> 22:46.420
we found a lot of surprising things.

22:46.420 --> 22:47.820
Yeah, we really did.

22:47.820 --> 22:49.820
And that's where I can maybe understand

22:49.820 --> 22:52.300
some of the mistakes on the DistroWatch side

22:52.300 --> 22:54.540
or some of their issues understanding Nitrix

22:54.540 --> 22:58.100
because really Nitrix had a long and complicated history

22:58.100 --> 22:59.740
and there's a lot going on in the project.

22:59.740 --> 23:03.060
I mean, there's a lot of new or original takes on ideas

23:03.060 --> 23:04.900
and there's just a lot of changes they've made.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.580
Like in the past, they were really targeting snaps,

23:07.580 --> 23:10.660
but these days it's now all about app images.

23:10.660 --> 23:11.700
Very much so.

23:11.700 --> 23:15.380
The app image integration is so slick.

23:15.380 --> 23:17.260
It is like I've never really,

23:17.260 --> 23:18.780
I guess I don't use app images a lot.

23:18.780 --> 23:22.740
So it's neat to see a distribution kind of focus

23:22.740 --> 23:25.860
on app image because it gives me an opportunity

23:25.860 --> 23:27.820
to experience it at the same level of integration

23:27.820 --> 23:29.780
I've experienced snaps and flat packs.

23:29.780 --> 23:31.620
You flat pack floozy you.

23:31.620 --> 23:34.100
I do love me some flat hub.

23:34.100 --> 23:34.940
But you know what?

23:34.940 --> 23:36.980
It was great to go check out app image hub for once

23:36.980 --> 23:38.660
and download a few app images

23:38.660 --> 23:40.460
and Nitrix impressed the hell out of me

23:40.460 --> 23:42.860
because you download an app image,

23:42.860 --> 23:46.180
just the action of downloading the son of a gun,

23:46.180 --> 23:49.140
not launching it, not having to install nothing.

23:49.140 --> 23:51.420
You just download the app image

23:51.420 --> 23:54.700
and the system indexes it and adds it to your launcher

23:54.700 --> 23:56.100
immediately, pretty much.

23:56.100 --> 23:57.740
And so you just do nothing.

23:57.740 --> 24:00.220
It's a very different sort of workflow and mindset

24:00.220 --> 24:02.380
from a traditional Linux distribution,

24:02.380 --> 24:03.940
where everything's sort of sprawled out

24:03.940 --> 24:06.380
all over your file system and your package manager

24:06.380 --> 24:08.860
has this detailed little index and database

24:08.860 --> 24:10.700
it keeps of, oh, this package owns these files

24:10.700 --> 24:11.540
and I've done them here

24:11.540 --> 24:13.260
and here's the state that they're in.

24:13.260 --> 24:15.220
And Nitrix and a lot of what they've been working on

24:15.220 --> 24:17.580
and by targeting app images,

24:17.580 --> 24:19.220
it's almost more like Mac OS

24:19.220 --> 24:21.260
but the old days of Mac OS

24:21.260 --> 24:22.900
where you have things more self-contained,

24:22.900 --> 24:24.900
I can just download the stuff, stick it on my thing,

24:24.900 --> 24:27.420
move it to another machine and it just works.

24:27.420 --> 24:30.660
It was really pretty surprising.

24:30.660 --> 24:32.980
You go to do a whole bunch of extra work

24:32.980 --> 24:34.140
and all of a sudden you discover

24:34.140 --> 24:35.460
it's just there and already done

24:35.460 --> 24:37.820
and you have that kind of, oh, wow.

24:37.820 --> 24:40.260
That was so easy I expected it to be harder moment

24:40.260 --> 24:42.380
this one is what you basically have.

24:42.380 --> 24:43.900
And I'm really impressed by that.

24:43.900 --> 24:46.780
But here's the thing that you realize

24:46.780 --> 24:48.020
after using it for a little bit

24:48.020 --> 24:49.700
and we didn't get like a ton of time with it

24:49.700 --> 24:51.940
but we had enough time to realize

24:51.940 --> 24:54.380
this is an opinionated desktop here

24:54.380 --> 24:57.060
and not too surprising because you could trace

24:57.060 --> 24:59.220
the roots of this distribution back to a theme

24:59.220 --> 25:00.540
where somebody was very opinionated

25:00.540 --> 25:01.620
about how things should look

25:01.620 --> 25:03.740
and how icons in the breeze theme should look.

25:03.740 --> 25:06.660
And you move forward now to a desktop distribution

25:06.660 --> 25:08.940
that has brought that same opinionated design

25:08.940 --> 25:11.580
and thinking forward and you end up with something

25:11.580 --> 25:13.660
that's like no other plasma desktop.

25:13.660 --> 25:16.700
It has a top bar, it does the integrated top bar thing

25:16.700 --> 25:18.340
when you maximize your windows,

25:18.340 --> 25:21.540
your maximize and minimize buttons go up under the top bar

25:21.540 --> 25:25.700
but it also has a dock and it has its own custom set

25:25.700 --> 25:29.260
of apps using Maui kit that enables things

25:29.260 --> 25:32.020
to be more convergent, you can resize them.

25:32.020 --> 25:33.780
They have a whole suite of applications

25:33.780 --> 25:36.100
that they've brought to the desktop that are unique.

25:36.100 --> 25:39.780
Yeah, things like Station, a terminal emulation app

25:39.780 --> 25:42.500
with tabs, vertical and horizontal splitting

25:42.500 --> 25:44.140
and some nice features that maybe you wouldn't

25:44.140 --> 25:46.460
take advantage of on your regular Linux desktop

25:46.460 --> 25:48.300
but if you were in a convergent situation,

25:48.300 --> 25:50.060
they've got things like handy buttons

25:50.060 --> 25:51.820
if you wanna send a tab or a control

25:51.820 --> 25:53.740
as well as easy ways to do copy and paste

25:53.740 --> 25:56.140
which hey, honestly, that's just kinda nice

25:56.140 --> 25:57.380
anytime in the terminal.

25:57.380 --> 25:59.220
Yeah, if you've ever used like a mobile app

25:59.220 --> 26:01.540
terminal emulator that adds some of the common buttons

26:01.540 --> 26:03.500
to the bottom, their terminal emulator

26:03.500 --> 26:04.980
does something similar.

26:04.980 --> 26:08.940
They have a video player app that they've built,

26:08.940 --> 26:11.140
they have a music collection manager

26:11.140 --> 26:13.460
and probably the most pronounced application

26:13.460 --> 26:16.900
you're gonna use is Index which is their own file manager

26:16.900 --> 26:19.980
with an embedded terminal, split views, file previews,

26:19.980 --> 26:23.540
experimental web dev support, tags, support for files

26:23.540 --> 26:27.700
and it's a QT app, it's just a little bit different.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.420
It's not Dolphin, it's its own thing

26:29.420 --> 26:32.860
and it's really well done and it works really quick.

26:32.860 --> 26:37.260
It's very smooth and you come away with this almost,

26:37.260 --> 26:39.540
I hate to say it but it's true,

26:39.540 --> 26:43.260
almost elementary OS type experience,

26:43.260 --> 26:45.180
maybe not quite as refined yet

26:45.180 --> 26:48.420
and it's using Qt and Plasma technologies

26:48.420 --> 26:52.180
instead of GNOME, Shell and GTK and Pantheon

26:53.100 --> 26:57.380
but it is a curated Qt environment with their own apps

26:57.380 --> 27:00.340
that have a surprising amount of functionality

27:00.340 --> 27:02.660
and yet a simplicity to their layout

27:02.660 --> 27:05.700
and also a common design language to their layout.

27:05.700 --> 27:07.900
Yeah, that's just it, sort of the integration,

27:07.900 --> 27:12.140
the holistic approach to the whole desktop experience.

27:12.140 --> 27:13.820
Obviously, there's a ton of differences

27:13.820 --> 27:15.660
but in those aspects, you're right,

27:15.660 --> 27:17.140
it does kind of remind me of elementary

27:17.140 --> 27:22.140
or almost also kind of of the very early days of Solus

27:22.740 --> 27:24.260
because experimenting with different

27:24.260 --> 27:25.420
package management scenarios,

27:25.420 --> 27:28.340
different ways to lay out the Linux file system,

27:28.340 --> 27:30.060
that's a lot of what I like about Nitrux

27:30.060 --> 27:32.220
because I think we sort of debate in the community

27:32.220 --> 27:34.140
like what are the value of these

27:34.140 --> 27:36.660
sort of one-off small time distros

27:36.660 --> 27:38.100
but to my mind, some of that value

27:38.100 --> 27:41.020
really is in experimenting and figuring out like,

27:41.020 --> 27:42.940
are there better ways that we should be doing that

27:42.940 --> 27:44.980
even if this isn't what you end up using

27:44.980 --> 27:46.540
on your enterprise desktop?

27:46.540 --> 27:48.980
It might inform the future versions down the road.

27:48.980 --> 27:51.540
Yeah, I think it is a solid contender

27:51.540 --> 27:55.300
for somebody who just wants a modern Debian workstation

27:55.300 --> 27:57.340
and really, they're pulling in aspects

27:57.340 --> 28:00.060
like the Plasma stuff from Neon

28:00.060 --> 28:02.940
so you're getting a really super current Neon

28:02.940 --> 28:04.660
and like Pycrash has pointed out in the chat room,

28:04.660 --> 28:06.660
some of these apps, some of these convergent apps

28:06.660 --> 28:10.340
are making their way into the Manjaro KDE mobile spin

28:10.340 --> 28:12.820
so you can actually use some of these same powerful

28:12.820 --> 28:15.740
desktop apps in a mobile UI

28:15.740 --> 28:17.580
and you know, as Wes and I were talking about this

28:17.580 --> 28:19.140
before the show and we were looking at these apps,

28:19.140 --> 28:22.100
we started thinking, yeah, maybe this isn't such a bad idea.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.060
You come to love a desktop application

28:24.060 --> 28:26.340
like say, Nota, which is their text editor

28:26.340 --> 28:28.100
with syntax highlighting and focus mode,

28:28.100 --> 28:29.860
it looks like a really nice text editor.

28:29.860 --> 28:31.580
Maybe you come to love Nota

28:31.580 --> 28:35.780
and now you could take that same exact application

28:35.780 --> 28:39.300
and you could just resize it and run it on a mobile device

28:39.300 --> 28:42.580
and there might actually be something to that there.

28:42.580 --> 28:44.260
I like the idea at least.

28:44.260 --> 28:46.700
So this Maui kit works with, what is it,

28:46.700 --> 28:48.580
Kirigami, isn't that what it is, Wes?

28:48.580 --> 28:51.100
Yeah, Maui kit and then Kirigami as well

28:51.100 --> 28:51.940
under the hood there.

28:51.940 --> 28:54.620
Yeah, and that technology stack

28:54.620 --> 28:56.700
isn't like something they've just invented on their own

28:56.700 --> 28:58.100
but they've brought in their own special sauce

28:58.100 --> 29:00.060
with Maui kit but it's, you know, it's cute.

29:00.060 --> 29:01.940
It looks like a cute application.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.820
It's not gonna be some weird toolkit

29:03.820 --> 29:04.820
you've never seen or something.

29:04.820 --> 29:06.220
It's gonna look totally normal.

29:06.220 --> 29:08.460
No, but it does seem like there's a lot of nice features.

29:08.460 --> 29:10.060
You know, you get a little bit of a higher level.

29:10.060 --> 29:11.420
You get more aspects of things

29:11.420 --> 29:12.620
that help you keep things convergent

29:12.620 --> 29:14.340
but also just, you know, helpers that you might need

29:14.340 --> 29:16.100
when you're making any app.

29:16.100 --> 29:18.980
At least if you listen to Yuri Harara, the lead dev,

29:18.980 --> 29:20.020
he's done several interviews.

29:20.020 --> 29:22.260
You can find some stuff linked in the show notes.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.140
It really sounds like, you know,

29:23.140 --> 29:25.100
much like elementary folks have focused somewhat

29:25.100 --> 29:27.420
on the developer experience, you know,

29:27.420 --> 29:29.300
with things like Vala.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.540
That's happening over here too,

29:30.540 --> 29:32.700
aiming to have something that's a pleasant experience

29:32.700 --> 29:34.740
to write yourself a Linux desktop application.

29:34.740 --> 29:35.580
Right, yeah.

29:35.580 --> 29:38.660
Yeah, another good comparison there to elementary OS.

29:38.660 --> 29:41.020
I think it's also, this is a distro for anyone

29:41.020 --> 29:44.220
who is currently a KDE Neon user to consider

29:44.220 --> 29:48.100
because you're getting very, very, very fresh plasma.

29:48.100 --> 29:50.620
Plasma 5.21.5 running on Wayland

29:50.620 --> 29:52.660
and they're pulling in the packages from Neon.

29:52.660 --> 29:55.940
So it's, you get something that's a little more curated,

29:55.940 --> 29:57.940
a little more polished, a little more like,

29:57.940 --> 30:01.140
yes, we know you're using this as a daily driver,

30:01.140 --> 30:02.540
but with the fresh packages.

30:02.540 --> 30:04.820
But they do something a little different.

30:04.820 --> 30:07.860
And this is again, where when you see people out there

30:07.860 --> 30:09.940
like DistroWatch who claim it's Ubuntu based,

30:09.940 --> 30:11.180
they're totally missing the mark

30:11.180 --> 30:15.420
because this system does not use systemd.

30:15.420 --> 30:16.260
What?

30:16.260 --> 30:17.300
Dun, dun, dun.

30:17.300 --> 30:19.060
Yeah, they use the open RC.

30:19.060 --> 30:21.060
And I don't even think I noticed

30:21.060 --> 30:21.940
for the first couple of days.

30:21.940 --> 30:24.380
I think you had to say something before I went and looked.

30:24.380 --> 30:27.700
Yeah, I mean, if you're not looking at the boot screen,

30:27.700 --> 30:29.060
because by default they've got a nice,

30:29.060 --> 30:33.100
you know, sort of visual splash boot, you won't notice.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.500
I only started to notice when I went to go try

30:34.500 --> 30:36.540
to make some changes to the system as I do.

30:36.540 --> 30:39.820
And I was like, oh, wait, systemd isn't here.

30:39.820 --> 30:41.300
How do I change things?

30:41.300 --> 30:42.140
You know what?

30:42.140 --> 30:44.340
Somehow the world didn't come crashing down to an end.

30:44.340 --> 30:47.420
Somehow I just got on using the Distro just fine.

30:47.420 --> 30:48.260
No, right?

30:48.260 --> 30:49.860
I mean, otherwise it's a super modern plasma.

30:49.860 --> 30:51.060
It's running on Wayland.

30:51.060 --> 30:54.060
It's a really slick setup and theme on plasma.

30:54.060 --> 30:57.580
Like in every other respect, it feels super modern.

30:57.580 --> 30:59.700
And it's interesting living in a parallel universe

30:59.700 --> 31:01.220
that still just works.

31:01.220 --> 31:03.220
I mean, maybe there are some nitty gritty details

31:03.220 --> 31:05.480
down the line or systemd features you might miss,

31:05.480 --> 31:08.340
but it's nice to see this all fleshed out.

31:08.340 --> 31:10.500
Yeah, and you get a very, at the end of the day,

31:10.500 --> 31:12.420
a very opinionated plasma setup with that.

31:12.420 --> 31:13.740
Like we said, with that global menu,

31:13.740 --> 31:15.940
that top bar based on Wayland,

31:15.940 --> 31:19.220
they use the Nitrix theme, obviously, out of the box.

31:19.220 --> 31:22.020
And it's one of those distros that when you log into it

31:22.020 --> 31:24.740
for the first time, you immediately go, oh, this is different.

31:24.740 --> 31:26.300
It's one of those immediate kind of things.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.180
It's not like, oh, let's go, it's like, oh.

31:28.180 --> 31:30.540
And then you begin to use it and you realize

31:30.540 --> 31:32.840
it's even more different than you realize,

31:32.840 --> 31:35.880
but in positive ways that are fun improvements

31:35.880 --> 31:37.720
in a way that I haven't seen in a while.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.500
So go for it, I say.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.300
I think this is a great distribution

31:41.300 --> 31:43.660
and it's a shame maybe it hasn't gotten the recognition

31:43.660 --> 31:44.700
that it should.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.260
They also offer minimal images

31:46.260 --> 31:50.720
if that's how you roll with i3, if that's your style.

31:50.720 --> 31:51.980
Yeah, I think that's pretty new.

31:51.980 --> 31:53.860
They're also, with that minimal image,

31:53.860 --> 31:56.300
they're offering other ways to install

31:56.300 --> 31:58.100
different desktop environments on top here.

31:58.100 --> 32:00.260
They do note that they really are focused

32:00.260 --> 32:02.180
on the Maui stuff and plasma,

32:02.180 --> 32:05.060
but if you wanna keep the underlying base system

32:05.060 --> 32:06.180
and have something different on top,

32:06.180 --> 32:08.140
that's now supported in the latest release.

32:08.140 --> 32:09.880
You know, Wes, I'm curious what your thoughts were

32:09.880 --> 32:12.220
about the app image based workflow

32:12.220 --> 32:14.340
for getting new applications installed.

32:14.340 --> 32:15.280
How did that appeal to you?

32:15.280 --> 32:18.340
Because that was something for me that was like,

32:18.340 --> 32:20.620
oh, okay, I gotta wrap my head around a different way

32:20.620 --> 32:21.460
of loading apps.

32:21.460 --> 32:23.500
I mean, I can use apt, but this is clearly

32:23.500 --> 32:24.940
kind of the direction they want us to go.

32:24.940 --> 32:27.700
It is, you know, I found it a little confused.

32:27.700 --> 32:29.420
On the one hand, like you're mentioning,

32:29.420 --> 32:31.140
there are some really nice integrations,

32:31.140 --> 32:34.420
but on the whole, I had a little bit of trouble.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.380
And really, this definitely shows from us

32:36.380 --> 32:38.540
only recently having started to play with this.

32:38.540 --> 32:41.020
You know, this is a first take at Nitrix.

32:42.220 --> 32:44.820
But because there's so many different takes

32:44.820 --> 32:46.620
and new ideas involved,

32:46.620 --> 32:48.340
it felt like there were multiple different

32:48.340 --> 32:49.500
transitionings happening.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.260
I'd find some mentions of systems

32:51.260 --> 32:52.540
or ways of doing things in the docs

32:52.540 --> 32:54.080
that didn't seem to be the case.

32:54.080 --> 32:57.060
Or for instance, there's a set of additional app images

32:57.060 --> 32:59.340
that you can have and that are mentioned

32:59.340 --> 33:01.500
as part of what makes Nitrix interesting,

33:01.500 --> 33:03.760
but they're not currently installed by default.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.580
So I had to go find an app package

33:05.580 --> 33:07.700
that I think under the hood just went and downloaded

33:07.700 --> 33:09.840
all these app images, almost reminded me

33:09.840 --> 33:12.380
of the Snap situation in the Ubuntu world.

33:12.380 --> 33:14.580
So I wasn't quite sure, because I got, you know,

33:14.580 --> 33:16.500
I didn't have an app image store by default.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.680
I had Discover and the normal system.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.460
So I wasn't really sure which direction I was being pushed.

33:21.460 --> 33:22.420
I had that similar experience.

33:22.420 --> 33:25.280
And I think when the NX software store

33:25.280 --> 33:26.420
is sort of shipping by default,

33:26.420 --> 33:27.900
it'll be a really nice portal

33:27.900 --> 33:28.980
to get access to some of the stuff.

33:28.980 --> 33:31.300
And that's gonna be a little more clear.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.660
There's things that are just slightly different.

33:32.660 --> 33:36.260
It's not really Plasma, it's the NX desktop,

33:36.260 --> 33:37.900
which is based on Plasma technologies

33:37.900 --> 33:39.580
and looks an awful lot like Plasma,

33:39.580 --> 33:41.280
but there's things that are slightly different.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.700
And I would argue perhaps better,

33:42.700 --> 33:46.000
I sure do prefer the way they handle menu bar icons

33:46.000 --> 33:48.020
and notifications and that kind of stuff.

33:48.020 --> 33:49.340
I think it's pretty good.

33:49.340 --> 33:51.900
The notifications especially, really slick.

33:51.900 --> 33:53.300
Yeah, and it's a real, you know,

33:53.300 --> 33:56.460
it is a really kind of close to Plasma experience,

33:56.460 --> 33:58.040
but not quite Plasma.

33:58.040 --> 33:59.860
And so there is a little bit of this,

33:59.860 --> 34:01.700
am I in an alternative reality?

34:01.700 --> 34:03.140
Because I'm using Debian,

34:03.140 --> 34:04.980
but it doesn't quite feel like Debian.

34:04.980 --> 34:06.780
I'm installing app images,

34:06.780 --> 34:08.620
but it's not quite what I expected.

34:08.620 --> 34:10.300
And it all, but at the end,

34:10.300 --> 34:12.300
it was all very positive experience.

34:12.300 --> 34:15.220
And I felt like we had kind of missed

34:15.220 --> 34:17.180
that something kind of special was happening over here,

34:17.180 --> 34:20.260
because if you take this where they're at right now,

34:20.260 --> 34:22.540
if you take this out another year

34:22.540 --> 34:24.620
where their software center is shipping in there

34:24.620 --> 34:26.700
and some of those other app images are installed by default

34:26.700 --> 34:28.160
and some of these things have been just even slightly

34:28.160 --> 34:31.680
more refined by a team that seems to have a strong opinion

34:31.680 --> 34:33.400
and be executing really well on it.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.620
When you zoom that out,

34:34.620 --> 34:36.420
what you're gonna find is something

34:36.420 --> 34:38.740
that makes for a very special distribution.

34:38.740 --> 34:40.740
And I think at the end of the day,

34:40.740 --> 34:44.780
it's unique value is going to be very modern desktop

34:44.780 --> 34:46.600
on a Debian base.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.460
You don't have to worry about distro politics.

34:48.460 --> 34:51.100
You don't have to worry about what Fedora is doing

34:51.100 --> 34:52.260
or Ubuntu is doing.

34:52.260 --> 34:54.820
It's just good old reliable Debian.

34:54.820 --> 34:56.420
And that's appealing.

34:56.420 --> 34:58.360
Yeah, and that means things just work, right?

34:58.360 --> 35:00.900
Like I needed to get Slack installed, unfortunately,

35:00.900 --> 35:02.980
but I did and I didn't have time to fuss with,

35:02.980 --> 35:03.820
okay, what's the one,

35:03.820 --> 35:05.900
is there a community person who's packaging an app image?

35:05.900 --> 35:08.060
Like I could just download the regular old Deb

35:08.060 --> 35:10.180
off their website, unfortunate as that may be,

35:10.180 --> 35:11.200
and get it working,

35:11.200 --> 35:14.340
because it still had those hooks of a traditional system.

35:14.340 --> 35:16.540
And then when I started using their custom apps,

35:16.540 --> 35:19.900
like station, which is their terminal emulation app,

35:19.900 --> 35:21.860
my first reaction was, oh, well, why not console?

35:21.860 --> 35:22.700
Console's great.

35:22.700 --> 35:25.860
I love console, but yeah, I started using it over.

35:25.860 --> 35:28.140
And I started appreciating things that they've added

35:28.140 --> 35:30.600
and the consistency of the applications

35:30.600 --> 35:33.540
and the way that all these technologies work anyways,

35:33.540 --> 35:35.300
they're all built on top of each other regardless.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.220
It's not like it's some crazy foreign thing.

35:37.220 --> 35:39.180
And at each app, as I started using it,

35:39.180 --> 35:41.060
like index, the file manager,

35:41.060 --> 35:42.540
or shelf, the document viewer,

35:42.540 --> 35:44.780
as I started using each one of these applications,

35:44.780 --> 35:46.940
I got more and more used to them.

35:46.940 --> 35:49.280
And I didn't have that typical reaction that I have,

35:49.280 --> 35:53.040
which is, oh, great, another file manager,

35:53.040 --> 35:54.380
just what we needed.

35:54.380 --> 35:55.540
I was impressed with that too.

35:55.540 --> 35:58.580
It was surprising how low friction it was to switch,

35:58.580 --> 36:00.820
cause I mean, especially I use a plasma desktop

36:00.820 --> 36:01.660
all the time.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.120
So I was like, okay, I'm already used to console,

36:03.120 --> 36:04.300
like, what am I gonna have to do here?

36:04.300 --> 36:06.420
But no, it was no problems.

36:06.420 --> 36:08.020
I could do all of my regular workflows

36:08.020 --> 36:10.300
to support things like tabs, all the normal stuff,

36:10.300 --> 36:11.860
like just no issues.

36:11.860 --> 36:16.200
Yep, so I think it's a big recommend for Nitrux 1.4.0

36:16.200 --> 36:18.180
here on this show, pretty fresh release,

36:18.180 --> 36:19.340
just released like 10 days ago

36:19.340 --> 36:21.340
as we recorded nine days ago.

36:21.340 --> 36:23.700
We'll have some links in the notes.

36:23.700 --> 36:25.700
There's a lot more to this.

36:25.700 --> 36:28.100
There is probably a three episode,

36:28.100 --> 36:29.820
you could probably do a three episode series

36:29.820 --> 36:31.740
just on this one distribution alone.

36:31.740 --> 36:33.780
So we'll try to cover some additional bases

36:33.780 --> 36:34.900
by putting some links in the show notes

36:34.900 --> 36:36.380
for you to go check out.

36:36.380 --> 36:40.660
And head over to their website to get Nitrux, which is?

36:40.660 --> 36:42.380
N-X-O-S.org.

36:42.380 --> 36:44.660
Yeah, go over there and grab that and give it a spin.

36:44.660 --> 36:46.540
I think you're gonna be pretty dang impressed.

36:46.540 --> 36:48.300
And hey, maybe send us some feedback,

36:48.300 --> 36:49.860
new Nitrux users out there,

36:49.860 --> 36:51.580
because I'm sure there are details

36:51.580 --> 36:53.300
and great things about it that we've missed

36:53.300 --> 36:54.980
or maybe some possible issues.

36:57.340 --> 37:00.260
MailRoute.net slash Linux.

37:00.260 --> 37:03.620
Try out MailRoute today and get 10% off the lifetime

37:03.620 --> 37:05.900
of your account and start with a 30 day free trial

37:05.900 --> 37:07.660
and no credit card required.

37:07.660 --> 37:09.900
MailRoute is how we're doing our mail protection

37:09.900 --> 37:11.460
for our new Jupiter colony mail server.

37:11.460 --> 37:13.860
And for 24 years, MailRoute has focused

37:13.860 --> 37:16.060
on its core competence, providing cutting edge

37:16.060 --> 37:17.460
email security.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.100
MailRoute protects your email server

37:19.100 --> 37:21.540
with a suite of services designed to remove spam

37:21.540 --> 37:26.100
and viruses and honestly prevent awful, horrible,

37:26.100 --> 37:27.700
debilitating downtime.

37:27.700 --> 37:30.780
And I gotta be honest, sometimes it's tricky

37:30.780 --> 37:33.540
with an ISP that blocks certain ports

37:33.540 --> 37:35.540
because they're jerks or maybe you ended up

37:35.540 --> 37:37.780
on a blacklist for some stupid reason.

37:37.780 --> 37:39.980
MailRoute solves all kinds of problems like that too.

37:39.980 --> 37:44.260
And you know, admins, it's also very, very, very nice

37:44.260 --> 37:46.180
to be able to queue up mail externally

37:46.180 --> 37:49.540
so that way you have time for maintenance and downtime.

37:49.540 --> 37:51.260
That was a number one priority for us

37:51.260 --> 37:53.060
because there's gonna be times for the show

37:53.060 --> 37:55.620
that we're gonna wanna upgrade our system.

37:55.620 --> 37:58.380
And MailRoute will queue up messages for us

37:58.380 --> 38:00.140
and then when our mail server comes back online

38:00.140 --> 38:02.540
and the servers can start talking again,

38:02.540 --> 38:04.860
MailRoute just conveniently delivers all the email

38:04.860 --> 38:07.020
like nothing ever happened, no big deal.

38:07.020 --> 38:08.980
And it's great for compliance too.

38:08.980 --> 38:11.220
If you work in government and you have certain compliance

38:11.220 --> 38:13.060
that you have to follow, MailRoute's gonna do that.

38:13.060 --> 38:15.100
In fact, MailRoute's one of the few ways to do that.

38:15.100 --> 38:17.580
It's super easy to switch as well.

38:17.580 --> 38:21.340
They have one-click migrations for both Office 365

38:21.340 --> 38:23.860
and G Suite users and realistically,

38:23.860 --> 38:25.020
it's so straightforward.

38:25.020 --> 38:27.060
You set up your MX records to point to MailRoute

38:27.060 --> 38:28.300
and then you configure MailRoute

38:28.300 --> 38:30.180
to point to your email server.

38:30.180 --> 38:32.260
And then you can just shut down accepting email

38:32.260 --> 38:33.900
from anywhere else on your email server.

38:33.900 --> 38:35.700
Only accept mail from MailRoute.

38:35.700 --> 38:39.540
That greatly reduces your attack surface and spam potential.

38:39.540 --> 38:40.780
And then you can go into MailRoute

38:40.780 --> 38:42.820
and they have real-time logs and filtering

38:42.820 --> 38:44.860
that you can look at which is also fantastic

38:44.860 --> 38:46.500
when you're trying to troubleshoot.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.980
That's something I really, really recommend for admins,

38:48.980 --> 38:50.340
get that real-time log search going

38:50.340 --> 38:52.900
when you're trying to figure out if an email even got sent.

38:52.900 --> 38:56.180
I mean, that is just great right there.

38:56.180 --> 38:58.780
So go get 10% off the lifetime of your account

38:58.780 --> 39:01.620
and get a 30-day free trial with no credit card required

39:01.620 --> 39:04.620
just by visiting mailroute.net slash Linux.

39:04.620 --> 39:07.700
Go protect your mail server, keep your system online,

39:07.700 --> 39:10.540
keep receiving email, prevent all this crap

39:10.540 --> 39:11.580
from getting on your server

39:11.580 --> 39:13.580
that gets stashed into emails today.

39:13.580 --> 39:14.860
It's just ridiculous.

39:14.860 --> 39:16.540
And you know, it's only gotten worse

39:16.540 --> 39:18.380
since people started working from home more.

39:18.380 --> 39:21.740
Like whatever reason the spammers went crazy

39:21.740 --> 39:24.340
during the COVID work from home situation.

39:24.340 --> 39:25.180
It's gross.

39:25.180 --> 39:28.180
It's just MailRoute scans and prevents all that stuff

39:28.180 --> 39:31.020
from even touching your system and wasting your bandwidth.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.180
MailRoute just makes email better.

39:33.180 --> 39:35.900
mailroute.net slash Linux.

39:38.940 --> 39:40.780
All right, Wes, we have some feedback.

39:40.780 --> 39:43.100
Last week, we asked for Slexi alternatives,

39:43.100 --> 39:46.180
which is what we used for Pastebin and Ben wrote in.

39:46.180 --> 39:47.820
You mentioned in your last episode

39:47.820 --> 39:50.060
that you're looking for a self-hosted Pastebin

39:50.060 --> 39:52.460
or GitHub Gist alternative.

39:52.460 --> 39:55.180
I've had a ton of luck with Privatebin,

39:55.180 --> 39:57.260
which has first-class container support

39:57.260 --> 39:59.460
and has been excellent for me.

39:59.460 --> 40:01.140
And then of course, thanks, Ben.

40:01.140 --> 40:04.660
He linked us right to their Docker NGINX FPM Alpine image.

40:04.660 --> 40:05.700
So that's handy.

40:05.700 --> 40:08.580
That is, and we've got a couple of recommendations

40:08.580 --> 40:09.420
for Privatebin.

40:09.420 --> 40:11.220
So that seems like one we should go.

40:11.220 --> 40:13.460
We had an email in for the security conscious out there.

40:13.460 --> 40:16.340
I repeatedly recommend a Pastebin alternative

40:16.340 --> 40:20.460
called Defuse, defuse.ca,

40:20.460 --> 40:23.460
which is a pre-internet encryption for text, they say.

40:23.460 --> 40:27.100
It's pie, pie, pre-internet encryption text.

40:27.100 --> 40:27.940
That's pretty nice.

40:27.940 --> 40:30.420
And then David wrote in with cryptpad.fr

40:30.420 --> 40:32.580
an end-to-end encrypted collaborative,

40:32.580 --> 40:37.580
a GPL3 self-hostable Pastebin alternative called Cryptpad.

40:37.580 --> 40:39.740
Yeah, you know, David's actually a member

40:39.740 --> 40:40.980
of the Cryptpad team

40:40.980 --> 40:43.220
and it might be a little more than we need,

40:43.220 --> 40:44.740
but boy, is it fancy.

40:44.740 --> 40:48.300
I mean, it's almost a whole online document solution.

40:48.300 --> 40:49.540
They've got a crypt drive.

40:49.540 --> 40:52.300
They've got a fancy syntax highlighting support

40:52.300 --> 40:54.300
for various programming languages in there.

40:54.300 --> 40:55.940
I only had time to give it a cursory review

40:55.940 --> 40:56.980
when I was going through the mail,

40:56.980 --> 40:59.780
but boy, Cryptpad looks nice.

40:59.780 --> 41:01.580
Zach writes in with a tough one.

41:01.580 --> 41:03.460
He says, I'm a network engineer, but I hate it.

41:03.460 --> 41:06.140
Having never worked on Linux in a professional capacity,

41:06.140 --> 41:09.100
how do I make the career switch to a Linux administrator?

41:09.100 --> 41:11.140
I know some Ansible automation for networking,

41:11.140 --> 41:12.660
so is that transferable?

41:12.660 --> 41:14.300
What other skills could I transfer

41:14.300 --> 41:17.900
as a Fedora Linux gamer to an actual career, Zach?

41:17.900 --> 41:19.340
Well, it sounds like you're honestly

41:19.340 --> 41:21.380
in a pretty good start already.

41:21.380 --> 41:23.740
Clearly you're interested in Linux, you're using Fedora,

41:23.740 --> 41:24.980
so you're keeping up with the latest

41:24.980 --> 41:26.700
and greatest in Linux technologies.

41:26.700 --> 41:27.860
Maybe you're not engaging with them,

41:27.860 --> 41:29.820
but they're there under the hood and available

41:29.820 --> 41:31.140
for you to play with.

41:31.140 --> 41:33.180
Plus, you've already got networking knowledge,

41:33.180 --> 41:35.020
which is a big win, and let me tell you,

41:35.020 --> 41:36.820
there are a ton of developers

41:36.820 --> 41:38.620
and system administrators out there

41:38.620 --> 41:41.700
whose networking chops are not quite up to snuff.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.660
So I think if you can get your foot in the door,

41:43.660 --> 41:45.340
those will be assets.

41:45.340 --> 41:47.220
Knowing Ansible and for automation,

41:47.220 --> 41:48.500
that's also gonna be huge.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.900
I think you just need to develop some experience,

41:50.900 --> 41:52.620
be able to talk through things.

41:52.620 --> 41:53.900
You've already got work experience,

41:53.900 --> 41:56.980
that's on your side too, so set up some Home Lab stuff,

41:56.980 --> 41:58.020
set up some stuff in the cloud,

41:58.020 --> 42:00.740
play more with automating more than networking,

42:00.740 --> 42:03.220
setting up various systems, maybe with virtual machines,

42:03.220 --> 42:04.500
start playing with containers,

42:04.500 --> 42:06.900
if that's the kind of work that you might wanna get into.

42:06.900 --> 42:08.660
Target that, and I think your experience

42:08.660 --> 42:12.020
with professional systems already will really help you out.

42:12.020 --> 42:13.780
I completely agree.

42:13.780 --> 42:15.180
Zach, something else you could consider

42:15.180 --> 42:17.260
is joining the self-hosted Discord server.

42:17.260 --> 42:19.540
You'll probably get a few project ideas

42:19.540 --> 42:21.420
in our Discord for self-hosted.

42:21.420 --> 42:23.420
Of course, you could always skim that show

42:23.420 --> 42:25.020
and see if any of our topics give you an idea

42:25.020 --> 42:26.300
for something to build.

42:26.300 --> 42:30.940
Getting hands-on with something really just is a,

42:30.940 --> 42:33.900
it's like an invaluable opportunity to learn.

42:33.900 --> 42:35.500
You can read about stuff,

42:35.500 --> 42:38.380
you can watch YouTube videos and visualize stuff,

42:38.380 --> 42:41.100
but really going hands-on makes all the difference

42:41.100 --> 42:44.100
and makes it possible for you to speak confidently

42:44.100 --> 42:46.700
about stuff and describe things in simpler terms,

42:46.700 --> 42:48.660
which is gonna do well in an interview.

42:48.660 --> 42:49.700
That's just it, cause I mean,

42:49.700 --> 42:51.980
you likely already have troubleshooting experience,

42:51.980 --> 42:54.620
which is a huge part of the job of a system administrator.

42:54.620 --> 42:56.140
You just need those concrete examples

42:56.140 --> 42:58.740
of like, oh, hey, you know, this isn't working.

42:58.740 --> 43:00.180
I can't make a network connection.

43:00.180 --> 43:02.100
Oh, it's because IP tables, you know,

43:02.100 --> 43:04.340
it's a different syntax, different subsystem,

43:04.340 --> 43:06.660
but the process is basically the same.

43:06.660 --> 43:09.060
And you learn that it's always SELinux, actually.

43:09.060 --> 43:10.460
It's always because of SELinux.

43:10.460 --> 43:12.220
That's really what you learn, and that's invaluable.

43:12.220 --> 43:14.140
Yeah, just turn that off right from the get-go.

43:14.140 --> 43:16.860
Also, Zach, you always wanna be logged in as root

43:16.860 --> 43:18.260
and do everything as root,

43:18.260 --> 43:21.180
including browse the web with your web browser as root.

43:21.180 --> 43:22.860
And don't bother updating either.

43:22.860 --> 43:25.100
Keep that stuff, once you get it set up and working,

43:25.100 --> 43:26.580
never touch it, ever.

43:26.580 --> 43:28.220
Ha ha ha ha.

43:28.220 --> 43:29.220
You know what we could do?

43:29.220 --> 43:31.740
Is we could basically tell Zach how to become a Linux expert

43:31.740 --> 43:34.980
by just telling him all the things he should never, ever do.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.420
Also, when you're at a coffee shop with your laptop,

43:37.420 --> 43:40.180
be sure you walk away with your laptop screen unlocked

43:40.180 --> 43:43.300
and fully logged in as root for extended periods of time

43:43.300 --> 43:44.340
without keeping an eye on it.

43:44.340 --> 43:45.380
That's a great idea.

43:45.380 --> 43:48.540
Ideally, SSH and do a few of your key servers before you go.

43:48.540 --> 43:49.980
Yeah, make sure they're left up on the screen

43:49.980 --> 43:51.900
and easy to identify.

43:51.900 --> 43:55.820
Bill writes in and he has a real good, long question, Wes.

43:55.820 --> 43:58.620
And I'm kind of tempted to say we should keep this

43:58.620 --> 43:59.980
for our AMA episode.

43:59.980 --> 44:02.660
This could be one of our first questions in the AMA episode.

44:02.660 --> 44:04.980
I think you might just be onto something.

44:04.980 --> 44:08.020
So Bill, if you know your email,

44:08.020 --> 44:09.740
you know the stumper you wrote in.

44:09.740 --> 44:11.540
So be sure to check into the AMA episode

44:11.540 --> 44:14.340
and everybody else go to asklup.com

44:14.340 --> 44:17.220
to help us fill out our AMA episode.

44:18.900 --> 44:21.460
We do have some pickage before we get out of here.

44:21.460 --> 44:24.660
And I wanted to talk about an oldie, but a goodie.

44:24.660 --> 44:26.940
And it's a real oldie, but it's still a real goodie.

44:26.940 --> 44:29.820
And that is TLP, the project that

44:29.820 --> 44:32.500
helps you optimize your Linux laptop battery life.

44:32.500 --> 44:36.820
Yep, it's still around and it's still useful.

44:36.820 --> 44:39.820
Friends, gather around and let me tell you a tale of woe.

44:39.820 --> 44:41.860
Stay a while and listen.

44:41.860 --> 44:46.620
So you know I've got this X1 Carbon, the Fedora edition.

44:46.620 --> 44:48.140
Nice little laptop.

44:48.140 --> 44:49.980
That's your shiny new rig, right?

44:49.980 --> 44:52.780
It is a Fedora 34 machine, Wes.

44:52.780 --> 44:54.500
Love it for that.

44:54.500 --> 44:58.460
I wanted to keep my battery as healthy as possible.

44:58.460 --> 45:02.340
I think maybe I overthink battery health in general

45:02.340 --> 45:03.660
for all my devices.

45:03.660 --> 45:05.860
I don't know about any other dads out there,

45:05.860 --> 45:07.180
but I'm the battery guy.

45:07.180 --> 45:09.100
I'm making sure all the devices are always charged

45:09.100 --> 45:12.500
in the family, plugging in tablets and devices constantly.

45:12.500 --> 45:14.100
And I unplug things when they've been plugged in

45:14.100 --> 45:17.180
for too long so that way you're not wearing the battery out.

45:17.180 --> 45:19.500
Because with lithium ion batteries,

45:19.500 --> 45:21.620
when they hold at 100% charge, it's

45:21.620 --> 45:25.100
kind of like keeping a muscle fully flexed all the time.

45:25.100 --> 45:27.220
It's actually not super great for them.

45:27.220 --> 45:31.420
They do better between 40% and 80% range.

45:31.420 --> 45:35.260
And I like to keep mine between the 40% and 60% range

45:35.260 --> 45:37.000
state of charge, unless I'm planning

45:37.000 --> 45:38.620
to use them for something heavy, where I'll

45:38.620 --> 45:39.660
charge them all the way up.

45:39.660 --> 45:41.660
So picky, these devices.

45:41.660 --> 45:44.300
And then you know what, even with that, Wes, sometimes

45:44.300 --> 45:46.900
I'll even do a full cycle regime.

45:46.900 --> 45:50.900
If I'm keeping a battery, say, at 60% on average,

45:50.900 --> 45:54.340
about once a month, I'll do a full all the way down to zero,

45:54.340 --> 45:57.060
back up to 100 kind of cycle as well,

45:57.060 --> 45:58.860
trying to keep them in prime shape.

45:58.860 --> 46:00.560
So that's why you're so busy.

46:00.560 --> 46:03.140
It's mostly just maintaining batteries behind the scenes.

46:03.140 --> 46:05.660
Yeah, I'm in a lot of battery debt right now, I got to say.

46:05.660 --> 46:09.820
So I took the old X1 Carbon out, and I installed TLP,

46:09.820 --> 46:12.580
which Fedora has some great documentation on,

46:12.580 --> 46:17.060
specifically for enabling support for ACP IP aspects

46:17.060 --> 46:18.740
that are unique to ThinkPads, so you

46:18.740 --> 46:21.620
can get really good data for your ThinkPad laptop.

46:21.620 --> 46:23.860
I installed all this, I'll have links in the show notes

46:23.860 --> 46:24.460
for that.

46:24.460 --> 46:28.300
And I do a TLP report to get my battery health.

46:28.300 --> 46:30.900
Now, mind you, and what is this X1 Carbon, Wes?

46:30.900 --> 46:32.780
Is it like three months old, four months old?

46:32.780 --> 46:35.660
Can't be much more than that, maybe six months at most.

46:35.660 --> 46:37.760
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

46:37.760 --> 46:38.980
I mean, it's not that old.

46:38.980 --> 46:41.020
Maybe it's, I don't know, maybe it's six months.

46:41.020 --> 46:42.740
I get the battery report back, and it

46:42.740 --> 46:46.460
says my battery health is down to 94%

46:46.460 --> 46:48.420
on this brand new laptop.

46:48.420 --> 46:51.280
And I know different batteries and different machines

46:51.280 --> 46:54.820
age at different rates, but this is the worst

46:54.820 --> 46:56.460
I've ever had on any laptop.

46:56.460 --> 46:59.140
I've never had a laptop within a couple of months

46:59.140 --> 47:02.520
already be below 95% or something.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.140
I mean, it's just outrageous.

47:04.140 --> 47:09.400
I've got laptops from 2017 that are maybe at like 86% battery

47:09.400 --> 47:12.860
health still, like they've declined at a much slower rate.

47:12.860 --> 47:15.900
I was actually upset about this, because I am very

47:15.900 --> 47:17.860
justidious about battery health.

47:17.860 --> 47:22.480
And so to have a 94% battery health on a brand new device,

47:22.480 --> 47:23.680
it was outrageous.

47:23.680 --> 47:24.580
Yeah, already.

47:24.580 --> 47:26.820
I mean, it's just going to make you worried about how long

47:26.820 --> 47:27.980
is this thing going to last.

47:27.980 --> 47:29.980
And surely that battery is soldered in there,

47:29.980 --> 47:31.580
so what can you even do about it?

47:31.580 --> 47:32.300
Right.

47:32.300 --> 47:34.180
And I want this thing to last forever.

47:34.180 --> 47:36.980
I'd love to use this thing until the wheels fall off, basically.

47:36.980 --> 47:39.860
So that's where TLP is going to help me out.

47:39.860 --> 47:42.940
One of the options when you go through this really long

47:42.940 --> 47:47.500
etsy-tlp.com type config, but it's very simple, very well

47:47.500 --> 47:50.660
documented with the comments just in line,

47:50.660 --> 47:51.900
there is a section in there.

47:51.900 --> 47:54.940
And I'm going to do this for a while,

47:54.940 --> 47:56.680
so feel free to check back in with me

47:56.680 --> 47:58.260
and ask me how it's working, if you want to do this

47:58.260 --> 47:59.740
for your laptop out there.

47:59.740 --> 48:05.540
But I'm sticking this thing to limit the charge to 60% for now.

48:05.540 --> 48:08.220
And the way you can configure it is you can say,

48:08.220 --> 48:11.520
charging kicks in when the battery reaches 55%,

48:11.520 --> 48:15.140
and charging discontinues when the battery reaches 60%.

48:15.140 --> 48:16.980
And so then the battery just kind of fluctuates

48:16.980 --> 48:19.500
between this 5% range.

48:19.500 --> 48:22.160
When it reaches the bottom of that range, it starts charging.

48:22.160 --> 48:24.480
When it reaches the top of that range, it stops charging.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.360
And then you can go in there and turn this off

48:26.360 --> 48:27.700
and let it completely cycle.

48:27.700 --> 48:30.220
And that's going to be, it's a little manual at the moment,

48:30.220 --> 48:32.940
but that's going to be my approach with this laptop going

48:32.940 --> 48:35.460
forward, because I think perhaps what had happened

48:35.460 --> 48:39.220
is I committed that 100% sin too many times, where

48:39.220 --> 48:41.540
I got the laptop all set up, because it's often

48:41.540 --> 48:43.020
my work from home machine.

48:43.020 --> 48:45.340
I got everything all set up on my arm

48:45.340 --> 48:48.000
and my external monitor and my external eGPU,

48:48.000 --> 48:50.140
and I just left everything plugged in.

48:50.140 --> 48:53.300
And I think that's sort of what brought this on.

48:53.300 --> 48:53.940
Yeah.

48:53.940 --> 48:56.060
It's not always easy to have time to unplug it, too, right?

48:56.060 --> 48:57.300
I mean, you've got to remember, sometimes you actually

48:57.300 --> 49:00.020
do just need it to work for multiple hours at a time,

49:00.020 --> 49:01.620
so it can be difficult.

49:01.620 --> 49:02.340
Yeah.

49:02.340 --> 49:03.900
I don't want to think about it, Wes.

49:03.900 --> 49:05.340
You know, I got other stuff to do.

49:05.340 --> 49:07.380
So this will just automate it for me.

49:07.380 --> 49:09.380
Even when it's plugged into AC power,

49:09.380 --> 49:11.580
it'll stop charging at 60% now.

49:11.580 --> 49:14.980
Now, the trick is to remember that if I need this thing out

49:14.980 --> 49:16.980
and about for like a day or so, I

49:16.980 --> 49:19.020
have to remember to disable this first

49:19.020 --> 49:20.420
before I take it off the charger.

49:20.420 --> 49:20.580
Right.

49:20.580 --> 49:22.980
Before you leave, remember, OK, I got to undo this.

49:22.980 --> 49:24.780
Let it charge all the way up.

49:24.780 --> 49:25.420
Is that easy?

49:25.420 --> 49:26.580
Do you have to go change the configs?

49:26.580 --> 49:28.340
Is there like a mode you can change it to?

49:28.340 --> 49:29.180
I think.

49:29.180 --> 49:30.820
I haven't really.

49:30.820 --> 49:33.420
I mean, there is for everything else in TLP,

49:33.420 --> 49:35.700
but I don't really see it for this option.

49:35.700 --> 49:39.060
So that is a little confusing.

49:39.060 --> 49:40.700
I'll have to watch that and see if you

49:40.700 --> 49:42.980
can do it in different modes.

49:42.980 --> 49:45.420
The orange ones, you just got yourself a ThinkPad.

49:45.420 --> 49:46.500
Have you installed this?

49:46.500 --> 49:48.660
Have you taken a look at what your battery health is?

49:48.660 --> 49:49.900
I have TLP installed.

49:49.900 --> 49:51.940
I've got to say the very depressing thing

49:51.940 --> 49:56.300
that it's not actually running on the machine, which sucks.

49:56.300 --> 49:57.860
But I mean, definitely after this,

49:57.860 --> 49:59.260
I'm going to have a play around.

49:59.260 --> 50:00.780
I've seen the TLP conf.

50:00.780 --> 50:02.660
It's absolutely huge.

50:02.660 --> 50:03.340
It is.

50:03.340 --> 50:05.140
So I'm definitely going to be playing around

50:05.140 --> 50:06.620
with this for the next couple of days.

50:06.620 --> 50:09.940
In part, it's so big, though, because it's documented so well.

50:09.940 --> 50:14.820
And there's a lot of just documentation via comments

50:14.820 --> 50:16.780
in line in the config file.

50:16.780 --> 50:19.120
The orange one, if you want to check your battery health

50:19.120 --> 50:24.700
right now, you can do sudo TLP-STAT space TACB.

50:24.700 --> 50:27.300
So that's TLP-STAT space TACB, and you

50:27.300 --> 50:28.860
have to do it with sudo privileges.

50:28.860 --> 50:29.920
And then that'll tell you, you just

50:29.920 --> 50:31.180
have to have it installed.

50:31.180 --> 50:32.820
And that'll tell you the health of your battery.

50:32.820 --> 50:34.420
I'm given lots of numbers.

50:34.420 --> 50:35.620
Any idea which one it is?

50:35.620 --> 50:37.040
Well, what you should see come back

50:37.040 --> 50:39.620
is what your current charge is and what your capacity

50:39.620 --> 50:41.020
percentage is.

50:41.020 --> 50:41.940
Oh, yeah.

50:41.940 --> 50:44.060
I'm at 96.6.

50:44.060 --> 50:45.700
And your machine's from February,

50:45.700 --> 50:48.780
so your battery is at 96% of its original capacity.

50:48.780 --> 50:50.420
Yeah, that's depressing.

50:50.420 --> 50:53.300
I mean, it does spend, given it's my work machine,

50:53.300 --> 50:55.820
so working from home, it spends all of its life plugged

50:55.820 --> 50:57.020
into a Type-C monitor.

50:57.020 --> 51:00.540
But that's not great.

51:00.540 --> 51:03.340
I think they lose a bit almost immediately.

51:03.340 --> 51:05.500
So it's just the way lithium ion batteries work.

51:05.500 --> 51:07.100
But it's different for each battery,

51:07.100 --> 51:10.620
so it's hard to say how that one's manufactured and whatnot.

51:10.620 --> 51:13.620
But yeah, there's also TLPUI, which

51:13.620 --> 51:16.780
is a GTK interface for TLP that's written in Python.

51:16.780 --> 51:19.280
And I think that'll give you this information as well.

51:19.280 --> 51:20.760
And we'll have that linked to the show notes for those

51:20.760 --> 51:22.300
of you that want to try it out and get

51:22.300 --> 51:25.620
the bad news about your battery.

51:25.620 --> 51:27.460
The nice thing about the TLPUI, though,

51:27.460 --> 51:30.380
is it lets you go through a lot of that huge config

51:30.380 --> 51:32.540
with a graphical front end, which

51:32.540 --> 51:34.380
might have been a better way to go through it,

51:34.380 --> 51:36.220
honestly, because maybe it'd give me more

51:36.220 --> 51:37.740
kind of idea of what it does.

51:37.740 --> 51:38.980
So we'll have links to all that in there.

51:38.980 --> 51:40.100
Although I'm not sure if it'll have

51:40.100 --> 51:42.420
all the nitty gritty for each of the niche features,

51:42.420 --> 51:45.620
because while most of TLP is not ThinkPad only,

51:45.620 --> 51:47.140
this stuff is, right?

51:47.140 --> 51:49.020
It's dependent on your ACPI extension.

51:49.020 --> 51:50.020
So there's ThinkPad ones.

51:50.020 --> 51:51.420
There's a couple of different ones.

51:51.420 --> 51:53.580
And then that's how it reads all the smart battery

51:53.580 --> 51:54.580
information.

51:54.580 --> 51:56.220
ThinkPads are the easiest, I think.

51:56.220 --> 51:57.300
Right, well, because my understanding

51:57.300 --> 52:00.300
was there's some tools out there for ASUS and Huawei as well.

52:00.300 --> 52:02.380
But I don't think TLP currently integrates

52:02.380 --> 52:03.660
with those, unfortunately.

52:03.660 --> 52:04.220
Oh, maybe not.

52:04.220 --> 52:04.740
OK.

52:04.740 --> 52:06.060
Now, separate commands then?

52:06.060 --> 52:07.740
Yeah, I think they have some of their own helpers,

52:07.740 --> 52:09.540
because they've got the details provided

52:09.540 --> 52:11.500
by the firmware and the hooks necessary,

52:11.500 --> 52:13.940
but they're not talking the same language.

52:13.940 --> 52:14.900
Oh, man.

52:14.900 --> 52:16.340
94%, just outrageous.

52:16.340 --> 52:18.060
Just outrageous for a brand new machine.

52:18.060 --> 52:21.500
Now I'm going to be checking all the time.

52:21.500 --> 52:23.020
But it's really nice to see.

52:23.020 --> 52:24.740
TLP is just a great idea.

52:24.740 --> 52:27.740
And it's one of those things that I suspect if there could

52:27.740 --> 52:30.180
have been an alternative reality where vendors

52:30.180 --> 52:33.340
kept bundling this, and pre-setting it up,

52:33.340 --> 52:35.420
and integrating it with their laptops and whatnot.

52:35.420 --> 52:37.500
Because it does make your battery last longer.

52:37.500 --> 52:39.340
We've talked about it before on the show,

52:39.340 --> 52:40.500
and it still holds up.

52:40.500 --> 52:42.220
It's still a solid pick.

52:42.220 --> 52:42.900
There you go.

52:42.900 --> 52:45.620
Somebody think of the children, or batteries.

52:45.620 --> 52:48.460
Children's batteries, yeah.

52:48.460 --> 52:50.660
Unpluggedcore.com, that's where you become a member.

52:50.660 --> 52:53.820
Thank you to everybody who supports the show over there.

52:53.820 --> 52:57.020
You did get a special note from me a couple of weeks

52:57.020 --> 53:00.660
ago as a trial balloon to see if we can give discounts

53:00.660 --> 53:02.260
to our members on The Garage.

53:02.260 --> 53:04.860
And I did not get a single issue.

53:04.860 --> 53:07.140
In fact, the only order that had a problem

53:07.140 --> 53:08.820
was my own test order.

53:08.820 --> 53:11.200
Because I put some crazy character in there as a test,

53:11.200 --> 53:12.740
and it totally caused a problem.

53:12.740 --> 53:14.540
But nobody else had any problems.

53:14.540 --> 53:17.080
So very soon, our members will be getting exclusive discounts

53:17.080 --> 53:19.660
on Jupiter Garage original merchandise.

53:19.660 --> 53:24.180
The retro stuff we sell is just sold at ridiculously low prices

53:24.180 --> 53:24.900
already.

53:24.900 --> 53:27.140
So go over there and become a member and support

53:27.140 --> 53:28.380
the show at unpluggedcore.com.

53:28.380 --> 53:30.300
You get access to two different feeds.

53:30.300 --> 53:32.900
A limited ad feed, nice tight, same full Joe Lovin,

53:32.900 --> 53:36.700
but just a little bit shorter, because it's got limited ads.

53:36.700 --> 53:39.180
Or go the exact opposite direction.

53:39.180 --> 53:39.820
Go all in.

53:39.820 --> 53:40.780
Get the full live stream.

53:40.780 --> 53:42.280
All our screw ups, all the stuff that never

53:42.280 --> 53:44.780
makes it into the show, the conversations that probably

53:44.780 --> 53:46.120
should have made it into the show,

53:46.120 --> 53:47.900
but we weren't recording properly yet.

53:47.900 --> 53:50.400
All of that is in that second feed.

53:50.400 --> 53:52.980
And you get access to it, either one, as a thank you.

53:52.980 --> 53:55.980
Or I suppose both, if you're a maniac,

53:55.980 --> 53:57.260
like Westpain over there.

53:57.260 --> 53:58.980
That's the kind of maniac Westpain is.

53:58.980 --> 54:00.220
I'll just take all the feeds.

54:00.220 --> 54:01.180
I don't discriminate.

54:01.180 --> 54:02.300
That's right.

54:02.300 --> 54:04.100
Thank you to our sponsor, Cloud Guru 2.

54:04.100 --> 54:05.740
You can go find them on social media.

54:05.740 --> 54:06.820
It's pretty simple.

54:06.820 --> 54:09.640
They're just slash a Cloud Guru everywhere.

54:09.640 --> 54:11.340
And you'll find them.

54:11.340 --> 54:13.340
If there's a social media site, they probably

54:13.340 --> 54:15.900
have a page at slash a Cloud Guru.

54:15.900 --> 54:17.820
Thanks for joining us on today's episode.

54:17.820 --> 54:19.260
If you do the Twitter thing, you can

54:19.260 --> 54:20.740
follow us at Linux Unplugged.

54:20.740 --> 54:22.260
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

54:22.260 --> 54:25.580
And the entire network of all of these fantastic podcasts,

54:25.580 --> 54:29.540
there's a lot more shows over at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

54:29.540 --> 54:31.940
Some of them may even have some Westpain,

54:31.940 --> 54:33.420
like that Linux Action News.

54:33.420 --> 54:35.340
If you work in the tech industry,

54:35.340 --> 54:37.900
do not miss Linux Action News.

54:37.900 --> 54:39.700
Every Monday morning, Wes and I break down

54:39.700 --> 54:41.860
everything that matters in the world of Linux.

54:41.860 --> 54:44.500
And it's a great way to get informed on your way

54:44.500 --> 54:45.340
into the office.

54:45.340 --> 54:47.700
And we do our best to make sure we get the details,

54:47.700 --> 54:49.020
that we do the research to make sure

54:49.020 --> 54:50.480
that when you listen to it, you're

54:50.480 --> 54:52.580
taking away something new, potentially,

54:52.580 --> 54:53.900
or learning something new.

54:53.900 --> 54:55.180
That's our goal with that show.

54:55.180 --> 54:56.700
Let us know how we did, something we

54:56.700 --> 54:58.500
try to hit every single week.

54:58.500 --> 54:59.820
See you next week.

54:59.820 --> 55:02.380
Same bad time, same bad station.

55:02.380 --> 55:03.180
That's right.

55:03.180 --> 55:04.380
You can join this show live.

55:04.380 --> 55:06.180
We keep the Linux rolling on Tuesdays.

55:06.180 --> 55:09.900
Join us at 12 PM Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

55:09.900 --> 55:12.340
Show up and chat with Wes and I, or join our Mumble Room

55:12.340 --> 55:15.220
and chat with the entire world.

55:15.220 --> 55:17.660
And links to everything we talked about today,

55:17.660 --> 55:21.460
how to contact us, the Mumble server info, the Matrix server

55:21.460 --> 55:24.620
info, and even how to subscribe to our RSS feeds.

55:24.620 --> 55:26.740
We've put it all at linuxunplugged.com.

55:26.740 --> 55:30.620
Don't forget, though, we want your questions at asklup.com,

55:30.620 --> 55:32.420
or you can use the contact form.

55:32.420 --> 55:35.140
We just want a whole bunch of questions, a whole bunch.

55:35.140 --> 55:37.420
Thanks for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged

55:37.420 --> 55:38.260
Program.

55:38.260 --> 55:42.380
And we will see you right back here next Tuesday.

55:42.380 --> 55:47.380
Bye.

55:47.380 --> 56:16.380
And we'll see you next week.

56:18.220 --> 56:21.220
JBtitles.com, JBtitles.

56:21.220 --> 56:22.900
Let's go boat.

56:22.900 --> 56:23.820
One last email, though.

56:23.820 --> 56:25.780
Dan wrote into the show.

56:25.780 --> 56:28.300
This is really the most important email of the day,

56:28.300 --> 56:30.260
but just made it in the post show.

56:30.260 --> 56:32.220
Texas Tendies.

56:32.220 --> 56:34.700
That's the subject, so you can tell already

56:34.700 --> 56:36.620
this is a high priority email.

56:36.620 --> 56:38.020
Says there's also Chicken Express.

56:38.020 --> 56:41.020
You guys were talking about chicken restaurants last week,

56:41.020 --> 56:43.020
but didn't mention Chicken Express.

56:43.020 --> 56:45.980
It's not nearly on the level of babes or canes,

56:45.980 --> 56:48.940
but I'm just so happy to hear the proper homage paid

56:48.940 --> 56:52.580
to the heartland of chicken.

56:52.580 --> 56:53.580
Thank you, Dan.

56:53.580 --> 56:55.540
I did forget about Chicken Express.

56:55.540 --> 56:59.060
I just, I think a good chicken strip is a piece of art.

56:59.060 --> 57:01.220
But you know what a good chicken strip needs, Wes?

57:01.220 --> 57:02.460
A good dipping sauce.

57:02.460 --> 57:03.380
That's right.

57:03.380 --> 57:06.100
Nothing like a great honey mustard or like a house sauce

57:06.100 --> 57:08.260
that's special just to that shop, you know, that place,

57:08.260 --> 57:09.420
that restaurant.

57:09.420 --> 57:10.380
Oh, man.

57:10.380 --> 57:16.580
That's quintessential American eating right there.
