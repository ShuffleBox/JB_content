WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.000
We have a little debunking I want to do. I'm going to pull up Skype right now so that way Matt can call in while we're talking about this because I'm about to get a little upset.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.000
Uh oh.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.000
You guys know how I feel about Linux journalism.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.000
It's crap.

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
It is crap and it needs to get fixed real bad, right?

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
Oh yeah.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
It's an old punching bag of mine. It's not too surprising. Nothing too new there.

00:21.000 --> 00:36.000
Well, our buddy John Grogan over at Linux Journal, nothing against John, I mean he's just doing his job writing for Linux Journal, wrote up a piece that I saw last week, towards the end of last week, he wrote this on August 8th.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.000
So let's see, when was August 8th?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
August 8th was last Friday.

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
And I remember I came across this article while I was evaluating potential stories for the Linux Action Show.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
And one of the metrics that I use before making a story in the Linux Action Show is how much overall coverage is it receiving?

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
And I noticed particularly by tracking the story that it was getting more and more pickup.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
And I thought, okay, this is one that it's now definitely entered the category I need to read.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
And it's Linux security threats are on the rise.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
That's the headline.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Ooh, that sounds bad.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Real bad.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Faith, does that scare you?

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
That scares me to death right there.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Yeah.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Well, and here's the facts.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
Every year, heck, every month, this is directly from the article, Linux is adopted by more and more companies and organizations as important.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
And of course I wouldn't dispute that.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
No.

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
Would not dispute that.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.000
And of course, Linux is a key part of their enterprise platform and more serious hardware of the platform, they're more likely to be running Linux.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
60% of servers, 70% of web servers, and 95% of all supercomputers are Linux based.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.000
So John starts out by kind of outlining something that everybody's going to agree with.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
I agree with that.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Linux has a lot of usage.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Okay.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
So we go through the article and we talk a little bit about the benefits of Linux and its total cost of ownership.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Then we get to a point about what's causing the increased security risks for Linux.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
At least two factors John points to.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
And this is, I love this one.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
I love this one so, so much.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
First one, going forward.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Not saying today, going forward.

01:53.000 --> 01:59.000
Love it when you just get everybody all worked up and then you preface it all on something that's going to happen in the future.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
It's not happening now.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Let's all get it worked up.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
So going forward, the sheer size and ever-growing popularity of Linux will be its downfall.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.000
Simply put, with 15.8 million lines of the most recent kernel, the likelihood of a mistake or a mistake simply increases.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
And mistakes equal vulnerabilities.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Witness the GNU TLS bug from earlier this year.

02:19.000 --> 02:24.000
And with more web servers running Linux than anything else, cracking Linux gets you where the money is.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
So he's saying more lines of code equal more bugs.

02:28.000 --> 02:34.000
This is essentially because the Linux kernel is 15.8 million lines of code, therefore there's going to be more bugs.

02:34.000 --> 02:38.000
So he's saying, so the headline is Linux Security Threats on the Rise.

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
What does he point to as a data point for these security threats being on the rise?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
The lines of code in the Linux kernel.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Now have we not been here?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
Have we not done this before?

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
This is what happens when any non-programmer looks at this and simply equates lines of code to complexity and bugs.

02:56.000 --> 03:00.000
That code is segmented out into individual modules where they have ownership.

03:00.000 --> 03:07.000
In fact, it is extremely improper to measure the complexity or the vulnerability of a project based on its lines of code

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
because you have no idea how that code is managed internally.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
And that makes all of the difference.

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
In fact, the senior director of engineering of Red Hat points out, he says the most fundamental level of vigilance

03:16.000 --> 03:20.000
are things that seem very likely should be no-brainers, but they're easy to neglect or forget about.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
This is the true reality of Linux security.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Vulnerabilities are found all the time.

03:24.000 --> 03:29.000
So the critical piece of advice is to make sure your servers are kept up to date with security fixes all the time,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
i.e. patch your S, like we talked about on TechSnap.

03:32.000 --> 03:39.000
This is why Fedora Next is looking at ways to make your server much easier to have almost in a sense rolling.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
So you're constantly updating.

03:41.000 --> 03:49.000
We just had a story on TechSnap where now, based on studies, really your safest window to patch is nine days of the vulnerability announcement.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
That's your safest time to patch is within nine days.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
And so you can see how existing Linux patching infrastructures aren't necessarily accommodating that new reality.

03:57.000 --> 04:00.000
To secure systems at an enterprise scale, one needs more than vigilance, though.

04:00.000 --> 04:04.000
Of course, he points out you've got to have a real-time continuous visibility, back to John.

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
You've got to have, in order to tackle this increasing Linux security problem, you have to have continuous real-time visibility

04:11.000 --> 04:17.000
across the entire landscape and environment and ability to establish and enforce security policies across the entire environment.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Well, good news.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Good news, everybody.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Because it just so happens, right at the end of this article, John points out,

04:24.000 --> 04:31.000
the Linux Journal is participating with Bit9 and Carbon Black for a webinar to address all of these issues

04:31.000 --> 04:36.000
where they will teach you with one click how to implement centralized security policies on Linux systems.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
They'll give you the technical justification for increased vigilance and security measures,

04:39.000 --> 04:44.000
as well as a roadmap to ensure that your data and your customers' data is safe and secure.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
Of course, the webinar is on August 27th.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
This entire article was to sell this damn webinar.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.000
And the reason why this bothers me is that headline has now gotten this thing in publication everywhere.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
And because the outlet is Linux Journal, everybody's running with it.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
And what I saw on Friday was a couple of sites.

05:01.000 --> 05:05.000
I now see all of the Linux aggregation news sites running this story.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
And it's a crap story. It's not based on any data.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
It's based on the fact that lines of code have been added to the kernel,

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
and the fact that they have a webinar they want to sell.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
Is this not egregious?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
This is fairly egregious.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
I agree.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.000
Was there not an independent testing suite that rated the Linux kernel as the gold standard of code quality?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Right.

05:23.000 --> 05:28.000
I feel like, if you're going to sell your product, can you do it without tarnishing the good name of another project, maybe?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
This is egregious.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
That's how I feel.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Well put, sir. Well put. That's exactly.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
And I don't mean to get on John's case, because I'm sure he was assigned this.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
And of course, you know, this is probably going to be a good talk.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
They want to spread the word about it.

05:41.000 --> 05:47.000
I just think it's unfortunate, like you're saying, to drag the good name of a good open source project through the mud

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
and use lines of code as your backup justification.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
Because it's one of those arguments that on surface almost sounds kind of good.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
And then when you actually think about it, it's kind of a crap argument.

05:56.000 --> 06:05.000
It sounds to me like they basically told him to write an article to push this marketing job forward.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Yeah, I agree.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
It's all marketing.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Agreement.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
I just wanted to rant about that a little bit.

06:18.000 --> 06:24.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's powered by Linus Torvalds' treadmill desk.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
My name is Chris.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
And my name is Matt.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Hey, Matt.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Hey, guess what?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
In studio this week, I'm pretty excited, Faith's joining us.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Hey, Faith.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Hi there.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Thanks for having me.

06:33.000 --> 06:38.000
Hey, so I think, what, last time I saw you, I mean, I feel like we talk almost every day because you've been on summer break.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Last time I saw you, though, Linux Fest.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
Yep.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Yep.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
And Faith's in the Washington area, but like as far away as possible.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.000
Yeah, pretty much.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
So he decided to join us today, Matt.

06:46.000 --> 06:53.000
And it's good, too, because one of the topics we're discussing today is the new beta of elementary OS.

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
And Faith happens to be sitting at the machine in the studio with that beta installed right now.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
He's running it.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
Oh, that's me.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
There he is right there.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
Oh, nice, nice.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Oh, that looks good.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Oh, you got chat on a virtual desktop.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Man, that is looking fancy.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
Now, of course, we're not doing a review because it's beta.

07:09.000 --> 07:19.000
We're just going to give you our insights on it and maybe discuss the project as a whole, the community, their interaction with the community, which I think is very unique for elementary OS.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
And elementary OS is doing some extremely interesting things hardware-wise.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
It's not a smartphone.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
It's not a tablet.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
No, it's much, much smarter than that.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.000
They're really attacking it.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
So that's coming up later in the show.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
But first, we do have some feedback to get to.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
So we're going to jump into that first, as always.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
That's tradition, Faith.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
I don't know if you – did you know that?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
Yeah, no, I knew that.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
Oh, yeah.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
Okay, you did know that.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Yeah, okay.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
All right.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.000
Well, our first email comes in from Kyle.

07:44.000 --> 07:52.000
And Kyle wrote on a follow-up to an email we read on Sunday's Linux action show about the Linux desktop kind of getting him down, how he was kind of disappointed.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Matt, you and I kicked this one around a little bit.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
Well, he writes, hey, Chris and Matt.

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
This is Kyle, aka WiggleWaffles.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Thanks for your follow-up on today's last.

08:01.000 --> 08:05.000
Just to respond, number one, he's not going to switch away from Arch.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
He says Arch would have to be pried out of his cold, dead hands.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.000
He doesn't blame Arch for his recent problems.

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
As he said in the subreddit, he wasn't having trouble with Arch, but stuff that would be an issue on any distro because he installed the beta versions of those packages.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
I've had to do some crazy grub gymnastics even to get Ubuntu to boot sometimes.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.000
So it's not like Arch is alone in his problems.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
He says, in fact, Arch should never really give me any trouble itself.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.000
Number two, he took our advice about picking like a GNOME or XFCE desktop and just sticking with it.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.000
He says he's going to give it a try.

08:32.000 --> 08:37.000
He says, I was wondering if you guys could do a how-to segment on running multiple DEs under Arch and cleaning up the ones you're not using.

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Because I remember Chris borked his Arch install when going from KDE to GNOME and it has me a bit scared.

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
I think that was actually an NVIDIA driver issue.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Oh, was it? Oh, okay.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Have you ever had any problems installing multiple desktops on Arch?

08:50.000 --> 08:55.000
Not really. I mean, I never really do KDE in any capacity, so I can't speak to that.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I just don't care.

08:57.000 --> 09:01.000
But I can tell you with GNOME and XFCE, no, those seem to play well together.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
What about you, Faith?

09:03.000 --> 09:09.000
Well, I've tried that on Ubuntu back when I was on Ubuntu and I got out of the habit of it because it tends to add badly.

09:09.000 --> 09:16.000
Now, I think that's where it happens to go bad is on Ubuntu desktops because they've got specific requirements of the version of Unity or et cetera, et cetera, right?

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
Don't you think?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
No, that's probably it.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
You run Arch now, though, don't you?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Oh, I do, yeah.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
And you still haven't really tried the multiple desktops?

09:23.000 --> 09:27.000
Well, GNOME is the master desktop, so how do you get away from that?

09:27.000 --> 09:32.000
I don't want to draw attention to this, but I had the lower third wrong and I just fixed it.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I don't want to thank my wife.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
She just sent me a text message.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
She sent me this text message.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Look at this text.

09:38.000 --> 09:41.000
Look at that text message.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
Episode wrong.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
The number is wrong.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Thank you, Angela.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
You're right.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
It is episode 53 of The Unplugged Show.

09:47.000 --> 09:59.000
Yeah, I would say the only thing that really bites me when I'm switching around multiple desktops is sometimes you get that mess of like, I've got three text editors now or something like that.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
I don't know.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
We'll bring in the mumble room.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.000
Anybody in the mumble room have any advice for somebody that wants to install multiple desktop environments and play around?

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Is there any gotchas that somebody should be worried about firsthand?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Cruft.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Lots of cruft.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Multiple apps, right?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Multiple web browsers, stuff like that.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.000
Oh, yeah.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.000
Redundant apps.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Multiple settings area.

10:15.000 --> 10:20.000
You're going to fill up your root drive very quickly.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
Selecting multiple display managers as well when you log in.

10:24.000 --> 10:33.000
I feel like systemd made that a lot easier because it's systemctl enable kdm.service or disable gdm.service.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.000
Systemd makes it really easy to move between the different display managers.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
But yeah, that would be my warning.

10:39.000 --> 10:45.000
What I do is I inevitably install another desktop because I like to play.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.000
I'm a tinkerer.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
So what I always do is I start with the grand vision.

10:49.000 --> 10:53.000
This is going to be a GTK only desktop with only GTK apps.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
And then, of course, about 15 minutes in, I remember I have to install Quazl.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
So then I install Quazl.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.000
And then about 10 minutes after that, I think, well, I do like K3B or something like that.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
I have to install it.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.000
What you have to do is just start as minimal as possible and then branch out from there and watch out for clutter.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
And you'll be fine.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
I don't really think there's anything.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.000
You're not going to break your KDE install by installing Gnome.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
That's not going to happen.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
And if that does happen, switch to a different distribution.

11:16.000 --> 11:21.000
One thing I'd also suggest is if you've got Gnome going on and you want to switch up your desktop environment,

11:21.000 --> 11:27.000
Cinnamon's a very easy one to install because it uses a lot of the same programs.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Oh, totally.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Yeah, good point.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.000
Moving between Gnome, Xfce and Cinnamon is particularly painless, I think.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
Don't forget Mate as well.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
Yes, yes.

11:36.000 --> 11:43.000
Mate has a lot of its own apps, including like a different replacement for GYAD as it were.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I forget what it's called off the top of my head.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
And it's got its own terminal, right?

11:47.000 --> 11:50.000
Well, but look, Cinnamon has their own file manager, right?

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
But that's the only thing.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah, and their own control center, but yeah.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
And the other thing to consider is that after some amount of time of messing around,

12:01.000 --> 12:05.000
you might eventually find one that you can stick with and stay with it and then it won't be a problem.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
Right, right.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
Yeah, because it is just kind of an experimentation phase.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
CountZero writes in with our next email.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
He says, the problem with Linux market share.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
Uh-oh.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
He says, hi, guys.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.000
First of all, congratulations on your excellent piece on the Linux Unplugged 52

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
where you talked about the issues facing Linux on the desktop

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
and why the Mac is gaining market share.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
And that maybe Linux might be stagnated.

12:24.000 --> 12:28.000
While there may be a large degree of truth to this problem,

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
I feel that the real situation is a lot more complex

12:30.000 --> 12:35.000
and that it first appears because unless you're buying a Linux machine from a company like System76,

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
well, there's a 99% probability that the machine you're going to get will have Windows installed on it.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
This means that when you bought it, it would count as a Windows sale

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
and consequently push up the Windows market share.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.000
Since it's very hard to actually go out and buy a ready-made Linux machine,

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
it's not surprising that Linux is lagging so far in the sales statistics.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
The main question that comes out of all of this, though, is how do you determine Linux market share

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
when Linux is downloaded for free of charge

12:58.000 --> 13:03.000
and for the home user no support contracts or other arrangements are made that would leave a paper trail.

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
Of course, Google certainly knows how many search requests are coming from Linux client

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
in relation to Windows or Mac, but this is just one way of determining usage.

13:10.000 --> 13:15.000
I guess my point is that because Linux doesn't leave much or actual any kind of financial data

13:15.000 --> 13:20.000
in its wake or a.k.a. paper trail, the market research companies not only find it difficult to get accurate figures,

13:20.000 --> 13:24.000
but frankly are not even very interested because there's no money involved.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
As Chase always says, you got to show me the money.

13:27.000 --> 13:30.000
And you know, Chase does always say that. Chase always says, show me the money.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
Show me the money!

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
I look back at that. For one thing, I've experienced this a lot when you're looking at various pundits and whatnot

13:37.000 --> 13:42.000
talking about the Linux market share is not there and they always point to the same old tired crap

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
that's not even accurate, it's not even a debate.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
But as an industry, we accept it as reality.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Well, there you go. There's the numbers. There's where it is.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
I think he's completely right. I think a lot of people are buying Windows boxes and installing Linux

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
and you would have no idea what those actual numbers are.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.000
Yeah, he says, my own feelings on the subject is that Linux market share is inevitably far greater than any official figures suggest

14:02.000 --> 14:06.000
while the Windows figure may be correspondingly less than their own market share would indicate

14:06.000 --> 14:13.000
since many people just see Windows boxes as Linux rigs waiting to be installed.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
I agree.

14:14.000 --> 14:18.000
Yeah, I think the closest you get is guesstimates, right?

14:18.000 --> 14:23.000
You can look at Steam figures, you can look at web browsing figures, but those are just approximations of certain demographics of people

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
and you're not going to get a true representation because there is no central database of Linux users.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Yeah.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.000
I think it's a combination of all of them.

14:32.000 --> 14:40.000
If you look at it, what it really comes down to is, I think the closest you're going to get is the web browser

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000
where the statistics based on Google or Bing or whoever.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
Or Wikipedia is one we'll sometimes quote.

14:47.000 --> 14:52.000
Some people use Distray Watch, don't they, to pin down market share.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
Yeah.

14:53.000 --> 15:00.000
If you look at net market share, most people use a browser on their computer at some point, don't they?

15:00.000 --> 15:07.000
So it's a fair assumption to say if you have traffic coming from Linux boxes, that's a good way to measure it.

15:07.000 --> 15:11.000
I almost feel like we have to come up with a new metric.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Like Fade here, what's that new tablet you got called?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
Oh, it's a Kobo Aura HD.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
It's an e-reader.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
And it's Linux based?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
It is.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
And it's got a 1080p e-ink display.

15:22.000 --> 15:30.000
So obviously it's a killer e-book reader and you can use Calibre to sideload documents on or mount it as a USB drive.

15:30.000 --> 15:37.000
And that, for you, if you, so I guess my point is say you spend two hours a day on that device.

15:37.000 --> 15:41.000
Does it, should it now be counted as one of your computing devices and the fact that it runs Linux,

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
should that be included in your mix?

15:43.000 --> 15:48.000
And even if you are a Windows user but you spent two hours of your computing time on a Linux type device,

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
how do you properly account for that?

15:50.000 --> 15:56.000
Because that represents a huge majority of people that have Android devices.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.000
That's true.

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
I mean you look at Android market share and that for the use case that you use mobile devices,

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
for most people it's the same use case they use desktop devices.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.000
Yeah, email, social.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
And we like to separate it with this delineation.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
We're geeks.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
But I think it's a false delineation.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.000
People used to get stuff done whether it's on mobile or on desktop.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
I agree.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I think it's a bit of a.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
That's just a false belief.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
It's a false belief.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
It's something that we've divided in our minds because of the way we see the technology.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
But as new people come into it and use it, they don't have those prejudices.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
Yeah, like your kids, when they're growing up, this is what they use to get stuff done.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
The computer is the old weird thing.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
Like when Dylan uses the computer, he's using the quaint thing that dad uses, right?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
That's how he sees it.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
And when he's using a tablet, he's using a real computer.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
Because a real computer has speech capability, it has a camera built in, it has touch screen capability.

16:43.000 --> 16:47.000
And if you have a computer that doesn't have those things, it doesn't have all the features he wants.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
It's like us looking at five and a half inch flabby's.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Right.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.000
Or punch cards.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Yeah.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.000
There you go.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
It is.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.000
It's very weird to think about it that way.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
And that's why it's all going to change.

16:57.000 --> 17:05.000
James writes in about the Ubuntu rant that Matt and I got into an Ubuntu rant at the end of last week's Linux Unplugged.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
And you knew that was going to get Josh in the mumble room.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
I knew he was pulling his hair out while we were going.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Oh, yeah.

17:10.000 --> 17:14.000
But James wrote in, I think, so that way he could say what Josh didn't want to.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
Hey, Chris and Matt, one day I'll make it onto the mumble room.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
But in lieu of that, I had to pass this comment about your Ubuntu dropping the ball rant in last week's episode.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
Firstly, here we go, Matt.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
You know it's bad when it starts out with firstly.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
Oh, yeah.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.000
That's okay.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.000
Yeah.

17:28.000 --> 17:33.000
Firstly, one of the specific points raised, such as the software center, et cetera, weren't necessarily wrong.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
But I contend that every distribution has issues like this.

17:36.000 --> 17:42.000
And the reason we are so upset about those issues with Ubuntu is that we all know deep down that Ubuntu is the closest.

17:42.000 --> 17:50.000
The problem seems that all of the glaring the problems seem all more glaring simply because it's 99 percent of the way there.

17:50.000 --> 17:55.000
If it was 70 percent as some other distros were, then it simply wouldn't get that upset about it.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
I don't know if I agree with that.

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
I completely agree with it.

17:58.000 --> 18:05.000
I think he literally like climbed inside my brain and stated exactly why I get so that's why I get so much grief about it.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
Because I do care.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
I care about Ubuntu and it is the closest.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.000
I completely totally agree.

18:09.000 --> 18:15.000
So you think because it's in that uncanny valley and that gap is so close to being closed that we get frustrated they didn't just finish it.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.000
Exactly.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
It's like they're I mean, they've already got the they've got the skeleton there.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
They've got the know how.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
I would argue they have the resources.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
They may differ, but I believe they do.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
I've seen evidence of it.

18:25.000 --> 18:28.000
I've just seen the things they've done so far and believe they can.

18:28.000 --> 18:33.000
And it feels like they get so close to the finish line and they're like, oh, hey, look mobile.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
It's just kind of like it's like, really, guys, come on.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Yeah, I would completely agree.

18:38.000 --> 18:43.000
When you bought your Ultra Pro, it came with the Unity desktop and then you reloaded to Arch with Gnome.

18:43.000 --> 18:49.000
Yes, to you, does do you doesn't doesn't Gnome feel like a more completed product to you?

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
So I like those percentages you gave.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.000
I feel like it's ninety nine percent of the way there for most people.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Ubuntu or Gnome?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Ubuntu with Unity.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Yeah.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
For the needs, not wants of most people.

18:59.000 --> 19:06.000
And it's about 70 percent of the way of what it could be if you really focused on the desktop, which is why I use Gnome, because they never stop focusing on it.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
And maybe Unity 8 will be simply amazing, but we don't know because it's not a thing yet.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Other than on mobile.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.000
That's a good point.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
All right.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
So that was his first point.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
He said, I have to say that in comparison with Android and we did make a comparison to Android.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
He said that he thought was kind of telling.

19:21.000 --> 19:27.000
Traditional Linux distros have always been just a little lacking on integration needed to produce what we've all seemed to want.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
And this will not change in the next few years.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Android solved that issue.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
So what did Android do?

19:33.000 --> 19:41.000
It took the Linux kernel and a subset of tools and it developed its own user space, its own integrated display manager and its own SDK.

19:41.000 --> 19:47.000
I think it's worth considering that what Canonical is doing is not getting lost off in mobile land and ignoring the desktop,

19:47.000 --> 19:58.000
but actually doing R&D on how to pull off an Android style revamp of its desktop while at the same time pulling off a large number or pulling in a new large number of developers.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
Let's be honest.

19:59.000 --> 20:05.000
Canonical is plugging the desktop hard, but in places where Microsoft does not have a huge monopoly.

20:05.000 --> 20:11.000
Is it worth spending limited funds providing and offering to say 2 million potential customers in the US?

20:11.000 --> 20:18.000
Or should they go to Brazil, Africa and India and put that offering in front of 2 billion potential customers,

20:18.000 --> 20:24.000
which will provide a larger foothold to build on for developers and to build applications needed to make Linux desktop a reality?

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
Sure, it's a risky strategy.

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
Unity 8 and Mirror might end up being bad, but Canonical in this case is like the Swan.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
Everything looks calm on the surface.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.000
But furious paddling is occurring under the water.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Only time will tell.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
That's a great email, James.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
That was actually fantastic.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.000
Yeah, I could see where they're going with that.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
I definitely can.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.000
My concern is that it's once again, it's grass is greener on the other side.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
As soon as we get this done, Matt, as soon as we get this done, it'll be fine.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
Yeah, exactly.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
That's it.

20:55.000 --> 21:01.000
And on top of that, I think if you really look at it practically, rather than owning a market that quite honestly is not dead,

21:01.000 --> 21:05.000
yeah, it's stagnated, but again, you're not trying to get people to buy new hardware.

21:05.000 --> 21:09.000
You're trying to get people to get them to use their hardware again in ways they may not have previously.

21:09.000 --> 21:16.000
Instead of going that direction, they're basically trying to invent something no one really asked for, in my opinion.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
Geeks have asked for more mobile stuff, sure.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
Joe Average doesn't care.

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
And being they make up most of the numbers arguably, I think they're wasting their time.

21:24.000 --> 21:28.000
I don't really understand the real benefit there, but they could prove me wrong.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
It's happened before.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
I hope they do.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
It's not a wasted effort.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.000
I hope it's not a wasted effort.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
I hope they prove us wrong.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
I don't know.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
I mean, we'll see.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Sure.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
It very well.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.000
I think it's wasted effort.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
That'd be awesome if it could.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
Yeah, it would be.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
It would be amazing, to be honest with you.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
It would be salvation for a lot of people who are looking for a solution.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Definitely.

21:43.000 --> 21:50.000
But wasn't one of the things you were talking about last week was that the Mac user experience is so great because it's got all this integration,

21:50.000 --> 21:55.000
and therefore, developers are willing to put the time and effort in to that user space.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.000
Well, if Linux had something like that, would that not benefit us?

21:59.000 --> 22:03.000
I don't know if I've ever said the Mac is well integrated because I don't know if that –

22:03.000 --> 22:10.000
I think when we think of integration, what do we – I think when I think integration, I think KDE, right, where all of the K apps.

22:10.000 --> 22:17.000
But the real integration, the integration that matters is like the API and that type of stuff,

22:17.000 --> 22:23.000
where you can write something for iOS, and then with very little code surfacing on the surface rewriting,

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
you can make that application available on Mac OS X.

22:26.000 --> 22:30.000
That type of integration that inspires developers to write for the platform,

22:30.000 --> 22:34.000
and then those good applications inspire users to move to the platform.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
What sells consoles? An incredible game.

22:36.000 --> 22:45.000
And that's the kind of story that Canonical is pitching is you will be able to write a QMLJS or a Qt application that runs on the mobile,

22:45.000 --> 22:50.000
that runs on the tablet, that runs on the desktop with very minor changes.

22:50.000 --> 23:01.000
That's a very compelling story, and it might result in some really decent applications coming to Linux that we might not have thought of before.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.000
It might be a pipe dream, too, though.

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
They've been talking about it for years.

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
Yeah, I think the problem that we have with it isn't so much that they're going in a new direction that may or may not be successful for them.

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
It's that they have such a large market share and so many people rely on them that them focusing the efforts,

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
their limited finite resources on something that's unproven and generally unwanted,

23:21.000 --> 23:26.000
it does result in negligence of the platform that we all love right now.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
Google has the resources to focus on anything they want to.

23:29.000 --> 23:34.000
I think it's the negligence of the platform we all love now that has us upset.

23:34.000 --> 23:40.000
But you can make a good case that the people who we really need to have adopting it right now don't want necessarily a moving target.

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
Take India.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
In some ways, a non-moving target is a good thing.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
So it depends on who you want to have adoption.

23:48.000 --> 23:52.000
What I really have is the end game.

23:52.000 --> 23:58.000
This is where I truly, deeply am concerned about the canonical strategy.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Let's be honest.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
Who's going to buy Ubuntu Touch devices in mass numbers?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
And I'm talking millions.

24:03.000 --> 24:04.000
It's carriers.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.000
Why?

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
Because they're already working with carriers to develop the platform so that way those carriers can modify it.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
So that way it's Verizon OS.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It's AT&T OS.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
It's Orange OS.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
Whatever the carrier is, it's their operating system with their store, with their services.

24:20.000 --> 24:25.000
What we will be moving to with Ubuntu Touch is not just operating system lock-in.

24:25.000 --> 24:33.000
We will be moving into an era of carrier lock-in where you buy an app and that app is only available from the carrier store

24:33.000 --> 24:37.000
because they control the experience from the operating system all the way up to the connection.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
And it will be carrier lock-in and phone lock-in.

24:40.000 --> 24:42.000
It will be a new breed of evil.

24:42.000 --> 24:49.000
The idea is you, as in like the carrier or whatever, would be able to, say for instance, Ting.

24:49.000 --> 24:55.000
Ting would be able to develop a Ting scope that works on the Unity mobile experience.

24:55.000 --> 25:04.000
And you would be able to use their scope or they would be able to tie in music purchasing into the music scope if they wanted to.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
Does that mean carrier lock-in?

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Yes.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
Sort of.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
But if the content you're buying is only available from that carrier and you switch to a different carrier,

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
you lose access to the content.

25:16.000 --> 25:23.000
It's not like the carrier is going to be completely stripping out the application store from Ubuntu Touch.

25:23.000 --> 25:27.000
They're only going to be adding particular stuff onto scopes.

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
I agree.

25:28.000 --> 25:33.000
I don't know here because I've had those really bad prepaid phones since I was a kid

25:33.000 --> 25:38.000
and they try and ship their store, their ringtones, their music, all of that stuff on there and nobody buys it.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
Well, you don't.

25:39.000 --> 25:43.000
It's bad, but they've never had a platform that sits on a smartphone.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
And when it's on a smartphone, it's shiny and appealing.

25:46.000 --> 25:51.000
And if they go to Canonical and say, hey, we'd love to ship your product if you let us do this, what's Canonical going to say?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.000
Of course.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.000
Right.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
They need the sale.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
Exactly.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.000
They have no resources.

25:56.000 --> 26:05.000
You have to remember that when your platform is divided and used in all sorts of different facets, that's a problem that winners have.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.000
Right.

26:06.000 --> 26:09.000
Well, and let's go back to Android for a second.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.000
Thank you, Noah.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.000
So let's talk about this.

26:11.000 --> 26:18.000
Look exactly at the user sacrifices that Android decided to make in order to accomplish carrier adoption.

26:18.000 --> 26:26.000
They conceded things that we all now hate, the ability to install software, the ability to delay updates.

26:26.000 --> 26:34.000
These types of things that we all absolutely hate as Android users were done so that way they could get in the door and compete with the iPhone.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.000
Well, we are now seven years later, ladies and gentlemen.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.000
So imagine how much more locked up that is.

26:40.000 --> 26:48.000
The only way to penetrate, and I want to underscore the word penetrate, that market, is by bending over and letting them do anything you want.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
And if that means making a scope, that's where it begins.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
It will be a themed operating system.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.000
They will have backgrounds.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
They will have app stores.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.000
They will have video stores.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
They will have e-book stores.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
It will be the V-cast store.

26:59.000 --> 27:00.000
It will be the V-app store.

27:00.000 --> 27:11.000
And the reason why I hate that we are ignoring the desktop is because we are building, and I say we, I mean Canonical, are building a future in which I don't want that anyways.

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
Like even if we get there, the worst case scenario is that Ubuntu Touch is actually adopted.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
It's bad for users.

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000
It's bad for the market.

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
Worst case scenario, worst case scenario is that Ubuntu Touch is successful.

27:24.000 --> 27:25.000
Think about it.

27:25.000 --> 27:29.000
Everything we don't like about Android, much worse.

27:29.000 --> 27:35.000
But what about the fact that the Android can be, you can install Ubuntu Touch on Android with like one button.

27:35.000 --> 27:40.000
But Canonical can make it where you can just disable all the carrier crap with one button.

27:40.000 --> 27:45.000
Well, I mean obviously, if there's something like that, then it's the Jesus platform.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.000
But right now, I don't.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
And you've got to look at motivation.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
Who's putting money in their pockets?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.000
We're not.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.000
Right.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.000
Why the hell would they do that?

27:53.000 --> 27:56.000
Like if I'm a carrier, wouldn't I want to remove that functionality?

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
I wish they would, but I can't see that.

27:59.000 --> 28:05.000
There's only one group of organizations in the entire world that are worse than banks, and that's carriers.

28:05.000 --> 28:12.000
Most of the time, like the only people that upset me more on a daily basis besides the financial industry is the freaking telco industry

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
because I have to interface with them constantly, and it's so aggravating.

28:16.000 --> 28:22.000
So giving them more power, giving them a platform, that sounds like the worst thing ever.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
If you create a vendor-locked-in platform like that, if they're successful, which why wouldn't they be?

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
If you're going to ship an Ubuntu Touch product, you're going to make any kind of demands you like,

28:29.000 --> 28:32.000
and they're going to be met, or you're not going to ship it.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.000
The two-year contract that you're locked into, even if you don't like it, tough.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.000
You've got two years before you can do something else, and by then, you'll be locked in.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
Well, you're going to take that phone over to another carrier?

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
It's got all the other carriers' image on it.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
And then we go into this argument that I love, like when I complain about the stuff about Android,

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
I always get the, well, you could install CyanogenMod.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.000
Well, I mean, sure, in Ubuntu Touch, you could flash it yourself.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
Okay, that's great for the 2,000 people in the entire world that will do that.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
Good job, everybody.

28:57.000 --> 29:02.000
But for the millions of people that will have no idea what that even means, it doesn't do squat.

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
Fair enough.

29:03.000 --> 29:07.000
I was just thinking about, this is kind of down, but if you think of the tablet industry, though,

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
that's not tied to a central carrier.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
Somebody like System76 or even just box stores could potentially ship a product.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
I would be more excited about that.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
I would be a lot more excited if it was like Ubuntu Touch for tablets, and that would probably be where I use it.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
I'm not so excited about the carrier versions.

29:24.000 --> 29:30.000
For me personally, I'm already running Ubuntu Touch on my Nexus.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
I am really looking forward to it as an enthusiast, getting to play with it.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
But the thing is, I have to be realistic about what the mass market implementation will be.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
And that's damn depressing.

29:41.000 --> 29:43.000
Personally, to play with, I'm all excited for it.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.000
Have at it, right?

29:44.000 --> 29:48.000
But I don't think it's worth sacrificing the two years.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.000
It feels like, I don't know, it feels at least like the last year has been lost on the desktop.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
But don't you think that the people that care enough to flash their phones are going to be the ones that flash their phones?

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
And the people that don't know how to flash their phones are the ones that probably don't care?

30:02.000 --> 30:07.000
I think people don't care until they decide, wait a minute, my carrier is screwing me and I want to move.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
Or they think, oh, I don't like this anymore.

30:09.000 --> 30:16.000
For me, I've recently come to the conclusion that I'm a little more uncomfortable with Android than I originally realized.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
And so I decided I'm going to try out an iOS device.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
Well, there goes all the apps I've ever bought.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.000
Screw you, Chris.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Same developers.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.000
You've spent the money.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.000
Screw yourself.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
You're done.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
Regular people are not willing to make that decision.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Shouldn't they get paid?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.000
Right.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.000
But see, what Faith just said, I underscore, is I don't necessarily hold the developers guilty for that.

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000
But like Faith said, normal people will look at that and say, well, geez, that's about another phone's worth of apps I've bought.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
I'm not switching.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
And they're already locked in.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.000
Now, add the carrier level to that, guys.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
I mean, just think about that.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
That is freaky.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.000
Well, we'll see.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
You know what?

30:50.000 --> 30:53.000
We shouldn't get too worked up, honestly, because who knows what could happen.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
There could be a way to strike a balance here.

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000
And maybe Canonical is the one that could set a tone for the rest of the industry to follow.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
And if not, Yolophone.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Yeah.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.000
Sure.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.000
Yeah, I'm rocking one right now.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.000
It's not loaded up with a bunch of DNA bloat.

31:09.000 --> 31:14.000
Yeah, and you know, Alan from TechSnap just got the Spark or whatever it is from the Mozilla guys.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
And he likes it.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
He doesn't need a lot of functionality.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.000
It works for him.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.000
All right.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Well, we've got a couple more emails just to bust through real quick.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.000
This is the one Faith's been waiting for.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
And I like this guy.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
His name, he submitted, from Australia.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.000
You know what?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.000
That's all you need to say.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.000
Immediately, I'm like, that's awesome.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.000
Okay.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
So he writes and he says, hey, Chris and Matt, I watch your show weekly.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.000
And I really enjoy it.

31:32.000 --> 31:36.000
So I just wanted to let you know, and I think he was responding to some of my butter FS

31:36.000 --> 31:37.000
grousing I was doing.

31:37.000 --> 31:40.000
I've been using ZFS on Arch for one and a half years now.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
Never had a single issue.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.000
I run it on two servers, about 24 terabytes of data, and on my notebook.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
I use it for my data partition only.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
Storing data on my ZFS makes me sleep better.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
And I'm sure Alan would agree with that.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
I use ZFS Git package.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
He's using the Git version of ZFS from the AUR, and it works like a charm.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
Thought you would be interested, and maybe you can give a maintainer a quick shout out.

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
His name is Jesus Alvarez, or Jesus, whichever.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.000
I'm going to go with Jesus.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
He really deserves the name.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
I agree.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
Also, he's known as the demonizer.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
He made my life so much easier.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
It may be yours, too.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.000
I've included commands to start using ZFS.

32:17.000 --> 32:20.000
He says, caution, it's very easy.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
See you on last in TechSnap.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
So from Australia, thanks for the update.

32:24.000 --> 32:29.000
You, sir, have balls making your data partition based on the ZFS Git.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
The Git version of your files, wow.

32:32.000 --> 32:35.000
And I know ZFS is supposed to be stable and all, but.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.000
On an unsupported platform, wow.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
This is what I'm saying.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.000
This is what I'm saying.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.000
Okay, Mumble Room, this one's for you.

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
Q5, are you still in there, Rotten?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Are you guys in there?

32:45.000 --> 32:46.000
You guys got your ears on?

32:46.000 --> 32:52.000
Because this was submitted nine hours ago to the Linux Action Show subreddit from...

32:52.000 --> 32:55.000
I'm going to go with Ion D-Bagger.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.000
Ionic Badger.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.000
Ironic Badger.

32:57.000 --> 32:58.000
That's actually me.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.000
Okay.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
I like D-Bagger.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.000
Wow.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.000
Well.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
All right.

33:03.000 --> 33:08.000
Well, I'm glad you're here because I made it much funnier.

33:08.000 --> 33:14.000
So, Ironic D-Bagger wrote, hey guys, apologies if this is a...

33:14.000 --> 33:15.000
Yeah, apologies.

33:15.000 --> 33:20.000
But he wants to know if we would be interested in doing a LUP review of Open Media Vault.

33:20.000 --> 33:25.000
Do-it-yourself NAS based upon Debian, it really has some neat features for the home NAS solution.

33:25.000 --> 33:29.000
Hopefully a range of people could test it out on various different RAID setups, drive

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
pooling options such as SnapRate, AUFS, MHDDFS, and so on.

33:32.000 --> 33:36.000
We could always use more discussions trying to help people store their TBs, terabytes,

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
at home.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I use SnapRate with AUFS.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
For now, XFS across my data drives.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Always love the good talk on this topic.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
I'll be in the Mumble Room tonight, hopefully.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.000
Well, there you go, Crunchy.

33:45.000 --> 33:50.000
So, I also would like to be, I would very much like to get a community review of Open

33:50.000 --> 33:51.000
Media Vault.

33:51.000 --> 33:55.000
It's one of these things where it's hard for me to review because I've got a free NAS and

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
a Plex server.

33:56.000 --> 33:58.000
I'm kind of already all dialed in.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.000
I'm not really in a position where I need to do this.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
But I've always wondered about Open Media Vault.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
So, is anybody in the Mumble Room interested in doing an Open Media Vault review?

34:06.000 --> 34:09.000
We could do like a round table review.

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
Yeah, I'll take part in that.

34:11.000 --> 34:14.000
Seeing as I posted the thing, I'll definitely say yes to that.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.000
All right, so we've got three.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.000
All right, we'll start from there.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.000
We'll talk more in the post show.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
So, we'll do a community review of Open Media Vault soon.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
So, out there, if you're interested and you're normally one of our Mumble Participators or

34:23.000 --> 34:27.000
if you're not and you still like to be involved, you can go over to the Linux Action Show

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
subreddit and we'll have a feedback thread for episode 53.

34:31.000 --> 34:35.000
And it is episode 53 of Unplugged, not 52 like the lower third said.

34:35.000 --> 34:42.000
Last but not least, I'm going to give you guys a little Oculus updates as we wait for

34:42.000 --> 34:43.000
the Linux version.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.000
Now, you will recall I was complaining in the Linux Action Show that on the Oculus DK2

34:47.000 --> 34:50.000
pre-order website, they list Linux support.

34:50.000 --> 34:57.000
However, I do not have a working SDK or DK2 under Linux.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.000
No, sir.

34:58.000 --> 35:03.000
No, actually, they've just today updated their SDK for Mac.

35:03.000 --> 35:09.000
So, now Windows and Mac have SDKs, but us Linux users, bubkiss so far, bubkiss.

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
So, the Oculus update remains, it's still negative in the freedom dimension, cannot

35:13.000 --> 35:19.000
use it under Linux, not yet at least, but a little birdie tells me they are working

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
on it.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
It's going to take some time.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Kind of a bummer.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Kind of a bummer.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Kind of a bummer, man.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.000
I'm going to show it to Fade afterwards and it's like, okay, well, should I show Fade

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
on the Windows box or the Mac?

35:31.000 --> 35:32.000
Not great options.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.000
No, not at all.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Right?

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
People come over and say they want to see the Oculus and I got to boot into Windows.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.000
It's disgraceful.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
It's disgusting.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
You feel dirty afterwards.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
Well, I always, that's why I always ask all my guests if they'd like to take a shower

35:45.000 --> 35:46.000
with me.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.000
I always just think it's gross.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
It just got awkward.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
I can actually see his eyes get wide.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.000
Oh, hey, Fade, by the way, after the show, I had something I wanted to ask you.

35:54.000 --> 35:59.000
All right.

35:59.000 --> 36:04.000
Before we get into our first main topic of the day, I wanted to thank our first sponsor

36:04.000 --> 36:05.000
and that is Ting.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Go to linux.ting.com.

36:06.000 --> 36:10.000
We were talking about some of the problems with the mobile industry and that is talk

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
about something that Ting can help clean up.

36:12.000 --> 36:17.000
Here's the thing about Ting, no contracts and no early termination fee, but maybe my

36:17.000 --> 36:20.000
favorite part and probably Matt's too, is you only pay for what you use.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
It's a flat $6 a month.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
It's $6 a month and then it's your usage.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
Ting takes your minutes, your megabytes, your messages, they add them all up, whatever bucket

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
you fall into.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
That's what you pay.

36:30.000 --> 36:34.000
And then the man comes along, he's like, excuse me, Ting.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.000
I got to put a little percentage on that.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.000
So then the man gets his cut, but after that, that's all you pay.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.000
It's whatever you use plus the man's cut and that flat $6.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
And by the way, it's $6 per line.

36:43.000 --> 36:46.000
So you add more devices, you can pull your minutes together, $6.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.000
I've got three phones.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.000
It's crazy.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
They're all on one account and my bill is outrageously low.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
It's great.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Plus they've got a ton of phones you can buy.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.000
They're yours.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.000
You own them outright.

36:55.000 --> 36:56.000
They're not subsidizing the cost.

36:56.000 --> 37:00.000
They don't trick you into paying for that phone over the life of that two year contract.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.000
You buy it upfront and own it like you do a fricking computer.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
It's yours because these are fricking computers.

37:05.000 --> 37:08.000
If you want to use Ting as your mobile ISP, do it.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.000
Kyra don't care.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
Ting don't care.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.000
Use them as your mobile ISP.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.000
They like it.

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Go over to linux.ting.com.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.000
It will take $25 off your first month of Ting service.

37:17.000 --> 37:21.000
And one of the great things about Ting once you become a Ting customer is you can take

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
advantage of some of their really advanced functionality like their dashboard.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.000
Ting has an incredible dashboard.

37:25.000 --> 37:29.000
You can go in there, you can activate devices, deactivate devices, transfer devices, check

37:29.000 --> 37:30.000
your minutes.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.000
They have cool like fuel gauge status indicators of where your minutes are at.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
Set up short names, set up call forwarding, all the bouncing rules, all that kind of stuff

37:37.000 --> 37:38.000
you might want to do.

37:38.000 --> 37:43.000
And then if you ever get stuck or you just don't want to be lonely, you just want to

37:43.000 --> 37:45.000
talk to somebody, guess what?

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
You can call them.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.000
1-855-TING-FTW.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
1-855-TING-FTW.

37:49.000 --> 37:55.000
Any time between 8am or 8pm East Coast time and a real person, a real Canadian empowered

37:55.000 --> 37:58.000
to solve your problems answers the phone.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.000
And they're cool too.

37:59.000 --> 38:05.000
Like we've had stories of our audience members getting postcards in the mail from Ting afterwards

38:05.000 --> 38:07.000
like signed by the person that they talked to on the phone.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.000
Be like, hey I was just thinking about you.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
I miss you.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
You know that kind of stuff.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.000
Maybe not the miss you part, but you get my drift.

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
And every Ting plan includes hotspot, tethering, picture messaging, caller ID, three way calling,

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
all that stuff you would expect.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.000
Oh, you want a hotspot?

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
Just tap the check box.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
You know your operating system's got it built in.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.000
Why do you have to pay your carrier some extra special like crazy ass package to get Wi-Fi?

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
Just tap the link and just use the feature built into your operating system and then

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
Ting just considers that to be data usage.

38:35.000 --> 38:36.000
Linux.ting.com.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
That will take $25 off your first device.

38:38.000 --> 38:43.000
If you've got a Ting compatible device and you might, you can check out their BYOD page.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
If you've got a Ting compatible device, they're going to give you a $25 credit.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
If you're like me, that $25 credit lasted me more than my first month.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
I'm now saving over $2,000 by switching to Ting.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
It's ridiculous.

38:55.000 --> 39:00.000
I could buy, I could almost, almost, almost afford a MacBook Pro with the savings I switched

39:00.000 --> 39:01.000
by Ting.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.000
Almost.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.000
Good thing Noah would never let me have it.

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
But I could easily buy like an Ultra Pro.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.000
That would be a good choice.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.000
Yeah.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.000
I've already got the money.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.000
I've already got the money for it.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
Wow.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
Because I've saved the money.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.000
I just got to convince Angela of that now.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.000
You think that logic would work with her?

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
No.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
Probably not.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
Maybe not.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.000
I'll keep trying.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.000
You know what I'll do is I'll keep telling her to go to linux.ting.com.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
You can go to linux.ting.com too.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.000
By the way, linux.ting.com is in the, Linux, in the URL.

39:24.000 --> 39:25.000
Right?

39:25.000 --> 39:26.000
I mean, just go rocket force.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Would you let them know you appreciate them supporting the Linux Unplugged show.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.000
Check out their site.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.000
They've got a great blog too.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.000
Go check out their devices and that savings calculator.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Linux.ting.com.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
And a really big thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.000
All right, Faith.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
So you've been sitting in front of that elementary OS.

39:42.000 --> 39:43.000
We're running the brand new beta.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
It was just released last night.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.000
And what's it called?

39:46.000 --> 39:47.000
Freya?

39:47.000 --> 39:48.000
That's what I hear.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.000
Freya.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.000
I wrote it down and then I lost the paper I wrote it down on.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
It's not ISIS anymore.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.000
They changed the name.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.000
It was going to.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.000
You actually pronounced it correctly.

39:54.000 --> 39:55.000
Oh good.

39:55.000 --> 39:56.000
So Faith, what do you think?

39:56.000 --> 39:59.000
So this is just a super basic install.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
It hasn't been exactly one year since the last release of elementary OS.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.000
So Freya beta one is available for developers and testing.

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
Now they do highly, like right up in the announcement put up there,

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Hey, this is not for production use.

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
Do not put this on a production machine.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.000
It is beta.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.000
It is meant for developers.

40:18.000 --> 40:19.000
It has issues that need to be worked out.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
So they're really upfront about that.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.000
So the first thing I did is I promptly went out and downloaded and installed it.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
I want it.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.000
So did you, wait a minute.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
Did you just drag that mumble application between desktops

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
by dragging its icon down below?

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
No, it turns into an icon.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.000
Oh, it turns into an icon.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.000
That is so cool.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Yeah, it's fantastic.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.000
Arch is cool and all, but no, I want this.

40:42.000 --> 40:45.000
So they say a few more stages remain in the development process.

40:45.000 --> 40:48.000
They'll be addressing serious bugs before the final release.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
That said, this post is going to be more technical.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.000
So they get into some technical stuff.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
They're going to talk about user features in the future.

40:53.000 --> 40:58.000
It's based off of Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, Linux kernel 3.13

40:58.000 --> 41:00.000
with the new updated drivers and graphic stack.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.000
It includes support for EFI and stub loading,

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
which is a kernel feature that enables booting directly from UEFI

41:06.000 --> 41:09.000
without the need for an additional bootloader such as grub, which is awesome.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.000
And we'll get back to this in a minute.

41:12.000 --> 41:15.000
One of their developers created a step-by-step guide to actually load

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
elementary OS natively on MacBook Pros,

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
which I was just grousing about two weeks ago.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.000
Additionally, we'll be shipping the latest GTK Plus release, version 3.12,

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
rather than Ubuntu 14.04's outdated 3.10.

41:26.000 --> 41:31.000
They say they're also working on the Pantheon online accounts.

41:31.000 --> 41:35.000
It's not necessarily a fork of Gnome's.

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Unlike Ubuntu online accounts, it's GLib-based.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
Unlike Gnome online accounts, it's fully extensible.

41:40.000 --> 41:43.000
With Pantheon online accounts, you get the best of both worlds out of the box.

41:43.000 --> 41:46.000
They're going to have Facebook, Fastmail, Google Plus, Microsoft, and Yahoo support.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
And then you'll be able to add more integration for other stuff.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Like right now, they don't have own cloud.

41:50.000 --> 41:54.000
This online account thing is actually a little neater than I originally kind of gave it credit

41:54.000 --> 41:57.000
because you set this up, and now you can tweet from your desktop.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Your calendar syncs, so when you click the little calendar,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
all of your Google Calendar or whatever you synced it up to,

42:01.000 --> 42:04.000
Microsoft, Yahoo, all show up in the calendar.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
It's kind of a neat service.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.000
And the fact that their support's plug-ins is nice.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.000
They also out-of-the-box client-side decorations.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
One of the new features of GTK 3.12, obviously, is the ability to use client-side decorations.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
So they've made extensive use of the feature there, right?

42:16.000 --> 42:20.000
Every GTK 3 window in Freya is decorated on the client side

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
with no extra work needed from the app developers.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
That's also important from a Wayland standpoint.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
The Wayland developers strongly believe that things should be client-side.

42:28.000 --> 42:30.000
They say there's still a few hundred bugs, though,

42:30.000 --> 42:34.000
like CalDAV syncing issues, search issues, and things like that.

42:34.000 --> 42:42.000
But, Matt, what we have is a beta 1 that is very functional-looking, really polished.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.000
Let's phrase this. Let's set this up.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
We're in an era now where we've obviously spoken about some discontent with Ubuntu.

42:50.000 --> 42:55.000
And there is a need for something stable, something elegant,

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
something that maybe we would look at home on one of the more popular netbooks

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
that seems to be selling these days, the MacBook.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
Is elementary OS enough, Matt?

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
Is it enough of a desktop operating system that it could be as successful as Ubuntu proper?

43:09.000 --> 43:13.000
I think potentially I would need to spend a little more time with it,

43:13.000 --> 43:17.000
and more importantly, how I foresee it or how I use it as a material.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
It's how I drop it in front of just people that might be Ubuntu targets and how they perceive it.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
If it's successful in that space, then potentially, then potentially.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
But I think that's something that needs to happen,

43:26.000 --> 43:29.000
is we need to get it out of the echo chamber and actually get it in front of real people.

43:29.000 --> 43:33.000
So Josh, I know you're running it in the mumble room, right? What do you think so far?

43:33.000 --> 43:39.000
I'm loving it. Interestingly enough, one of the things I was most excited about

43:39.000 --> 43:43.000
is the fact that the calendar is actually useful now.

43:43.000 --> 43:47.000
You can actually sync stuff with it now, which is like, I know,

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
how could they ship a calendar that doesn't even let you sync with Google?

43:51.000 --> 43:55.000
But it does now. Files now have search functionality,

43:55.000 --> 43:59.000
and it doesn't have the stupid type of head stuff that the current Nautilus has.

43:59.000 --> 44:03.000
Oh, I like that. Yeah, that's nice. That's frustrating under Nautilus.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.000
Yeah, it's incredibly frustrating.

44:06.000 --> 44:13.000
The music app doesn't screw up when you have a large amount of music now, which is nice.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
Josh, does it feel too much like an OS X clone to you?

44:17.000 --> 44:22.000
I mean, you know, it's got the metal, it's got brushed metal look, it's got a dock below.

44:22.000 --> 44:25.000
Right, but I mean, you know what else has a dock?

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Xyburn 2.

44:26.000 --> 44:32.000
You know, it's just like, it's a different way of handling your current running application.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Maybe it's better.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
You know what else has a dock? Unity is just on the left-hand side.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
My gnome desktop.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
Yeah, you know, I like it.

44:40.000 --> 44:43.000
But the brushed metal, right? I mean, isn't that the thing that stands out the most?

44:43.000 --> 44:47.000
I mean, you look at Midori under this, it looks like Safari to me, right?

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Yeah.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.000
Does that bother you at all?

44:49.000 --> 44:54.000
Yeah, I mean, I like it. It does have a lot of strong resemblance to OS X.

44:54.000 --> 45:02.000
But, you know, they have done a lot of specific things to elementary OS to make it different from OS X.

45:02.000 --> 45:06.000
And I think the line to walk is, can you be inspired by a desktop,

45:06.000 --> 45:12.000
but yet still do your own enough unique take on it that essentially what you're doing is adopting some of the best elements

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
and innovating in your own areas.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
And I think it's fair to say that elementary OS does that.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.000
I feel like it. What do you think, Fadi? You've been using it for a little bit.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
I think it's pretty, and I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

45:23.000 --> 45:29.000
You might make comparisons, but any comparison you see in a negative light could just as easily be interpreted as a benefit.

45:29.000 --> 45:36.000
For example, people that might be familiar with that look or even just subconsciously aware of it from commercials or whatever.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.000
It looks good, and it works really well, and I really like it.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
Well, and there is something about it.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
Like, when you see a screenshot of elementary OS on a piece of hardware, it looks good.

45:44.000 --> 45:47.000
Like, it does justifiably look good.

45:47.000 --> 45:53.000
But, Eric, it's not all about the look or the applications or the unique apps that they've built for it.

45:53.000 --> 45:57.000
There's also, at least for Linux enthusiasts, the whole community aspect of it too, right?

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
That's absolutely true.

45:59.000 --> 46:05.000
One thing that has been bugging me about the elementary OS, I think they're probably a great group of guys.

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
I've never had the pleasure of meeting them, but here's what I've been seeing.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
Their community management sucks.

46:10.000 --> 46:17.000
And the reason I'm saying that is because there are people who want to be involved with the project to help them get some of these bugs down

46:17.000 --> 46:21.000
so they're not taking so freaking long to get the distro out there.

46:21.000 --> 46:24.000
There are people who want to help, and they're like, no, we don't want you helping.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
We don't want you helping.

46:26.000 --> 46:30.000
We're going to do this all ourselves and take so freaking long, and it'll be ready when it's ready.

46:30.000 --> 46:33.000
Well, they want help, but they want it via BountySource, right?

46:33.000 --> 46:39.000
For them, they say, we have over 5,000 worth of bounties remain unclaimed on BountySource.com.

46:39.000 --> 46:43.000
Anyone can contribute to fix and earn bounties.

46:43.000 --> 46:46.000
Eric, here's where I think you're getting confused.

46:46.000 --> 46:51.000
The people that were saying, oh, I want to report these bugs, I want to help fix it,

46:51.000 --> 46:57.000
those were individuals that were running unofficial, unstable ISOs or ISOs that they've built themselves.

46:57.000 --> 47:00.000
They were not running any sort of beta.

47:00.000 --> 47:08.000
What they were doing was they were saying, okay, I'm going to use this build script and create my own thing that might resemble elementary OS.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
Of course, the developers are going to say, no, no, no.

47:11.000 --> 47:20.000
If you want to help, go fix the bugs or contribute monetarily if you don't have any programming experience or you don't know Vala and GDK.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.000
Yes, you're right.

47:24.000 --> 47:30.000
They should have been downloading the ISOs according to them, but then how does anybody do any bug reports?

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
That just doesn't compute.

47:32.000 --> 47:39.000
You let the core development team focus on the issues at task for beta one,

47:39.000 --> 47:47.000
and then the beta is used to figure out any issues that the core development team couldn't figure out that the community knows of,

47:47.000 --> 47:52.000
and then those issues get resolved before stable.

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
Okay, they are the only Linux distro community I know of that does that.

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
There's a lot of things they do that are unique.

47:59.000 --> 48:08.000
When this beta hit, because I don't follow it super closely and there's not really a lot of public postings about it,

48:08.000 --> 48:12.000
I wasn't sure, is this one also based on 12.04 or is it based on 14.04?

48:12.000 --> 48:14.000
I didn't know any of that.

48:14.000 --> 48:22.000
I had to ask people in the community because I don't grok how I'm supposed to be receiving information from the elementary OS project

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
if I want more than just when they make big announcements.

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
I want more than that, but I don't need much more than that.

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
That's my other point, is that when they do give out information, they don't give enough.

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Yeah, I can understand.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
Maybe they're trying to do some sort of Skunk Works project.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
And branding. It's a little bit about branding.

48:40.000 --> 48:47.000
Yeah, a little bit about branding, but the thing is there is this community of people who just want to help.

48:47.000 --> 48:51.000
I have a degree in volunteer management, basically.

48:51.000 --> 48:55.000
I know what it takes to make volunteers work.

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
If everybody has a common vision, it's great.

48:59.000 --> 49:06.000
The thing is, it's harder to manage volunteers, I can understand that, because you're not holding a paycheck over their head.

49:06.000 --> 49:11.000
But at the same time, you need to let people get involved in your project.

49:11.000 --> 49:23.000
At the same time, though, I want to, in a way, give them room to try something unique and different than all the other distros are doing.

49:23.000 --> 49:31.000
I feel like we need that, because maybe that will be the right combination that finally results in massive success.

49:31.000 --> 49:37.000
From a usability standpoint and a consistency standpoint, I think they're getting there.

49:37.000 --> 49:44.000
What we have seen so far is a distribution that has decided it doesn't need to quite follow the standard distro mold.

49:44.000 --> 49:52.000
That might, while it might be hard for us to figure out how to fit into our established paradigms of interacting with Linux communities,

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
maybe a little bit of medicine that we need to swallow, eventually, down the road.

49:56.000 --> 50:03.000
But I think the problem is, them as a project, figuring out what that means and how to pull that off and how to do it successfully

50:03.000 --> 50:08.000
is going to be changing for a while as they grow and get established. Does that make sense?

50:08.000 --> 50:11.000
Well, I think they've also... I'm sorry, Faye, go ahead.

50:11.000 --> 50:17.000
No, it makes sense to me. One thing I just wanted to throw in while we're talking about it is that their choice of Midori,

50:17.000 --> 50:23.000
I think that's an excellent choice, because not only are you providing something that consistently is elegant in its design,

50:23.000 --> 50:28.000
but most users that you're installing an OS2 that aren't technically savvy,

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
they're probably going to be using the web browser most of the time, and choosing something that's so low resource

50:33.000 --> 50:38.000
would indicate that it would perform well, as long as they have the graphics to support the compositing.

50:38.000 --> 50:43.000
Yeah, and it's very fast, it's very functional, it does feel like a perfectly integrated app.

50:43.000 --> 50:48.000
Now, for me, I'm like, oh, what about my Markdown plugins and stuff like that? But for regular folks, it's fine.

50:48.000 --> 50:51.000
Yeah, they have some extensions, but there isn't a lot.

50:51.000 --> 50:56.000
Yeah, no. I've played with it a little bit. I like to use it for one of my Google account logins.

50:56.000 --> 51:01.000
My gripes aside, I think they're doing a fantastic job.

51:01.000 --> 51:07.000
No, I think it's a fair point to make, because it's something I've kind of grappled with, too, is it doesn't quite click.

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000
Sometimes I go in there and I'm like, am I even supposed to be reporting on this?

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
I wasn't sure if I should even be talking about this story today, or am I going to get crap from the elementary project

51:17.000 --> 51:20.000
for talking about something that isn't ready to be talked about yet.

51:20.000 --> 51:25.000
Honestly, before we even went on air, I was like, maybe we shouldn't do this on the show, because I don't want to piss them off.

51:25.000 --> 51:30.000
And then I thought, if they're putting out a beta, they're obviously okay with some, and we're not reviewing it as a distro yet.

51:30.000 --> 51:32.000
We're going to wait until it gets finalized.

51:32.000 --> 51:39.000
But I guess what I'm saying is, that thought would never have crossed my mind with any other Linux distro, ever.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
Never has ever in the history of any show I've ever done.

51:42.000 --> 51:45.000
This is the first time the thought has ever crossed my mind.

51:45.000 --> 51:51.000
And it's one of the reasons I don't like covering some of the commercial software spaces, because who wants to worry about that crap?

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
It's nice that it's all open source.

51:53.000 --> 52:01.000
The key thing is, you wouldn't do any logical individual, wouldn't put a review up, whether it be a video or something,

52:01.000 --> 52:06.000
and point out, oh, you shouldn't be running this operating system if it's a beta.

52:06.000 --> 52:12.000
Say for instance, Ubuntu 14.10 beta 1 in the future.

52:12.000 --> 52:19.000
It wouldn't be logical to do a completely different video review or something.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
You wait until it's so stable.

52:22.000 --> 52:30.000
I think too, let's be frank, whatever they're doing is working from a PR standpoint.

52:30.000 --> 52:35.000
Because before this beta hit, the first story I saw on the subreddit was a countdown.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.000
Like we got the countdown thing to the beta release, and everybody's like, oh my gosh, the countdown page is up.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
And everybody started talking about the countdown page.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.000
And then within a couple of hours after the countdown page, boom, beta hits.

52:44.000 --> 52:49.000
And then links on every single freaking Linux website in the world are linking to the new elementary OS beta.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
And OMG, Ubuntu's got a write-up about it before they even have made an official post.

52:53.000 --> 52:56.000
And everybody's freaking out, now we're talking about it the next day.

52:56.000 --> 52:58.000
It generates buzz.

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
Well, and it works. And I think you kind of nailed on something very important.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
The reason why they make a lot of stuff that we take for granted really difficult to do

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
is because they've looked at other proprietary models that have done the same thing, and they found that it works.

53:10.000 --> 53:13.000
Is it attractive to us? No.

53:13.000 --> 53:17.000
Is it attractive to people that want to talk about it? Yeah, apparently so.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
I guess so. It's working.

53:19.000 --> 53:25.000
Well, and it's almost like they give us enough for us to talk, but not enough that we all fill in the gaps.

53:25.000 --> 53:30.000
It's almost like the Apple approach, where they eek out a little rumors, like they give some to the Wall Street Journal.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
That's exactly what they're doing. Yeah.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.000
It's kind of funny. Here we are getting played, but I kind of like it.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
At the same time, it's fun to kind of conjecture about it, too.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
They got me. All right, well, they're doing something really smart.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
I think, you know, we talked about mobile devices and phones and tablets.

53:44.000 --> 53:49.000
The elementary OS project, though, and I don't even know if it's all that official,

53:49.000 --> 53:55.000
is doing something incredibly smart when it comes to hardware support that might give them the edge up in the long run.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.000
But first, I want to thank Linux Academy.

53:58.000 --> 54:01.000
Go over to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug.

54:01.000 --> 54:04.000
That'll get you the summer of learning discount 33% off,

54:04.000 --> 54:09.000
and Linux Academy is an awesome resource created by some really passionate Linux enthusiasts,

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
always adding new content to it, which I love.

54:11.000 --> 54:14.000
Their training division is so passionate about this stuff.

54:14.000 --> 54:17.000
So, have you checked out Linux Academy? Because you really should.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
They've got step-by-step video courses. They have downloadable comprehensive study guides.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
You can grab on your MP3 player and listen to it while you're in the goal.

54:23.000 --> 54:26.000
If you're like, Listener Seth, you can listen in the shower. No judgey.

54:26.000 --> 54:31.000
It comes with your own server, too, so if you need to spin up a virtual server during the coursework, don't worry about it.

54:31.000 --> 54:35.000
They got it covered, man. You get there in the coursework, boom, on the back end, they spun up a virtual server.

54:35.000 --> 54:38.000
You're doing AWS, good on you. Don't pay for AWS.

54:38.000 --> 54:42.000
Linux Academy has it covered. You get to the point in the course where we need a virtual server, they spin it up.

54:42.000 --> 54:45.000
I think that's incredible. Plus, you can choose from any 7 Plus Linux distributions,

54:45.000 --> 54:50.000
and they'll automatically adjust the courseware to match that distribution, which I think is pretty sweet.

54:50.000 --> 54:55.000
And one of the things that I like about their system is they're not just adding content every single week,

54:55.000 --> 54:59.000
but they're also now involving livestream Q&A, so that way you can go right to the educator and ask them a question.

54:59.000 --> 55:04.000
And then they post them up later on, too, so even if you aren't able to attend the live event,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.000
you can still benefit from the Q&A session.

55:06.000 --> 55:10.000
They have self-paced labs as well, so if you're somebody like me who just wants to go in and tinker to learn something

55:10.000 --> 55:15.000
and just have a little intellectual stimulation and advance my skill set from time to time, that's perfect.

55:15.000 --> 55:20.000
But if you're also somebody who needs to land that next contract, if you're somebody who just wants to better themselves,

55:20.000 --> 55:25.000
and I've thought about this a lot, and one of the things I like about Linux Academy from a Linux user standpoint

55:25.000 --> 55:31.000
is it allows me to stay competitive and keep my skills up, even when I'm not necessarily working with these technologies anymore,

55:31.000 --> 55:38.000
because as I've pulled back from the contracting world, I've had this weird sensation where I feel like maybe some of my skill set has slipped,

55:38.000 --> 55:41.000
or maybe I'm just not quite as sharp as I used to be.

55:41.000 --> 55:46.000
So in a way, I get to test my mettle with Linux Academy, and there's very few things in my life that I have control over.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
I just have to be honest about that.

55:48.000 --> 55:54.000
But my own bettification, my own education, that is something I do have control over.

55:54.000 --> 55:59.000
I think it's so important to go in and investigate the things that intellectually stimulate me,

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
and to sort of indulge in that.

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
And what a great way to entertain myself, too.

56:03.000 --> 56:06.000
It really is a form of entertainment, and what I love, and it's no pressure,

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
because I can look at the courseware beforehand.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
I'll see how long something's going to take, and I can say, you know what?

56:11.000 --> 56:15.000
I can dedicate 15 minutes, or I can dedicate an hour tonight.

56:15.000 --> 56:18.000
And then when I go back in, I can resume right where I left off.

56:18.000 --> 56:21.000
I can go test myself, too, to see if I've slipped at all.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.000
It's really fun.

56:22.000 --> 56:24.000
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
Go get that Summer of Learning discount.

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
There's never been a better time to better yourself just a little bit.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Go check them out.

56:33.000 --> 56:34.000
I think you'll be really impressed.

56:34.000 --> 56:38.000
Also, they've got a great community as well, which us Linux users know is super important.

56:38.000 --> 56:44.000
So, I want to talk about something I think the elementary project is not even officially embracing yet,

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
but the people that are involved with the project are doing,

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
and if it continues and they're successful with it,

56:50.000 --> 56:57.000
it almost is answering a couple of topics that we have covered on the Linux Unplugged show for a couple of weeks now.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
So, first off, I want to give them props.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.000
In their release announcement, they linked to a step-by-step guide

57:03.000 --> 57:08.000
to getting elementary OS Freya or Isis on a Mac using REFI,

57:08.000 --> 57:11.000
and you can dual boot or single boot,

57:11.000 --> 57:15.000
and it is an out-of-the-box native elementary OS experience on a Mac.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
And I think more, I want to give them so much credit for this,

57:19.000 --> 57:24.000
because more distributions need to come to the realization that people are buying Macbooks

57:24.000 --> 57:27.000
and they need to make their crap work on the Macbooks.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.000
And I know in some people it's a bad, bitter pill to swallow, but it is the reality.

57:32.000 --> 57:35.000
And the fact that elementary OS is like, pfft, here you go.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.000
You want to try out our beta?

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
Not only can you do it, here's a step-by-step guide for this beta.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.000
Genius.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.000
Genius on their part.

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Could be huge.

57:44.000 --> 57:49.000
I don't know if you guys have heard of this thing called YUM?

57:49.000 --> 57:50.000
Do you know what YUM stands for, Fade?

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
I don't know what it stands for.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
I know what it is and what it does, but no.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Yellow Dog Update Manager.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.000
Bingo.

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
And why is Yellow Dog Update Manager still remembered?

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
Because there was Yellow Dog Linux.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
And what was Yellow Dog Linux known for?

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
And why did Fedora adopt YUM?

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
Because it ran on Macs.

58:07.000 --> 58:08.000
It was the distro.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.000
If you were going to run it on a Mac, this was the distro you went to.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
They became world famous for that.

58:13.000 --> 58:16.000
And elementary OS could be going down the same path.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
Only not just Mac anymore.

58:18.000 --> 58:25.000
Not just for Mac, because they also have released a really easy way to install elementary OS on Chromebooks.

58:25.000 --> 58:31.000
So now they've got Chromebooks and Macs that is super simple to get elementary OS running on those bad mamas.

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
I think that is sweet.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
I think that is a super smart move on their part.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
They call it ChromEOS.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
Chrome E-E-O-S.

58:39.000 --> 58:40.000
Of course, don't call it E-O-S.

58:40.000 --> 58:45.000
Users will be able to boot into either Chrome OS or elementary OS, whichever they like.

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
Right now it has been tested on the Acer C720.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.000
It has also been on the HP Chromebook 14.

58:50.000 --> 58:55.000
And I guess the Acer C720 profile edition, I'm not sure.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
And the Acer's partner Chromebook also has been tested and verified.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.000
So here you go.

58:59.000 --> 59:04.000
Elementary OS is saying, here is the new hardware landscape reality.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
On the low end you've got Chromebooks and we've got millions of them.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
And on the high end you've got Macbooks and we've got millions of them.

59:10.000 --> 59:14.000
We want to be the distribution that is easy to install.

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
Noah, I'd really like to hear your thoughts.

59:17.000 --> 59:26.000
I think sometimes you get the impression that I don't want people to own Macbooks because I have something against people owning Macbooks in and of itself.

59:26.000 --> 59:33.000
If you told me I'm buying a Macbook to install Linux on it, I think that would be fantastic.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I just don't believe it happens.

59:35.000 --> 59:47.000
And it worries me, even if somebody honestly believed that they were going to go to Best Buy and they were going to buy a Macbook and then they were going to take it home and install Linux,

59:47.000 --> 59:53.000
I would be really concerned that when they get home and they get into OS X, they're just not going to leave OS X.

59:53.000 --> 59:58.000
Whereas I have a lot higher confidence that if somebody bought a Windows 8 machine, they're for sure putting Linux on it.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Why wouldn't they?

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I argue that I still think in your scenario of the Macbook buyer, there's still a percentage of peel off from that, the people that are unsatisfied with the sandbox and want out.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
And even that percentage of that peel off is still more people probably collectively that are using the Linux desktop all told.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:28.000
And so if we give them an escape hatch that is 5, 10, 15 steps and they pull that lever and now they're out of the operating system on their hardware they already own, I think that's genius.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
So could you clarify that?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:42.000
You said that you think that the number of people that are using Macbooks that want to progress to something else is greater than the entire desktop Linux user base currently?

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Potentially.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
And I'm talking over years, right?

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I'm not talking instantaneously right now.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I'm talking about future Macbook sales too.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Okay, fair enough.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Because I think you get there.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Like I hear from developers, like we just read an email on Coda Radio on Monday and the guy's name is Texas Linux user and he's switching to a Macbook.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:11.000
And I think guys like Texas Linux users will switch to a Macbook and then about a year later or two years later they'll be like hands up in the air, I can't take this anymore, I'm so bored.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.000
I've mastered this system, it's not changing, they're going in a direction I don't like, I'm ready for something else.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And he'll find something like elementary OS and be able to load it on that Macbook.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Recently I was looking for a computer.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I ended up with a System76 because I wanted to support Linux as a whole.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:39.000
But when I was looking, a lot of people want a laptop to do their work on because it's portable and there aren't a lot of good laptops.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Here's why the Macbook math, here's how it works out.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Because everybody's like, oh, it's so expensive.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Well, okay, make this list of requirements.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000
I want a usable resolution on my screen.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I want an i7 processor or i5 processor.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I want SSD.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000
I want it under this weight and I want it with this much battery life.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Depending on what your answer is to those questions, you very quickly come down to almost only a Macbook or a ThinkPad or maybe like a high, like there's like three machines, four machines really to choose from that are great.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.000
And so the fact that the Macbook's getting picked a lot isn't that surprising when you look at it for that lens.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And I'm with you, Fay.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Like if I was out to buy one right now, out of that list that I just said, it would be the Ultra Pro for me because my primary operating system would be Linux.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Would I consider a Macbook?

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Maybe if the support was perfect.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000
I'm a developer.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
I get a Macbook.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Yeah, I think some people would do because they're like, the other thing is like the Macbook's like, well, I have this option.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Like if Linux doesn't work out for me, I can bail to the Mac.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
I think some people look at it that way too.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.000
So that's where I think elementary OS just being here, having an operating system that's very well designed.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:59.000
So like you're not going to feel like you're having a big experience downgrade by switching from Mac OS to elementary OS and the fact that they've got this guide to install it on and dual boot too.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
And the Chromebook.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Who else is doing this?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
What are the distros doing this?

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
The Chromebook though.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
That's great.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
I mean, hey, you see you got a Chromebook.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
You want to use something other than a web browser?

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
There you go.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Yeah.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
I can't.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000
I mean, it is possible with any distro, but I don't know of anybody that's making it this easy.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Matt, do you think that makes a difference?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I would definitely agree with the Chromebook.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
I think you're on crack when it comes to people.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
You and I live with Mac users.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Let's be honest.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
You could light them on fire before they switch to Linux.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
It's not going to happen.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Yes.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
I mean, they would use it over Windows, but my wife especially, she'll use Linux.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000
She just begrudgingly, but she won't touch a Windows box with a 20 foot pole.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
But she's trapped in an ecosystem of does it provide me what I want?

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Yes.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Good.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Great.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
I'm done.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.000
It gives me the tools I want to do stuff with.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
So going back to the Chromebook, however, that I would agree with because Chromebook's

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
experience is great if you're like 18 and going into college, but I think if you want

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000
to actually...

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Or on the other end too, like you're retired, maybe all you need to do is check in with

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000
the kid's Facebook feed.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Exactly.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Or you want to...

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Yeah, exactly.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
You want to...

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000
It's like, and then you discover, oh yeah, I wanted to use Skype.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Sorry.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Too bad.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Little things crop up like that.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.000
All of a sudden elementary OS then makes a lot of sense on that type of machine for sure.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And there's a lot of them out there too, right?

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000
And the price of the Chromebook is so low that you're not that afraid to experiment

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000
with it a little bit.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Well, maybe your fancy MacBook is a little riskier because it could be like a $2,000

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000
computer, whereas a Chromebook could be like a $200 computer.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Definitely.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Go ahead.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Do you remember last week when I said, I don't think it was on the show, but I said last

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.000
week I bought a Chromebox and I was playing with it and I really liked it, but I'd never

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
put it into production?

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Yeah.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Six hours later I get a call from one of my clients who said, one of the computers died

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
and we need a new one here right now.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
And I said, well, Dell is 24 hours, 48 hours before I'm going to get a new one out.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
And they said, well, we need something right this second.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Right, of course.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
So like an idiot, I take the Chrome...

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Because they're using Linux.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Like an idiot, I take the Chromebox, I install Ubuntu, and I think to myself, why would anyone

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
restart the Chromebox within 24 hours?

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Of course not, right?

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
You can sit there for 24 hours, right?

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Nobody.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000
You don't need to, right?

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Yeah.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Yeah.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Turns out she walks into the room and goes, I don't like which plug he plugged that in

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
because the cord drips across my desk.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Unplugs and plugs it into the different plug.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Turns the machine on.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000
It says, press space bar to enable...

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Hits the space bar, dumps the OS, and then I said to myself, didn't I just tell Chris

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000
six hours ago I'd never put this into production because this exact thing would happen?

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
It's the worst, Noah.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:32.000
So there are risks to running Linux on, if you're not an experienced user, you don't

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
understand...

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
I mean, if you're putting it on yourself, you probably know what's happening, but this

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
idea that we can install Linux on Chromeboxes like we do on everyone else's laptop, I'm

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
hesitant to do that.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
True.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Yeah, you'd have to...

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
That's an excellent example.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.000
You'd want to be able...

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Because there is a way to disable that space bar thing, right?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
But you have to do it within Chrome OS.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:55.000
You have to be able to write to the...

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
C BIOS?

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
The firmware.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Yeah, and so on certain Chrome devices, you can take out a write protect screw.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
I haven't figured out how to do it on the Chromebox yet.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Yeah, and I know there's different ways for different machines, too.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
Yeah, that's the tricky part.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Boy, isn't that just a little dose of reality, though?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.000
It's what I deserve.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Yeah.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I was like, well, that would have been really great if that would have worked out.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000
No kidding.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Well, you know what, Noah, I feel for you.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I think it'll be interesting to watch elementary OS, though, when the final version hits.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Do they sell it all as one big...

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
This is your one platform for your MacBook, your PC desktop, and your Chromebook.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
The one distribution.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Of course, they all do it, right?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
But they'll sell it as the one distribution that runs on all of them.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
That'll be interesting to see when the ISIS version 1.0...

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
I have Freya.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Freya.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Froyo.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Freya.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I'm trying.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.000
I'm sorry.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I'm sorry.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
It's difficult.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
I liked ISIS.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Okay?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Yeah, that's true.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
So I'm not thinking of the Islamic State of Syria.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
I'm thinking about the Linux distribution, okay?

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
You are now thinking.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Well, I am now, right.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Yes.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Also, we are bombing them.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
But I'm not thinking about that right now.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000
That's tomorrow.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
That's tomorrow's problem.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000
All right.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Well, we got a couple of interesting things coming up.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.000
In fact, one of them involves Noah and a couple other things that...

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Oh, I got a call out, too.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Oh, shoot.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Let me grab that right here.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:20.000
First, I will thank our last sponsor for this week, and that is the great folks over at

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
DigitalOcean.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I have now...

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I am now the proud operator, and I consider myself an operator, like, in the matrix style

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
of operator, of three DigitalOcean droplets.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Why?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Because DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Users can create a cloud server in about 55 seconds.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000
If you're a boss, you can probably get it done in less than 55 seconds.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000
And the pricing plans, they only start at $5 a month.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
And here's what you get.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
512 megabytes of RAM.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
20 gigabyte SSD.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
One CPU.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
And a terabyte of transfer for $5.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Okay?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.000
That's cheaper than, like, a lot of pro services for, like, file sync.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
And you could do everything on your own Dropbox...

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
On your own DigitalOcean Dropbox Droplet thing if you want.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
You could make it a Dropbox.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Make it a BitTorrent sync.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Make it a sync thing.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
I'm using own cloud.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Make it an own cloud thing.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
At $5 a month, it can do all of the things.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
And what I love is that 20 gigabyte SSD gets you that density you need to do that.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:17.000
And DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam,

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000
or London.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
So you've got a lot of geographical locations to choose from.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
But let's talk about that control panel.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
It is simple and intuitive.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
The DigitalOcean control panel rocks.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000
And power users can replicate it on a much larger scale with their straightforward API.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000
It's all done in HTML5.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
No Flash required.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Nothing funky like that.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000
You just get in there.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
You get access to the console.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
You can watch it from post all the way up to boot.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
It's awesome.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
It's really awesome.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.000
All done in HTML5.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
You can deploy a Droplet easily.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
They've got lots of Linux distributions you can choose from.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
They've got one-click application installs, which is super handy if you want to do WordPress

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
or GitLab.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000
DNS management, Droplet backups, private networking, all running on top of Linux, all using open

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
source technology wrapped around this incredible dashboard for an unbelievable price.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
But we've got a deal for you.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000
If you use the promo code unpluggedaugust, that's all one word.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
And just like your file system, like it should be, lowercase.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Case sensitive here.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
All lowercase.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
You know why it's case sensitive?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Linux.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Linux.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
So go over to digitalocean.com, use the promo code unpluggedaugust, and you'll get the $10

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
credit.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Then you could try out that $5 rig that I've been using for a while for two months absolutely

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000
free.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Digitalocean.com.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Unplugged August when you check out.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
And try out a DigitalOcean Droplet.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Do you have your own root server up in the cloud?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:35.000
You should.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Because you can do anything with it.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000
You want to make it a game server?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Do it.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
You want to make it a web server?

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
You want to make it the backend for an app?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
You want to do anything on cloud?

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Do it, boy.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Go over there.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Use the promo code unpluggedaugust when you check out.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
And don't forget, DigitalOcean rocks hard.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
You can actually apply those promo codes retroactively.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
So if you forgot because, I don't know, maybe you were drinking.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
Are you drinking right now?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000
Put the beer down.

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Go over to digitalocean.com and put in that promo code unpluggedaugust.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
It'll let you retroactively apply it.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Digitalocean.com.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Unplugged August when you check out.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000
And a really big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
All right, guys.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:12.000
A couple of last bits of business to take care of before we get out of here.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
You know, I got Linus Torvalds' treadmill.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Did you know that?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I did.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
That's how I power the studio now.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
I'm not doing it right now because I have a guest.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
But if you weren't here, I probably would.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
So is the treadmill before or after the shower?

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
I mean, that's really the big question.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I get it.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
I need a shower after the treadmill, Matt.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
I tell you what.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Hey, we have a couple of upcoming things I want to tell you guys about just to put them

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000
on your radar.

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Ohio Linux Fest registrations are now open.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Mr. Q5 Sis, Noah, and myself will be traveling over to Ohio in October for Ohio Linux Fest.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000
We will attempt to do a live stream, and Matt will be here in studio, I assume, or somewhere

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
on Skype.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000
And this is going to be fun.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
It's going to be like this weird, complicated remote setup that I'm strangely looking forward

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
to trying out.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I don't know what's up with that.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000
So you can go over.

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I'll have a link in the show notes if you want to go to Ohio Linux Fest 2014 and see

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000
us there.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000
That would be awesome.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
We do a little fist bump.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:10.000
And before that, even before then, Mr. Noah, Colonel Linux there in the chat room, is going

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.000
to be at LinuxCon in Chicago on the 20th, I think.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
So if you're going to be at LinuxCon and you want to fist bump Noah, say hi to him.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Or if you are a project that would potentially like to chat with Noah, email us, production

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000
at JupiterBroadcasting.com, and maybe we can get in touch.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Noah, I've already had people ask me from the Fedora camp they want to meet up with

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
you.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
So you're already in demand.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:34.000
All right.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
So that'll be fun.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.000
You guys can say hi to Noah.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Because of the short notice, we weren't able to make it.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.000
But it was actually kind of a cool thing that happened.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000
The Linux Foundation saw our OSCON coverage and also the self coverage and the Linux Fest

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
coverage.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And they just said, we would love to have you.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
What could we do to get you guys to LinuxCon?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:58.000
And I said, well, a time machine, because it's 20 days from now.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Actually, it's less than that now.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And she said, well, I don't have a time machine.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
And I said, well, let me email Noah.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000
And Noah, being awesome, was like totally down.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
No, you know what Noah said to me?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Yeah, just let me know, oh, by the 18th, if I need to go there to Chicago.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
That's great.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:15.000
I know, right?

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
So LinuxCon coming up.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Then after that, Ohio Linux Fest in October.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000
LinuxCon will be this month.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
We'll have interviews and clips in our shows, just like you've come to expect from some

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:24.000
of our other coverage.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
And Noah always does great interviews.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.000
I also have a little tech support question I want to put out there to the audience.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:34.000
This problem has been eating at me literally for fricking years.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
You probably noticed it too.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
It's probably bothered the heck out of you.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Let's solve this problem together.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.000
The fricking Linux action show RSS feed in podcatchers never shows the damn badge.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:50.000
So if you subscribe to the Linux action show in a podcatcher, all your podcasts got the

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.000
beautiful artwork in there.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:54.000
And then you scroll through your list, and there's herpa derpa Linux action show with

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
the default app badge.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Because for whatever reason, feed burner's a jerk and it won't show the image.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
I have trouble shot the snot out of this.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
If you would take a look at our Linux action show RSS feed, like say grab the MP3 RSS feed

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
right off our site.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Run that.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000
If you're some sort of RSS whiz or something like that, please take a look at that SOB

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
and tell me what we're doing wrong.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Because we have verified our local XML.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
We have set up feed burner six ways to the sun to try to support an image.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000
All of the other shows on all of, for every show we've ever done on the network don't

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000
have this problem.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Frickin Linux action show has this problem.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:34.000
And I almost wonder if it's because the feed existed before iTunes existed and before artwork

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000
in a feed was common.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
And I don't know if that's what the problem is.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Help me Obi-Wan.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.000
You're my only hope audience.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I've literally been fighting this for a long time.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000
I would love your input.

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:46.000
And I have a link in the show notes for more information about that.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:47.000
So please.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000
You know.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.000
I know, right?

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
It's just one of those things that's like annoying.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:56.000
I'm looking at it now and this thing's bigger than my house as far as a logo.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.000
That's the more.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
I wonder.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000
That's the more.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
No, I upped it because I thought, well, maybe it was too low res because it was really old.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
It was like this old picture of Brian and I like on a Mac, on a Mac.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Right.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
Because we're doing a computer action show.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.000
Yeah.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
And then I put the new logo in there.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.000
Yeah.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I'll go through my old notes because I actually ran into this like a few years ago.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.000
Long, long time ago.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
And I actually found a solution for it.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
So let me see if I can dig that up.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Oh, Odin in the chat room says it's because I'm on a rolling distribution.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000
That makes sense.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Well, that's it.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Clearly.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000
And HTML5.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000
You don't use HTML5.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Yeah.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000
You guys are jerks.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
You use Open Broadcaster, right?

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Wait.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Why not?

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.000
And Mumble.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Actually, I do use Mumble.

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.000
All right.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.000
We want your feedback.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.000

You get to help us title the show either way, and we always appreciate you being here.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Matt, is there anything else we want to cover on this episode of Linux Unplugged before

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
we wrap this ass up?

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000
I think that's about it.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Nice.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.000
All right.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Well, I'll just mention real briefly that we have some good interviews coming up on

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
the Linux Action Show, potentially this Sunday, depending if everything works out, and definitely

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.000
the next Sunday.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000
So don't miss episodes of Linux Action Show or in the can.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.000
So Matt, prepare your brain for that and your body.

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Maybe double up on the underwear for this Sunday's Linux Action Show, okay?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Sounds good.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.000
All right, Matt.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.000
I'll see you on Sunday.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000
See you then.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000
It's a little dirty.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.000
I'm sorry, Matt.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I'm sorry.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.000
All right, everyone.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Thank you so much for joining us on this week's episode.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Fate, thanks for joining us in studio, buddy.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Yeah, no problem.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.000
My pleasure.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.000
It was good having you here.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:06.000
It's nice having somebody here to look over at and be like, boom, what do you think of

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.000
that?

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Yeah, yeah.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Gotcha.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000
All right, everyone.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Don't forget, we want your feedback.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Don't forget to check out github.com.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Join us live.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000
I've told you all of that stuff already.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.840
And last but not least, go grab one of our RSS feeds, and this show's RSS feed actually

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.840
has the artwork.

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.840
So hey, that's good too, right?

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.840
That's a good bonus.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.840
All right, everyone.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.840
Thanks so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:54.680
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:17:16.920
I don't want to freak anybody out, but we totally just podcasted.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:17.920
Whoa.

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:18.920
Yay.

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.920
Whoa.

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.920
There we go.

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:21.920
I just changed our underwear.

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:22.920
Yeah.

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:23.920
All right.

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.320
So the first thing I was going to mention to you real quick, two things, the first two

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:29.240
things that come to mind immediately, and these are things I'm sure you've done five

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:33.280
or six times, so I'm going to mention them anyway, is changing file names on the image

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:38.120
and turning off the browser friendly for testing purposes on your feed burner.

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:39.920
I don't know about that last one.

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:40.920
Those would be the very first two things I tried.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:42.680
I'll take a look at that last one and try that.

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:43.680
Yeah.

01:17:43.680 --> 01:17:44.680
That's a good one.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:45.680
Yeah.

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:46.680
Because I mean, those are two things I know just historically.

01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:49.440
I was looking through some of my old notes, and that's actually something I don't know

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.680
if it still applies or not.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:56.800
The image that it all shows is a picture of you and Brian as well, Chris.

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.800
That's the video feed though, right?

01:17:58.800 --> 01:17:59.800
Yeah.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:00.800
I think so.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:01.800
I'm looking at audio feeds here.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:02.800
Yeah.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:03.800
I'm thinking about the mp3.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:04.800
Yeah.

01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.160
Some of them need to be updated, but the one that just doesn't work at all is the mp3 feed.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:10.480
That's using podcast addicts on Android.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.680
JemmyTitles.com, everybody.

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:13.680
Go boot.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:14.680
I love Antilus.

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:15.680
Thank that file name too, definitely.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.680
You're booted with Roden.

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.680
Especially the imagery.

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:18.680
Thank Roden.

01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:19.680
I love it.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:24.520
Okay, do we just need to... See, I've actually... It's funny, the audience has brought me

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.280
back onto the Ubuntu soapbox.

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:31.120
I've actually kind of done ranting about Ubuntu, because I just feel like now we just need

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.120
to wait.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.760
But then it comes up again, and I get all worked up again, and I get into these big

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.760
Ubuntu rants I didn't even mean to.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:40.120
That was a pretty good rant.

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:44.200
You essentially said the worst thing that could possibly be happening is the advance

01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:45.200
of Ubuntu market share.

01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:46.200
I did say that, yes.

01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:48.640
That is kind of a puppy be gone.

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.840
You're a hop, skip, and a jump away from canonicals and antichrists.

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.040
Well, I mean, I'm looking at the end game, man.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.920
I got in my mental time machine.

01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:03.320
I went to the future, and I saw a world dominated by carriers, and I came back to warn the people.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:06.120
I'm like John Connor, no.

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.940
Maybe a little bit, if I built a robot version of myself.

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:10.000
Maybe I'm a robot.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Now I'm John Connor.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Ribbit.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:21.040
So a side note, Ray, when you were talking about DigitalOcean, it came to my mind.

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:26.680
When they, as an elementary team, released the ISO, a lot of people were complaining

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:31.320
like, oh my god, it's so slow, because no one decided to seed.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:38.520
So I fired up a DigitalOcean droplet, like the two terabyte transfer one, because I was

01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.240
just going to have it go for a day.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.240
Let him seed it.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.240
Yep.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:46.600
All it cost me in total, because I've already destroyed it, because I only wanted to run

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.600
for that day.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:48.600
Six cents.

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:49.600
That's it.

01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:50.600
Six cents.

01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:51.600
Nice.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:52.600
That's actually, you know what?

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.760
Why don't more Linux distros just do that on their own?

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:59.240
Like on a release day, they should just throw up a few seed boxes on DigitalOcean, and just.

01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:00.240
Seriously.

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:04.720
That's what, when I downloaded the ISO, I let it seed overnight, just to kind of help

01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.720
them out.

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:10.240
Yeah, because DigitalOcean's perfectly fine with it.

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.640
They're like, yeah, if it's a legal torrent, whatever, perfectly fine, whatever, we don't

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640
care.

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:16.640
So.

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:17.640
Who me?

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.600
Look, I agree that the whole communication side of it is dominated by the carriers, but

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:26.480
the apps, the music, the video, the content, the e-books, all of that is still carrier

01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:27.480
independent.

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.480
The experience.

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:34.800
Yeah, it's not red themed for Verizon, pink themed or purple themed for T-mobs, or whatever

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.800
it would be.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:36.800
Hey, Chris.

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:37.800
Red, what?

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:38.800
Speed test requires flash.

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.800
Nobody uses flash.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:40.800
They don't want.
