1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,400
Wes, you're not still using that filthy top, are you?

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,440
Oh gosh, no.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,000
Basic top?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,520
Age top, come on, at least.

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,720
Maybe back in the 80s.

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,760
Well, Wes, I wanna introduce you to Vtop.

7
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,600
Vtop.

8
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,020
Yeah, it's got all the top.

9
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,000
It looks so good.

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,980
Now, it's a little heavy,

11
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:17,360
but it's probably in your local package manager,

12
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,760
or you can install with npm.

13
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,360
It's a graphical activity monitor for the command line.

14
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,480
It's pretty slick, dude.

15
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,080
If you have npm, you can just do npm install-g vtop,

16
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,920
but I installed it right here on my machine.

17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,760
Yeah, you did.

18
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,040
I don't got a lot going on right now,

19
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,420
but you can go through the different processes.

20
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,620
You can look at your memory usage.

21
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,640
You get a real-time graphical representation of your CPU.

22
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,080
It's pretty cool.

23
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,920
Not bad.

24
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,760
Yeah, look at this.

25
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
Things are, jeez, Chrome, man.

26
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,440
Chrome's got 34 threads going right now.

27
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:47,960
It's using 33.9% of my system's RAM.

28
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,000
You know how all a computer is as a web browser these days.

29
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 203, for July 11th, 2017.

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,480
that's installing and upgrading distributions

32
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,360
like some kind of maniac.

33
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,200
My name is Chris.

34
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,040
My name is Wes.

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,880
Hello, Wes.

36
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,700
Hello, sir.

37
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,400
Very excited about today's show.

38
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,680
Any day that we get to cover a new big distribution release

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,920
is a good day.

40
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,800
Fedora 26, coming to Linux Unplugged.

41
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm Chris.

42
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,480
I'm Wes.

43
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,300
Hello, Wes.

44
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,140
Hello, sir.

45
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,440
Very excited about today's show.

46
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,760
Any day that we get to cover a new big distribution release

47
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,880
is a good day, Fedora 26 is here.

48
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,760
It was released this morning, and we've

49
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,600
been installing it on systems all day long.

50
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,320
Not even our own systems, whoops.

51
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,160
I know.

52
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,520
Wait, whoops, uh-oh.

53
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,880
And Matt from the Fedora Project will join us

54
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,920
to cover the new release and explain why we maybe

55
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,520
accidentally installed it on his laptop.

56
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,360
Sorry, sorry about that.

57
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,180
It's our bad.

58
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,020
Sorry about that.

59
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,360
Also, we've got a bunch of great community news,

60
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,640
everything from some Ubuntu shenanigans

61
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,480
to new software projects that we think are super cool.

62
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,280
And updates coming for you Steam users that are,

63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,520
I don't know, you might say many, many years overdue.

64
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,200
Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous to talk about that.

65
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,000
Then we're also gonna get geeky with NF tables.

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,840
Oh, sorry.

67
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,120
Not to confuse you with NFS.

68
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,760
I'm talking about NF tables, the replacement for IP tables.

69
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,160
It's been billed as a performant alternative,

70
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,840
the next generation IP tables.

71
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,720
But has that really been tested?

72
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,540
It looks like a Red Hat engineer took it to the benchmark.

73
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,640
We're gonna talk about some testing that he did

74
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,300
to really throw both NF tables and IP tables

75
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,700
through the wrenches and see how the performance

76
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,720
were different, see where one may perform better.

77
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,840
It's actually very fascinating.

78
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,440
There's a lot of details in there.

79
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,960
Yeah, you found a good one this week, Wes,

80
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,600
so we'll talk about that too.

81
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,980
But we sort of have to get to something

82
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,820
right off the top here.

83
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,600
We've gotta bring in the Mumble Room.

84
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,000
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Greetings.

86
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,680
Hello.

87
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,520
Good to see you.

88
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,340
Greetings.

89
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,480
Hello, hello, hello, and a special hello

90
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,320
to Matt from Fedora.

91
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,640
Hey, Matt.

92
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,120
Hi there, glad to be here.

93
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,440
Sir, it is always good to welcome you back to the show.

94
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
I always love talking to you.

95
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,560
So Matthew Miller is the Fedora project leader.

96
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,020
He's been on the show for the last couple of releases

97
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,960
of Fedora just about here or there.

98
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,280
And today is Fedora 26's release day

99
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,440
with lots of things that are obviously coming

100
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,720
into Fedora 26 from upstream.

101
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,680
The new development tools like GCC 7, Golang 1.8, Python 3.6,

102
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,800
new partitioning tool in Anaconda, the installer.

103
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Also, there is the new LX cute version of the spin.

104
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,720
It's got Kernel 4.11.8, ships with Gnome 3.24,

105
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,260
and all of its new fancy features.

106
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,320
LibreOffice 5.3, Fedora MediaWriter

107
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,120
has gained ARM support.

108
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,800
So if you want to write the Raspberry Pi versions,

109
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,920
Builder now supports things like Flatpak and Rust.

110
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,400
And the cute Odwadia theme has gotten lots of improvements

111
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,240
to make it match the GTK version, including

112
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
support for dark mode.

113
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,080
I mean, this is sounding like a great release, Matt.

114
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,320
Have I missed anything that's your favorite new feature?

115
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,680
So one thing I think is pretty neat

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,000
is we have a new Python classroom spin.

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,480
So one of the things we do, it's actually a lab.

118
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,400
We've divided things up into spins and labs now.

119
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,880
Spins are desktop environments, and the labs

120
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,160
are kind of use-focused things.

121
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,880
So the Python lab, it's basically a classroom

122
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,680
environment in a vagrant box or a Docker container

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,240
or a life USB stick that is basically pre-set up

124
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,220
to get your classroom ready to go to teach Python

125
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:34,680
or a bunch of scientific computing things

126
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,720
based around Python.

127
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,280
Oh, wow.

128
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,580
That's really, I could definitely

129
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,360
see that in a classroom somewhere.

130
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,960
Yeah, and I really like this because as a project,

131
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,440
we've been looking a little bit at our mission

132
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,200
and what we want to do, what makes Fedora unique and special.

133
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,840
And we came up with a new mission statement, which I

134
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,760
cannot say off the top of my head, although it is, yeah.

135
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,920
But the basic idea is we build a platform that

136
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,600
enables our contributors and other software

137
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,120
to make solutions for users.

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,800
And so this is a great example of here's

139
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,640
some things that some contributors did.

140
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,000
This wasn't a top-down, let's make a Python thing.

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,880
But some people who are involved in Fedora wanted to do this.

142
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,400
And we provide the tooling and stuff to make a kit like that.

143
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,600
And I'd like to see a lot more of those kind of things

144
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
for special use cases.

145
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,920
So there's a few things that have

146
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,760
sort of been on the ancillary edges of this release that

147
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,680
have also gotten my attention.

148
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,100
And so what I thought we would do

149
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,720
is maybe talk about a couple of things

150
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,680
that the Fedora project is working on.

151
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,920
And then sort of the second half of this would be our take

152
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,400
on the release, because both Wes and I have had a chance

153
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,160
to kick the tires.

154
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,680
And I've had this long-running Digital Ocean Droplet

155
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,160
instance since either Fedora 24 or 23

156
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,120
that I've been upgrading every single release.

157
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,120
And I run a couple of Docker containers on here,

158
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,760
and I manage it with Cockpit.

159
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,960
And it's sort of been my, how long can you run a Fedora server

160
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,320
and not have it break?

161
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,240
And so I completed that upgrade before the show.

162
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,920
And did my testing on it.

163
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,000
So I'll give you my report on that as well.

164
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,960
But not to take away attention from the release of Fedora 26,

165
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,440
but I always love to do this to you.

166
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,320
I noticed something about future releases

167
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,980
that really got my attention.

168
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,120
And I don't really even know how to put this right.

169
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,560
But it looks like Rawhide is seeing a shift as of about

170
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,840
right now, where essentially it sounds like Rawhide will be more

171
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,680
like a rolling release that you intend people

172
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,080
to use as a daily driver.

173
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,040
I quote directly from the wiki, it

174
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,500
will be generally useful to people

175
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,920
to use as a daily driver and a development platform

176
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,000
and means we no longer need to go

177
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,300
through the process of building, testing, and shipping

178
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,120
alpha releases.

179
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,800
And the entry on the wiki is no more alpha

180
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,840
for the Fedora project.

181
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,320
What's going on here, Matt?

182
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,760
Yeah, that's the plan.

183
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,960
I mean, this is part of an overall push

184
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,440
we have for more automated testing.

185
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,960
This is more validation testing rather than continuous

186
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,840
integration testing, which happens kind of more

187
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,200
the developer side.

188
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,440
But basically, Adam Williamson, who's one of our top QA people,

189
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:15,320
has been working with the SUSE thing, the open QA tool,

190
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
to set up a lot of automated tests.

191
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,760
Basically, all of the basic tests

192
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,000
that we've previously always done by hand

193
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,680
to make sure the alpha was ready,

194
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,520
those are basically imported as automated tests already.

195
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,800
So basically, there's the changes to make those gating

196
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,840
and so that automatic raw hide basically happens.

197
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,600
Something like an alpha happens every night,

198
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,360
assuming all the tests pass.

199
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,160
And so essentially, the raw hide system

200
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,240
is running through open SUSE QA?

201
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,920
Yeah, through the open QA thing that open SUSE made, yeah.

202
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,960
And so yeah, there's kind of two advantages.

203
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,040
The one advantage is that we can get more people using it.

204
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,040
I think it might be a little bit ambitious to say

205
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,400
this is like our rolling release because it's

206
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,680
still going to change a lot.

207
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,040
And I think that if you want to use this,

208
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,880
you've got to be willing to be like, well,

209
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,320
my system broke this afternoon.

210
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,840
I wonder what wasn't getting tested.

211
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,160
This should have been getting tested.

212
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,440
Very good to know.

213
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,880
Yeah, definitely.

214
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,960
But if you enjoy that kind of thing, I think it will be good.

215
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,480
And we do have a number of people

216
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,640
who are running raw hide already, as it is right now.

217
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,040
And generally, that kind of thing

218
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,000
happens maybe once a season or so.

219
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,280
So it's not that bad of a risk.

220
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:38,840
But if we can reduce that so you can maybe roll back or have

221
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,720
something a little bit better.

222
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,880
So that's one benefit.

223
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,760
And the other benefit is basically

224
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,680
that every time we put out a release, that is a lot of work.

225
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,520
And that's one of the reasons distributions

226
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,280
like rolling releases because it's like,

227
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,480
what else could we do if we skipped all that trouble

228
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,480
we were doing making releases and just did stuff?

229
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,360
So removing alphas is a way of removing some amount of work.

230
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,840
And with the automated testing, we're

231
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,680
feeling pretty confident that we can do that

232
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,480
without negative impact on the project.

233
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,520
Right, and it would seem to me that if raw hide is getting

234
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,320
continuously ran through automated QA,

235
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,680
that it would probably raise the average quality of it,

236
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,680
which would probably make average releases quality

237
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,320
better.

238
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,400
Exactly, exactly.

239
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,960
And yeah, one of the problems we ran into in this last release

240
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,120
is that some of the things came down

241
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,600
to tests that hadn't been done for a while

242
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,360
and they were just done on the last day before the release.

243
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,680
Then we're like, oh, look, virtualization on AMD

244
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,920
is broken.

245
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,720
So then we had to trace down that bug

246
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,280
like all at the last minute.

247
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,320
And so if we have automated tests running all those things

248
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,520
all the time, we can catch them long before they become

249
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,080
a crisis.

250
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,240
Sure, yeah, that makes sense.

251
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,480
I guess so, oh, hi there.

252
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,680
So my little playback there, a little echo back,

253
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,320
but now it's gone.

254
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,720
My follow-up question to that would

255
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,440
be, could you share any of the background

256
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,080
on how the Fedora project began working with the open QA

257
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,200
project from OpenSUSE?

258
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,880
I'm just curious, was there an event and you guys shook hands?

259
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,000
They're like, hey, let me show you what we're doing.

260
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,680
And you guys went, hmm, we could really use that.

261
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,440
How did that process initiate?

262
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,840
I'm not quite sure for this one, but a lot of stuff

263
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,920
happens at conferences like FOSADEM and things

264
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,400
where people get together in the distro dev room

265
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,040
and people show off their stuff.

266
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,840
I think that actually may be the genesis

267
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,000
of this particular thing, but I'm not quite sure.

268
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,760
It might just be us looking around.

269
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,240
A lot of people in the project like

270
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,600
to look and see what cool things other distros are doing.

271
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,440
And it's all open source, so we take advantage of it

272
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,040
where we can.

273
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,440
I think it's actually pretty cool.

274
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,640
It shows an open-mindedness.

275
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,560
Definitely, and we've talked a lot about open QA

276
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,280
here on this show, but haven't necessarily

277
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,320
seen the kind of adoption that we thought might make sense.

278
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
So this really bolsters, I think, both projects.

279
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,040
So Rawhide is going in an interesting direction

280
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,400
if things continue.

281
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,200
Is there a trend line here, or is this

282
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,880
just sort of the next evolution and what's

283
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,920
going to stay here for a bit?

284
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,800
And the question, really, what I'm asking is,

285
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,240
are we trending towards a Fedora rolling,

286
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,040
or is this not really likely the end goal of what Rawhide's

287
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,280
to become?

288
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,200
Yeah, so I think I said this on here before.

289
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,680
I've got strong opinions about rolling releases,

290
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,240
and that is there's sort of two people that rolling releases

291
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,120
benefit, and one is enthusiast people

292
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,200
who want the latest of everything

293
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,880
and just don't mind waking up to a surprise,

294
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,240
and now all of the buttons on my screen have moved around,

295
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,360
and hey, it's innovation.

296
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,120
That's one demographic, and that's probably

297
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,440
a lot of your listeners, right?

298
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,040
I don't know.

299
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,600
I don't know.

300
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,400
I can also sympathize with that to some degree.

301
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,280
It can be kind of fun.

302
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,640
I'm getting some new stuff for its own sake.

303
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:47,520
And the other one is basically the distro themselves,

304
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,160
because it's a lot less work.

305
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,080
But from a user point of view, I think having real releases

306
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,000
is actually a lot better, because in any distribution,

307
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,880
there's just a whole bunch of change,

308
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,280
and you can test to make sure things aren't awful

309
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:05,160
and don't crash, but you can't test for that thing easily

310
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,320
for the UI changed in this, or now that program's gone.

311
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,120
And so with a rolling release, you need something to target.

312
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,640
Right.

313
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,280
And with a rolling release, you get that basically

314
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,240
whenever the distro developers put it in there,

315
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
and then you get it, or else.

316
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,200
And if you decide to not, you then don't get security updates,

317
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,160
because that's the idea, basically.

318
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,560
You take it or you don't.

319
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,520
Yeah, makes sense.

320
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,680
So I think releases are better, because it

321
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,280
lets you have a window when you can decide, OK, this Thursday,

322
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,360
I'm going to maybe have to relearn how my menus work,

323
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,600
because I'm going to the new version.

324
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,920
So I think there's always a bunch of pain as change happens.

325
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,880
Change is pain.

326
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,160
That's one of those life-truth things.

327
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,920
And I think our model of releases

328
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,520
helps users manage that.

329
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,400
So I think we probably always want

330
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,960
to keep that to some degree.

331
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,640
Makes sense.

332
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,760
So let me ask you about another forward-looking thing

333
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,200
that I saw during this release.

334
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,840
And I don't know if I'm saying the name right,

335
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,960
because I've never heard anybody say it out loud before.

336
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,600
Fedora 26 Boltron server?

337
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,320
Or Boltron?

338
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,120
Boltron.

339
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,760
It's like Voltron bolted together, right?

340
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,080
I don't know.

341
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,320
I was thinking that.

342
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,400
There's a nerd joke in there somewhere.

343
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,160
Yeah, so this is actually very related to that.

344
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,200
Because the basic problem people have in an operating system

345
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,000
and a distribution overall is stuff

346
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,720
moving too fast or too slow.

347
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,200
And the rolling release basically

348
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,080
says everything's going to move fast.

349
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,400
And a LTS says everything's going to move slow.

350
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,040
And generally, nobody's happy with either one of those things

351
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,400
and you want something else.

352
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,120
So this basically lets us separate the hardware

353
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,880
enablement in the operating system from your applications

354
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,360
and have different streams where those things can actually

355
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,920
move at different speeds.

356
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,800
So you could, say, have basically a Ruby version

357
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,320
that you keep at the same version

358
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,440
even as you upgrade the base underneath it

359
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,680
and that kind of thing.

360
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,280
How is that accomplished?

361
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,520
There's a crazy thing called module build service.

362
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,120
You basically define a module, which

363
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,120
is a collection of packages, and then say, OK,

364
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,520
build this against this build root.

365
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,400
And then that's built against basically every new base

366
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,560
operating systems out.

367
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,160
We're making this stuff up right now.

368
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,480
So check out Boltron and see a little bit how

369
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,960
it's going to be accomplished.

370
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,760
But if it's successful, it's going

371
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,760
to be a big shift in how we make the distribution.

372
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,840
Right now, we're focused on I'm making

373
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,640
this package for Fedora 26, this package for Fedora 25.

374
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,280
In the future, if this works out, you'll focus on,

375
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,520
I'm making, say, the latest stream of this package

376
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,520
or the stable stream of this package or the version 1

377
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,360
stream and the version 2 stream.

378
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
And then you build that stream across all

379
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,920
of the underlying base OSes that we produce.

380
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,520
This sounds like a feature that must

381
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,200
have come from application developer feedback

382
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,640
or enterprise customer somewhere.

383
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,260
What's the background there?

384
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,640
Yeah, well, honestly, it's something

385
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
I've been thinking about.

386
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,360
I've been working on Linux distributions

387
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,960
for like 17 years now.

388
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,320
So it's kind of been the thing I've been hearing from users

389
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,040
all the time.

390
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,160
This is the pain I have.

391
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,200
So we wanted to try and address that pain.

392
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,000
So this is one stab at doing that, basically.

393
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,120
It really got my attention.

394
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,600
It sounds like a really cool idea.

395
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,080
And there's been a background debate recently

396
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,240
about new distributions that are coming up

397
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,040
by hardware manufacturers, both Tuxedo and System76.

398
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,200
And one of the arguments that both of them

399
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,920
has put forward is the LTS is too slow for us.

400
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,640
And we have customers that have problems.

401
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,480
And the solution to these problems

402
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,600
is to replace maybe its NGINX, or its PHP,

403
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,720
or it's the SQL server, or it's even the DHCP client

404
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,360
on that server to fix this problem.

405
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,960
And we end up getting in this weird position of trying

406
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,240
to decide if we package that up ourselves

407
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,960
and slip it in as a PPA, or how to evenly manage this.

408
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,200
And it gets to a point where it's, well, screw it.

409
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,320
Let's just ship our own OS, where

410
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,160
we can manage the package releases ourselves.

411
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,720
And this could sort of solve that problem.

412
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah, that's exactly the idea.

413
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,480
And the problem with the screw it,

414
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,840
or we're going to do it ourselves approach,

415
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,040
is that now you've created something that's

416
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,400
yet another thing that fits only one use case, right?

417
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,760
And then some of your customers are

418
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,960
going to have a different use case, and they're out of luck.

419
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, that's a good point.

420
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,520
So my kind of last question is just really self-serving.

421
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:33,320
But we're sort of at an interesting point

422
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,880
here in studio about what we're considering using

423
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,960
for our production distro.

424
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,480
And Fedora is on my mind.

425
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,240
To be honest with you, my only question

426
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,200
is, what would be the right spin for somebody

427
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,040
who wants an extremely, or spin, or whatever

428
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,840
their terminology is, for somebody who wants,

429
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,840
essentially, a bulletproof workstation that's

430
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,800
Fedora-based, though?

431
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,260
See, when I think of Fedora, I think of a great workstation,

432
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,880
except for these are five, six-year systems

433
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,720
that I'd like to have running.

434
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,000
But CentOS moves too slow for me.

435
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,320
What is the solution in the Fedora world for this problem?

436
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,080
Well, so our main solution is that we've

437
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,880
tried to work on making upgrades less painful for you,

438
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,440
so that we don't have a five, six-year solution.

439
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,960
But basically, they've put a lot of engineering

440
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,040
into making sure that every upgrade goes smoothly,

441
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,680
and so that you go from one release to the next,

442
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,880
and your pain is minimized in doing that.

443
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,080
This is, again, like I often get the,

444
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,000
you should make a roll-on release, or an LTS,

445
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,180
and since those things are opposite ends of the spectrum,

446
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,980
when I dig into it, I often hear,

447
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,080
well, I don't wanna do that upgrade, it's so painful.

448
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,800
So, we've worked on making the upgrades less painful.

449
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,000
So, yeah, upgrades to Fedora 25, 26,

450
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,080
both on all of my systems, have been half-hour affairs.

451
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,480
I started it, went and got some coffee, came back,

452
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
and then I was like, oh, there we go.

453
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,520
And I think, especially for a workstation,

454
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,160
as GNOME has kind of settled down with GNOME 3

455
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,420
into a nice, comfortable environment,

456
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,520
they've got a lot of the rough edges

457
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,780
from the initial release sort of polished.

458
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,980
And basically, it's kind of increasing polish

459
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,240
instead of disruptive change every release.

460
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,380
Like, back in the first couple of GNOME 3 releases,

461
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,220
not only was GNOME 3 itself kind of shocking,

462
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,280
every point release was also, oh my goodness,

463
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,680
everything's new again.

464
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,800
Or there was GDK breakage.

465
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,640
Right.

466
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,460
Right.

467
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,300
Yeah.

468
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,400
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

469
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,400
And I feel like that's a really solid answer for the server.

470
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,920
I'll just cover really, really briefly to just cover it.

471
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:51,280
My Fedora 26 server right now running on DigitalOcean is,

472
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,640
I think it's either from Fedora 23 or Fedora 24.

473
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,560
And it's a Fedora server install

474
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,680
that I then installed, or cockpit was installed,

475
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,880
and I installed several droplets,

476
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,000
one of them a Nextcloud instance,

477
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,320
one of them a Plex server and an MB instance.

478
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,240
So I have both those running different containers.

479
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,800
And I've been chugging along with the upgrade releases

480
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,720
on day one of Fedora releases, which, you know,

481
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,560
I'm gonna say is-

482
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,520
That's kind of unheard of for you.

483
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,760
Well, I mean, you know, if you're not in a rush,

484
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,440
go ahead, give it a couple days, let it sit, you know?

485
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,280
But I, nope, because I've been wanting to talk about it.

486
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,480
And sure enough, if not a single thing's broken yet,

487
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,600
the thing is still running today.

488
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,160
I mean, there's nothing really to report.

489
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,480
The upgrade went totally smooth.

490
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,680
It's actually, the process is,

491
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,360
it's actually pretty good.

492
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,280
And Matt, are you the one that writes up

493
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,560
the upgrade posts every release?

494
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,640
Cause these are always easy to find and straight forward.

495
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,160
No, I think Justin Flory wrote those, they're very nice.

496
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,440
Oh yeah, Justin, yeah, I see that, yeah.

497
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,240
And it's just a simple process.

498
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,960
It goes through, it's really easy to do it through the GUI,

499
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,160
but of course I'm doing it on a server.

500
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,920
So I always use the different DNF commands.

501
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:05,560
And I'm always pleasantly surprised at how clear DNF is

502
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,400
and how safe it is.

503
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,960
It does all the downloads, it does all the checks.

504
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,680
Then you tell it to do a DNF system dash upgrade reboot.

505
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,560
It reboots into the kernel of the current,

506
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,520
of the, you know, the release you're upgrading from,

507
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,040
installs all the packages, verifies everything,

508
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,880
does another reboot now into the new kernel, and you're done.

509
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,720
Bob's your uncle.

510
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,640
Everything's, your cockpit's running again,

511
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,480
your containers are back up and running.

512
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,600
That's the one thing that really stood out to me.

513
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,320
It's like, with that DNF in general,

514
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,960
it seems like it's very, it's been thought out,

515
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,440
it's well-founded, I can trust it a little bit more

516
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,000
than maybe some of the competing package managers.

517
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
Yeah, so it's funny, you know, people don't,

518
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,040
I don't think can, you know,

519
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,480
normally think of maybe Fedora on their VPS,

520
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,880
but I'll tell you, it's been working solid for me.

521
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,800
But I don't know if that's gonna hold true, Matt,

522
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,240
if you're somebody who has maybe RPM fusion set up,

523
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,960
or you have, I don't know,

524
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,720
something outside the Fedora repos,

525
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,600
or maybe you have the Nvidia graphics driver.

526
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,560
Isn't it then not exactly as smooth?

527
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,920
Yeah, I mean, that's always hard,

528
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,520
because we're dependent on other people

529
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,600
for those kind of things.

530
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,520
And, you know, some of those third-party repos

531
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,400
package things that we can't even talk about,

532
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,200
so that makes the situation difficult.

533
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,600
Oh, yeah.

534
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,120
So, yeah, so that can definitely be a problem.

535
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,600
I know that some of them had problems in the past

536
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,600
that they are doing better with.

537
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,880
We're also, the workstation team is working

538
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,880
on building some relationships with Nvidia

539
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,040
and with some of the third-party repo providers,

540
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,360
where we can't point to, for legal reasons,

541
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,920
basically to a third-party repository

542
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,720
that has arbitrary things,

543
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,520
but we might be able to point to a repository

544
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
that has just a specific thing

545
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,440
that we know is okay for us to point to,

546
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,760
something that we wouldn't include in Fedora

547
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,080
for, you know, it's not free software.

548
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,720
We're never gonna include not free software

549
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,000
in Fedora directly,

550
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,200
but we know people need to make their hardware work,

551
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,840
so we would like to make it easy

552
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,880
to enable those kind of things,

553
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,560
or something that, whatever other reason,

554
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,800
isn't packaged in Fedora,

555
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,360
but we wanna make it available to people.

556
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,360
You know, so there was a post recently

557
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,400
about some future projects that Fedora's working.

558
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,880
In fact, even in the release notes,

559
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:10,560
or the release post on Fedora Magazine for 26,

560
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,840
there's sort of an inference in there

561
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,320
about some things that are coming down the pipe wire,

562
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,280
if you will, the pipe wire.

563
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,640
Can we, if you have just a minute,

564
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,240
I'm gonna take a minute and I'm gonna mention

565
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,520
our first sponsor, and then that'll be

566
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,160
pretty much my last question for you for the day,

567
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,760
and then we'll let you get out of here.

568
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,880
Everybody head over to linux.ting.com,

569
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,880
support the show, and get a great deal on mobile

570
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
the way it should work.

571
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,800
They'll give you a $25 service credit

572
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,040
if you bring a device,

573
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,680
and they have CDMA and GSM network,

574
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,840
so the compatibility factor is high,

575
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,680
check their BYOD page,

576
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,920
or if you need a new one,

577
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
they'll give you $25 off the device.

578
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,200
I mention this because it's really

579
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,760
a smarter way to do mobile.

580
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,400
It's so simple, it's how things would go

581
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,240
if the wireless industry had to reboot today

582
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,200
and be competitive.

583
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,880
It's $6 for a line,

584
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,520
you choose whether you want CDMA or GSM,

585
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,840
which is super nice,

586
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,200
you can bring an unlocked device

587
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,640
or buy one directly from them,

588
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,200
and then you just pay for what you use.

589
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,440
And with that, you get every feature you would expect,

590
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,280
I mean, really great stuff,

591
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,160
including hotspot and tethering.

592
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,080
Ting doesn't have any agendas for you to be

593
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,360
only using streaming at certain times of day

594
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,840
when you use these certain providers,

595
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,920
or else they're gonna, none of that,

596
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,280
no re-encoding garbage.

597
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,200
In fact, they're a pretty big supporter of net neutrality.

598
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,240
They have no contracts, no determination fees,

599
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,560
nationwide coverage, you just pay for what you use

600
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,600
with a great dashboard.

601
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,040
And they just recently posted a video

602
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,480
about Ting's privacy policy,

603
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,760
which, you know, I think is actually worth playing.

604
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,240
I'll just play a brief moment of it here on the show

605
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,480
because it might be something you're wondering

606
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,960
if you're gonna become a Ting customer.

607
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,080
It's kind of a legit question.

608
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,880
Does Ting sell personal information?

609
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,440
Ting does not sell personal information.

610
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,600
Ting's parent company, Two Cows,

611
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,440
has long been committed to protecting consumer privacy.

612
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,200
We do not aggregate information, we do not sell it.

613
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,280
And in fact, we actively advocate

614
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,680
for consumer privacy protections

615
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,600
at the legislative and regulatory levels.

616
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,560
Can your wireless carrier say that?

617
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,600
I don't know about that.

618
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,920
Linux.ting.com, a big thank you to Ting

619
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,880
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

620
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,560
Linux.ting.com.

621
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
So I think Matt might have a roast in the oven

622
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,440
after Run Soon, so I just, really kind of my,

623
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,760
sort of my last question to you is,

624
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,040
can we talk a little bit about the stuff

625
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,560
in the incubator, like PipeWire?

626
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,720
That has got my interest piqued,

627
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,560
and I've seen a lot of people in our audience

628
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,840
that are excited about PipeWire.

629
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,080
These are like some crazy projects

630
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,320
that are coming from you guys.

631
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,920
Yeah, PipeWire is something from the desktop team

632
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,800
and can own people.

633
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,800
I'm not actually sure of all the details of that.

634
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,520
You might wanna get Kristen Schaller on here sometime.

635
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,760
He wrote that blog post.

636
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,360
I can talk to him for you guys and get him

637
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,200
to talk about some of those things.

638
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,040
That would be awesome.

639
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,040
I would really, I would love to.

640
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,280
I'm sure he, I'm sure he would,

641
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,840
I won't completely speak for him,

642
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,600
but I'm pretty sure he'd love to do it as well.

643
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,160
So I'll talk to him.

644
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,000
Cool.

645
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,600
Yeah, my thoughts are a lot more on

646
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,160
how we put together the distro

647
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,240
and what we're doing to make it

648
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,720
rather than what's going into it.

649
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,480
His thoughts are a lot more on what's going into it.

650
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,480
Here's my meta question about it though.

651
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,040
So why Fedora?

652
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,360
I mean, like, there's so many things to be working on.

653
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,760
Why are some of these things incubated in Fedora first?

654
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,000
I guess I don't, I don't, I mean,

655
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,360
I understand that everybody wants

656
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,760
to make the experience better,

657
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,920
but there's some mountains that some distributions

658
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,440
don't ever seem to wanna take on.

659
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,760
And then Fedora comes along and just sort of nonchalantly

660
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,960
says, yeah, well, we're gonna replace

661
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,400
the entire audio video pipeline on Linux,

662
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,240
or we're gonna rework the way network management is handled,

663
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,720
or, hey, you know what would be great

664
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,000
is if we had this unified init system

665
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,400
across all distributions, like there's this crazy,

666
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,320
like nobody can do that kind of projects

667
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,480
that get started over in your camp.

668
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,400
And I don't, what is it?

669
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,440
I mean, what is it, why?

670
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,560
Yeah, it's foundational to what Fedora is.

671
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,240
It's basically, it's one of our, you know,

672
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,360
Fedora, we have these Fedora foundations,

673
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,200
which are like the project values.

674
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,880
So features is one of those things

675
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,880
where we try and get all these things

676
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,840
that are going to be the next generation of the operating

677
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,720
system and get the new version of the software there.

678
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,800
And we want to experiment with it first.

679
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,760
So it's part of what we're here for.

680
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,440
So it makes it a natural place for people

681
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,880
who are interested in that kind of thing.

682
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,120
So then it's sort of self-fulfilling

683
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,040
because it attracts people

684
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,840
who want to do those kinds of things.

685
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,440
And also, you know, we've got a slant towards saying,

686
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,000
yes, we're going to do that.

687
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,040
Why the hell not?

688
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,160
All right, well, you know, Matt,

689
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,880
is there anything else you wanna add to all of this

690
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,320
before we wrap it up with you?

691
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,120
I don't think so.

692
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,320
I think this has been great.

693
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,880
I'm glad your upgrade went well.

694
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
I was a little bit prepared for,

695
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,400
and then everything horribly exploded.

696
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,400
But no, in fact, I've heard just a lot of good things today.

697
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,960
So that's, it's been a very successful,

698
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,600
nice release day with very few fires.

699
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,800
I mean, it seems like a release

700
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,440
that's just got a lot of improvements

701
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,280
and a lot of refinements.

702
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,640
It's not anything that's dramatic, right?

703
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,560
Yeah, I do have to say that the wallpaper

704
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,680
is like the most beautiful Fedora wallpaper

705
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,520
I've ever seen.

706
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,280
And I'm lobbying to keep it for a couple of releases.

707
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,160
It's so nice.

708
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,440
It's surprising too, like how well it looks,

709
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,640
like when you bring up like the applications menu,

710
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,280
when you log, I logged into the Plasma desktop

711
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,800
and it had that background on there

712
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,760
and just the colors matched the menu bar so well, ugh.

713
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,720
And also the shape there of the tree line

714
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,400
is actually based on the wave form

715
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,680
of somebody saying Fedora.

716
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,320
So it's also super, super geeky.

717
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,160
That's awesome.

718
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,200
I have to endorse.

719
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,080
I'm really, I really appreciate you saying that

720
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,680
because the first time I saw it, I thought,

721
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,480
oh, that's a wave, oh no, those are trees.

722
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,600
So that's awesome.

723
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,200
I've seen a few wave forms in my day.

724
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,720
And it was a nice example of collaborative design too,

725
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,520
where the design group, which is, you know,

726
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,720
a bunch of community people from all over the world

727
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,160
kind of started with this idea of a wave form

728
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,080
and then iterated on it till we came out with this.

729
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,520
So I really love it.

730
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,360
That is great.

731
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,840
Yeah, so if you guys want to see that,

732
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,640
either install Fedora or you can go check out

733
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,240
the Fedora Magazine post where Matt went through

734
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,080
the new release.

735
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,600
Matt, thank you so much for coming on the show.

736
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,720
It looks like a great release

737
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,800
and I hope to hear from you soon.

738
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,640
Yeah, thanks again.

739
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,200
I'll love to talk to you again later.

740
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,160
And I will talk to Christian,

741
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,320
see if I can get him on your show for you.

742
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,160
That would be awesome.

743
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,000
Thank you.

744
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,840
Love to chat with him.

745
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,680
Have a good one.

746
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,080
Cool, yep, bye.

747
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,320
So I had a chance to also, like I was saying,

748
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,880
kick the tires on the Plasma Edition,

749
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,600
which is the first time I've ever done that.

750
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,520
I've always, always gone gnome.

751
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,400
Always have because, you know,

752
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,240
it's just such an obvious solid gnome.

753
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,080
It's Fedora.

754
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,000
So I've just, just got started.

755
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,120
But, you know, out of the box, it does look really,

756
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,400
it looks really nice.

757
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,240
It's definitely, it's got me thinking

758
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,280
about some of the woes we've had here in the studio.

759
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,280
And right now I have been leaning Ubuntu LTS

760
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:49,560
with maybe like a OBS PPA or something like that.

761
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,080
But now I'm just kind of wondering

762
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,440
if I installed an OBS rig or Fedora 26 rig

763
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,280
and tried to put OBS on there.

764
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,160
What would that look like?

765
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah.

766
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,320
Hmm, I don't know.

767
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,000
I think it might be worth trying.

768
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,840
Because with all this stuff,

769
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,120
like you've been playing a lot with Docker

770
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,640
and we covered some of the stuff about running

771
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,920
even X apps and system D containers.

772
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,160
Like it seems like there's a lot of,

773
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,480
maybe the application relative unavailability of Fedora

774
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,800
that we sometimes talk about.

775
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,160
Maybe that's less of a thing in this modern Linux world.

776
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,000
Speaking of that, Minimac,

777
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,800
you were saying that it's actually much better

778
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,240
as far as like the community goes

779
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,360
with keeping up with Fedora releases now.

780
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,680
Yeah, it is definitely.

781
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,040
For example, OBS Studio is available now

782
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,240
on Fedora 26 on release day.

783
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,120
The third party repositories are really available.

784
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,920
Most of them, most of them.

785
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,720
And it's always, I always surprise.

786
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,960
You see, Chris, you're talking about a Fedora 26 server

787
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,040
with Docker and everything.

788
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,600
And I'm running that on the Chromebook

789
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,680
with two gigs of RAM.

790
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,760
And I have OBS Studio running here with my webcam

791
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,680
and everything.

792
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,760
I'm really surprised.

793
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,360
That's a really good distribution.

794
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,200
Really cool.

795
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,020
Wow.

796
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,860
Really cool.

797
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,440
I'm thinking about quitting another distribution

798
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,400
that shall not be named.

799
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,400
Oh, yeah.

800
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,360
It does seem to be, it's always nice to look.

801
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,200
I mean, I'm gonna be honest.

802
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,600
I've always been a bit of a hopper.

803
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,240
I stayed on Arch for quite a while,

804
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,520
but my hopper tendencies have been coming back recently,

805
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,960
if I'm gonna be honest with you.

806
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,280
You know, Mr. Wes, did you get a chance to try,

807
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,120
before we go on?

808
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,940
I didn't want to say anything else,

809
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,600
but before we go on, are you running it right there?

810
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,440
Oh, yeah.

811
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,280
And you're running the GNOME version?

812
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,120
I am.

813
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,480
I would be, I'd be really interested

814
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,320
to hear your thoughts,

815
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,800
because I have not tried the GNOME one.

816
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,960
You know, it's actually pretty slick.

817
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,960
I hate the default theme a lot less than I normally do.

818
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,760
Honestly, I just installed it.

819
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,240
I've done no customization.

820
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,080
It's pretty usable.

821
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,900
I could use this for a while.

822
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,800
Eventually, I would probably want ArcDark or whatever

823
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,840
installed with a few little tweaks here and there,

824
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,720
dash to dock, whatever.

825
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,540
All the normal things, but right here, it's pretty nice.

826
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,680
And I was very impressed with,

827
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,400
they have a nice little welcome screen,

828
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,320
kind of gets things set up.

829
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,960
The GNOME software's improved a lot over the years,

830
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,280
so that's like a decent experience,

831
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,120
and I've almost always had some kind of problem

832
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,960
with Anaconda.

833
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,400
It's always been my least favorite of the common installers.

834
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,080
This time, okay, first time, it crashed on me,

835
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,920
and I just rebooted it and did it again,

836
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,400
but that time, it worked perfectly.

837
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,920
I have kind of a weird partitioning scheme,

838
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,420
because there's already a couple OSs on here,

839
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,080
and in the past, that's really caused problems.

840
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,960
This time, nope, easy peasy.

841
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,460
Yeah, yeah, and that's the new,

842
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,760
Matt, are you still by the mic by chance?

843
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,120
Because that's one thing we didn't mention,

844
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
is there's a new partitioner in Anaconda

845
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,760
if you do the custom partitioning setup.

846
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,840
I am still here, yeah.

847
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,320
Is there anything more to add to that?

848
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,760
So what is, it's got a new name, or, I can't remember.

849
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,120
Yeah, it's called Blivit GUI, which is, I don't know,

850
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
another, some sort of in-joke of some sort.

851
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,120
I actually would like it to be something

852
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,320
a little more polished in the UI,

853
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,460
but we'll get to that eventually.

854
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,460
The basic thing is, when there's a big Anaconda rewrite,

855
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,020
like in Fedora 17 or 18 or something like that,

856
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,020
and it was based on a lot of the user studies

857
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,820
on how people install systems,

858
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,020
and the idea basically is, instead of telling it,

859
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,820
I've got this disk and this disk,

860
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,180
and I wanna make a partition on it in the logical volume,

861
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,220
and then this and this and this, and building it up,

862
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,140
you would say, I've got these disks,

863
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,620
I would like redundancy,

864
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,500
I would like a journaling file system, give it to me,

865
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,260
and then it would determine your configuration from that,

866
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,820
so it's kind of a top-down thing,

867
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,660
and I think that's good, especially for people who,

868
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,220
whom, when I say partitions and logical volumes,

869
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,100
they kind of get a panic look, it's really great for that,

870
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,580
but a lot of people have special cases

871
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,140
that didn't feel that covered,

872
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,460
or they definitely want to have partition,

873
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,820
the first partition be home,

874
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,040
because that's important to them,

875
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,260
or they are just more comfortable

876
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,300
doing the buildup kind of thing,

877
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,380
and so those people have, for a long time,

878
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,140
felt like the installer, Fedora installer,

879
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,620
doesn't suit their needs,

880
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,580
so this basically adds a third option

881
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,020
that's kind of a true partition manager thing

882
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,020
that can do a lot of very sophisticated things

883
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,500
for a buildup from the bottom environment.

884
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,300
On the other hand, you can,

885
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,740
and I did several times in testing,

886
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:12,080
make systems that will not boot that way,

887
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,420
so it really is for, if you know what you're doing,

888
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,280
this lets you do it.

889
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,340
Yeah, I did play around with it a little bit,

890
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,180
that definitely echoes,

891
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,420
it seems, there's not a lot of hand-holding,

892
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,260
but it is a lot more reminiscent of what you get

893
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,520
in a lot of other installers,

894
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,840
or even just something like, you know,

895
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,680
gnome disks or gparted.

896
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,020
And if you're going off in that neck of the woods,

897
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,340
you probably, that's probably the tool you want.

898
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,940
Yeah, it's like a power user escape hatch,

899
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,040
which I think is actually pretty nice.

900
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,260
I didn't use it ultimately to install my system,

901
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,800
I went back to the standard custom solution,

902
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,140
but it really, I think as it evolves,

903
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,900
I'll be happy to use it.

904
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,340
Yeah, and one of the UI problems we have a lot with that

905
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,860
is our installer people discovered that

906
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,180
if you have an advanced option,

907
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,020
people will always pick it,

908
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,400
even if it's going to make their life miserable.

909
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,260
So we wanted to try and figure out

910
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:58,940
how to freight it properly to get people steered,

911
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,140
not to choose it if they didn't know what it was.

912
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,700
So I'm possibly leaving it named blivet-gui

913
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,860
is the right thing for that for now,

914
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,220
but we'll figure that out.

915
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,200
I, it's a pretty, like I said,

916
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,100
it's a nice solid release

917
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,680
with tons of new stuff from upstream,

918
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,420
cause I mean, just bringing in that new gnome release

919
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,980
and then, and now also the new plasma release

920
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,300
and then when Anaconda gets some nice improvements,

921
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,420
it's just check, it's worth checking out for door 26.

922
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,740
And if you're crazy like me,

923
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,820
it's also very deployable on your digital ocean droplet.

924
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,240
If you go to digital ocean right now,

925
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,020
create an account and use our promo code DOUNPLUGED,

926
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,000
apply that to your account and you'll get a $10 credit.

927
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,500
Now at the moment it's fedora 25

928
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,900
is what's deployable on digital ocean.

929
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,540
However, I just did it a little bit during the show.

930
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,740
I spun up a 25 instance and I upgraded it to fedora 26,

931
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,600
just clean install, worked flawlessly.

932
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,420
So if you want to run that, you can also do that too.

933
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,620
It's all, I'll link to, in the show notes,

934
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,940
I have a link to how to upgrade

935
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,140
from fedora 25 to fedora 26.

936
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,860
I've been, I have a droplet now on this, on digital ocean.

937
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,340
It's four years old.

938
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,180
Wow.

939
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,860
I did not realize I've been using digital ocean that long.

940
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,460
Four years, it's an arch box.

941
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,300
It's an arch zone.

942
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,020
Good work, you've been doing your updates.

943
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,340
I've been keeping on, I've been keeping on.

944
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,260
And I have now also been running a fedora droplet for ages

945
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,060
and then I've got a bunch of Ubuntu droplets

946
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,500
and it's, you know, they also, they offer free BSD

947
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,780
and a bunch of other distributions.

948
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:29,260
It's a really easy way to spin up infrastructure on demand,

949
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,280
whether you want something personally for yourself

950
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,740
or hosting for your business.

951
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,380
Everything's SSDs from the low priced rigs

952
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,780
all the way up to the high priced rigs.

953
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,280
They have stuff with like 512 megs of RAM

954
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,580
for a nice slim system with things up like

955
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,380
over 200 gigs of RAM, tons of CPU cords, terabytes

956
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,000
and terabytes of transfer.

957
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,220
You can have team accounts, highly available block storage.

958
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,080
They're beta testing object storage right now.

959
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,960
They have loads of pre-built open source apps

960
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,360
that you can just one click deploy

961
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,140
and they're not like magic script setups.

962
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,020
It's legitimate.

963
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,820
Like if an expert system administrator built a system

964
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,920
to host next cloud, that's how it looks.

965
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,420
And like one of my favorite ones to do

966
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,460
is just a quick test.

967
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,640
I can deploy a base LTS system with Docker on it,

968
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:14,420
try something and then destroy it and spend like three cents.

969
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,260
It's amazing.

970
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,080
So great.

971
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,700
Digitalocean.com use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED

972
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:22,920
and yes, yes, you can run Fedora there as a matter of fact.

973
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,900
You crazy cats, just like I have been.

974
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,140
And you know what I do is I set up Fedora on there

975
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,940
and then I just manage my Fedora box

976
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,100
through cockpit all the time.

977
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,540
It's a super solid way.

978
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,660
Yeah, it's a super solid way to keep a Fedora system running.

979
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:41,140
And then in cockpit, there is a really simple

980
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,740
straightforward system to search for new Docker images,

981
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,240
click on them, pull them down.

982
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,940
And then when the first time you set them up,

983
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,540
you can set up all of the port forwarding,

984
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,940
you can set up paths and there's a UI

985
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,140
to just set all of that stuff and you hit save

986
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,380
and boom, everything just works.

987
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,700
That seems perfect for the casual admin.

988
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,500
You're not doing it every day, but you know the concepts,

989
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,460
maybe you forgot that command line switch.

990
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,780
Cockpit makes it just right there.

991
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,260
It's nice, it's really nice.

992
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,900
And the other thing that's really cool about it

993
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,760
is we've covered the security architecture of it

994
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,160
a couple of weeks ago, if you recall,

995
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,940
and it's really soundly built too.

996
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:14,180
So I actually feel pretty safe running it.

997
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,340
It's a pretty solid innovation.

998
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:20,140
You know, this is sort of tangentially related to Fedora

999
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,440
because they've been shipping Wayland by default now

1000
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,220
since the last release and it looks like,

1001
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,700
according to Will Cook, who's the head of the desktop team

1002
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:32,300
over at Canonical, they're considering backing off

1003
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,300
of their decision to ship Wayland in Ubuntu 17.10,

1004
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:42,260
which could then ultimately impact the LTS in 2018.

1005
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,700
Now, I think this announcement has been,

1006
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,940
it's not really an announcement.

1007
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,700
It's a discussion at this point, so keep that in mind.

1008
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,140
This is not like this is being announced officially.

1009
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,640
This is them discussing their gut feelings

1010
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,220
about maybe Wayland not being ready yet.

1011
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,420
And I think that's actually the fascinating thing about it

1012
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,860
is that is a conversation to be had.

1013
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,860
Is it stable enough?

1014
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,540
They said they've taken some input from their users

1015
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,380
that have been in testing and seen stability issues

1016
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,420
with both Wayland and Ex-Wayland.

1017
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,100
My gut feeling, Will Cook said,

1018
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,020
is that Wayland isn't ready yet.

1019
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,700
That's a tough thing because you wanna skate,

1020
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,340
obviously, to where the puck is going,

1021
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,220
and you wanna get this thing tested in the 17.10 release

1022
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,300
before 18.04 hits, and you've got, obviously,

1023
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,980
the Fedora distribution has been shipping it for a while.

1024
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,420
But they had some legitimate use case problems

1025
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,500
that they've had people writing in to them

1026
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,700
in their testing that have come up.

1027
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,740
So it's, I don't know.

1028
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,580
The flip side of that is that we need this kind of,

1029
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,940
we want Wayland to be really good.

1030
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,460
We want it to be rock solid for the future.

1031
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,660
We need these kinds of, sometimes it takes

1032
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,500
another big distribution, being like,

1033
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,080
okay, can we really use this?

1034
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,900
What would that look like to make sure

1035
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,140
that we do iron out all those bugs and make it stable?

1036
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,080
Because we don't want another thing

1037
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,860
where the pulse audio rollout or whatever,

1038
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,420
where now no one trusts Wayland,

1039
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,780
it's not gonna get good rep,

1040
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,140
maybe less developers want to work on it.

1041
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,600
Well, it's just the hard truth of default rules supreme.

1042
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,860
So you could even include Wayland as a session option,

1043
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,420
you know, GNOME parenthesis Wayland,

1044
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:17,080
and then you could have GNOME X11 as the default.

1045
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,420
But you're just gonna have a dramatic volume difference

1046
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,300
between the amount of users testing it

1047
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,220
and submitting bug reports if you do that.

1048
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,420
It's just gonna, it's gonna be a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction

1049
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,060
of the Ubuntu user base would use that.

1050
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,740
Pretty much people who probably could,

1051
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,620
might install it anyway.

1052
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,460
I mean, I can tell you all of my Arch systems right now

1053
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,980
that are running in this studio all have an option

1054
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,920
to log into GNOME on Wayland, and I never do it.

1055
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,220
I've had problems, especially I've had problems with Chrome

1056
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,340
and I just don't, I guess I'm waiting it out.

1057
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:53,300
But at some point you're right,

1058
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,120
you gotta rip the bandaid off.

1059
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,660
And Wayland is really at this point becoming a joke

1060
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,540
if we can't get this thing out the door.

1061
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,580
It's been years in development.

1062
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,440
Now I guess, you know, if you look at it

1063
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,280
in the grand scheme of things,

1064
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,780
I think X has been around since Reagan was president,

1065
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,700
so I don't know if that's true,

1066
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,940
but it feels like it probably is true actually.

1067
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,940
We just have long timelines.

1068
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,700
So I guess if you consider in the grand scheme of things,

1069
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,380
Wayland is still just a young pup.

1070
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,060
And I guess maybe this is just the long haul,

1071
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,460
but this stuff isn't easy.

1072
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,100
And it sounds like the Ubuntu devs

1073
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,700
are just uncertain about which way to go.

1074
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,620
So we'll just have to stay tuned.

1075
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,600
I'm gonna keep watching it.

1076
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,200
There's also, there's a little follow-up news

1077
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,860
to something we covered before, GR security.

1078
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,240
Remember when we mentioned GR security

1079
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,980
was sort of branching off and doing their own thing

1080
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,800
and closing up their patch set against the Linux kernel,

1081
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,500
which promises to make the Linux kernel super secure.

1082
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,700
And now they're releasing it in this stable patch access

1083
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,100
agreement license that says that you can take this GPL code,

1084
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,280
but you're not allowed to share it.

1085
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,640
And if you do, we're gonna revoke your access.

1086
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,380
And they kind of have people really sort of

1087
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,380
by the elbow here because these are oftentimes

1088
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,580
business customers that have systems out on the web

1089
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,060
that are doing e-commerce that are being audited.

1090
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,460
And this is how they say they're secure

1091
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,820
is because they have this, oh yeah, we have hardened Linux.

1092
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,760
We've hardened our Linux with GR security.

1093
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,600
We've hardened it.

1094
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,340
It's used a lot by like multi-tenant hosts

1095
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,300
or people running like open VZ containers

1096
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,340
or other things like that.

1097
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:20,980
And so what are they gonna do?

1098
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,740
You know, they've been using this thing for years.

1099
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,180
And then one day these guys decide to go,

1100
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,620
ah, no, we're going commercial product and you gotta pay.

1101
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,580
Huh, what's that?

1102
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,980
No, you pay, you pay.

1103
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,300
You can take it and you can use that GPL software,

1104
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,740
but you gotta pay and you can't do anything with it.

1105
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,140
If you distribute that, if you make modifications to it

1106
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,340
and you share that GPL code with anybody,

1107
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,700
we're gonna come after you, kind of crazy.

1108
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:45,640
And it's got a few people's attention.

1109
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,040
It got our attention a few weeks ago.

1110
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,660
We talked about it here on the show.

1111
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,700
And Linus about a week ago really ripped him a new one

1112
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,220
saying that their code quality was just garbage.

1113
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,640
Not really even concerning,

1114
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,260
not even really mentioning the license issues,

1115
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,380
but just saying that, you know,

1116
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:02,500
they're a bunch of basically dweebs is what he said.

1117
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,860
I mean, he said it in harsher terms.

1118
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,020
Well, there is a gentleman, Bruce Perns,

1119
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,960
who is an advisor to lawyers.

1120
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,900
So wrap your head around that for a second.

1121
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,820
And what does he advise those lawyers about?

1122
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,640
GPL compliance.

1123
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,180
You see where we're going here.

1124
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,860
Now that GR security has taken their patch set

1125
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,540
that they claim makes Linux better

1126
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,900
and they've wrapped it behind

1127
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,500
the stable patch access agreement,

1128
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,260
customers are warned that if they redistribute

1129
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,900
any of this GPL code, there's gonna be a penalty.

1130
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,900
Well, here's the problem.

1131
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,940
You can't deny this one fact.

1132
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,180
GR security is a patch for the Linux kernel.

1133
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,140
It's inseparable from Linux.

1134
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:50,820
It, GR security does not work without Linux.

1135
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,520
So this would fail a fair use test.

1136
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,100
Because it's strongly derivative nature of the kernel,

1137
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:00,180
it must be under GPL version two license

1138
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,780
or a license compatible with GPL

1139
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,660
and with terms no more restrictive than the GPL.

1140
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,140
And there is a pretty clear clause of the GPL.

1141
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,940
It's GPL section six, which specifically prohibits

1142
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,180
any additions of terms as well.

1143
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,920
So they're also violating it

1144
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,060
by wrapping these additional terms.

1145
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,880
They really got themselves in a pickle here.

1146
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,820
And I think these guys are ripe for the picking.

1147
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,260
I mean, I think this is gonna be one juicy, juicy pickle

1148
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,500
that somebody is gonna come along

1149
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,640
and decide to take a bite out of.

1150
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,260
Nobody has yet, there's no lawsuits yet.

1151
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,420
But there seems to be some pretty solid

1152
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,540
GPL violation issues here.

1153
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,460
And then this Bruce guy here at the bottom of his pose

1154
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,740
is like, by the way, if you want to consult with me

1155
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,540
and see these guys, it's essentially what he says.

1156
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,320
He doesn't say it like that.

1157
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,100
Give me a callskies and we'll work something out here.

1158
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,020
So it's open hunting season for GR.

1159
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,760
You got Linus coming after him.

1160
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,300
You got obvious GPL compliance questions.

1161
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,720
Well, there's been a lot of, let's say drama back and forth

1162
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,560
between the projects.

1163
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,920
I mean, for a long time, but even more recently

1164
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,940
with they had some threats of lawsuits

1165
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,020
against people like Kees Cook

1166
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,540
and the Linux self-protection project

1167
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,700
for using their work without proper attribution.

1168
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,100
And it's just this whole culture of like,

1169
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,060
they've certainly had some innovations.

1170
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,140
They've done a lot of good research,

1171
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,420
but it's been a long history of not using

1172
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,360
the kernel standard, not making patches

1173
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,660
that have any hope of doing it.

1174
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,700
And they just, you know, there's a very,

1175
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,260
almost in a similar style to OpenBSD.

1176
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,180
It's a security first, but of course,

1177
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:26,020
Linus is never gonna ship a broken kernel

1178
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,860
even if it is more secure.

1179
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,700
Well, stop right there.

1180
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,240
I mean, like what a, that is a huge red flag

1181
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,820
is if GR security is based intrinsically on upstream

1182
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:37,860
and they have a hostile relationship with upstream.

1183
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,060
Well, that doesn't lead to a good product.

1184
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,980
You know, like that's not how you set up a winner.

1185
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,260
So it's, this is a difficult situation for them for sure.

1186
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,540
And I don't know if it really has direct impact on us

1187
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,340
unless any of you out there are working in businesses

1188
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,340
that use this, but it's sort of a fascinating one

1189
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,860
to sit back from the rafters and watch a bit.

1190
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,780
You know, we have a little NF tables stuff to get to,

1191
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:00,380
but I also have a couple of cool apps

1192
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,380
that I've been itching to talk about.

1193
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,060
Wonder, let's do this.

1194
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:04,980
Let's talk about this,

1195
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:06,640
just this quick little open source app

1196
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,480
that we found this week.

1197
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,940
Cause this is just a real quickie.

1198
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,300
It's called I want, and it's a decentralized

1199
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,000
peer-to-peer file sharing command line application.

1200
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,620
And this came across both Wes's radar and mine.

1201
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,060
And it's just a, it's a CLI tool for searching

1202
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:20,700
and downloading files on your land network

1203
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:21,940
without any central server,

1204
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,400
which I think that's kind of cool.

1205
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,620
It includes easy discovery of files.

1206
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,820
So it's sort of like a search type syntax.

1207
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,180
You can download it from multiple,

1208
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:31,060
multiple machines on your network.

1209
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,900
This could be handy for us because we have large media files

1210
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,020
that we're distributing.

1211
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,200
You can do entire directory downloads.

1212
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,300
And obviously, as you would hope,

1213
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,380
it does support a resumption of file transfers.

1214
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,080
It is, it is very careful about getting consistent data.

1215
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,180
Any changes made to files inside a shared folder

1216
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,940
are instantly reflected on the network.

1217
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:51,360
It works on Linux.

1218
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:53,580
It works on Windows and it works on the Mac.

1219
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,700
Although I think this guy even admits like,

1220
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:59,500
Mac version, I wouldn't use it to quite yet.

1221
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,940
And if you, if you, if you want to give it a go,

1222
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,980
just pip install, I want, it might also be in the AUR.

1223
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:07,900
And I think it's kind of, it sounds like a really cool way

1224
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,260
to just toss files around your network.

1225
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:10,880
One of the questions that consistently has come in

1226
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,620
over the years is what's the best way to share files

1227
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,960
that's not Samba.

1228
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,380
And a lot of times what our answer is,

1229
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,620
well, if you have, if you have one machine that's always on,

1230
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,960
you could consider setting up some NFS mounts.

1231
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,340
But a lot of times what we tell people

1232
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,680
is just use SCP.

1233
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,100
Just toss it around on your network using SSH.

1234
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:30,540
Kind of not super intuitive for people

1235
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,380
that are coming from different operating systems.

1236
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,980
Yep, and if you don't have keys set up,

1237
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,740
there's maybe a lot of passwords and things.

1238
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,260
Yeah, yeah, or if you have different passwords

1239
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:39,080
on different machines.

1240
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:39,920
Yeah, exactly.

1241
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,740
So this could be a nice way,

1242
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,820
if you have a nice, safe, trusted LAN,

1243
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,180
like here at the network, here at the JB studios,

1244
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,260
you know, we have, we have like large files

1245
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,220
that we want to toss around between our machines.

1246
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,100
And sometimes just being lazy,

1247
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,220
we'll just throw it on Dropbox.

1248
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,060
Yeah, exactly.

1249
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,580
And it's like, why go all the way up to the cloud,

1250
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,780
sync it to all my machines, bring it all the way down.

1251
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,700
Why not just toss that one gig file

1252
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,360
directly to somebody's machine using something like I want.

1253
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,400
And I've played around before with graphical ones,

1254
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,460
and I think command line is the way to go.

1255
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,860
Yeah, especially if you're listening to this show.

1256
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,740
What?

1257
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,780
You do say, you do say.

1258
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,380
You know, I won't be here.

1259
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,280
I won't be here next week.

1260
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,660
Are you?

1261
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:17,500
How do you feel about that?

1262
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,340
Are you okay?

1263
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,180
You gonna be good?

1264
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:20,000
Well, I mean, I'll miss you.

1265
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,840
Yeah, yeah.

1266
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:21,940
But I think you're gonna have a great time.

1267
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,940
Yeah, yeah, I am heading off to.

1268
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,940
You're gonna come back refreshed, ready to podcast?

1269
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,420
Hmm, yeah, hopefully.

1270
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,860
I'm going to Montana.

1271
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:31,180
I would like to have seen Montana.

1272
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,460
And it's gonna be hot.

1273
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:35,080
It's gonna be, it's gonna be really hot.

1274
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,780
So hopefully, like when we get there,

1275
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,060
it's gonna be like 100 degrees.

1276
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,860
There's some sweaty vlogs coming up.

1277
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,700
I don't know, I don't know.

1278
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,860
The cameras maybe will have to go away from that sweaty.

1279
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,060
But yeah, I'm gonna be there with Noah.

1280
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,900
He's gonna be doing Ask Noah live from there.

1281
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,140
Is that right?

1282
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:47,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1283
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:48,800
I don't think.

1284
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,640
That rascal.

1285
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,220
No, I think, but I think we have a very special guest,

1286
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,140
somebody from one of our other shows will be joining us.

1287
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,180
We'll be joining Wes.

1288
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:56,000
Yes, that's right.

1289
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,900
We'll be joining Wes, because I won't be here.

1290
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,380
But you guys, I think, will have a great show.

1291
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,300
So if you out there in the audience

1292
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:02,980
want to help the boys out while I'm gone,

1293
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,580
head over to jblive.tv next Tuesday and join the Mumble Room.

1294
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,620
You can get in the IRC there and just do Bang Mumble,

1295
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,460
or exclamation mark, and get the server information.

1296
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,420
And then you can hang out with Wes

1297
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,980
and his special guest next week.

1298
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,060
It'll be a lot of fun.

1299
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,500
So there's a particularly cool little bit

1300
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:23,420
of benchmarking and engineering work that was done.

1301
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,700
And kind of a nice bit of research

1302
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,180
that I would have loved to have done if had I had the time.

1303
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,620
Because I've always wondered, what

1304
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,660
is the difference between NF tables and IP tables?

1305
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,140
And how is this new world, and does it scale

1306
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:38,780
if you want to set up, say, maybe a Linux firewall?

1307
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,340
And is it too much overhead if you just want to have it

1308
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:43,220
on your workstation?

1309
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,820
These are all questions I've pondered, but never really

1310
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,340
sat down to iron out.

1311
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,300
And so this next piece was a really solid bit

1312
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:51,820
of research and write-up.

1313
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,260
But I want to mention Linux Academy briefly,

1314
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,380
because I think this is a great opportunity when you

1315
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,640
get into this kind of stuff.

1316
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,420
If anything we're talking about goes over your head,

1317
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:00,900
consider going over to Linux Academy.

1318
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,980
Or if you just want to just step your skill level up a bit,

1319
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,940
stay competitive, maybe get a new job,

1320
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:08,420
or just look good in a review, Linux Academy.

1321
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,940
Start by going to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug.

1322
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,100
Sign up for a free seven-day trial of the Linux Academy

1323
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:14,900
platform.

1324
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:17,700
It's a place to learn everything about Linux.

1325
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,700
They have self-paced, in-depth video courses,

1326
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,860
hands-on labs that give you real experience with this stuff.

1327
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,820
And I think probably one of my favorite features

1328
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,700
that really makes Linux Academy stand out.

1329
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,780
And this is really possible because they're really

1330
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,620
all in on Linux.

1331
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:31,020
It's not just something they do.

1332
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,700
It's not just something they cover,

1333
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,460
along with the Cisco stuff and the Microsoft stuff.

1334
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,620
This is what they do.

1335
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,140
Everything from the nitty-itty bitties

1336
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:41,020
all the way up to the big stuff, like OpenStack and AWS

1337
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,940
and Azure, they have the entire Linux pipeline.

1338
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,500
And that's why they can offer instructor mentoring, full time

1339
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:50,460
human instructors who know this material top to bottom

1340
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,220
because this is what they focus on.

1341
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,060
That's a huge differentiator for Linux Academy.

1342
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,060
They have these virtual servers that they spin up

1343
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,780
simultaneously with your courseware,

1344
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:01,740
which is a really cool thing because you're going along

1345
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:04,980
and it's like, OK, now SSH into this and try this out.

1346
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,740
Boom.

1347
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,380
My mind was blown the first time I did that because it's like,

1348
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,260
I can sit there with the material on my screen

1349
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,620
and then in my favorite console, I'm SSHed in just

1350
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,940
like it would be any other system I'm working on.

1351
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,300
It's just a brilliant way to learn.

1352
00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:19,100
It's especially great for things like AWS

1353
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:20,900
where you're like, how much is this going to cost me?

1354
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,660
I don't really understand.

1355
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:22,900
I'm just trying to learn.

1356
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,060
You don't even have to worry about it.

1357
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,060
Let them take care of it.

1358
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:28,020
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

1359
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:30,220
Big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

1360
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:31,140
the unplugged program.

1361
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,580

1364
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:39,100
So this is Benchmarking NF Tables

1365
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,300
over at the developers.redhat.com blog.

1366
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,580
And it was posted by Phil.

1367
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,100
It was a little bit ago, but it was something that kind of,

1368
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,620
I think, came across as Wes's radar.

1369
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:52,700
And he passed it on to me, and I was pretty fascinated by it.

1370
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,820
For starters, it's just interesting to see

1371
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,500
how he decided to do this.

1372
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,660
He wanted to figure out how different firewall setups

1373
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,140
affected performance.

1374
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:05,220
And so he messed around with a simple test framework, which

1375
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,460
he could feed a bunch of different setup snippets

1376
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,620
and then cycle through them.

1377
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,880
And then he could test scalability with these snippets

1378
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,700
by adding a number and a scale ranger from 0 to 100.

1379
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,460
And then the test script would go off,

1380
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:19,200
and it would run each possible value to that scale.

1381
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,140
And then each value equals a multiple of five benchmarks.

1382
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,060
And those are then performed, repeated nine more times.

1383
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,860
The results are all plotted out with nice beautiful graphs.

1384
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:30,260
And we end up in this post.

1385
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:33,720
And what we get here is some rather interesting revelations,

1386
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:36,840
including the fact that it seems to be that there

1387
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,780
is a bit of a performance difference that

1388
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:43,460
is fairly noticeable between IP tables and NF tables

1389
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,580
on really small setups, like 20 or fewer rules,

1390
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,820
or even like 100 or fewer rules.

1391
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,620
IP tables may actually be more performant than NF tables.

1392
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:58,620
But IP tables, if I read this correctly, there is,

1393
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,140
and same to a degree with NF tables,

1394
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,780
but I'll talk about that more in a second, with IP tables,

1395
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,420
there is some suffering of performance

1396
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,260
as the number of rules increases.

1397
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:10,220
Not too surprising.

1398
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,100
So the overhead introduced with adding rules

1399
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,740
becomes less and less significant

1400
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:16,420
the more rules there are with NF tables,

1401
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,060
because NF tables handles this in a little bit different way.

1402
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,260
It sort of does some of the logic ahead of time.

1403
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,300
And it eats that cost initially, and then that cost

1404
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,020
is essentially spent, that time is spent.

1405
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:30,660
And then it is able to scale up more rules much, much faster

1406
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,900
and performant than IP tables, which

1407
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,180
has to go through the chain and consider

1408
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:37,420
every single rule every time.

1409
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,100
And so it's interesting, because at the smaller scale,

1410
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,400
that might actually be advantageous with IP tables,

1411
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,220
depending on your setup.

1412
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:47,980
But if you consider that NF tables are still early days,

1413
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:49,540
and they're still working on it, that

1414
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,720
seems like a performance gap they're

1415
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,820
going to probably close as well.

1416
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:52,060
Right.

1417
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,380
Really been focused on functionality, not

1418
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,340
optimization yet.

1419
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,140
What was your take from some of this stuff?

1420
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,940
Was there anything that jumped out at you

1421
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,540
as sort of an interesting result?

1422
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,540
There's just so many tests between these systems.

1423
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:05,460
There's a lot to dig into to this one.

1424
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,420
For me, I think that one of the bigger things is, yes,

1425
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,980
there's still early days around NF tables.

1426
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:13,700
Some of the command line stuff needs to be worked out,

1427
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:14,620
some of how that works.

1428
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:16,020
There's some unintuitive bits, especially

1429
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,540
if you're already familiar with IP tables and kind

1430
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,900
of the defaults, the default chains, and tables,

1431
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,940
and things that already exist.

1432
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,780
But I'm really excited.

1433
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,620
What struck me is it looks like NF tables and the NFT command.

1434
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:31,860
There's going to be a lot of things that we can do with this

1435
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,780
in more intuitive ways than we can now.

1436
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:35,860
In particular, I think this article highlights

1437
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,500
that if you want to do kind of traffic control things,

1438
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,180
there's the TC application, which is part of IP route 2.

1439
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:45,300
But it is one of the least intuitive command line

1440
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,980
applications I've ever used.

1441
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,740
If you actually need to do things with it,

1442
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,280
I would definitely recommend something

1443
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:53,100
like Fire QoS that can help automate that in a sane way.

1444
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,620
But not only is the way NF tables

1445
00:53:56,620 --> 00:54:00,260
uses Netfilter to accomplish some of the same things easier

1446
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:01,700
to do, it looks like it's actually

1447
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:02,460
a little more performant.

1448
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:05,120
So that story on Linux might be getting a little bit better,

1449
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:05,800
which I think is great.

1450
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,920
Did you see the part here?

1451
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,500
And I just sort of read the highlight of this section

1452
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,540
because I thought I'd pass it on to the audience.

1453
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:14,900
He also performed DDoS protection testing

1454
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,020
to see how NF tables stood up versus IP tables

1455
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,180
and get a bunch of different ways to see how they handled it.

1456
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:26,260
And I took away that essentially NF tables probably

1457
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,060
would handle this better in an actual situation.

1458
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,220
But I thought I'd list all that in there

1459
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,980
because part of what he tested to see was, like you were saying,

1460
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,860
is TC and blacklisting IP addresses in real time

1461
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,500
and stuff like that and cycling through 100,000 packets

1462
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,820
per second using package gen and just all kinds of cool stuff

1463
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:43,860
the way he set this up.

1464
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:46,300
So it's a fascinating read if you guys

1465
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,760
want to read through the whole thing.

1466
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,900
The TLDR might be the most prominent information

1467
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:56,060
to draw from the experiment is that similar IP tables and NF

1468
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:59,180
table setups are comparable in performance.

1469
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,240
NF tables is usually a bit behind,

1470
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,280
but given that the development focus at this point

1471
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,280
is still on functionality, like you were saying,

1472
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,220
it's going to be changing.

1473
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,180
IP set is a blessing to any IP table setup.

1474
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,500
NF tables follows their path with their native implementation

1475
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,060
and their concepts.

1476
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:18,380
Then NF tables could be in a great spot too.

1477
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,980
He says he's not still convinced of his test results.

1478
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:23,460
He still thinks there's probably no point

1479
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,900
in breaking a leg over implementing something in TC

1480
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,900
if the same thing is possible in net filter.

1481
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,220
Yeah, that's a good summary.

1482
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,380
It's a good post.

1483
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,860
And it looks like, I don't know, if you're considering setting

1484
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:36,860
up a Linux firewall, you might want to read it

1485
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,240
and just decide, depending on what your scale is,

1486
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,240
what would work for you.

1487
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:40,900
Yeah, definitely.

1488
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:41,400
Yeah.

1489
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,500
And you might be surprised.

1490
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,900
And it might be we're getting close enough maybe now

1491
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,920
in a similar vein to Wayland, perhaps,

1492
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,660
where, especially maybe for home use,

1493
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,500
I don't have crazy performance concerns for my house.

1494
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,000
Exactly.

1495
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,380
I might be the time where I could convert over to NFT

1496
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,220
and see what happens.

1497
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,900
Yeah, and start just sort of learning now.

1498
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,540
And then, because that's kind of where things are going.

1499
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:58,980
Yeah, right.

1500
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,940
I mean, it'll be years yet, I'm sure,

1501
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,340
before I want it on the production server.

1502
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,060
But someday.

1503
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:02,780
Yeah.

1504
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,100
One little story before we go.

1505
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,500
Oh, I know that sound.

1506
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,860
Your buddies over at Gabe's office

1507
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:12,940
are working on some big updates to the Steam client.

1508
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,180
I saw this over on gamingonlinux.com.

1509
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:18,420
And I'll just cover a moment of what they are planning to do,

1510
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,380
because it's from them.

1511
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,740
Another thing we're working on is a major redesign

1512
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:26,220
of the Steam client, which is probably far overdue.

1513
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,720
So that includes a redesign of the whole Chrome

1514
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,940
of the Steam desktop client.

1515
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,560
But I think probably the most relevant and interesting thing

1516
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,800
for you guys is going to be the redesigns

1517
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,600
that we're working on for the Steam library

1518
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,500
section in particular.

1519
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,460
So once a customer owns your game,

1520
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,180
what is that experience like in Steam?

1521
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,680
Talking to developers, obviously.

1522
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,820
So let's get forward a couple there.

1523
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:51,260
So there's kind of two big parts of that update

1524
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:51,860
in the library.

1525
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,460
One is going to be a new library home screen.

1526
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:56,860
If you've used big picture mode at all

1527
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,340
and you go into your library, there's

1528
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:00,740
kind of a similar thing that's in Steam big picture

1529
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,700
mode, which surfaces games that your friends are playing right

1530
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,440
now, surfaces things that you've recently played,

1531
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,600
surfaces recently updated games.

1532
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,440
We're taking that and we're building on that

1533
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:14,220
so that when a customer comes and logs into Steam,

1534
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,220
if they really just want to go back and play

1535
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,220
the last game they were playing, it's super easy

1536
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,500
to launch it right from there.

1537
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,900
We're not making that any harder.

1538
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:22,420
I'm going to leave the rest of the video for you guys.

1539
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,740
It's 42 minutes long, so I'm not going

1540
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,300
to play all that in the show.

1541
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,900
But good to hear that update's coming.

1542
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,660
And yes, it includes one to Linux.

1543
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:29,500
That's kind of nice.

1544
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,620
It's good to see that, too.

1545
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:33,380
Are you much of a gamer, Wes?

1546
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,140
Have we ever talked about that?

1547
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,180
I don't think we've really done a gaming episode

1548
00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:36,980
since you've been a host.

1549
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:38,380
No, we haven't really.

1550
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,580
You know, I don't get very much time to play games these days.

1551
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,620
But I do really enjoy it.

1552
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:47,540
I try to find time here and there on the weekend to do it.

1553
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,980
I've not yet set up my new place.

1554
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,660
I've not yet set up my gaming tower.

1555
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,340
But it's on the list of things to do.

1556
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:53,940
So maybe we can do that here shortly.

1557
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,820
Yeah, I would be, you know, maybe one day.

1558
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,460
Maybe.

1559
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,300
People don't love it, so we'll just do it experimentally.

1560
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,620
But we would love it.

1561
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:00,380
Yeah, right, exactly.

1562
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,420
Hey, that sounds like great fun.

1563
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,380
Before we go, I want to mention that we're

1564
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:08,340
doing a little sweepstakes for a Dell XPS 13 developer

1565
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,540
edition, which means one of the Linux machines.

1566
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:11,640
You've heard Chris talk about it.

1567
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,020
Now you can have it in your hands.

1568
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,720
Yeah, spic and span, brand new one shipped directly from Dell.

1569
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,540
Now, this is US residents only.

1570
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,340
This is just sort of the way that this particular one

1571
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,260
has to be.

1572
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,540
And you have to be 18 years or older.

1573
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:26,340
But if you're in the US and are perhaps

1574
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,460
interested in getting a Dell XPS 13,

1575
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:30,780
you can enter the sweepstakes to win.

1576
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,220
Go to jupyterbroadcasting.com, click on the Shows menu option,

1577
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:37,140
and choose the User Airdropdown.

1578
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,940
And then you can enter to win there.

1579
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,060
And we'll be announcing it here soon,

1580
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,360
before I think it's coming up.

1581
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,980
Now, since I won't be here, you probably

1582
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,100
won't hear much about it next week.

1583
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,300
So I just wanted to mention it now,

1584
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,640
because it's a great opportunity.

1585
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,420
And then stay tuned to the User Air program for the winner.

1586
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:53,060
Yeah.

1587
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,420
We'll be announcing it in there.

1588
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,500
Last week, User Air went out a little late.

1589
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,460
So episode 16, Desktop as a Surface, went out.

1590
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:06,300
User Air 16 includes things from more discussion about LTS

1591
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:08,740
overrolling, particularly in certain production

1592
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:13,060
environments, the East slash West divide of Linux

1593
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:16,060
that seems to keep coming up, two different types of cultures

1594
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,380
that are clashing there.

1595
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:19,820
We talk more about the Linux Laptop Survey.

1596
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,820
And actually, we really dug into that for a bit.

1597
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:24,780
And then end up with Microsoft's Desktop as a Service

1598
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,420
announcement, and sort of how that affects Linux users,

1599
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,140
maybe helps good and bad.

1600
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,940
So it's a pretty great episode of User Air.

1601
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,180
It's episode 16.

1602
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,940
I know what I'm doing after the show.

1603
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,580
You know what I'm doing after the show?

1604
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:40,820
I actually have two ribeyes from the barbecue last week,

1605
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:43,260
cooking in the sous vide machine right now.

1606
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,100
So when you're doing TechSnap, I'm

1607
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,580
going to be finishing those up.

1608
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,380
I am still eating off of the extra food.

1609
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:49,460
That's amazing.

1610
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,620
Of course, I'm fasting, too, here and there.

1611
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:52,780
It stretches it out.

1612
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:55,540
But yeah, there was just so much good stuff here, really great.

1613
00:59:55,540 --> 00:59:57,020
Great people, great time.

1614
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:57,940
It was such a good time.

1615
00:59:57,940 --> 00:59:59,640
So if you missed last week, go check out

1616
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,840
last week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1617
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,840
It was a lot of fun hanging out with them, folks.

1618
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,020
Well, Mr. West, I just mentioned it there.

1619
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:08,140
People can find more of you on the TechSnap program.

1620
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:08,660
Oh, yeah.

1621
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:09,260
Stay tuned.

1622
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:10,180
You and Dan doing that.

1623
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:11,620
They do it live right after this show.

1624
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:13,540
So if you want to come next week in to hang out

1625
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:17,020
with Wes and his special guest and then just stay tuned,

1626
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:17,500
keep it up.

1627
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,380
And you just get to watch the TechSnap program.

1628
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:20,180
Yeah, it's awesome.

1629
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:20,860
Back to back.

1630
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,940
You are a busy man.

1631
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:22,540
You know it.

1632
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:23,660
Back to back right there.

1633
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,660
You can also participate in the Mumble room.

1634
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:28,500
Bang Mumble when you're in our IRC room, which is, again,

1635
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,900
at jblive.tv.

1636
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:32,820
And the live times are all posted at the calendar

1637
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:36,220
at jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1638
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:38,520
You can also go to our subreddit,

1639
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,180
linuxunplugged.reddit.com.

1640
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:42,340
You can leave us feedback at jupitabroadcasting.com

1641
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,300

1642
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,260
You can tweet me at chrislas.

1643
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,900
Follow the network at jupitersignal.

1644
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:48,980
I won't be here next week.

1645
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,140
I'll miss you.

1646
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:51,260
But the show will go on.

1647
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:51,980
That's right, it will.

1648
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,360
And I think it's going to be a really good one.

1649
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:53,860
Oh, yeah.

1650
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:57,340
First time special guest on this show.

1651
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,340
So that's going to be really cool, too.

1652
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,780
It's a first time special guest.

1653
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:01,940
We'll put them through their paces.

1654
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:02,420
That's for sure.

1655
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,180
I'm sure we will.

1656
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,020
I'm sure we will.

1657
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,700
OK, everybody, thanks so much for tuning

1658
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,860
into this week's episode of the Unplugged program.

1659
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:12,860
And we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

1660
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:14,860
Goodbye, everybody.

1661
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:53,780
Oh, boy, the chat room was punny today.

1662
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:54,700
Look at these titles.

1663
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,360
A fitting fedora.

1664
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,820
The new fedora fits well.

1665
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,260
Fedora's new hat trick.

1666
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:05,700
Oh, man, most of these bad ones are WW's fault. No, I'm kidding.

1667
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,140
Ouch.

1668
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:12,540
JamieTitles.com, now we've got to go pick our title.

1669
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:15,340
Hey, hey, at least I didn't, I'm not the one that came up

1670
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:16,340
with Boltron.

1671
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:17,620
You can't blame me for that.

1672
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:19,580
That Boltron title, though, I kind of liked it.

1673
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,340
I got it, because it's like bolt on.

1674
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,100
But it's Boltron, which is even cooler.

1675
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,480
Those fedora guys are working on some good stuff over there.

1676
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,260
I'll tell you what, that really is impressive.

1677
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:30,940
I cannot believe that I have pushed a fedora server

1678
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:35,220
install that far, running Nextcloud and all that stuff.

1679
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,180
Maybe it's the new way.

1680
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:38,020
Maybe it's the new normal.

1681
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:38,860
I don't know.

1682
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,540
Or maybe I'm lucky.

1683
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:41,940
The hipster BSD.

1684
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:42,460
It was easy.

1685
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,880
I will say, while you're doing that,

1686
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,420
I installed OBS on the fedora.

1687
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,100
No.

1688
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:46,660
Super easy.

1689
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:48,620
They actually have instructions that just add the RPS.

1690
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:49,000
Which version?

1691
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,340
Can you see which version it is?

1692
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,100
I just rebooted back to R, because I can't.

1693
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:52,700
But I'll check later.

1694
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:53,100
That's cool.

1695
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:53,540
That's cool.

1696
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:54,340
That's cool.

1697
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,620
This on our production one here is 19.02.

1698
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:58,300
OK.

1699
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:00,100
19.02-1.

1700
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:03,220
JamieTitles.com, the tree speaks fedora.

1701
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:04,140
The tree speak fedora.

1702
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,780
What is that a reference to?

1703
01:03:05,780 --> 01:03:07,780
The tree speak fedora.

1704
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:09,860
I don't know.

1705
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:10,780
I'm not sure either.

1706
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,700
Five people seem to think they get it, though,

1707
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:13,980
because it's got five upvotes.

1708
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,420
It's like the number one title.

1709
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,140
It's the wallpaper.

1710
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:20,260
It's the wallpaper that means fedora.

1711
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:21,020
Right.

1712
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,820
It is a nice wallpaper, I will say.

1713
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,140
That title, though, is such a head scratcher

1714
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:25,900
when you see that.

1715
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:26,660
You know what's funny?

1716
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:28,220
I honestly 100% thought that was a word.

1717
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:29,860
It's like, oh, wait, oh, no, trees.

1718
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:30,380
Yep.

1719
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:31,420
That was interesting.

1720
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:32,420
Yeah, I get it now, XM.

1721
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:33,020
I get it now.

1722
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:34,740
OK.

1723
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:36,500
Remember how I have rib eyes cooking?

1724
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:39,820
Oh.

1725
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:41,540
Rolling pain, that's not bad.

1726
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:44,500
Rolling pains, atomic fedora, fedora's tree line,

1727
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:49,660
fedora incubator, there's boltron bend, the fedora fiasco,

1728
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:55,540
fedora, fedora, adora, ah, jbtitles.com, jbtitles.com.

1729
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,380
There's a lot of titles, a lot of titles.

1730
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:01,100
I'm just going to put it, there's a lot of titles over there.

1731
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,620
There's a lot of titles.

1732
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,420
Not saying that much more than that, though.

1733
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:04,920
It's crazy.

1734
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:05,420
Crazy.

1735
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:06,620
It's crazy.

1736
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:07,820
Yippee, yay.

1737
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,300
So here, I also appreciated this.

1738
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,020
Fedora handles UEFI very nicely.

1739
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:13,020
Let me just say that.

1740
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:15,580
I like that a lot because it did not

1741
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,460
screw up my Arch UEFI install.

1742
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,020
And gone are the horrible days of overwriting different boot

1743
