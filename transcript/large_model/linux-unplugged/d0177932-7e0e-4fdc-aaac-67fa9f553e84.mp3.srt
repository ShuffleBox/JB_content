1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Very impressed that they've got Linux running on the iPad Air, too.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,840
You knew it would happen, right?

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,600
But this is Linux 518.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,400
So this is like the most recent version.

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,760
And another group then built on that work and got

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,320
Linux booting on the iPhone 5S.

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,040
That's so crazy. It is really great.

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,280
When you start seeing things like from the GNOME project, like that

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,960
they're working on mobile.

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,120
My first reaction when I saw this is like, oh, here we go again.

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,320
GNOME's focused on mobile again.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,520
Well, we all know how this is going to go.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,600
But then I thought, you know, for a tablet, which Google's about

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,720
to make a big push into tablets again, they announced that at Google I.O.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,240
And on an iPad, if I could get Linux 518 and then eventually they could get

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,520
a graphical interface working based on the work the Asahi project is doing,

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,480
who they just got their first triangle rendered on the M1 platform.

18
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,360
I don't know, maybe there's going to be a day where I'm running GNOME on an Apple

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,720
device.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,880
Yeah, but OK, I support this, obviously, because I like it seeing Linux

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,640
run really wherever it can. Yeah.

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,680
But what are you doing on that tablet?

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,200
I mean, I don't know.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,280
Browsing the web? I don't know.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,400
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,320
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

27
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,720
And my name is Brent.

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,200
Hello, gentlemen.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,320
It's been quite the week.

30
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,480
Each one of us is bringing our own topic.

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,360
Brent's been battling the lizards all weekend.

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,960
We'll find out how his tumbleweed box may have gone sideways.

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,400
Wes has been cramming Nixos into places that I didn't think

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,440
it'd be able to go.

35
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,480
We'll find out where and why.

36
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,280
And then I am reversing course on an executive decision

37
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,640
I made about a year and a half ago.

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,040
And I'll tell you why that is.

39
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,240
Then we'll round it all out with some boosts, some picks and a lot more.

40
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,480
So before I go any further, let's say time appropriate greetings

41
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,120
to our virtual lug.

42
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,800
Hello, Mumble Room, everybody.

43
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,160
Hello. Hello, Chris and Wes.

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,560
And hello, Brent.

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,920
Hello.

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,320
Thank you for making it. Nice to see everybody there.

47
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,480
This is an interesting trend.

48
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:13,120
We've got a lot of people in quiet listening again these days.

49
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,560
I love it. Thank you for making it there, too.

50
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,560
We are live on Jupiter.2.

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,800
Oh, oh.

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,320
More about that later in the show, because up first,

53
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:27,200
I want to take a moment and just put the word out there

54
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,800
that if you are planning to attend the London meetup,

55
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,840
there is some things in flux that they need to know about.

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,760
Right, Brent?

57
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,480
Yeah, I just learned that the date has changed.

58
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,320
So instead of August 6th, Alex, I guess, has shifted things slightly.

59
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,480
That's why he's planning so far in advance to August 5th.

60
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,920
And that's six p.m. GMT.

61
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,080
Don't be showing up at like Pacific time or anything,

62
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,480
because that's how meetup.com tends to show it.

63
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,200
I did also notice that there are more than 70 people who have RSVP.

64
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,440
So I think last week we were at 40.

65
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,800
That's almost double, which is kind of impressive.

66
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,640
The location, therefore, is to be determined.

67
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,080
But I think we'll figure that out in the next little bit.

68
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,600
Yeah. And this is unfortunate, but it's doable.

69
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,400
I think it was going to be on a Friday.

70
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,200
Now it's going to be on a Saturday or something like that.

71
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,320
Alex is still figuring it out.

72
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,280
He got contacted by his airline.

73
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
And for his convenience, they're rebooking his flight.

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
For his convenience.

75
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,080
Who would have thought that, you know, planning a cross-country meetup

76
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,880
might have some details to figure out here?

77
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,960
Who would a cross-continent meetup?

78
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,760
Really? Indeed. That's pretty cool.

79
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,800
I'm I'm bummed we couldn't make it even speak the same language over there.

80
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,680
No, they speak English. Yeah.

81
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,240
You know, I realized, too, they actually say HDMI right

82
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,920
because they're pronouncing the sound the H makes.

83
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,440
We say HDMI.

84
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,160
I mean, I'm used to saying a all the time, so it's fine when you say.

85
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,480
But how do you say HDMI?

86
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,200
Do you say HDMI or do you say H?

87
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
No, I'm with you. HDMI.

88
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,120
But, you know, they invented the thing.

89
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,760
So I don't know, Jeff Giff, RGA.

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,040
I don't know. Anyways, I'm just saying it's not all bad over there.

91
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,400
Now, if they just didn't smell so bad, except for Pope, he smells great.

92
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,080
But yeah, so keep an eye at meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

93
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:20,680
That's unfortunate, but that is the state of the airline industry right now.

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,760
And we'll just keep it up to date over there.

95
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,040
So let's start with my reversal.

96
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,360
This will be pretty quick.

97
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,280
So I think this is probably a good place to start.

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,280
I surprised a lot of the hosts last week here at Jupiter Broadcasting

99
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,520
when I announced that Jupiter Broadcasting was getting back into PeerTube.

100
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,440
PeerTube is a YouTube in a box replacement that is based around WebTorrent

101
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,960
technology to do peer to peer streaming of the video to offload

102
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,520
the most expensive part about live streaming, which is the bandwidth.

103
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
And it's something we've talked about before on the show.

104
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,320
We're a big fan of where they're going with it.

105
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,320
It participates in the activity pub Federation Network.

106
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,320
So you can actually you can actually there's this beautiful world

107
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,360
where mastodon and PeerTube can actually communicate and cross

108
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,760
pollinate each other. It's it's really cool.

109
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,080
We shut it down due to some limitations at the time that didn't

110
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,840
just didn't really work for us.

111
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,720
Yeah, right. We had an old PeerTube and it was fun to try, but it didn't.

112
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,360
It just seemed like it wasn't, you know, the place where we were at

113
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,280
and wanted to do and its stage of development.

114
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
Yeah, we were kind of at the time, we were kind of thinking of it

115
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
as a full YouTube replacement.

116
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
So we would post all of our stuff there. Right.

117
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,320
Yeah. Be another like the archive of J.P. stuff. Right.

118
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,240
And maybe we would create a channel for each one of the shows.

119
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
You could subscribe to the Coder Radio channel and the Linux Unplugged channel.

120
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,640
And don't listen to the guys on Linux Action News.

121
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
They're crazy. Don't know what they're talking about.

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,840
No. So you could pick and choose.

123
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,800
But this time around, I've decided to do just sort of a live version,

124
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,960
a limited archive of our live shows.

125
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,560
And we're trying to do video where we can for those to make it,

126
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,280
you know, a little more enjoyable. I get all of that.

127
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,520
The idea really came to me, though, when I thought, well,

128
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,640
we've gotten a decentralized community with Matrix.

129
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,200
And that's been going really well.

130
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,160
We've been working on a decentralized value system with Boose.

131
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,240
That's building out. It's early days, but it's building out.

132
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,640
But we don't really have a decentralized media solution.

133
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,480
And that really got me thinking about PeerTube again,

134
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,000
because I think it really brings everything we've been talking about in 2022 together.

135
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,320
We don't really need another project,

136
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,520
but I think we can do something here that completes a picture of decentralized media.

137
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,920
So everything from the distribution to the funding to the community interaction,

138
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,000
it can all be decentralized.

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
We've never really been at this place before.

140
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,480
This is a new era in technology that you can actually host yourself

141
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,800
on your own infrastructure.

142
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,040
Still early, but it seems, you know, just based on some of what you say,

143
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,920
I read some of the other results like seems like something worth continuing to explore and invest in.

144
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
And the whole stack is free.

145
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,120
It's all free software right from the OBS machine that we're using to stream right now

146
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,880
all the way up to restream.

147
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,560
And if you're watching on a Linux box to all the way down to your system,

148
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
that's why you want Linux on your tablet.

149
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,040
There you go.

150
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,520
And, you know, this is the advantage of things like no takedown bots.

151
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,160
But here's the idea is I thought, well, we'll have livestream recordings up there.

152
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,960
It'll be archived for a period of time.

153
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,680
We'll stream special events like Apple's WWDC.

154
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,040
I'm going to do it like a Mystery Science Theater WWDC stream tomorrow.

155
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,120
Yeah, I'll have a link in the show notes if you want to try it.

156
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,760
And we can go live earlier over there because we don't have to worry about copyright violations.

157
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,640
So you can kind of get the pre pre show over there.

158
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:28,520
And the number one question I got is why not make this a members only thing?

159
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
You know, now that you've added video.

160
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,080
I like that that somehow the audience is suggesting this.

161
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah. Yeah. Well, you guys to not you specifically, but a lot of the team did.

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,680
But also it was like that when I in Matrix, I was asking people their opinions and, you know, trying it out last week.

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,200
And a lot of people said, well, why not just do a members only thing?

164
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,480
Well, so the members only feeds not going away.

165
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,120
It's an audio feed with the show notes and we publish it like almost immediately after the show.

166
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,640
That remains the source feed for that audio is better quality.

167
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:03,280
It includes some processing in Jack and it doesn't include like all the dead air on the livestream when we're bringing the streams up.

168
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,440
And it's just a standby screen and all of that kind of stuff.

169
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,160
And we don't go back and prune the archive like we're going to do on PeerTube to keep storage costs down.

170
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,520
And we're not going to be posting the livestream video version to anything like YouTube or anything like that.

171
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,160
Or so with the with the member feed, you get the convenience, right?

172
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
You can just it's like any other podcast, etc.

173
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,360
This is a something a little different.

174
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,600
Yeah. And to dip our toe into something which is bigger that I'll talk about here in a moment.

175
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,920
But another reason it was an audience first reason is work from home.

176
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,680
You know, we hear from people that they just don't commute as much now.

177
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,880
And I'm honestly humbled that so many of you have figured out new ways to work us into your routines.

178
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,480
And we don't take that for granted at all.

179
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,600
And we're going to work hard every single week to try to make that decision worth it.

180
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,600
But also, I just hear from people out there that they're at their desk more when they listen.

181
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,120
So this might be something you could you know, when you're at your desk, you go up to Jupiter tube and watch it on there potentially.

182
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,480
Also, it's just a minimal overhead.

183
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,840
We're not making these video shows.

184
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,640
These are still audio multitrack recordings and have an audio editor.

185
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,760
We're just adding some cameras because of the low key nature of it.

186
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,080
It actually probably looks worse than we did 10 years ago.

187
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,120
But I just don't care. Right.

188
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,080
I'm not taking it seriously.

189
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,800
YouTube is a fool's game.

190
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,040
I don't much respect anybody wants to try it.

191
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,480
So it does work for some people.

192
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,000
But I hate what it incentivizes as a platform.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
So we have no interest in that.

194
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,880
And the overhead is pretty minimal.

195
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,520
I've done live switching for a decade.

196
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,480
So for me, it's pretty natural to to live switch while I'm talking.

197
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,400
Just didn't know. Whoa, whoa.

198
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,560
So that's no big deal.

199
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,760
So that's no big deal, but the other bigger reason kind of looking out the podcasting

200
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,920
to community is working on live stream support inside the podcast app.

201
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
Now, this is where this is going.

202
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,320
Tell me more about this.

203
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
So you got your favorite podcast app and you pull up your podcast.

204
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
And when Linux Unplugged is live on a Sunday,

205
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,160
we'll just show up as another entry in the list of your podcast with a little badge or however

206
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,880
the developer implements it that says this is a live show.

207
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,160
And then you can tap that and in your existing podcast player,

208
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,120
you can just listen to the live stream like like with all your podcast controls.

209
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,840
That is neat.

210
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,480
Yeah, we've needed that for a long time.

211
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,280
Yeah, because otherwise we have to direct people like a whole separate setup, right?

212
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,280
And there's a lot of URLs to figure out.

213
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,040
And yeah, and some apps will let you some of those like Podverse,

214
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,600
some of the podcasting to do apps already support this.

215
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,240
They'll let you opt in for notifications when the show goes live.

216
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
If you want inside the app, you manage it inside the app.

217
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Just say, yeah, notify me or by default, it doesn't.

218
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,240
So that I'm looking forward to.

219
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,640
But right now it's primarily audio that's in these apps.

220
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,000
But there are members in the podcasting to community who are working on making this

221
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,560
also a video and audio option.

222
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,040
So you would pick when you tap on if you want to watch the video or the audio.

223
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,920
And the awesome thing about that is they're doing this based around PeerTube

224
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,840
as the origination point for the video.

225
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,360
So the podcasting to folks are going to basically kind of encourage PeerTube

226
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,120
adoption for people who want to stream their video.

227
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,440
And one of the developers working on this is Alex Gates.

228
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,200
He's one of the podcasting to community members working on a bunch of awesome projects.

229
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,280
But he's working on this video stuff using PeerTube.

230
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,600
And he said, this was this morning in a conversation I had with him.

231
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,240
He said, the goal is to get PeerTube live stream support, either upstream or via a

232
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,200
series of plugins, which live notifications go through Podping on a federated live chat

233
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
via XMPP in a curated RSS feed out of the box.

234
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,280
Now, this is a lot of jargon.

235
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:23,280
But what he's saying is they're going to leverage a bunch of open standards like

236
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,200
ActivityPub and XMPP to do this back end work.

237
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,480
And he's going to create an example spec for people to follow that can then implement it

238
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,400
in the app or implement it as a podcaster.

239
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,480
And he says, I also want to provide the capability for apps to choose to participate

240
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,080
in a web torrent bandwidth sharing or just stream it directly to so you could also help

241
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,720
with that.

242
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,440
That'd be nice.

243
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,480
All from the podcasting app.

244
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,800
So that's another reason we're doing it.

245
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,280
Right.

246
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,560
So that's another reason we're doing it, we're just going to kind of start experimenting

247
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,120
with that stuff.

248
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,960
And the PeerTube project is such a great piece of free software as well.

249
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,560
So I just wanted to experiment with it again.

250
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,040
And I've gotten some community members who have offered to help us do some of the admin

251
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,760
side so we can kind of take over some of that.

252
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,360
And I'll do my first experiment, which our YouTube I was just looking.

253
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,400
Our YouTube channel has been in trouble since November 20th, 2020, when I did a mystery

254
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,800
science theater Apple stream and they gave us one of those like, if you screw up again,

255
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,000
you can't live stream anymore.

256
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,640
And it's been on our account since November of 2020.

257
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,960
So I just got to try it now.

258
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,760
You know, like next week, I'm just going to give it a go on Monday and see what happens

259
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,440
to do all of that.

260
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,320
We ended up deploying this instance of Jupiter tube on NixOS.

261
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,120
Yeah, we did.

262
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,160
And we deployed NixOS on Linode, which is not one of their default images.

263
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,800
No, no.

264
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
We have we had a little bit of fun with that.

265
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,640
Yeah, we learned a few things along the way.

266
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,000
And I don't know what you think would maybe be the most helpful thing to relate to people

267
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
that want to try this as well, because I know what we figured out was there's some label

268
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
stuff with the disks and that kind of thing.

269
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,480
Yeah, you know, you kind of you got to learn the particulars of the hosting platform that

270
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,840
you're using.

271
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,720
And so I'd play with it on like a couple other hosts that I already had set up when I first

272
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
started dabbling for the NixOS challenge.

273
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,480
But we hadn't actually deployed anything like on the JB stuff, really, except playing around

274
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,360
with VMs.

275
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,520
Yeah, locally, nothing up on Linode.

276
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,960
So it's fun.

277
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,560
I liked it because it was just like you and I sort of like pair installing NixOS.

278
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,760
And I'd never like walked through, you know, we've installed other like we've done Arch

279
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,560
before and that kind of thing.

280
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
But it was it was neat.

281
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,720
It was.

282
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,720
It was fun because we were tempted to follow a guide, but also wanted to do it on our own.

283
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,680
So we kind of just like a mix of both, which did lead us to make one little mistake with

284
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,040
I guess how the Nix installer finds the drives to set up for boot.

285
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,880
Yeah, so one of the particulars that we had to take into account was just sort of the

286
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
nature of the virtualization and the setup.

287
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,560
And so instead of having, you know, like a partition table set up on the disk by default,

288
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,080
you get just like the whole disk and Linode has a fancy setup where they'll run grub and

289
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:58,480
then that'll find your, you know, find your boot drive and load your kernel and that kind

290
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,200
of thing.

291
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,280
But NixOS is so neat that you just kind of enable a couple command line options, right?

292
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,760
You say, oh, yeah, well, I'm choosing BIOS boot or EFI and enable grub for me, please.

293
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,440
Then you don't really have to do much else.

294
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,480
And that was the first time we got into a situation where it's like, I know how to fix

295
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,240
like regular grub things, but, you know, or the ArchWiki's guide to install grub or whatever.

296
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,400
But here we're kind of just seeing this failure and it's saying like, oh, this mode, you have

297
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,640
to install in this mode, but you can't actually use, you know.

298
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,320
Yeah, not supported and yeah, and it just airs out when it's trying to do the bootloader stuff.

299
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,200
Yeah, exactly.

300
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,560
And you could go the other way.

301
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,160
You could obviously repartition things.

302
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,080
So we thought about taking that path, but we found some resources that suggested that

303
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,080
can break some of Linode's, you know, they've got functionality and there's reasons, obviously,

304
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,960
they've chosen that, you know, the default setup that they have.

305
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,480
And if you want to keep things like, have it be able to, you know, fix your root password

306
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,920
for you or something like that, you probably shouldn't vary that.

307
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,800
That's where they also suggested, I guess Linode suggests don't use UUIDs for your disks,

308
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,080
go by label, at least.

309
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,480
I don't know if that's still relevant, but at least at one time that was the suggestion.

310
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:56,800
Oh, okay.

311
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:01,040
I thought that was our secret sauce because it seemed like when we started going by label,

312
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,200
then the bootloader finished installing.

313
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,840
Well, so then we also found out how, you know, learn more about how the grub setup works

314
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,560
in NixOS to go ask it, still write all the config files because we wanted those, but

315
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,600
just don't bother with the part where you go, you know, write the grub magic onto the

316
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,480
physical part of the disk.

317
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
And that was the part that was failing.

318
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,160
So then, like, you know, there was no, once we got that little config change, it just

319
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,480
worked.

320
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,640
So that's pretty easy.

321
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,040
They do have a guide, which we could have followed.

322
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,120
But yeah, we did it the painful way.

323
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,520
So instead of doing what we did, we'll have some links in the show notes that will sort

324
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,760
of lay this out if you want to copy it, because I mean, once we figured that out, even though

325
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,240
we kind of we did it a couple of times, we debated like, to be clear, this was like after

326
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,600
the show last weekend.

327
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,800
And so we're kind of just like, how quickly can we get PeerTube back up and going?

328
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,280
Yeah.

329
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,080
Trying to like hazily like remember the last time because we just played with it, right?

330
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,440
We threw the old one away.

331
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,560
We didn't think we needed it again.

332
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,200
Now we were done.

333
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,880
Never going to use that again.

334
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,760
But it was nice because we went down and then we decided, oh, no, let's like start again,

335
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,320
reinstall.

336
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,880
Now we found some like better directions for how we're going to do this.

337
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:08,720
And since we just had our same configuration.nix file, it was no big deal.

338
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,600
Yeah, that was what was so great is to put that another way is when we were trying to

339
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,440
go through all of this and it didn't work and we were just about like, ah, screw it.

340
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,240
We'll just go, you know, we'll go deploy 2204 or whatever.

341
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,120
It'll be fine.

342
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,760
When we right at that moment, we're like, actually, yeah, if we just grab that configuration

343
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,800
file and we just start over and do it the right way.

344
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,640
Well, all the work was really filling out the config.

345
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,680
It'll just rebuild.

346
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,000
And that is such a great moment with Nix.

347
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,920
It's it's so nice.

348
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,760
And to that end, right after we went through all that manual process of installing it,

349
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:44,160
like the next day or something, two days later, the new version of Nix came out with a graphical

350
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,440
installer, ironically.

351
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,320
So we tried it out for the Linux Action News and I put it on my ThinkPad that we were doing

352
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,400
the BcashFS testing on a couple of weeks ago.

353
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,560
And I left it on there and I started using it over the weekend, just kind of filling

354
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,920
out that configuration file.

355
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,160
And it's the same thing as a test over the weekend.

356
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,440
I just blew the whole thing away.

357
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,800
I dropped the configuration file back on there and rebuilt the whole system.

358
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,560
And it's amazing.

359
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,880
And I have everything in that file I need to work on my applications, my Flatpak support,

360
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,040
my tail scale stuff, everything.

361
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,240
And I like having it in one file.

362
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,480
I know I could do includes.

363
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,520
I don't want to.

364
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,240
I don't want to, Wes.

365
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,600
I like having it all in one file.

366
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,960
I love it that way.

367
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:27,440
And I wasn't really sure when we took the Nix challenge a bit ago how Nix would be on

368
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:27,840
the desktop.

369
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,280
I was solely focused on the server.

370
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,840
Totally.

371
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,400
Oh, oh, it's so good on the desktop.

372
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,480
It turns out for a certain kind of like, I just want this thing to always work.

373
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,960
Like on my ThinkPad, I want to raise the screen and get to work.

374
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,200
Maybe it's not you're like tinkering, constantly fiddling with your setup or something, but

375
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,680
on a machine.

376
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,080
Yeah, right.

377
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,640
You're just like, I want a few plugins installed.

378
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,680
I want to configure a couple of things and then just be playing.

379
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,360
You can even declare the Nome extensions you want a little plain with fire in case there's

380
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,440
a Nome update, but I think that's pretty great.

381
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,480
And then last but not least, and I'm sure this is true with Silverblue as well, what

382
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,000
really seals the deal and bridges the gap from like a 90% solution to a 100% solution

383
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,800
for me is Flatpak.

384
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,440
So when you have Flatpak on NixOS, I've declared like all of my core system in the configuration

385
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,320
file and that's incredibly powerful.

386
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,000
But then like, if I want to just rando try something, there's almost always a Flatpak

387
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,480
of it now and I can just throw it on my system with Flatpak and that also works.

388
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,680
But between Flatpak and more, you know, the server world of containers, obviously Flatpak

389
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,880
uses the same sort of primitives.

390
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,240
Yeah, right.

391
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,320
We've got we've got these nice escape hatches now that you really can have a really locked

392
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,320
down set up sort of base system and then put some stuff on as you see fit.

393
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,160
So if you haven't heard the news, if you haven't listened to Linux action is from last week,

394
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:54,480
the latest version of NixOS with the either the Gnome or the Plasma ISOs has the was

395
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
it Climaris, is that how we say it?

396
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480
Colomaris, I don't know.

397
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,840
But it's a really well known distro agnostic installer.

398
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,960
If you've used Manjaro or Endeavor OS or lots of distros out there, you've actually used

399
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:13,200
this installer before and we we were both really impressed with the implementation.

400
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
We weren't sure how that would port to something like Nix.

401
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,680
No, you know, just because here's a sure it's set up to be multi distro and have plugins

402
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:23,200
and have some extensibility built in, but even when you're supporting multiple distros,

403
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,960
like how many of those distros are set up like NixOS, you know, it's kind of a unique

404
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:26,960
set up.

405
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,880
So can can you work with that framework to actually marry those two things?

406
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,920
Because there's a bunch of different, you know, the process and the set up is different.

407
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,360
You got to hook into the next system.

408
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,880
But what's so neat about that is like once you've learned a little bit about Nix enough

409
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,440
to go like read some Nix slang files, you just go look at like you can just go look

410
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,080
at the MR adding this feature and see exactly all the patches and what had to change and

411
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,680
how the modules fit together.

412
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:53,920
It's so cool.

413
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,040
Linode.com slash unplugged go there to get $100 in 60 day credit on a new account, and

414
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,480
you go there to support this show.

415
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,160
This show is made possible by you taking advantage of our sponsors offers and Linode is one that

416
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,400
I am totally on board with endorsing because we have built so much of our infrastructure

417
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:10,880
on Linode.

418
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,080
It's one of these sponsors where I have just spent hours and hours and hours using their

419
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,960
platform.

420
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,160
I can tell in those hours that this is something that has been iterated and approved on for

421
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:22,960
years.

422
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,760
You know, Linode started nearly 19 years ago before AWS was a twinkle in Bezos's eye and

423
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,160
their mission has remained unchanged since all of that.

424
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,080
Even with all of these other crazy competitors coming on board jacked up with their VC funds,

425
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,480
Linode has focused on making cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible to all.

426
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,760
This has led to the best in class experience with performance, with configuration options

427
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,280
and with support.

428
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,880
Literally Linode can provide a level of support that the hyperscalers are just not designed

429
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,680
for.

430
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,200
And you can really see what I'm talking about when you go to Linode.com slash unplugged

431
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,480
and you get that $100.

432
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,800
And you know, they've got one click system.

433
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,240
Say you want to deploy something just super quick and get up and going like a next cloud

434
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,280
or a Jitsi or lots.

435
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,840
I mean, there's those are the ones I always mentioned because those are the ones I have

436
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,400
deployed.

437
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,880
But there's so many in what they call their marketplace.

438
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:17,600
But it's also really great for those of you who are cooking with gas.

439
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,560
You know, maybe you use Terraform or Kubernetes and to that end, Linode has a free ebook

440
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,480
they've put out Decorative Cloud Infrastructure Management with Terraform.

441
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,520
It's a book that covers infrastructure as code, covers a lot about Terraform specifically

442
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:41,440
and they talk about the unique aspects of Linode's Kubernetes engine and Terraform that

443
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,320
let you import your existing infrastructure into Terraform and do things that are really

444
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,120
next level.

445
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,280
I've only really begun to understand the power of this, but now I really understand

446
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
why some of you out there like this kind of stuff.

447
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,400
Linode's all about it.

448
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,640
Plus, they got 11 data centers around the world.

449
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,840
They are their own ISP, S3 compatible object storage, which is just killer.

450
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,280
DDoS protection, VLAN support, a powerful DNS manager with pricing 30 to 50% cheaper

451
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,120
than those major cloud hyperscalers.

452
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,120
It's pretty great and the best customer support in the business and it's a great

453
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,560
way to support the show.

454
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,360
Go build something.

455
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,800
Go learn something.

456
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,760
Go try something.

457
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,960
Go sign up today at linode.com slash unplugged.

458
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,440
Get that $100 in 60 day credit on your new account and you support this here show.

459
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:32,160
Linode.com slash unplugged.

460
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,520
Brent, you kind of surprised, I think, both Chris and myself this week when you let on

461
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,600
that you've still been running Tumbleweed on your laptop.

462
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,080
I kind of totally, unfortunately, I'll admit it here.

463
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,600
It's my bad, but I kind of just forgot, you know, we engaged in the Tumbleweed world.

464
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,440
I got very distracted by NixOS, but you, you kept on the path.

465
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,480
He stuck with it and sounds like it kind of went sideways, maybe, at least most recently.

466
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,800
I remember I think it was, well, it's actually Linux unplugged 4.3.2 when we did the Tumbleweed

467
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,640
kind of the three of us tried a bunch of different ways of playing with it.

468
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,520
And I remember distinctly making a promise in there, which was that I would

469
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,720
continue using it and we would do an update at some point.

470
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,120
Now, I did not plan for that to be this week, but it seemed like a natural, natural thing

471
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,360
to do, considering I ran into a few little issues that I thought I would discuss.

472
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,880
Uh oh.

473
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,960
Yeah, it's like Tumbleweed tribulations.

474
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,800
The weeds of Tumbleweed.

475
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,560
Okay, let me give you a little context, I guess is fair.

476
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,600
I have a laptop that I use, you know, every single day.

477
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,760
It's not running Tumbleweed.

478
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,240
It's running something else.

479
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:47,040
But I do have a podcasting laptop that its sole purpose is just to make sure my voice

480
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,280
sounds great and records everything and connects with you guys, you know, once, twice, three

481
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,800
times a week, and it's kind of the podcasting appliance.

482
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,640
And that one is running Tumbleweed.

483
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,480
Ah, so you're putting the most risk over there.

484
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,760
Yeah, okay.

485
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,400
I know.

486
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,960
Well, if you remember correctly, during that episode way back, I think it was November,

487
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,120
actually did our episode recorded it on that laptop, even though it was the first time

488
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,640
that we were kind of getting familiar with it.

489
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,520
So it was a little risky.

490
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,920
And, you know, I like risk.

491
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,680
So I stayed with it.

492
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,560
And it's been great.

493
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,400
All right, now, that being said, it's been an appliance.

494
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,440
So I haven't really treated it maybe the way I should treat a rolling release.

495
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,800
Christ, I know in the past, you've got caught with this with with Arch, but I never updated

496
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,920
it since November.

497
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Brent.

498
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,840
It's going to be quite a few months since November now.

499
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,880
That's not how rolling distros are supposed to work, Brent.

500
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,040
And I know better as well.

501
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,680
But it ended up being kind of fun.

502
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,720
It's going to be a new thing.

503
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,760
And you were traveling too.

504
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,400
I mean, there's all kinds of excuses you probably could come up with, I imagine.

505
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,040
Yeah, I've got I got many of them that I'm telling myself.

506
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,640
It started as a really simple thing, because this thing just runs and I never have any

507
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,840
issues with it.

508
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,800
But I tried to use it for a different purpose, which was I tried to use cheese, if you guys

509
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,960
are familiar with cheese, just to do a little video with some audio of me playing the drums

510
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,320
over here that are on my right and ran into like a small issue.

511
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,400
And I was like, Oh, well, I'll just, you know, I'll just update and reboot and everything

512
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,120
will be fine.

513
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,120
I was like, Oh, yeah, I haven't updated this ever.

514
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,960
And it turned out to be slightly problematic.

515
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:33,040
So it wanted to do updates of like 2300 packages, which yeah, I guess makes sense.

516
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,560
Like two gigs worth of stuff.

517
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,120
Wow.

518
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,600
Like a Brent's offended by this.

519
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,480
Don't give me all these.

520
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,600
Why so many packages?

521
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,680
Geez, how dare you bring me to the current state?

522
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:50,080
It was an interesting experiment, because I've, you know, run enter goes enter goes

523
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,840
before, thanks to the, you know, the arch challenge, Chris, that you enabled way back.

524
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,800
And I just got sort of cozy again with the rolling lifestyle.

525
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,920
You know, every once in a while, something breaks, and you have to dig in and you can't

526
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,560
really schedule this, you just kind of have to be okay with it and solve some issue and

527
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,520
stay up later than you want to and learn a bunch along the way.

528
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,640
And I think this time, really, what I learned was the power of zipper and how nice its interface

529
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,280
is.

530
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,040
At first, when I was solving this, and I was trying to play drums, I just wanted to quickly

531
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,680
record something.

532
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,800
I just use discover to try to do the updates.

533
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,560
And it was, hmm, let's say problematic.

534
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:36,720
So it threw like 20 errors, which I thought, no, that's not great.

535
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,160
And some dependency resolution errors, which I don't think discover is built to solve.

536
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,000
And then it started asking me for pseudo privileges for every single package thereafter that actually

537
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,560
works.

538
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,560
And there's 2000 packages, right?

539
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
I remember this in our chat.

540
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,160
You're like, nope, this is where I'm out.

541
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,720
I'm out.

542
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,080
Shouldn't have chosen a really, really long secure password there, Brent.

543
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,560
So using discover is not typically my way of doing upgrades.

544
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,920
But I just forgot to remember zipper.

545
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,800
It had been, you know, since November that we talked about it.

546
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,160
So I dug into our show notes, and I remembered all of these things.

547
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,440
And it turned out zipper was far more helpful, as you might imagine.

548
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,240
It gave some really helpful tips, like it suggested, oh, wait, you got all these updates.

549
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,960
But actually, you want to run a different command.

550
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,680
So it said, consider canceling, right at the bottom.

551
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,720
It said, consider canceling.

552
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,960
You have to sort of use a different command to update the entire OS.

553
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,480
I was like, oh, that's so helpful.

554
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,440
It was really great.

555
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,600
So it was like, no, no, run zipper, you know, disrupt, right?

556
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,120
And I was like, oh, that is nice.

557
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,640
So I decided to do that.

558
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,080
And those 21 problems showed up with some helpful solutions and stuff.

559
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,600
So I was able to get through those.

560
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,840
They ended up being some like vendor change problems, which I think is sort of normal.

561
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,400
I'm not sure.

562
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,840
I'm not that familiar with it.

563
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,160
I did install the like codecs, multimedia codecs.

564
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,600
So I think it might have something to do with that.

565
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,400
I did some research.

566
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,040
Some people were talking about is really helpful.

567
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,440
Like my research was very short because I was able to search for exactly the error errors

568
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,800
and they came up right away.

569
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,520
So it was really nice to see that the community was on top of this stuff pretty quickly.

570
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,400
I did find Neil in there somewhere sharing comments as well about how things were working

571
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,040
and not working.

572
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,520
So it was nice to see some familiar faces.

573
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,640
So thanks, Neil.

574
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,640
So I got through all those errors pretty smoothly, which I thought was wonderful.

575
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,400
And the process that Zipper offered to solve those was equally nice.

576
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,040
So I stayed in a fairly good mood for that.

577
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,840
So I was finally able to get through the upgrades.

578
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,240
There was some stuff that stood out to me that I thought you guys might find was interesting.

579
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,600
There were 20 vendor changes.

580
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,240
Like I mentioned, two packages wanted to be downgraded, which I didn't expect.

581
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,360
And two packages also wanted to change architecture, which I don't think is a good thing.

582
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,920
Yeah, unless they're going from 32 to 64, possibly.

583
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,640
It looks like in this case, it's going from being explicitly labeled x86-64 to no arch.

584
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,160
So is it maybe just that those packages no longer have a strict requirement on that?

585
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,000
Or there's just no 32 option anymore.

586
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,720
Yeah.

587
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,920
So that's where my mind went was either that's totally fine and I can just safely ignore it

588
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,360
or it's going to be very bad.

589
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,520
And I thought, this is great show content.

590
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,880
So I'm just going to go for it.

591
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,040
Fair enough.

592
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,920
I like the way you think.

593
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,520
Right.

594
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,960
You've trained me well, sir.

595
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,600
It went fine.

596
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,520
I ended up with one last error that I haven't solved yet.

597
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,200
And it's nice because they offer, you know, Zipper offers solutions.

598
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,040
So I have some issue that I've described that I won't get into here.

599
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,600
You know, it has like solution one, deinstall that package.

600
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,760
Solution two, keep the obsolete package.

601
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,440
Solution three, break it and ignore its dependencies.

602
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,920
So it's at least nice it's trying to solve the room.

603
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,680
I don't know which one of those is supposed to be good.

604
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,360
I'm just going to ignore the whole thing.

605
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:02,720
But it was super great.

606
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,840
Zipper with its like extra verbose information was just fabulous.

607
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,560
So and it color codes like the warnings that are like pretty critical seeming are red.

608
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,720
And the ones that are like, well, these are just maybe warning.

609
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,600
They're yellow.

610
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,640
And it's just super nice.

611
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,400
So if someone wants to try that, I think it was a pretty good time.

612
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,920
But it brought me to remembering the whole rolling release lifestyle.

613
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,680
Do you remember what that's like?

614
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,080
I feel like you're describing a worse version.

615
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,400
I mean, because the rolling lifestyle you update.

616
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,160
You just pick your update time.

617
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,480
You know, you have to have a little care about it.

618
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,560
Yeah, you're kind of like the maniac at the right time.

619
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,120
For sure.

620
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:51,760
And but I do remember when I was, you know, more regularly using sort of a arch base as

621
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,200
my everyday, you know, you get into, you know, an arch.

622
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,480
I don't know how this happens.

623
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,280
But then you end up wanting to, like, update five, six, 20 times a day.

624
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,480
Feels good to type SYU.

625
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,120
There's something about it.

626
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,680
I've seen Alex.

627
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,280
Every time he sits at his computer, he does that.

628
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,160
It's crazy.

629
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,080
It felt like these were the exact kind of problems I used to run into on a not daily

630
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
basis, but you just randomly sort of run into them.

631
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,160
So I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or or whatever.

632
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:17,440
But it also has taught me a heck of a lot.

633
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,920
You know, a lot of the skills that I've learned was trying to troubleshoot some of this stuff.

634
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:27,600
So I think I've at least with these experiences that I've got under my belt, I've come to

635
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:33,280
the conclusion that the rolling release lifestyle is great because you get the updated software.

636
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:37,280
You get to play with new stuff like, you know, pipewire comes out pretty darn fast and all

637
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,720
the new stuff you can play with.

638
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,720
From that perspective, it's awesome.

639
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,680
The community tends to be also quite great.

640
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,320
You know, if you run into an issue typically within an hour or less, someone's already

641
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,040
talking about it.

642
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,040
That I found really great.

643
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,320
Is there a but coming here?

644
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,680
Well, it just gets me pondering because you also have lots of unplanned learning and maintenance.

645
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,560
And I think maybe I'm at a point now where I don't really appreciate that.

646
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,120
And I wondered how you guys feel about that.

647
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,080
That's interesting because that was going to be my observation is you kind of have to

648
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,040
be and it seems like you successfully did it, though, but you kind of have to be willing

649
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,040
to convert a real pain in your butt into a learning opportunity.

650
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,840
And you kind of have to keep your head about it and work your way through it.

651
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,160
Because I know my initial reaction these days is when there's a whole bunch of package issues

652
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,960
and I'm like, screw this, I'm out and I'll just wipe it.

653
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,120
But with Seuss in particular, when we were trying tumbleweed, I stuck with it when I

654
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,640
had an issue so that way I could try to learn it.

655
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,720
And I do think it was beneficial, but you have to.

656
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,680
It's a mindset thing.

657
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,120
Well, I know it's true, right?

658
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,480
There's that sort of trade off.

659
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,800
You certainly you could switch back to, you know, LTS, Brent's LTS lifestyle.

660
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,880
But then you what what kind of cadence do you want for upgrades and you kind of have

661
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,720
to figure out you want the do you want lots of small changes or less frequent big changes?

662
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,560
Because this could be a story of sort of like, oh, gosh, the new Ubuntu is really different

663
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,480
now and I'm getting some pipeline or whatever.

664
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,080
And then your whole system isn't working for the weekend as you refigure that out.

665
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,560
Yeah.

666
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,600
And there is leap.

667
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,240
There is leap.

668
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,200
That is true.

669
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,160
That is true.

670
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,440
Maybe that's worth considering.

671
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:09,920
Hmm.

672
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,000
Well, I think it's worth me sticking with this because then we can, you know,

673
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,120
see where it goes in another six months.

674
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,960
That's the real question.

675
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,200
Yeah.

676
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,600
I mean, you're connected today, so it must be working right now.

677
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,320
I think it's working.

678
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,840
It's working, right?

679
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,280
As far as I can tell, yeah.

680
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,680
You know, at the back of my mind the whole time, I was remembering that ButterFS is just

681
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,720
baked in by default and that I can just roll back if I totally went down the wrong path

682
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,520
and try something else.

683
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,680
So I think you're going to have to try that for the show.

684
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,160
Yeah.

685
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,920
Maybe I should try harder to screw it up.

686
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,680
But that insurance was really nice, too.

687
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,840
So that's one of the things that can mitigate, right, the unplanned nature.

688
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,800
Because if you're sort of like, oh, I wanted to do an upgrade, but I'm also about to go

689
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,280
traveling.

690
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,000
I don't have time to fix this because I needed to go download my podcast for the flight

691
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,880
or whatever, right?

692
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,640
And you can just be like, nope, old one.

693
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,920
I'll deal with this later.

694
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,720
Very good point.

695
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,440
I did notice in OpenSUSE's news section, they had a community annual survey that came out,

696
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,720
I guess, a few months ago now.

697
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:09,040
And they did mention that most people who took the survey recommend OpenSUSE distributions

698
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,240
for advanced users.

699
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,760
And they least recommended for new users.

700
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,800
So at least users are thoughtful in how they're recommending these things.

701
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,840
That's interesting.

702
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,560
That's interesting because don't you think YAS is sort of trying to appeal to a new user?

703
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,240
I mean, I do think I kind of agree.

704
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,760
But when I think of SUSE, I think of a distribution that's trying to cater to people that have

705
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,840
never had to configure a Linux machine, too.

706
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,320
Yeah, it's true.

707
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,640
But I wonder if that's not necessarily new user and it's like differently competent computer

708
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,200
user.

709
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,040
Because I feel like you'd need to also understand how to configure, say, Windows for that to

710
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,320
be super useful out of the gate.

711
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,320
And probably the same people who aren't into configuring computers at all.

712
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,840
It's not like YAS is suddenly going to be.

713
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,920
I mean, it is better than figuring out the command line, perhaps.

714
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,520
But it's still a complicated system if you don't understand the basic of how your system

715
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,000
works.

716
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,640
Yeah, that's probably where I was when I first started trying it.

717
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,040
And I was used to managing a Windows system.

718
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,800
Yeah, one of the quotes from the survey results I thought packed it up pretty nicely.

719
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,400
It said the distribution was easy to use and were held in high regard, especially for the

720
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,280
core uses of the server with web hosting, databases, containers and virtualization.

721
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,480
So I think if you're in the world already, go try it.

722
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,200
You're going to be fine.

723
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,880
But if you don't really know what Linux is and you're just getting into it, this is not

724
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,760
the place for you.

725
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,040
So you're going to stick with it, though?

726
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,680
Yeah, I don't know.

727
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,560
This seems exciting.

728
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,400
Otherwise, it's been totally fine and very fun to use.

729
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,920
So yeah, unless someone has a better idea for me to go down some rabbit hole, I'm willing

730
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,560
to hear about it.

731
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,360
Linux subplug dot com slash contact.

732
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:39,760
I like it.

733
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,360
You know, we kind of had to give up the whole Arch updates on the air, but now we can rent

734
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,080
us as Dumbleweed.

735
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,160
Bitwarden dot com slash Linux.

736
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,480
Go get started for free at Bitwarden dot com slash Linux for an individual user or start

737
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,320
a trial for your team or enterprise.

738
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,160
Bitwarden is the easiest way for businesses and individuals to store, share and sync sensitive

739
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,880
data.

740
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,920
It's fully customizable.

741
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,800
You can turn off features in your enterprise with policies you don't want.

742
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,920
It's built on open source.

743
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,360
So, you know, I love it and trust it.

744
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,080
And it has a huge community around it, including a big self-hosting community.

745
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,320
It's what Wes and I use to manage all of our passwords, our two factor code tokens and

746
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,480
other sensitive data like recovery keys.

747
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,160
Some apps these days require things beyond just a password to recover, get back into

748
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,320
them.

749
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,600
And one of the things that I really like is how they keep iterating the experience and

750
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,480
making it better and better.

751
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,000
You guys know I'm all about that.

752
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's like do something, do it really well and then just focus on that and make it better.

753
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,320
And that's why when they added username generators, I was like, heck, yes.

754
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,600
But now, now it's even better.

755
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,920
Now, when you use Bitwarden to generate your username and a password, it'll also tie in

756
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,640
with simple login or a non Addy or something like Firefox Relay.

757
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,800
You enter your API key for one of those services and how it'll generate an email address.

758
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:00,720
So you're getting a username, password and email address that is unique just to that

759
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,040
account, just to that service, just there.

760
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,440
Right.

761
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:08,560
So if something happens, if the worst thing happens and their passwords get leaked, you're

762
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,040
good.

763
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,600
They didn't even get your email address.

764
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,960
This is brilliant.

765
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,640
And this is what I'm talking about is a Bitwarden user.

766
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,560
I've noticed it just keeps getting better and better.

767
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,600
I've been a user for a couple of years and it's just great.

768
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,160
On Android, they've just now added quick account switching.

769
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,520
When you're at the password fill out screen, you just tap your user icon, switch over to

770
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,600
your other account, maybe like, you know, for your business stuff.

771
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,400
They're adding features all the time to that are great for businesses and individuals who

772
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,240
like to just self-sovereign it.

773
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,760
You know, like, I appreciate that, that they can walk that line and they do it so well

774
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,680
and they contribute back upstream to make it possible.

775
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,320
It's easy to get started with Bitwarden, too.

776
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,040
That's the best thing.

777
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,920
You might even import your existing password database.

778
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,960
It did mine.

779
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,520
So go to bitwarden.com slash Linux, try it out for yourself, for your business, or more

780
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:55,600
than likely, maybe you have a friend or a family member or a colleague that needs to

781
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,520
just do a little bit better with their passwords.

782
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:02,320
I legit can't tell you how many people I've seen to store their passwords on a sticky

783
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,680
note under the keyboard.

784
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,880
If that's you or you know somebody that's doing that, stop right now and go to bitwarden.com

785
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,760
slash Linux.

786
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,840
Support the show and try it out for free.

787
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:17,280
Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

788
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,760
As usual, we got some great boosts this week.

789
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,720
They just seem to be getting better and better all the time.

790
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,600
And now it is time for the boost.

791
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,320
Silver Koala wrote in four days ago with 5000 sats.

792
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,560
First time trying the Breeze app.

793
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,760
Simple, easy to use.

794
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,440
First impressions are that it's easier and less buggy than Fountain.

795
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,080
Nice.

796
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,520
So Breeze is a lightning storefront in your phone, basically.

797
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:49,840
It's a lightning wallet that runs a lightning node, so you are all 100% self-contained,

798
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:53,520
and it can connect to our podcast feed and you can send a boost in without having to

799
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,480
switch podcast apps.

800
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,680
Convenient.

801
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,880
Double boost.

802
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,320
Silver Koala also wrote in again four days ago with 5000 sats.

803
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,000
I've noticed that Breeze app also has limited notes like Fountain.

804
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,880
Yeah, I like this.

805
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,320
I like you can send a little note in there.

806
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,720
I think it's like 300 characters or something like that.

807
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,400
Just fine by me.

808
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,560
See, I interpreted that to mean limited notes, i.e. not our full show notes show up.

809
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,040
Remember?

810
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,160
Oh, you're right.

811
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,080
This sounds like an issue tracker kind of boost to me.

812
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,880
Okay, all right.

813
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,520
We can add that.

814
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,440
I think I wouldn't count on Breeze having all the notes, though, you know, but Fountain,

815
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,560
we got to get on that.

816
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,360
It's all part of figuring things out in the relationship.

817
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,160
Yeah, well, speaking of 412 Linux boosted in five days ago with 500 sats with some

818
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:40,480
feedback on, you know, the whole members feed stuff and video live.

819
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,360
We asked for that.

820
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,400
So let's have it.

821
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,920
Well, 412 Linux has been listening to the live feed since its availability.

822
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,800
Hey, that's awesome.

823
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,920
Really enjoys it.

824
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,040
Multitask while listening.

825
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,800
So video is not that important, but it is nice occasionally to, you know, pop in and

826
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,640
watch the video or for special occasion.

827
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,920
Something you mentioned there, Chris.

828
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,320
Mm hmm.

829
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,040
Part two.

830
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,160
I do like when you include small bits about the sponsors in the live feed.

831
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,760
I like that I don't have to listen to the whole ad, but I get to know the sponsor in

832
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,960
special deals or info.

833
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,160
Thanks for the show.

834
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,800
You know what?

835
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,920
We have the best members ever.

836
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,080
I mean, so 412, thank you for being a member and then for boosting on top of that.

837
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,320
You are you are great.

838
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:21,760
So thank you very much for that user 609 to six days ago, boosted in with 5000 sats.

839
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,200
Yes, this one was about the Intel software defined CPU that we covered.

840
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,760
And a lot of people had thoughts on that.

841
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,600
And user 609 wrote, is Intel underestimating the risk of geeks managing to crack their

842
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,400
processors?

843
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,360
I'm not condoning or promoting this, but surely buying a processor for 100 bucks and

844
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:46,000
ending up with an equivalent $400 model is very tempting.

845
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,920
And I could see disgruntled Linux users giving some direct feedback on what they think of

846
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,520
this business model.

847
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,520
Do you guys think you think it's possible people could figure out ways to hack this?

848
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,560
You know, I'm sure Intel has tried not to make that happen.

849
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,080
And you got to get past some of the crypto stuff.

850
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,240
But probably the most, you know, realistic way is like all these things, right?

851
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,120
There's a mistake somewhere.

852
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,480
You can take advantage of it.

853
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,960
That said, I imagine that's somewhat less of a concern if like perhaps the enterprise

854
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,800
or data center market or some of the things there is more where they're thinking for this.

855
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,720
I don't know that us, you know, retail consumers are really going to be the people paying to

856
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,680
enable the features.

857
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,480
Maybe it'll go that way.

858
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,280
I hope not.

859
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,280
We were speculating in the pre show that this could be years away.

860
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,080
Like if Intel is trying to get it upstream into 518 now, it might be years before we

861
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,400
see a product that uses this because perhaps they want to get it into something like REL.

862
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,480
So that way, when they do ship an enterprise product that uses the software to find features.

863
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,960
Distributions like REL and Debian already have the feature set.

864
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,840
And if that's the case, we're looking at years of not knowing.

865
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,840
But one of the things I'm trying to figure out, and we talked about how this mechanism

866
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:54,880
works, I'm trying to figure out how the mechanism is going to verify that you're going to

867
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,880
verify that your authorization files, your licenses to do this, to activate these features.

868
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,280
How does it figure out it's valid?

869
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,320
There's two mechanisms.

870
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,720
There's a feature that gets enabled and there's a file that's the license to enable that feature.

871
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,440
And what prevents me from taking that license file off of my file system and giving it to

872
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,200
Wes and him putting on his file system and having that feature?

873
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,560
Maybe there is something I'm missing.

874
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,320
Maybe it's more complicated than that.

875
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,400
Or maybe there's some sort of cloud activation aspect to this as well that we haven't heard

876
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,040
about yet that wouldn't be revealed in their code to the kernel.

877
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,000
Yeah, right.

878
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,520
We just kind of know about the interface, not necessarily what user space thing is going

879
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:33,920
to be talking to the kernel and loading these various things into the capabilities.

880
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:36,000
Boost.

881
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,080
Marcel wrote in six days ago with 1969 SATs.

882
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:45,200
Chris, have you figured out if there's anything, any special meaning to that number?

883
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,640
That feels like a birthday.

884
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,160
Or just a really great year?

885
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,680
Yeah, feels like a year to me.

886
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,720
1969.

887
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,440
That's how I read it.

888
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,520
Good music that year, I think, if I remember.

889
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,400
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

890
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,840
They're right.

891
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,320
I'm very anti-SDSI.

892
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,200
But let's remember Intel is responsible here, not Linux.

893
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,400
Why should the kernel get flack for implementing this feature?

894
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:04,960
You're right.

895
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,320
Linux is about freedom.

896
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:11,600
With this feature, you're free to use the horrible model of Intel's, which you couldn't

897
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,160
before.

898
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,600
Linux is not restricting you.

899
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,720
Intel is.

900
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,920
They didn't support it.

901
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,760
I think it wouldn't change anything.

902
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,200
We just have kernel patches rolling around, and it would be worse for everyone involved.

903
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,800
Vote with your wallet.

904
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,160
Yeah, point there.

905
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,280
Yeah, I think the kernel community has kind of learned that people are going to do it

906
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:29,760
anyway.

907
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,040
So maybe this helps.

908
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,000
No, Marcel's right.

909
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,560
Last week, I was just saying, should we, as a community, try to act as a last line of

910
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,440
defense for this?

911
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,960
And it would start with the kernel community.

912
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,320
But Marcel's right.

913
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:47,040
It's like, OK, if you do it for Intel, then you've got to do it for so many other hardware

914
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,000
devices.

915
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,120
Where do we draw the line?

916
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:53,680
You know, it does occur to me 1969 was right before the start of the old Unix epoch.

917
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,560
That could be it.

918
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,600
Let us know, Marcel.

919
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,200
That could be it.

920
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,440
Mage also wrote in via the feedback at linuxunplug.com slash contact on the same topic.

921
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,920
They write CPU as a service.

922
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,160
Say hello to the next generation from ransomware.

923
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,000
That's a nice compute slash virtualization cluster slash database CRP you've got there.

924
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,960
Would be a shame if virtualization and extra CPU cores were disabled until you paid us.

925
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,240
That would be a shame.

926
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,400
That's the enterprise use case I'm thinking of.

927
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,320
It's funny to kind of pitch it as ransomware.

928
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,920
Like you have something on your computer, but you can't unlock it until you pay us.

929
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,800
There is like there is a little bit of that.

930
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,800
All right, I'll take this next one because this was a special triple boost by the Golden

931
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,120
Dragon.

932
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,640
I didn't know that was even possible.

933
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,640
Totally in 2000 sats, Golden Dragon was boosting along as they listened in the pre-show.

934
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,520
They speculated that this system D stuff may play out fairly interesting to observe and

935
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,000
wondered if it would work well on a system like Arch.

936
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,120
And the system D feature they're talking about is building in the AB system updating mechanism

937
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:03,600
into system D. And you know, you hear what Brent just went through, maybe.

938
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,800
Because right now, SUSE is accomplishing that with file system technology and things like

939
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,160
Snapper sitting on top of that.

940
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:14,320
But wouldn't it be interesting if system D could manage some of that AB system switching

941
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:14,800
for them?

942
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,840
I could see that being nice and the sort of unification factor is a few, you know, more

943
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,040
distros have have that functionality and it worked similarly across them.

944
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:21,760
That could be neat.

945
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:29,360
Keeping up with the triple boost in B-O-O-S-T on SDSI, I'm mostly an opponent of DRM.

946
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:34,080
So this seems like an anti-consumer move, locking parts of the experience behind a paywall

947
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,200
just reads the same as when the gaming industry went to full downloadable content and day

948
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,080
one patches.

949
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,960
Yeah, I remember that world.

950
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,160
Who knows what the lengths Intel is willing to go to on this want to overclock pay us

951
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:54,160
virtualization pay us virtualization would be really, you know, like these low end consumer

952
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:55,840
devices that just can't do the same thing.

953
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:00,160
And it would just suck to from the Linux perspective of, you know, like we're so used to assuming

954
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,360
that, like you get this OS and you get all the you get all these things, you know, maybe

955
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:07,440
it's not the most performant version or whatever, but like you can do it more limitations would

956
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,000
be lame.

957
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,480
A lot of people wrote in this is a common thread on Matrix two about the resale market.

958
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,920
How is this going to mess with the resale market, especially if Westpain buys the features

959
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,200
it's licensed to Westpain's Intel account.

960
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,040
Yeah, it's licensed to me or the chip or.

961
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:21,600
Yeah.

962
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:26,080
And does it make the resale market just totally screwed like you got a you had an $800 value

963
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:31,120
computer, but when you sell it and the features get deactivated, now it's only a $600 computer

964
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,480
because the CPU doesn't do it.

965
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,760
But that's why it makes sense to have an ongoing subscription cost that way.

966
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,080
You know, that's why when you're done with it, you don't have to keep paying for it.

967
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,320
Just make it part of your Intel plus subscription.

968
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,840
Oh, man, I hope not.

969
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:44,800
Oh, geez.

970
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,520
I think the resale market was the aspect I didn't think of the most.

971
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,040
During the show that we got the most feedback on to here's the last boost that came in from

972
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,800
the Golden Dragon, although they said quad.

973
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,880
I saw three boosts, but they invoked the cone of silence for this one.

974
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,160
So this is private.

975
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,280
The cone of silence.

976
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,400
That's just for us.

977
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,200
Come on in here.

978
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:07,600
They're right.

979
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,200
I might have a slight boost addiction.

980
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,320
So let's just try to move right past this.

981
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,000
The cone of silence.

982
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,080
He writes, I just wanted to say I really enjoyed the show and I'm glad to be able to help out

983
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:18,800
this way.

984
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,240
I streamed some stats and I got my two cents in all in a cool new way.

985
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:22,720
F yeah.

986
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
Boost to grams and F yeah.

987
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,440
Go, JB.

988
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,040
Oh, that's great.

989
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,760
We got a thank you boost from user eight eight nine to did a mic test for 2100 sats.

990
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,040
Test, test, test.

991
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,240
And this is I think we'll do one more week now of our splits.

992
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,280
So we're going to do a mic test for 2100 sats.

993
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,480
Test, test, test.

994
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,760
And this is I think we'll do one more week now of our splits.

995
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,080
So when you boost in a split, I think we're doing 10, 15%.

996
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,800
Maybe I can't remember.

997
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,320
I think it's maybe 15.

998
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,760
We're giving 15% of the splits to open sats, which is a charity that donates 100% of the

999
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,720
funds they receive to free software projects.

1000
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,840
So yours, your boosts are going to help open source as well.

1001
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,560
If you'd like to send a boost, go grab a new podcast app at new podcast apps.com,

1002
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:13,040
or keep your podcast app and you can just use breeze B R E E Z dot technology.

1003
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,280
Something special for our picks this week.

1004
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,080
We don't ever do this ever.

1005
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:22,400
I don't think we've never picked a subscription.

1006
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,800
We've never picked anything really that's not software for the most part,

1007
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,400
except for with a very few exceptions.

1008
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,360
But this week's a, is an exception week.

1009
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:35,680
Our buddy, Michael Larable over at Ferronix has launched a special edition of the

1010
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,760
subscription price for the 18th birthday of Ferronix.

1011
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,040
Yep.

1012
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,400
Happy birthday to Ferronix.

1013
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:42,880
Freaking.

1014
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,840
Hey man, that is very impressive.

1015
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:52,800
June 5th, 2022 marks the 18th birthday for Ferronix.com for Ferronix.

1016
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,160
It's kind of hard to say fast, but I got it to mark the occasion.

1017
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,080
There's a premium special.

1018
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:03,440
If you'd like to go all ad free and I'm going to say this, you know, the reality is guys,

1019
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:10,560
um, even if you're not a big Ferronix reader on the daily, uh, Wes and I are super tuned

1020
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,680
in to like all the news in the Linux world for Linux action news.

1021
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:19,040
And a lot of our stories for Linux action news start with a Ferronix article that then

1022
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,360
sends us down a rabbit hole for coverage in the show.

1023
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:30,720
And there is only a very, very small handful of original content creators in this space

1024
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,080
that are not just taking something somebody else is reporting and repeating it.

1025
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:38,640
Doing the hard work of following, you know, the day to day ins outs of the work going

1026
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,720
on in these projects and then knowing enough, understanding enough, having paid attention

1027
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:46,400
for years to give the context to know like what things the rest of the community should

1028
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:46,880
know about.

1029
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,520
Yeah, that's just it.

1030
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,280
And every year he gets better at doing what he's doing.

1031
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,200
Uh, and you know, he's testing the hardware when new hardware comes out and doing the

1032
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,000
benchmarks as well.

1033
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,120
Finding kernel regressions.

1034
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:55,600
Yeah.

1035
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,960
Yeah, that's a great point.

1036
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,360
I mean, I think he probably is most known for the benchmarks, but a lot of what Michael

1037
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,840
does is dig through kernel development stuff.

1038
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,840
And yeah, there was a regression, a performance regression that we talked about in Linux action

1039
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:08,640
news in 518.

1040
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,200
And you know, sure enough, you start digging into it and Michael's one of the first people

1041
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,480
talking about it in public.

1042
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,920
And the kernel developers knew behind the scenes, they weren't saying anything.

1043
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,200
They were submitting the patches.

1044
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,760
But Michael, you know, brings light to this kind of stuff.

1045
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,120
And he does a lot of the original reporting in the Linux community.

1046
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,840
A lot of other people are based on the reporting off of what he does.

1047
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,320
So I just wanted to give him a plug.

1048
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,280
He didn't ask us to.

1049
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:36,320
In fact, a year or so ago when I invited him on the show, I invited him to plug his membership

1050
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:37,280
and he declined.

1051
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,400
He's very humble about it.

1052
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,840
He doesn't ask very often.

1053
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,680
So, you know, 25 bucks for a year or 140 for a lifetime.

1054
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,160
It's a steal.

1055
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,480
Yeah, it's it's it's for Onyx's birthday.

1056
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,280
It's pretty great to see.

1057
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:50,080
It reminds me I need to get my subscription.

1058
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:50,560
I need to renew mine.

1059
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:51,040
Yeah.

1060
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,880
Oh, jeez.

1061
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,680
You know, I think I might have a bonus pick here.

1062
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,960
It's actually a software piece, too.

1063
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:00,960
Brent sneaking in.

1064
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,960
Well, audience member JJ wrote in with a really great tool that they wrote in Rust.

1065
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,360
I'm sorry.

1066
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,000
What'd you say?

1067
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,240
Oh, I said, I think the tool was written in Rust.

1068
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,140
Huh?

1069
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,320
Rust you say?

1070
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,080
And they got inspired by episode 448 of Linux and plug.

1071
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:21,840
Do you remember when we did that encrypted show notes episode where we didn't have any

1072
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,160
idea what we were talking about to each other?

1073
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,080
That was our first of each one of us brings a topic, which is what inspired this episode.

1074
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:28,640
That's right.

1075
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:34,080
And Chris, you touched on some steganography that you hid a bunch of hidden messages in

1076
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,840
a cute little Levi photo.

1077
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:44,240
Well, JJ wrote a little Rust program called a steganosaurus that does a lot of cool things

1078
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:46,480
in the steganography world.

1079
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,680
So check it out.

1080
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,640
Well done, JJ.

1081
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,200
That's great.

1082
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,040
We'll put a link to that in the show notes.

1083
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:51,920
I love it.

1084
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,120
What a great project, too.

1085
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,880
He writes in there and helped him ignore some exams, which he did get through.

1086
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,480
He did finish the exams, which that also is important.

1087
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,760
Just remember that we get together every single Sunday to do the show live.

1088
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,800
We started usually around noon Pacific, 3 p.m.

1089
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:12,160
Eastern, usually a little bit earlier over at Jupiter Tube, Jupiter Dot Tube.

1090
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,840
And don't miss Linux action news.

1091
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:14,640
No, do not.

1092
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,920
Companion piece.

1093
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,400
Stuff going on every week in the world of Linux and open source.

1094
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,120
You know where it goes?

1095
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,880
LinuxActionNews.com.

1096
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,000
Yeah, exactly.

1097
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,240
I think, you know, there's an RSS feed you can use, too.

1098
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:24,560
Huh?

1099
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,400
Yeah, one of those newfangled technologies.

1100
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:27,760
Sorry, sorry about the XML.

1101
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,280
There's a JSON one, too.

1102
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,520
You know, you could build some stuff on top of that RSS.

1103
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,240
You know, if you think about it, you could build some stuff.

1104
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,040
See you next week.

1105
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,840
Same bad time, same bad station.

1106
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,280
And of course, links to what we talked about today are over at our website,

1107
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,320
LinuxUnplugged.com slash 461, right?

1108
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:44,960
That's right.

1109
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,640
How that happened, I don't know.

1110
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,360
Does that mean we're now closer to 500?

1111
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,640
That can't be, because we just did the beer thing.

1112
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,760
So that can't be right.

1113
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:54,560
That can't be right.

1114
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,080
We're going to have to brew a cider this time?

1115
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,040
That's not bad, Wes.

1116
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,720
We should just be doing that anyways.

1117
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,400
I'm surprised we're not brewing a cider right now.

1118
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,320
That's how we get Brent to come back to the studio.

1119
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:03,920
All right.

1120
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,440
Well, thanks so much for joining us this week.

1121
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,000
Yeah, I'm only going to take some if it's a hoppy cider.

1122
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,640
All right.

1123
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:08,960
All right.

1124
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:09,760
We can make one of those.

1125
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,480
Be sure to join us next week at LinuxUnplugged.com slash subscribe for the feed.

1126
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,280
Thanks so much.

1127
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:45,040
And see you then.

1128
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:59,200
So we got some propane for the grillskis.

1129
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,000
What?

1130
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,160
So and I got some Costco beef dogs.

1131
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:02,480
That's...

1132
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,240
You're inspired, sir.

1133
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,120
Mm-hmm.

1134
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:05,600
Mm-hmm.

1135
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,440
You going to take care of yourself after this, Brent?

1136
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:08,320
I always do.

1137
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,680
You got some work to do over there.

1138
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,880
More zipper updates to fix.

1139
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,680
I feel like things are slowly falling apart, but yeah, yeah, yeah.

1140
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,280
We'll fix them all.

1141
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,560
I think it'll be OK.

1142
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,200
That's better, right?

1143
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,360
That's better than things quickly falling apart.

1144
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:19,840
Yeah, you're right.

1145
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,480
You can at least see it happening and you can do something about it.

1146
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,640
Pretend that you can do something about it.

1147
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,120
At least you have some hope that you might someday finish all of them.

1148
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,000
Right, right.

1149
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,480
Yeah.

1150
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,360
I feel like you just had a...

1151
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,120
You just made like a really deep metaphor for life when you were talking about his laptop

1152
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:33,600
