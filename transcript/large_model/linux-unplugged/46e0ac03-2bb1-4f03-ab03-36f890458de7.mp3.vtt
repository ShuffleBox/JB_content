This is Linux Unplugged Episode 31 for March 11th, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:43.000
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's doing everything it can to switch every single user to Linux.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
My name is Chris.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
My name is Matt.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Hey there, Matt. Welcome to Episode 31, buddy.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
This week, I want to talk a little bit about something you wrote a great piece on DataMation about,

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
and that is, are Ubuntu haters pushing away Linux switchers, potential Linux switchers?

00:58.000 --> 01:04.000
Are those people scaring away people that are looking into Linux with a lot of hate and things like that?

01:04.000 --> 01:09.000
And I recall from when I switched to Arch, I ran into a lot of that.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
Did you experience that, Matt, during our Arch challenge?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
Oh yeah, definitely.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
A lot of like, do it this way, don't do it that way.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Yeah, I like to call it Arch think.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
I think it was basically they had a pattern of thought that worked for them,

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
and they expect you to adhere to that pattern of thought or screw you.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
Yeah, and if you don't do it that way, there's something wrong with you.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
Yeah, I mean, it's gotten a little better over time, but it's still there.

01:29.000 --> 01:34.000
But I think in the context of Arch, I think that's given the community a little bit of a bad rep in some sense,

01:34.000 --> 01:36.000
is that particular kind of behavior.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
And I think kind of this point in the Linux community, Ubuntu haters,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
drinking the Ubuntu Hater Aid is kind of like it's world famous now.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Everybody's in on it. Everybody knows an Ubuntu hater.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
A lot of us are Ubuntu haters.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
I'm pretty neutral. I know Matt's pretty neutral, too.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
But you do have to think about it in the context of people's first impressions

01:54.000 --> 01:57.000
and how that sort of forms their opinion about the Linux community.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
And I think that's going to be interesting in sort of the shadow of this Sunday's laughs.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
Here we are a year after the announcement of Mir.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
And we're going to break down some of the things that have made people kind of upset with Canonical,

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
and I think Mir is one of them.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
So I think it's a perfect time to talk about this in light of that.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
But first, Matt, it is tradition to start with the feedback.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
And we got a lot of feedback last week about replacing Exchange.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
We've been talking about what's preventing people from switching to Linux from a technical standpoint, right?

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
Collaboration software, AutoCAD.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Big one.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.000
Yeah, games, just general education about the existence of Linux and the options there.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
There's been a lot of things, ease of use, that we've covered on this show

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
that we think are preventing people from switching to Linux.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.000
The groupware thing has definitely been one of them.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
So this couple of emails we're going to do will sort of wrap up that discussion

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
around the technical stuff, and this week we'll sort of kick off the discussion

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
around the community stuff, the people stuff.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
So we'll start with an email from Dwayne.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
He wrote into the show responding to the whole groupware thing.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
He says, hi there, Chris and Matt.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Well, hi, Dwayne.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Good to talk to you.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
He said, I listened to Linux Unplugged and I heard you mention Colab and Zimbra

03:07.000 --> 03:10.000
as possible solutions for your office.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
While you're at it, check out Univention.

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
It's meant to be an open source replacement for folks who don't want to use Microsoft software solutions

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
to start with or are moving away from them.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
He says, thanks again for the sweet show.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
I use BitTorrent to get all the shows.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
Can't risk missing any of them.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
And he includes a link to Univention.

03:27.000 --> 03:33.000
It's univention.com, and they have a small business edition,

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
and it's sort of like a drop-in exchange replacement.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Oh, I like that.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Especially if it is truly drop-in and you can just kind of slide into that.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
That's fantastic.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Now, I think he's using Thunderbird as his front end.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
We heard from a few folks that sent in different stuff,

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
but this was kind of a popular one.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
Another one on the topic of the exchange replacement, Kevin writes, and he says,

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Hey, Chris and Matt, you asked what people did for email contacts and calendars,

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
so I figured I'd share my open system with you.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
Basically, I use IMAP, Cal Dev, and Card Dev to access my mail contacts, etc.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
I originally used Google for all of the above,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
but migrated away as they shut down Cal Dev and Card Dev support.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
He says, I still use them for my email, though.

04:15.000 --> 04:20.000
Now, the other two reside on my local own cloud server.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.000
This is great because I'm using only open standards,

04:23.000 --> 04:26.000
and everything stays in sync across my laptop, desktop, and phone.

04:26.000 --> 04:32.000
Also, because of the protocols I use, it is easy to migrate between services

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
if I decide I don't like them for whatever reason.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.000
Now, no need to change applications or workflow, just change the host.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
For clients, I use Thunderbird on my computers,

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
and my apps on my Android provide Card Dev and Cal Dev backends for Android Sync,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
allowing it to work with all apps.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
I use the Gmail app on Android, that's the only non-free part of this setup,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
but I also have used K9 in the past.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
Cheers, Kevin.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
This is interesting.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.000
It's not a full solution because he still uses Gmail for his email part.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
True, true.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
But I know open cloud is a popular solution for this.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
I think it's an interesting approach.

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
I mean, if he's able to make it work, and he's able to make it work for him,

05:11.000 --> 05:15.000
as he builds his stuff out, it's still working for him, then I think he has a winner.

05:15.000 --> 05:21.000
I do dig his point about how because he's using IMAP and Cal Dev and Card Dev,

05:21.000 --> 05:27.000
the backend is really sort of just an implementation detail,

05:27.000 --> 05:30.000
and he can swap that out to another system if he decides for some reason

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
that own cloud isn't doing the business for him anymore.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
That's a great point.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
That's actually an excellent point.

05:35.000 --> 05:38.000
Didn't own cloud just have an update like today?

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
I believe so.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Let's go check.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.000
I think, I'm not sure, but I think own cloud 6 just shipped today.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
I have to go over to owncloud.org and take a look.

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
But I've been considering using something like own cloud.

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
There's a few other alternatives that I want to review soon on the Linux Action Show

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
that look like they're really good systems.

05:58.000 --> 06:04.000
So I'm thinking about maybe doing a couple of like a roundup of like the one I really like,

06:04.000 --> 06:06.000
and then maybe I'll even deploy to the new studio.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
That's kind of the goal I'm shooting for.

06:09.000 --> 06:14.000
That would be awesome to have this totally, because it's not starting out completely fresh,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
but it kind of is because it's at a new locale.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
You can actually start everything the way you wanted it from the get-go.

06:19.000 --> 06:23.000
The own cloud site isn't loading right now, so I don't know if they had it.

06:23.000 --> 06:27.000
Maybe that's a sign that they did have an update because right now I'm just getting a blank page

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
and it's just waiting for owncloud.org.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
But I think version 6, I want to say version 6 came out today.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Maybe the chat room knows. They can let us know.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
All right, Matt.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Well, let's see. We'll give that own cloud site a second to load here,

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
and I'll say thanks to one of our sponsors this week, and that is ting.com.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.000
Get started by being proud and going to linux.ting.com.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
That's right. Represent.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.000
You got to go shout it out, you guys, linux.ting.com.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
What is Ting?

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Well, I'll tell you what Ting is. Ting is no BS mobile service.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
It's simple. It's straightforward. It's mobile. It makes sense. No contract.

06:59.000 --> 07:03.000
You only pay for what you use, flat $6 per line plus taxes.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
And then it's just your usage on top of that.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
Ting takes your minutes, your messages, your megabytes.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
They add it all up. Whatever bucket you fall into at the end of the month,

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
that's what you pay.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Every Ting plan includes hotspot and tethering.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
For me, this is so awesome because right now as we're setting up the studio,

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
there's no internet there.

07:17.000 --> 07:20.000
And it is so weird to be in a building for hours at a time

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
and not have internet access.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
I'll just be honest with you. You can't do it.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
It hurts on the inside.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
So what's so great about Ting is if I want hotspot or tethering,

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
let me just check the box on Android.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
That feature that Google built in for a reason?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Yeah, you just check that box. No special plan.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
I don't get in trouble for not having a data plan.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
I don't have to have a family share, whatever.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
It's just part of my data usage.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
And Ting makes it super easy to monitor where my data usage is at

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
with their awesome intuitive control panel.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
I can go in there and manage all of my devices,

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
disable, enable, activate devices, set up alerting,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.000
set up call forwarding or voicemail options.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
You can really take control of your Ting account

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
and ultimately your own bill.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
It's very straightforward, plain language billing.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
When you see that bill, you know exactly what's going on.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
There's no surprises.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
They also have companion iOS and Android apps

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
to manage your Ting account right from an app on the device.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
And Ting has no hold customer support.

08:13.000 --> 08:18.000
You can call them between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. or 8 p.m. Eastern

08:18.000 --> 08:21.000
and just call them at 1-855-846-4389

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
and a real person just answers the phone.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
You don't have to go through some sort of call tree or something.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
Well, isn't it great that you can walk into this brand new studio

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
that's still being very much set up?

08:29.000 --> 08:32.000
I mean, it's still in disarray for the most part.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.000
And you have internet out of the box.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
You don't have to worry about it.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.000
Boom, done.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.000
It's super nice.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
It's internet in my pocket and it's actually really great internet.

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
And today, as Ting is announcing,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
if you have a Sprint-compatible iPhone 5,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.000
you can now activate it on Ting.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Or you can grab one if you just want to go get a new one from Ting,

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
whichever you prefer.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
This is great because I know not everybody in our audience

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
is an Android lover.

08:53.000 --> 08:57.000
And the iPhone 5 is a great device for iOS users.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
And now you can use it right there on Ting.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
Or you can buy, they partner, Ting will partner up with Glide

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
and you can go through them to get a used device,

09:06.000 --> 09:07.000
to get it at a great price.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
If you've already got one, you can bring it over.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.000
And if you're in a contract,

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
Ting has an early termination relief program.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
They'll pay up to $75 per line that you had to get canceled.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.000
They'll apply that to your account.

09:17.000 --> 09:22.000
Now, average Ting bill before taxes is like 21 bucks a month per line.

09:22.000 --> 09:26.000
I think mine is about 30, 35 bucks right now.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Yeah, so $75 credit, that gave me quite a ways.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Yeah, definitely.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
I know it.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
Well, and I think you're talking about people that want to use iPhone.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.000
I think it's important to remember that while a lot of us may be Android people,

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
we may have family members that we're bringing onto Ting with us

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
that perhaps would like to use iPhone.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
And we very much do.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Yes.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
And we very much thank Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
Linux.ting.com, you guys.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
Go check it out.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
Just visiting there lets them know that you appreciate them

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
supporting the Linux Unplugged show.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
And plus, it's pretty cool that we got Linux.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Hey, oh, there we go.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
OwnCloud 6, yes.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
The OwnCloud site loaded.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Nice.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
And OwnCloud 6 is out today.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
That's something we're going to have to check out.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
I'll put this on my list for Sunday to do some research on

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
and maybe even download it and check it out.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
I think it's worth checking out.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
Yeah, there have been some reports that there's some bugs in the new features

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
and things like that, but it might be worth looking into.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Yeah, I'll do some digging.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
I'll dig around.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
So if anybody has any experiences, please share those in the

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
linuxactionshow.reddit.com subreddit.

10:22.000 --> 10:27.000
And we'll incorporate all that into our feedback on Sunday.

10:27.000 --> 10:31.000
Okay, so Friar Tuck wrote in Matt, and this is sort of just rounding out

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
our coverage on the technical limitations for people switching to Linux.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
It's the other popular one, AutoCAD.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
He says, Hello, Chris and Matt.

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
I've heard you both mention in passing that lack of AutoCAD solutions

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
is a major drawback to Linux.

10:44.000 --> 10:48.000
Well, I'm a CAD technician who provides IT support in my office as needed.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.000
When I hear your discussions about the enterprise Linux adoption,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.000
I can't help but apply the issues to my own office.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.000
It seems to me that my office could get by fine in the Linux space

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
except for certain engineering-related software,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
mostly Autodesk and Bentley software.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.000
I'd love to see a show dedicated to available CAD solutions under Linux.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
I've heard of Blender, but that seems to be mostly for digital animation applications.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
But what else is out there?

11:12.000 --> 11:15.000
Also, I'm learning about Steam streaming for CAD solutions.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Thanks so much for all the great informative content.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I'm new to Linux in general.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
Oh, that's great.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
My crowning achievement so far has been getting Ubuntu up and running on my old MacBook.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Nice. Good for him.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
LUP has been his gateway. I like that.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
Hey, audience.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
If you guys know of some AutoCAD replacements,

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
I know there's some stuff out there, but this is just not my area.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I don't really know a lot about CAD software

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
outside of really the AutoCAD commercial solution.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Well, and someone that can help us look at the available options and say,

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
Okay, Chris and I, they look the same.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
Really, I can't make heads or tails out of one versus another,

11:49.000 --> 11:52.000
but if someone can help us understand what the benefits of one versus another are,

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
or whether one's more stable, runs better, one's on Java, one's not, whatever it may be.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
Yeah, that's exactly it. Perfectly put.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.000
They all just look the same to me.

12:00.000 --> 12:03.000
It's like, okay, well, I see there's some sort of CAD thing here.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
I can draw stuff. I mean, I don't really know what I'm doing with it.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Yeah.

12:07.000 --> 12:11.000
Do you remember last week, at the end of the episode, we had an email from Scott,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.000
and Scott was a little concerned about the amount of commercial software

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
now coming over to Linux and sort of taking Linux

12:18.000 --> 12:23.000
and sort of perverting it into this closed-off, commercial, money-making platform.

12:23.000 --> 12:27.000
Well, Mark wrote back to reply to Scott, and he said,

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Regarding the discussion about whether we should be happy with proprietary games on Linux,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
here's how I see it.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
And I think Mark nails the way I see it, too.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
He says, My system, utilities, and application software, I want that to be free.

12:39.000 --> 12:43.000
If I'm browsing the web, if I'm editing documents, etc.,

12:43.000 --> 12:48.000
I want the code open to inspection, improvement, forking in case of developing it or going away,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
or maybe the development turning bad.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
But my entertainment, I don't care.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
If I watch a movie, if I've got no interest in having access to the raw footage to make my own cut,

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
I don't have any interest in making my own raw cuts of it.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
If I play a game, same deal.

13:01.000 --> 13:07.000
It's a piece of entertainment that I'm paying for as a complete article.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
If the license allows me to be entertained by it,

13:09.000 --> 13:14.000
and the price is proportionate to the amount of entertainment I get, then that's fine.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
Cheers, Mark.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
That's exactly how I see it.

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
For Steam games, to me, that is not as important as the system utilities

13:24.000 --> 13:27.000
and the day-to-day applications that I have to have to actually work,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
and I need to be able to have trust in.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
For me, it's sort of like buying a movie theater ticket.

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Yeah, I think I'm going to equate that, because it's exactly the movie theater ticket thing.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.000
It's like the rule, you can't bring in your own food and drink.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
That doesn't feel very open, does it?

13:42.000 --> 13:47.000
But at the end of the day, if you think about it, we're choosing to go there to do this.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
We could very well wait for it to come to the Blu-ray.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
That's fine, or however we may get it.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
But the point of the thing is that that's exactly it.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
The fact that the movie is available for us for our entertainment,

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
it's not a critical piece of our life.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
It's not a critical piece of our job or our ability to do stuff at home.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Yeah, I would agree with that.

14:07.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah, that's why for me, I kind of have this, meh, not a big deal for games.

14:13.000 --> 14:19.000
But I love the fact that my entire desktop environment is open source.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.000
Our last bit of email this week, Mike writes in, he says,

14:22.000 --> 14:24.000
Hey guys, first of all, thanks for the awesome show.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.000
I listened to Linux Unplugged and Last, and I love it.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
I just thought I'd quickly share with you one of your sponsors,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
pleasantly surprised me today.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
I signed up with Digital Ocean a few weeks back.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
I had heard of them on your show.

14:36.000 --> 14:42.000
Being me, I forgot to use your promo code.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Uh oh.

14:43.000 --> 14:48.000
He said, so anyways, I was able to go back in and edit my order,

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
figuring I'd probably missed out on it, but why not give it a shot anyways.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
He said, I went in there, applied it, and to my surprise,

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
they actually still applied the discount.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
Oh wow.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
Yeah, he says, yeah, when you're in there, there's a promo code field

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
in your account settings, and you can apply the discount.

15:03.000 --> 15:08.000
And he says he's been rocking his Digital Ocean droplet ever since then.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
So why don't I stop right here before we get into the rest of the show

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
and thank Digital Ocean, our second and last sponsor this week,

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
here on Linux Unplugged.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.000
What is Digital Ocean?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Digital Ocean is simple cloud hosting.

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
They're dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
to spin up a cloud server.

15:22.000 --> 15:27.000
Users can create a cloud server in 55 seconds or 44 seconds,

15:27.000 --> 15:28.000
like some of our audience.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.000
I don't think anybody's beat that yet.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
I think 44 is the record.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.000
And pricing plans start at only $5 a month,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.000
which gets you 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
one CPU, and a terabyte, yes, a terabyte of transfer.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
And that's a fixed cost.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Boom, $5.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
You know exactly what you're going to get.

15:44.000 --> 15:48.000
And that's so perfect because it's way more than enough machine

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
to do a ton of the things you want to do,

15:50.000 --> 15:54.000
like host an own cloud 6 installation or a BitTorrent sync installation

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
or a card dev server, whatever it might be.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
That's more than enough.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
I've been running an Archbox up there for months now,

16:00.000 --> 16:02.000
and the performance is outstanding.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Plus DigitalOcean has locations in New York, San Francisco,

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Amsterdam, and now even Singapore.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
They have a simple interface, very intuitive control panel.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Power users can replicate that control panel on a larger scale

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
using the straightforward API.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
And I want you to get it with a $10 credit

16:17.000 --> 16:20.000
so you can try out that $5 box for two months for free.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
And trust me, this is a great way to learn something.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
You will find something to do with this.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
I sure have, and I love it.

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
Just use the promo code LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH, all one word, $10 credit.

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
You can try the $5 machine for two months,

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
and you will really be impressed.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
The clean, easy-to-use control panel is absolutely excellent.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
The Droplet system makes sense.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
If you've ever worked with VirtualBox at all

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
and you understand the concept of snapshots,

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
you're going to totally get this system.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
They make it really easy to back up your box

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
before you make any changes to template off that.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
You can have auto backup and snapshots.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
You can one-click install WordPress

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
or one-click install Ruby on Rails.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
You can deploy an Ubuntu box,

17:01.000 --> 17:05.000
1204 with LAMP or Docker or a Fedora box,

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
whatever it might be, in 55 seconds, too, guys.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
You can do this in just no time.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
If you've only got a couple of hours a day

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
or a week even to experiment with this kind of stuff,

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
this is how you can do it.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
You don't have to set up a whole rig in your house.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
You don't even have to funky around with virtualization software

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
on your own machine.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
For $5 a month, and, heck, with LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH,

17:24.000 --> 17:26.000
we're going to get you two months,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
you can just play around, get a machine up there,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
make a snapshot of it before you try something cray-cray,

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
and if it barks it, just revert back from that snapshot.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
It's like being able to run your own Linux server

17:37.000 --> 17:40.000
with training wheels, and nothing's going to go wrong.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
And that's what makes it great for production as well,

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
because if you ever have something up in production

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
on DigitalOcean, why wouldn't you?

17:46.000 --> 17:49.000
They have tier one bandwidth, those SSD hard drives scream,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
the KVM virtualization is awesome, we all know that,

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
and it's backed by amazing hardware.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
So why wouldn't you throw it into production?

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
And now you have that safety net.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
If something goes wrong on your production server

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
up in the cloud that you have root access to,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
that runs whatever distribution you want,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
one click and you're back up and running.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
And you can try it all for two months for free,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
LINUXUNPLUGGEDMARCH, and a big thank you

18:09.000 --> 18:12.000
to DigitalOcean for sponsoring LINUXUNPLUGGED.

18:12.000 --> 18:15.000
I mean, two months for free, it actually costs you money

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
not to try it at that point.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
And it costs you your soul.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
I'm just saying, okay Matt, before we go on,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
we've got a Valve update real quick.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
We've got to talk a little bit about this,

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
like it's storming the internets right now

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
as we're recording this show.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Valve has announced they're going to solve all of our problems.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
Never fear Linux users, they have released a direct 3D

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
to OpenGL transition layer.

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
Everybody go home, job's done.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
Is that right Wizard, or did I get something wrong there?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Exactly what you think it is.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
It's actually going to be something that you can add

18:47.000 --> 18:50.000
to your actual project after the fact

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
to bring something else up to date.

18:52.000 --> 18:54.000
So it's going to be something like,

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
I can apply to X old game to go and make it

18:58.000 --> 19:00.000
so that I can run it on Linux.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
It's not going to be something that everyone just

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
installs in their repository and it's going to be

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
this magic wine fix that's going to replace for it.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
I was going to say, it almost sounds like wine then.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
No, it's not going to be something that you,

19:11.000 --> 19:15.000
it only goes and translates the DirectX calls

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
to OpenGL calls.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.000
It's like the project itself is called 2GL.

19:20.000 --> 19:25.000
If you want to look at it, it's on GitHub right now

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
under the Valve software.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
That's pretty cool.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Have you been taking a look at it?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
Yes, I have.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.000
It's all written in C++, so it's very readable.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
So this isn't really going to, I mean,

19:37.000 --> 19:40.000
now that you've kind of brought me up to date on it,

19:40.000 --> 19:43.000
it kind of seems like, I guess this is one more,

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
what's that?

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
I kind of find it, it's nice, but it's a little bit overhyped.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Exactly, that's exactly what I was going to say.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
And I was kind of playing to that,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
that whole overhyped aspect of it, but it's neat.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.000
It's neat and I'm glad to see Valve open sourcing software.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Absolutely.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
What was the license?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.000
Is it GPL?

20:00.000 --> 20:01.000
Good question.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
I didn't look.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.000
Oh, okay.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
Yeah, I don't see it right here on their page either,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
but I know they have a license file,

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
so I'll go jump in there.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
I bet you the license file will tell you.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
But all right, well, thanks, Wizard.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
I'll toss you back up to the main room

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
and we'll join the main room too.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.000
I want to kick around something that came out on the web today.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
You guys probably saw this.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.000
Will Wheaton took to Google Plus

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
and made Mark Shuttleworth cry

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
when he announced that he's not crazy

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
about the direction Ubuntu is taking.

20:31.000 --> 20:35.000
In fact, the exact quote that Will Wheaton said was,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
yeah, I'm not crazy about Ubuntu.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
I feel like the entire project has gone in a direction

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
that isn't for me.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Does that mean that Sheldon likes Ubuntu?

20:43.000 --> 20:46.000
Yes, the big bang joke started immediately, yes.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.000
Okay, exactly.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
He went on to say,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
I love just about everything about my MacBook Pro

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
and my iMac,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
so I don't see myself going to Linux full-time again.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
But I really do love being able to explore

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
tons of open source packages

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
and play with different kernel options, desktops,

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
and all those things that I need to do,

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
all those things that I don't need to do,

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
but still have fun doing anyway.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.000
Being a hipster intensifies.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Well, and it's defense.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I've actually, you know, I've met him before,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.000
and I will tell you, he's an old-school Linux guy.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
He's actually waded through it.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
He's slack-weared with the best of them,

21:20.000 --> 21:24.000
but he did kind of evolve into kind of a Mac mindset,

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
if you will, over time.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
So he did his time in Linux.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
It's not like he's some passive guy

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
just coming through and talking smack.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
I think that Linux community's pride

21:33.000 --> 21:37.000
blinds them from seeing the real threat.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
I think maybe we also still see Microsoft as the threat,

21:40.000 --> 21:44.000
but I think the reality is the real competition is Apple.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.000
I think they have compelling hardware that people,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
a lot of people like, not everybody.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
The fact that they can sell so many computers

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
without Ethernet ports blows my mind,

21:53.000 --> 21:56.000
but it's a thing, apparently.

21:56.000 --> 22:00.000
And they offer sort of at least the idea

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
of a turnkey computing solution.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.000
And I think that is, I want to sort of keep that in mind

22:08.000 --> 22:12.000
as we talk about the overall Linux community's abrasiveness

22:12.000 --> 22:16.000
sometimes when it comes to issues that they're passionate about.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
And Matt, you touched on this in an article you wrote

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
for DataMation saying, is Ubuntu animosity misplaced?

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
Kind of from a high level, like, what's the concept here?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Basically, I'm looking at it from this perspective.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
And I always take the Ubuntu perspective for two reasons.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
One, it's what my editor would prefer.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
And secondly, it still covers most of the Linux universe

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
just by default anyway,

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
so it's really a mood issue in that regard.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
But the point is that a lot of people come into Linux,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
and people I introduce to Linux, they go to the forums,

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
they go to these different places,

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
or especially on the social media sites,

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
and they see a lot of real negative behavior.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
I mean, it's really unfortunate.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
The kind of stuff you would expect to see in a Windows forum.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
You know, you like to think you got away from that,

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
but in the Linux space it can be really prevalent

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
for a lot of people to turn off.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
But also going deeper than that, I feel like that,

23:00.000 --> 23:02.000
so what got these people to that mindset in the first place?

23:02.000 --> 23:05.000
And a lot of it does come down to Unity,

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
other aspects of Ubuntu as well.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
I mean, just really nailed it on the list.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
You did a good job.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
You said Ubuntu simply needed to give Unity more time

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
and development before releasing it.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.000
Because of that, it got a big backlash from the community.

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
Simply put, you said,

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
I believe some folks within the Linux community

23:18.000 --> 23:22.000
felt like Ubuntu was isolating itself with this move to Unity.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.000
I think that's probably a fair point.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
That caused some hurt feelings,

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
or maybe hurt feelings is the right way to put it,

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
but it caused people to take sides.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
And then you said, down the road,

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
you had the Mir versus Whalen debacle,

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
which we're very familiar with.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
When it was first announced,

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Mir was to be Ubuntu's choice for Xorg's replacement.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
Once again, the Linux community sounded off.

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
At the time, I took a stance on the matter that explaining,

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
I took a stance on the matter explaining

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
that if Mir didn't get at least one additional distro

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
to use it as a display option,

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
I would wear a monkey suit for the masses,

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
unless, well, it's 12 months later,

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
and I've lost the bet,

23:58.000 --> 24:01.000
I'm prepared to pay the price initially agreed upon.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.000
Now for the bitter pill.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
You don't want to hear.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
The casual computer user couldn't care less about the issue.

24:07.000 --> 24:10.000
So long as the applications work as expected,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
I suspect we'll be seeing shrugs of indifference

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
throughout the Ubuntu masses.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
No, I see this as a battle of wills

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
between developers and their opposing views,

24:18.000 --> 24:20.000
and I think you nailed it there.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.000
Yep.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
And I think if you look at Will Wheaton, what he just said,

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
he couldn't give two craps about Whalen versus Mir.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
And he also defeats the thing

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
that it's only new users that don't care.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
He is not a new user by any stretch.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
That's a great point.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
So I think this is something we've got to appreciate

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
is people, you know, as their lives get busy,

24:37.000 --> 24:40.000
just because they might not be,

24:40.000 --> 24:41.000
they might be technical people,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
but they might just decide that they don't have time for drama

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
or they don't have time to follow this kind of stuff.

24:45.000 --> 24:48.000
And that can be a whole off-putting thing in itself.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.000
And you say the back and forth was perhaps even more heated

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
than we'd seen than the Unity versus Gnome challenges in the past.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
Like the Mir versus Whalen thing was,

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
like every time they've had something,

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
that event has been more hotly contentious than the one before it.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
That's true.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
And it seems to be like the animosity is building on itself

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
and building on itself,

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
and it's like this snowball that just keeps rolling.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
And then, of course, we get into the whole Upstart

25:10.000 --> 25:12.000
versus system de-discussion,

25:12.000 --> 25:15.000
which, you know, Canonical and Ubuntu weren't directly involved in,

25:15.000 --> 25:18.000
but you say unlike the Unity versus Mir debate,

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
Upstart got the attention of a fresh new crop of Linux users

25:21.000 --> 25:26.000
as it directly affected how a Linux distro starts and stops events and services.

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
So even if you're not a system admin or a developer,

25:29.000 --> 25:32.000
this affected anyone who uses Linux on a day-to-day basis.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.000
Definitely.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
And I noticed a lot of people that normally wouldn't care

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
one way or the other about desktop environments or whatnot

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
because they just use something else.

25:38.000 --> 25:41.000
This affected them more so because it was under the hood.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
It's going to change how they do things.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
And you said, of course, the CLA at its core,

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
the CLA is perceived as a barrier among many developers within the Linux community.

25:49.000 --> 25:54.000
You mentioned Linus Torvalds expressed his displeasure with all CLAs in all forms.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
And, you know, that's been a real concern for some developers.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
And you mentioned in your closing thoughts that the Linux community

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
is passionate, involved, and sometimes overtly loud

26:04.000 --> 26:08.000
when it comes to the direction the platform is headed in.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
That you say, while users such as myself try hard to remain neutral

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
and not act as though using our computers is a religious experience,

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
the community at large continues to make their voices heard no matter the cost.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Now, what do you think that cost is?

26:21.000 --> 26:28.000
I think a lot of times the cost is that we create unnecessary contention between each other.

26:28.000 --> 26:32.000
I think a lot of times that we become so focused on stupid stuff

26:32.000 --> 26:36.000
that we really lose focus of what's going on in other areas.

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
For example, let's look at the Chromebooks and how Chrome's doing its thing

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
and these things are selling really well and whatnot.

26:41.000 --> 26:45.000
Rather than focusing on outdoing Apple, outdoing Google, outdoing other stuff,

26:45.000 --> 26:49.000
I feel like we focus on our internal squabbles so much

26:49.000 --> 26:53.000
that it really not only doesn't solve anything,

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
it just makes us dig deeper into our own personal camps,

26:55.000 --> 26:58.000
but we ignore bigger issues.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
I'm not sure if you're thinking about it right,

27:01.000 --> 27:04.000
because there's a lot of things that are huge deals,

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
like what side of the window is the close button on?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
Oh my God, I know.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I'm guilty of this.

27:11.000 --> 27:14.000
I used to bitch constantly about the lack of a minimize button,

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
and no, I made a big stink about it.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
I went on and on and on about it.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
No one cares.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
It was my problem, not yours.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
So it's like, why would anyone care?

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
But I'm guilty of this as well.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
I'm just as bad as the other guy.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
Riley, what are your thoughts on the Unity hate?

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
Well, here's the thing about Unity too.

27:33.000 --> 27:39.000
There's a large user base who would actually use Unity on other distros if they could.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.000
Sure.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
People would use Unity on Arch if they could,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
but since they can't, they just hate on it.

27:44.000 --> 27:50.000
I actually think Unity is maybe the ultimate example of stuff that we argue about

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
that actual users don't care about, because here's the thing.

27:55.000 --> 27:59.000
Even if Unity was, quote, unquote, the most terrible desktop in the history ever,

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
it doesn't matter.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.000
If you are even slightly Linux technically inclined,

28:03.000 --> 28:05.000
you know how to use a different desktop.

28:05.000 --> 28:09.000
And if you're a new user to Linux, you really probably have no problem with Unity,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
because truth be told, it's not that bad,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
especially if you don't come in with preconceptions.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
No.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.000
Go ahead.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.000
It honestly isn't that bad.

28:16.000 --> 28:21.000
It's a very pretty desktop, especially if you've used it 12.04 forward.

28:21.000 --> 28:24.000
It's actually halfway stable.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.000
I don't care what you think.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.000
Unless you haven't got to the point where it's valuable.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
I think it's something that general users just don't even know they should be caring about.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
And Ick, you think somehow maybe user choice plays into all of this?

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Yes, absolutely.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.000
Here's the thing.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.000
We keep talking about over and over again,

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Linux is about freedom and choice,

28:43.000 --> 28:47.000
and it's something that I wrote actually on the subreddit.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
When it comes to desktop environment,

28:49.000 --> 28:52.000
use whatever you like the best and works best for you.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
Don't let anyone talk you into something else just because they like it more,

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
or have some other agenda.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Good advice.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Yeah.

29:00.000 --> 29:03.000
Rodden Corpse, you switched your mom over to a Unity desktop?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
I did.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
How'd it go?

29:05.000 --> 29:07.000
She's been using it for about two years now.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.000
She likes it, I guess?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
Yeah, she has no problem with it.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.000
The thing is I was using it at this time because I was testing it out,

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
and I wanted to kind of like have her opinion on it.

29:17.000 --> 29:21.000
And because she's a completely – she doesn't really care at all.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
All of the DEs and stuff like that is irrelevant to her.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
It doesn't matter.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
So when I look at Unity, I find the little flaws and stuff that I don't like,

29:29.000 --> 29:30.000
and a few things that I do.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
Like the dash, I don't like it almost at all.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
But I asked her what she thinks about the dash.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
She's like, what's that?

29:37.000 --> 29:38.000
And I explained it.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.000
She's like, yeah, I don't care.

29:39.000 --> 29:40.000
Yeah, exactly.

29:40.000 --> 29:45.000
Well, see, I've had – so I had my dad running an older version of Ubuntu with Unity,

29:45.000 --> 29:46.000
and he really liked it.

29:46.000 --> 29:50.000
He was coming from – it was either XP or 7.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.000
It was before Windows 8, and he was switching over,

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
and he ran Ubuntu for a little while.

29:55.000 --> 29:59.000
And what he ran into is kind of what you touch on here, Matt,

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
is you say – and sort of closing out your article,

30:01.000 --> 30:05.000
you say my concern is that newer users who have just come over to the Linux side of the fence

30:05.000 --> 30:10.000
will be scared away by some enthusiasts and their misplaced animosity towards Ubuntu.

30:10.000 --> 30:14.000
Will this color how the majority of newcomers see the Linux community?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.000
It did for my dad.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
Yeah, and I've seen evidence of it.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
I don't just – I actually have people that I talk to about this stuff before I write this stuff.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
Yeah, he saw – so he had two problems, I think.

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
First problem was is he wasn't really clear on where he was supposed to go to look up problems.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
So he wanted to – he moved at one point, and they didn't have internet access.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.000
They didn't have like cable or DSL where he'd moved to,

30:38.000 --> 30:41.000
and so he wanted to tether to his phone.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.000
And like trying to look up, and he was at work and trying to do like the Googling at work

30:46.000 --> 30:50.000
and then bring that home, he got so many different results

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
and so many different mixed messages on that whole thing that it –

30:54.000 --> 30:56.000
and I don't – I wouldn't blame it all on this,

30:56.000 --> 31:00.000
but I think it definitely – when it came time to buy a new rig altogether,

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
he just kind of decided to go get a Mac.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
Yeah, oh, yeah, because it's an all-inclusive experience.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
And as much as I'm not in any way a Mac person, believe me, I really don't like them,

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
at the end of the day, they don't sell a computer.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
They sell a collective experience.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.000
Yeah, yeah.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
They really do.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
And, you know, they have the whole genius angle to it, too,

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
so he was able to ask the guys some questions.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
And I – so this article, you wrote, really resonated with me here

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
because not only did I see that through my dad's experience,

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
but when we were taking the Arch challenge,

31:30.000 --> 31:34.000
there was equal parts really good advice that I got from, you know,

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
some awesome people on our subreddit and things like that,

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
and there was equal parts really like hostile bad advice that I got,

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
everything from trying to scare me away from using Arch

31:44.000 --> 31:48.000
and telling me how hard it is to use and how I really have to keep the system maintained,

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
and it turns out to be like the easiest Linux box I've ever had to maintain.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.000
That it would be unstable because you're using bleeding edge.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.000
Yeah, that was another one.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.000
Yep, yep.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
And, you know, don't use this tool, use that tool.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.000
And it's – and I suspect this happened for you, too,

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
but it gave me pause for a little bit where I thought,

32:04.000 --> 32:06.000
I don't think I want to deal with this.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.000
Right.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.000
And I don't like this.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.000
This is – I don't need this.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.000
You know, and it's even more nuanced than it is in Arch

32:12.000 --> 32:16.000
because in Arch, there's multiple ways to install a piece of software.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Where like in Ubuntu, like pretty much at the end of the day,

32:18.000 --> 32:20.000
every guide is going to tell you sudo apt-get install, right?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Add this PPA.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
Like there's consistencies, so you can get a lot of different –

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
you get a lot of different information,

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
but they all kind of tell you to use the same tools and do the same things.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Not the same thing in Arch.

32:29.000 --> 32:32.000
Now, thankfully, that Wiki is very authoritative and has a lot of good info,

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
but when you're just switching, I felt like I had a lot of mixed messages.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
And I can – so I think that experience might be what a lot of new people get

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
when like, you know, they're reading a common thread

32:43.000 --> 32:46.000
and there's just tons of Ubuntu hate in that common thread.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.000
I would agree.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.000
And what you said about the Wiki,

32:48.000 --> 32:51.000
the problem with the Wiki is that it's too good.

32:51.000 --> 32:55.000
And what I mean by that is that the information in the Wiki blows other distributions

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
out of the water as far as accuracy,

32:57.000 --> 33:00.000
but the problem is locating and knowing what to search for to find it.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
That's the rub for a lot of people because you don't always know.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
Like when I was trying to figure out the whole battery life for, you know,

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
the battery life situation for my network,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
I wasn't necessarily finding exactly what I was looking for

33:10.000 --> 33:13.000
until about the third or fourth search and then I clicked.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.000
And the information was fantastic, but it was finding it.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.000
So I think if they can hone that a little bit, the information is gold.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000
There's no problem there.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.000
Some people actually suggest people to look at the Arch Wiki to find the information,

33:24.000 --> 33:28.000
which is a good idea, but they'll also suggest to people who are not using Arch,

33:28.000 --> 33:30.000
which is very awkward.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.000
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

33:31.000 --> 33:35.000
Ryan, you were going to say it kind of depends on the existence of users of Linux

33:35.000 --> 33:38.000
to make regular user experiences a little more easier.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
Right.

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
I was basically just going to say that when people talk about moving people to Linux,

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
they always think about, you know, telling the advocate why Linux is good

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
and why they should use it.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
But they don't necessarily make that transition easy.

33:53.000 --> 33:57.000
Like for example, with my mom or my roommate or my neighbor I've moved over,

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
I set up their computer.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
I find out what they want.

34:01.000 --> 34:04.000
I put the Linux thing that I think fits best for them, the disk drumming,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.000
and then I put on the different apps that they want.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
Like for one of them wanted Wow, so I had to put Wine in, so then I put Wow Connection.

34:10.000 --> 34:17.000
And if you give them Linux setup where they can have it just the stuff they want to use

34:17.000 --> 34:21.000
and the things that they would be used to, like the way they get Windows

34:21.000 --> 34:24.000
when it's already installed, if you do that for them, the transition to Linux

34:24.000 --> 34:28.000
is almost negligible in as far as like whether it's hard or not.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.000
That's true.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.000
That's true.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
I used to support Linux at a small bookstore in a town north of me,

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
and I actually – the service calls were – well, they went from a ton of them to none

34:38.000 --> 34:40.000
as long as I maintained the machine.

34:40.000 --> 34:46.000
Yeah, I definitely noticed during – I used to joke when my clients would ask me,

34:46.000 --> 34:49.000
so what should we do here for this desktop?

34:49.000 --> 34:55.000
And I would tell them – I would say thankfully a lot of my clients use Windows.

34:55.000 --> 34:59.000
I'm very thankful for that because it gives me ten times the amount of business

34:59.000 --> 35:02.000
that I would have if they ran Linux.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.000
And that's not just me guessing.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
That's like literally from my experience.

35:06.000 --> 35:09.000
Like I can put Linux in, and once things are set up and stabilized,

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
like Rotten Corps is saying, I would go in there,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
and I would configure everything for them, right?

35:14.000 --> 35:17.000
And I would even set it up so it would take snapshots of their configuration settings

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
and all of that kind of stuff and back those up,

35:19.000 --> 35:22.000
and we could restore them very simply.

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
And Webman was a great tool to help some of their local tech gal set up users

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
and stuff like that.

35:29.000 --> 35:34.000
And that worked so well that I would literally lose money on those clients.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.000
Exactly.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.000
When I switched to Linux full-time is about the time I got out of repair.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.000
I don't know.

35:39.000 --> 35:42.000
Ick was going to say our problem here is that we've been conditioned by Microsoft.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
What's going on there, Ick?

35:44.000 --> 35:48.000
Well, let me just go ahead and set the way back machine to like 1995

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
when Windows 95 first came out.

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
People were up in arms that their programs were not right there in front of them

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
like they had on the program manager of Windows 3.1.

35:57.000 --> 36:03.000
Now fast forward 19 years later, now everybody is looking for that start menu.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
If they don't see that start menu, they are up in arms.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.000
It's just like, okay, now Microsoft has conditioned us to operate this way.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
And see, that's the thing.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
People are assuming that a desktop environment such as Unity is unintuitive

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
just because they're not used to it.

36:20.000 --> 36:21.000
I suppose.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
That's the ding you get.

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
Give them the ding.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
That man has earned a ding.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.000
All right.

36:28.000 --> 36:29.000
Well, here you go.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.000
There you go.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
You get a ding.

36:31.000 --> 36:36.000
Are you going to say that maybe we just need to cater to each specific user?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
That's your go, man.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
That's your go right there.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.000
No?

36:39.000 --> 36:40.000
Well, that's what I think he's going to essentially say.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.000
I don't know.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.000
He has a little bit of lag, by the way.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.000
Oh, okay.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Yeah, it's complicated.

36:44.000 --> 36:48.000
No, what I was simply going to say is every user has their own sensibility

36:48.000 --> 36:50.000
of how a desktop should and should not be.

36:50.000 --> 36:55.000
I mean, you have people who use Windows 8 perfectly with and without touch.

36:55.000 --> 36:58.000
And you have people who see the Macintosh interface

36:58.000 --> 37:00.000
and see that's the perfect desktop.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.000
They can't use anything else regardless of, you know, whatever it is.

37:04.000 --> 37:08.000
So every user has their own sensibility of what a desktop should be

37:08.000 --> 37:10.000
and what their workflow should be.

37:10.000 --> 37:14.000
So while we're arguing about what the perfect one is,

37:14.000 --> 37:20.000
we're thinking of a hypothetical magical user that doesn't really exist.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.000
That's true.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.000
Exactly.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.000
That's very true.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.000
Exactly.

37:24.000 --> 37:27.000
That's what I'm kind of driving at is that intuitiveness is subjective.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.000
Yeah.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
True.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
So this goes going back to Apple is the big threat here.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.000
I think the thing about Mac OS that you've got to wrap your head around

37:36.000 --> 37:40.000
is that it's not a great desktop in a lot of ways.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
Like when I use it for, you know, I have several machines here in the studio.

37:43.000 --> 37:47.000
And, you know, to me it feels very old.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
It feels like I can, you know, I remember the Macs from the 80s

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
and I still see a lot of influence there.

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
And I don't think it's that amazing of a desktop.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
I think it's what Matt's saying is that with Apple it's this hardware,

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
good enough software, better than the alternative, which is Windows,

38:06.000 --> 38:09.000
and that support package.

38:09.000 --> 38:13.000
And I think when you're somebody like Will Wheaton and that price isn't a factor,

38:13.000 --> 38:16.000
because that's I'd say the number one argument,

38:16.000 --> 38:19.000
once you take out all the freedom and the open arguments,

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
which if you don't even know to be concerned about that,

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
that's not even part of the equation, right?

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
If you take away that and you take away the cost barrier,

38:27.000 --> 38:31.000
because for a huge segment of people that's not going to be an issue,

38:31.000 --> 38:34.000
I think Apple is a fierce competitor to Linux.

38:34.000 --> 38:38.000
I think it's much more of a threat on the desktop than Windows is.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Well, it is, especially for someone coming from Linux,

38:40.000 --> 38:43.000
because they can drop down to a command line and do anything they need to do.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
I mean, that's the other thing.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
Like look at Miguel Ytikaza, you know, one of the original GNOME developers

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
who eventually just threw his arms up in the air and said,

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
you know what, I'm going to go get a MacBook.

38:51.000 --> 38:54.000
But you could sort of get that equivalent on Linux easily

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
if you go with something like Ubuntu and System76.

38:57.000 --> 39:00.000
I mean, they have excellent customer support,

39:00.000 --> 39:05.000
magnificent hardware on top of generally they ship on what like LTSs.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.000
I think this is an important piece.

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
This is why I'm a System76 fan,

39:10.000 --> 39:15.000
is because they are also creating that entire end-to-end experience.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
But the problem is we don't have enough people doing that,

39:19.000 --> 39:24.000
whereas Apple has this massively established presence and brand.

39:24.000 --> 39:29.000
And we do our part just to spread the word about System76,

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
because I think it's really important.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
I think that whole entire product package is super important.

39:34.000 --> 39:40.000
And I think one way we can achieve that today is in larger installations,

39:40.000 --> 39:44.000
like at schools and at businesses where you have a person that comes in

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
and rolls out a system for a whole bunch of people.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
That seems so ripe for the Linux desktop picking to me.

39:50.000 --> 39:51.000
It's ridiculous.

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
It's just maybe a few software applications, but that just seems so ripe.

39:55.000 --> 40:01.000
Whereas that home user who's a 30-something hipster

40:01.000 --> 40:05.000
that just wants to go down to the mall and buy a metal MacBook,

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
I don't know if we're going to be able to get that person.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
But I think schools and businesses,

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
and any time where you can take the experience

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
and you can build it around the need,

40:14.000 --> 40:17.000
I think Linux is such a slam dunk for that.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
Well, that's sort of already happening now.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
We see Chromebooks and Chrome OS,

40:21.000 --> 40:27.000
which is technically Linux-based in educational areas all the time now.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.000
It's becoming increasingly popular.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
That just makes me sad.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
So I think the formula to making this work

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
is the fact that it takes a multinational company to make this happen.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.000
Right.

40:37.000 --> 40:45.000
It boils down to the same thing that Matt has said a bunch of times,

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
and that is marketing.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.000
Yeah.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.000
Mac stuff, the software, is okay,

40:51.000 --> 40:55.000
and it's built on stuff that was already good in the first place.

40:55.000 --> 41:00.000
So if you took LXDE, put a dock on it, it's very close to the way Mac works.

41:00.000 --> 41:05.000
Or like GNOME 3, or if you spend a couple of hours configuring KDE, right?

41:05.000 --> 41:06.000
Yeah.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
I really believe you can have a more modern,

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
experienced desktop that has better efficiencies.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
In some ways, especially I think for GNOME 3, it can be more user-friendly.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
I agree.

41:19.000 --> 41:23.000
This is such a problem that I just kind of want to –

41:23.000 --> 41:27.000
and I guess I want to bring this back to how the community can make a difference here.

41:27.000 --> 41:31.000
We're not going to convince everybody to lay down arms

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
and embrace each other in a kumbaya, but –

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
I have an idea.

41:35.000 --> 41:38.000
What if the GNU project –

41:38.000 --> 41:41.000
because they always want Linux to be called GNU-slash-Linux –

41:41.000 --> 41:46.000
they put up money for marketing to make it GNU-slash-Linux?

41:46.000 --> 41:50.000
I don't know. I think it's close. I think it's close.

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
Get a GNU start with GNU-slash-Linux.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
Well, here's an actionable formula of how this could actually be done.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
First of all, you get yourself a Kickstarter project,

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
or however you want to fund it,

42:01.000 --> 42:05.000
which is sort of a collective funding process that gets a bunch of advertising dollars together.

42:05.000 --> 42:11.000
Then everybody in key metro cities goes to the Google AdWords program

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
that allows you to advertise on your local cable channels.

42:13.000 --> 42:17.000
Take a Fiverr voiceover of one of those really good movie voices.

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
Slap together some great video capture from OpenShot or whatever.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Just really show off what the desktop can do.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
Make it sound like a movie intro.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
Launch those in each one of those metro areas on television.

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Stop this internet crap.

42:29.000 --> 42:33.000
Watch TV where regular people actually get their media, and watch what happens.

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
I think you might just run viruses.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
Isn't this part of the problem, though, is there's no Linux Inc.?

42:39.000 --> 42:47.000
There's no company that needs to capitalize on this opportunity, that could capitalize.

42:47.000 --> 42:50.000
There's individual companies that are all kind of scattered about,

42:50.000 --> 42:54.000
and I think that's one of the reasons Ubuntu has such name recognition

42:54.000 --> 42:56.000
is because there's a company behind that,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
and Red Hat has such name recognition and brand recognition.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
But there's no one company who's got the money and the presence to do that.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.000
So maybe, let me shift the conversation here.

43:06.000 --> 43:10.000
Is this why everybody is so hard over mobile?

43:10.000 --> 43:16.000
Because it's the grand reset of this technical century that we get to start all over again,

43:16.000 --> 43:22.000
and everybody is afresh and new, and the possibilities are endless.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
Is that why everybody's so hot on mobile?

43:25.000 --> 43:33.000
Maybe it's because they have, right now, essentially two platforms that they have to look at only,

43:33.000 --> 43:36.000
and they're so massively widespread now.

43:36.000 --> 43:41.000
Since it's easy for people who are not computer users,

43:41.000 --> 43:45.000
even just regular people who just want a tablet so they can watch something like Netflix or something,

43:45.000 --> 43:48.000
it can bring so many more people to look at your stuff,

43:48.000 --> 43:54.000
so people are just kind of jumping on the bandwagon of any kind of mobile device of all.

43:54.000 --> 44:00.000
It's a lot easier to get mobile devices in the hands of individuals around the world,

44:00.000 --> 44:05.000
and the fact that there's billions of individuals around the world that still don't have a mobile device,

44:05.000 --> 44:08.000
that's a huge user base that a company could target.

44:08.000 --> 44:11.000
Well, like Dave is saying in the chat room, everybody loves a computer in their pocket,

44:11.000 --> 44:14.000
but Wimpy, what kind of tipping point do you think we're at?

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
You say we're at a tipping point right now?

44:16.000 --> 44:28.000
Well, 20 years ago, Apple was in the shitter, and they've really turned their fortunes around.

44:28.000 --> 44:36.000
The two companies that are really driving popularization of cutting-edge technology at the moment are Apple and Google.

44:36.000 --> 44:42.000
I think the tipping point that we're at right now is that Microsoft is on a downward trend.

44:42.000 --> 44:49.000
They're hanging on to traditional markets and really not succeeding in that,

44:49.000 --> 44:55.000
and I think the tipping point we're at is with Apple and iOS and Mac OS X,

44:55.000 --> 44:59.000
and then Google with obviously Android and then Chrome OS,

44:59.000 --> 45:06.000
and I think it will be a battle that's fought out between Mac OS and Linux in the guise of Chrome OS.

45:06.000 --> 45:12.000
Well, I think the big problem with Windows is it's sort of become a tainted name.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.000
I know people who won't buy Windows phones because they think they'll get viruses.

45:16.000 --> 45:20.000
It's a black mark. I agree. I think the Windows name is now a black mark on a product,

45:20.000 --> 45:26.000
and I think the general consumer thinks it's something old, and it's not hip. It's not cool anymore.

45:26.000 --> 45:31.000
I think that's what's holding back a lot of these Windows mobile devices and desktops.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.000
Well, I feel sorry for Microsoft because they can't win. They try and be hip, and then everyone says,

45:36.000 --> 45:41.000
oh, we don't know how to use Metro, and then they try and be like old school and everyone has a go at them

45:41.000 --> 45:45.000
for not being different. It is kind of bad for them.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
They're trying to be hip again.

45:47.000 --> 45:53.000
They're just trying to do it through a bunch of people dancing around holding tablets, and that just doesn't work.

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Clicking them together.

45:55.000 --> 46:01.000
Exactly. I'm always running around my office smacking the monitors together to try and get it to accomplish tasks.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
Really?

46:03.000 --> 46:11.000
That's an interesting concept. The whole idea, is it going to be Macbooks versus Chromebooks in the future?

46:11.000 --> 46:17.000
You'll have everybody who wants to save a buck running Chromebooks, but they'll be inextricably forever linked

46:17.000 --> 46:24.000
at the hip to Google, and you'll have everybody that wants to drop some cash, we're talking large percentages here,

46:24.000 --> 46:31.000
buying Macbooks, and is Linux going to be, is the predominance of Linux going to be this bastardized, closed down,

46:31.000 --> 46:36.000
souped up for their commercial cloud services client side OS?

46:36.000 --> 46:39.000
Wait, wait, wait. You said commercial software.

46:39.000 --> 46:46.000
Would that honestly be so bad? I mean, this is open source.

46:46.000 --> 46:52.000
People can do whatever with it that they choose, and people can implement it the way they want.

46:52.000 --> 46:59.000
And if Linux adoption requires that companies like Google and whoever change it the way they need to,

46:59.000 --> 47:06.000
or the tableization of Linux, would that be so bad? Because isn't that sort of the original idea?

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
It's negative in the freedom dimension.

47:09.000 --> 47:17.000
I don't know. It's not what I hope for. And I think also, we can't really have this conversation without keeping in mind

47:17.000 --> 47:22.000
that Linux will dominate on the server side too, and that's going to be all different kinds of operating systems.

47:22.000 --> 47:28.000
But it does make you wonder what the future holds for these desktop-focused distros,

47:28.000 --> 47:33.000
and if eventually they're not just going to be kind of, you know, just...

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
Outdated.

47:34.000 --> 47:38.000
Yeah, the ones that survive will be the ones that are maintained by community enthusiasts.

47:38.000 --> 47:43.000
I've noticed myself, especially, and I don't know if it's just the point of my life I'm at,

47:43.000 --> 47:49.000
but I see my parents and my grandparents and all these other people around me going and saying,

47:49.000 --> 47:55.000
I don't know what to do anymore. They've always had, you know, go with Windows if you want business,

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
or go with Mac if you want media. And now they don't know where to go.

47:59.000 --> 48:05.000
And it's kind of this weird point where people that once thought they knew what they had to do

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
don't know anything anymore. It's kind of sad.

48:08.000 --> 48:13.000
We're in a weird transition, and I think what we're trying to wrap our brains around on this show is,

48:13.000 --> 48:19.000
what do we need to change to get Linux in position to sort of be there to catch a certain amount of people

48:19.000 --> 48:25.000
who are dropping away from Windows, and are there things just as a community we could do?

48:25.000 --> 48:29.000
And I think we've identified guides, you know, informing people,

48:29.000 --> 48:33.000
and one of the things that I want to accomplish with How To Linux once we launch it is,

48:33.000 --> 48:39.000
I think the easy wins are the enthusiasts, the technically inclined people,

48:39.000 --> 48:43.000
the folks who want to solve a particular problem with Linux,

48:43.000 --> 48:48.000
and my hope with How To Linux is that we can provide an on-ramp where we're going to say,

48:48.000 --> 48:52.000
here's your problem, here's how you solve that problem with Linux,

48:52.000 --> 48:56.000
and that hopefully will be an on-ramp there, and then maybe as people play with it, they'll be like,

48:56.000 --> 49:00.000
hey, you know, I could load this on my laptop. I could try it out on my lap.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
You know, that's what I'm hoping we can do as a network to help Linux,

49:04.000 --> 49:09.000
but I wonder as a whole wide community, can we just dial it?

49:09.000 --> 49:15.000
Is it possible to dial it down a notch, turn down the hater aid, the system D debates are done,

49:15.000 --> 49:21.000
the mirror debate seems like it's pretty much where it's going to be at.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Monkey suits will be worn.

49:23.000 --> 49:28.000
Can't we all just use this as an opportunity to kind of take a snapshot of where we're at and say,

49:28.000 --> 49:31.000
you know, let's just dial it down a little bit and just welcome everybody in.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
How do we do that? Is that possible?

49:33.000 --> 49:41.000
Well, Chris, you were saying with the How To Linux, and I really appreciate the work you do,

49:41.000 --> 49:44.000
because that's how your videos is what really got me into Linux,

49:44.000 --> 49:52.000
but I think the key really is shorter videos, because I remember I might only want to watch the

49:52.000 --> 49:59.000
max, you know, how to section and I'd have to, you know, watch all episode. It'd be nice if we just had like

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
lots of little really informative videos.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Right. Shot of information.

50:03.000 --> 50:10.000
Yeah, because most of the question I get brought uploads is, oh, I've downloaded this tar.gz file.

50:10.000 --> 50:15.000
Now what? You know, that's like the biggest question I get.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
Yeah.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.000
But that only takes maybe three minutes to explain.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.000
We're working on it right now.

50:20.000 --> 50:26.000
I'm happy to announce that Ik in the Mumble Room here and Crash Bandicoot will be joining us.

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
Ik will be our lead producer and Crash will be our associate producer on Linux, on How To Linux,

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
and we've got a bunch of really great applications.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
We're going to continue to go through those.

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000
I think we'll probably develop a bench of producers who can be working on content,

50:40.000 --> 50:45.000
so that way they can work at their own pace, at their own speed on the things that scratch their particular itch,

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
and we can have several people working.

50:47.000 --> 50:52.000
And if How To Linux takes off, if it's a hit, I want to be able to scale that show up big,

50:52.000 --> 50:58.000
maybe multiple times a week, all kinds of topics, guides, written tutorials, all that kind of stuff,

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
where it's all still early planning stages.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
We're not ready to pull the trigger on any one particular thing,

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
but we're assembling our team right now.

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
We're getting things ready in place.

51:07.000 --> 51:14.000
And I feel like even if moving forward we only capture just the technically inclined,

51:14.000 --> 51:18.000
the Windows power users and the sysadmins who've ran Linux for years,

51:18.000 --> 51:20.000
but now are thinking about switching on their desktops,

51:20.000 --> 51:27.000
I think that's a great percentage, that's a big percentage of users that we could bring over to Linux.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.000
So I'm excited about that.

51:28.000 --> 51:32.000
Now before we wrap up this week's episode, coming up on Sunday's Linux Action Show,

51:32.000 --> 51:36.000
we're doing a review of the SolidXK desktop.

51:36.000 --> 51:42.000
Now you can go over to SolidXK.com, that's S-O-L-Y-D-X-K.com, and download this.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.000
We're going to do the home edition, Matt, okay?

51:44.000 --> 51:47.000
So we're going to grab the home edition because that's like our latest and greatest.

51:47.000 --> 51:51.000
This is a Debian-based semi-rolling release that uses the XFCE desktop,

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
and we want to do something kind of new this week.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
We want to get your review of it.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
So try it out, and between now and during the last live show,

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
send us your review on Twitter and use the hashtag action review

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
to tweet your thoughts about the SolidXK desktop right now,

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
between now and during the last live show,

52:10.000 --> 52:15.000
and in the feedback segment, Matt and I will pull up all those hashtag action review tweets

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
and read your mini reviews there at the end of the show,

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
so you have a chance to get your thoughts in.

52:19.000 --> 52:24.000
And if everything goes as planned, Matt, the SolidXK developers will be joining us

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
on next week's Linux Unplugged.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Sounds good.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
Yeah, so load up your testing box, Matt, and we'll give SolidXK a spin on Sunday.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
I'll see you then, okay?

52:33.000 --> 52:34.000
See you then. Bye-bye.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.000
All right, everyone.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Well, thank you for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
We'd love to have you join us live.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
Visit jblive.tv Tuesdays, 2 p.m. Pacific.
