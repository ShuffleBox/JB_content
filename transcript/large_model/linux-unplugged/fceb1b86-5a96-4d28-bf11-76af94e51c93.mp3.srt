1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
So we're all familiar with the perpetual joke

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,360
about Linux on a toaster, but Linux on a microwave,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,320
it's real and it's here.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,440
Sensory's truly natural embedded speech recognition

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,520
and natural language platform improves the ease of use

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,120
and feature accessibility in consumer products.

7
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,740
This domain-specific assistant

8
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,340
allows natural language voice controls on small appliances,

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,680
such as a microwave,

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,040
without requiring an internet connection.

11
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,120
No confusing setup and no risk of lost privacy.

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,040
Just what you've always wanted.

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,640
Sensory's truly natural.

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,640
Now you have voice control for a microwave.

15
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,080
I like that we're on the other side of the hype cycle now,

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,160
where suddenly, privacy's in vogue again.

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,480
Open the door.

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,960
Ha ha ha.

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,000
Listen to these guys.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,680
They're using their voice to control their microwave.

21
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,800
Voice genie, cook for one minute and 10 seconds.

22
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,000
Start in one minute and 10 seconds.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,940
Voice genie, pause.

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,520
Now. Pause.

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,080
I love that it's all local, Wes,

26
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,240
but where do we draw the line?

27
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,560
Do we really need voice systems

28
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,040
that are all independent and separate,

29
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,920
built into each and every device?

30
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,420
Am I some old-school 80s network engineer

31
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,160
that I want everything centralized?

32
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,640
I want one system that's aware of everything,

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,840
that can communicate with the endpoints.

34
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,280
Not each endpoint having its own voice assistant.

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,640
I mean, I think there are advantages

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,040
to having things integrated,

37
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,680
but until you get real standards

38
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,240
that do respect your privacy,

39
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,920
this might be a nice compromise.

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,640
One of the things that they laud here

41
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,240
when they're trying to sell this all-offline,

42
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,520
customizable thing is you can use a particular brand

43
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,960
to talk to instead of having to say,

44
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,920
hey, big name cloud company, do this for me.

45
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,360
But I don't know, it's all powered by Linux,

46
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,800
so I think I would say something like,

47
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,520
okay, Linus, start Linux Unplugged.

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,520
Hello, friends, and welcome back

49
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,120
to your weekly Linux talk show.

50
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,960
My name is Chris.

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,960
My name is Wes.

52
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,400
Hello, Wes, is that a travel size

53
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,800
of talcum powder you brought?

54
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,320
Oh, yeah, it's actually smaller than you know.

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,240
You never wanna be in somewhere and not smell fresh, Wes,

56
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,200
so I appreciate that, you know?

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,720
You're a guy that cares about that.

58
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,760
This episode is brought to you

59
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,920
by the all-new A Cloud Guru,

60
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,480
the leader in learning for cloud Linux

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,560
and other modern tech skills.

62
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,880
Hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

63
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,520
Get certified, get hired, and get learning

64
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,920
at acloudguru.com.

65
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,320
Well, it's not all about talcum powder today.

66
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,720
Coming up on the show, we're taking a look

67
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,040
at a bit of a distro underdog.

68
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,640
We may have found a bit of a diamond in the rough

69
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,960
that has a few tricks that we were surprised

70
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,120
to come across, and today, finally,

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,560
after weeks and weeks of playing around,

72
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,840
I'm going hands-on with the Odroid Super Go,

73
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,600
which is a Linux handheld gaming, not tablet.

74
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,920
Actually, it's more like a Switch.

75
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,040
You know the Nintendo Switch Lite?

76
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,520
It's like that, only it runs Ubuntu

77
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,760
and it's got an Odroid in there.

78
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,600
I'll tell you all about that.

79
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,440
Wait, what?

80
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,760
That's really cool, Wes, I can't wait to show it to you.

81
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,160
And also, I have a battery emergency.

82
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,480
My battery is in bad shape in my new ThinkPad.

83
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,320
I can't believe it.

84
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,640
It's already in bad shape.

85
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,280
So I'm going to share the tools that I'm using

86
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,840
to try to save my ThinkPad's battery

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,120
and maybe, hopefully, extend its life.

88
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,400
But before we get into all of that,

89
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
I want to say time-appropriate greetings

90
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,120
to our virtual Linux users group.

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,440
Hello, mobile room.

92
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,640
Hello, Chris, hello, Wes.

93
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,880
Hello, everybody, 25 of you in there hanging out.

94
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,320
We have some in the on-air, some in the quiet listening.

95
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,160
Just the backup we need.

96
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,520
They are our wingmen.

97
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,600
You can join our Mumble Room.

98
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,720
It's open to the whole world.

99
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,080
The information is linked up at linuxunplugged.com.

100
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,560
Hey, before we get into the rest of the show,

101
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,600
I want to put a special request out there for your questions.

102
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,520
We want to do a Q&A episode.

103
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,840
Any topic is open.

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,080
You can ask us anything,

105
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,160
and we'll answer as many as we can on the show

106
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,320
about the show, about JB, about Linux,

107
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,560
whatever it might be.

108
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,040
We'd like your questions, because at the end of the month,

109
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,320
I'm taking a family trip to Bozeman, Montana.

110
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,480
I love Bozeman, and every year I try to make it out there,

111
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,680
make it going a little early,

112
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,920
make it a little earlier this year.

113
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,800
And while I'm gone, we want to record an episode

114
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,400
that can go out in the feeds while I'm out in Montana

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,520
that will be the Ask Us Anything episode,

116
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,040
and that's coming up really soon.

117
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,520
So if you're listening to this episode

118
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,560
around the time it was released,

119
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,640
you have until the weekend,

120
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,960
because we're likely going to be recording this Sunday,

121
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,800
potentially.

122
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,240
So go to asklup.com,

123
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,400
and there's just a really simple form there.

124
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,200
You can fill it out and send us in your question,

125
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,560
or you can just use the contact form, like always,

126
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,400
or the email.

127
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,640
We're going to be using both.

128
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,560
Asklup.com and submit your question into the show

129
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,280
and ask us just about anything,

130
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,640
because, well, we thought it'd be really fun.

131
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,640
We've never, ever done that in 405 episodes.

132
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,160
We've never done an Ask Us Anything episode.

133
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,360
And you know, it's a great chance to get another domain,

134
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,640
asklup.com.

135
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,240
So go there and submit your questions into the show.

136
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,080
So let's start with the Odroid Go Super this week,

137
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,000
that handheld device I was just mentioning.

138
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,080
And Pycrash, right off the top,

139
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,480
I know you have a question about it.

140
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,320
For me, the Odroid, it was more like a Game Boy

141
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,320
or maybe something like a retro handheld,

142
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,360
something like that.

143
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,200
Yeah, that's fair,

144
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,640
because it is more about the retro games, absolutely.

145
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,520
And so the Odroid Go Super was announced in December

146
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,360
for a price of $80.

147
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,680
And it has remained completely sold out everywhere

148
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,960
until this week.

149
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,840
It's actually back in stock and available for purchase.

150
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,840
So I wanted to tell you guys all about it.

151
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,480
And yeah, overall, it's like a Game Boy

152
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,800
in terms of some of its functionality,

153
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,600
but the build, it's like a Nintendo Switch Lite,

154
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,800
which isn't surprising.

155
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,200
The original Odroid Go from 2018

156
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,960
looked like a Game Boy itself.

157
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,200
And then they had an Advance later on

158
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,880
that looked like a Game Boy Advance.

159
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,200
But this is a shocking price, $80.

160
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,560
That's less than half the price of a Nintendo Switch.

161
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,960
And it has support for PlayStation 1 games,

162
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,840
PlayStation Portable, Nintendo 64,

163
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,160
Super Nintendo, Atari, MAME Station,

164
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,560
a lot of classic game consoles.

165
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,880
It is missing a few.

166
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,600
It is missing a few, but it's got a lot.

167
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,480
With a five inch LCD display

168
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,200
running at 854 by 480 resolution.

169
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:22,200
It's got a Rockchip RK3326 quad core Cortex 835 arm processor,

170
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,400
a Mali G31 MP2 GPU.

171
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,280
Oh, and it's booting up right now as I'm using it.

172
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,840
A 4,000 milliamp battery.

173
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,080
So it's decent battery life.

174
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,600
I charge it over USB-C and really have had no complaints

175
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,160
because I pretty much always have it plugged into my desk,

176
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,040
but now it's been unplugged for about a day and a half

177
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,480
and I'm still at full charge.

178
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,360
A gigabyte of RAM on this thing.

179
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,480
It has a mono speaker.

180
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,760
It has a headphone jack.

181
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,360
It has a USB two A port.

182
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,240
So you can plug dongles in

183
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,200
because it does not come with wifi built in.

184
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,800
And it just takes a five volt, 1.5 amp charger.

185
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,800
And this thing, this thing all fits in your hand

186
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,600
with a really, really good comfort level.

187
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,360
The buttons I'd say are not the best.

188
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,880
They're not quite Switch quality,

189
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,640
but they're better than some of the earlier builds

190
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,720
that you'll see reviews that are based

191
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,200
on earlier versions of the Odroid.

192
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,120
They improved it when they moved on

193
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,480
from the transparent case.

194
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,920
I still don't love the buttons, but they're pretty good.

195
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,040
And they're laid out a lot like you'd see on a Switch.

196
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,280
You've got a D-pad, you've got two thumb joysticks

197
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,920
and you've got a Y, X, B and A keys.

198
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,480
And it ships with Ubuntu 18.04.

199
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,040
Well, actually it doesn't ship with anything,

200
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,440
but they make it very easy to get Ubuntu 18.04 on there.

201
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,880
It doesn't ship with a micro SD card.

202
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,680
You have to supply that on your own.

203
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,480
So no wifi and no micro SD card,

204
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,960
but those are pretty easy to come by these days.

205
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,520
And the five inch screen on this thing is just glorious.

206
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,440
The screen really is the high point.

207
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,040
Now you don't normally get a screen this good

208
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,460
for an $80 device.

209
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,380
And it really makes these old games just absolutely pop.

210
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,360
And I really enjoyed the nostalgia aspect

211
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,000
of playing like my old Game Gear games,

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,680
my old Star Trek games that I used to play forever.

213
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,500
And the fact that at the end of the day,

214
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,960
when I'm done playing with this thing,

215
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,620
I have Ubuntu 18.04.

216
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,860
Well, that makes up for a lot of the,

217
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,400
oh yeah, here's Spider-Man.

218
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,460
Yeah.

219
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,860
Sounds good.

220
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,700
Yeah, it's fine.

221
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,020
That's not even up all the way.

222
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,980
The fact that it has 18.04 on there makes up for a lot.

223
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,500
You can SSH into this thing and install packages

224
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,600
and you know, it's a real full Linux box.

225
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,860
And then what they do, Wes,

226
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,340
and this makes it really kind of approachable

227
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,660
for the rest of the family.

228
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,860
Yeah.

229
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:32,460
What they do is they ship it with their image

230
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,900
with emulation station on top.

231
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,500
So it's Ubuntu 18.04 underneath,

232
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,940
and then emulation station on top of that.

233
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,940
And that is a graphical themeable emulator front end

234
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,540
that allows you to get access to all the games in one place.

235
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,140
And it works really well with controller input.

236
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,100
And the default theme is clean.

237
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,500
It's a nice PS3 style UI, easy to use.

238
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,340
Yeah, this looks really nice.

239
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,340
I mean, both professional

240
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,180
because it's got all the logos built in here,

241
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,220
you know, kind of a slick, slidey UI,

242
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,460
but also just clear and easy to use,

243
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,300
familiar to someone who's used a different,

244
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,180
you know, but similar kind of game platform.

245
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,620
Emulation station is what's up.

246
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,860
I mean, you could put just about any ROM on this

247
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,700
you kind of want.

248
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,140
I mean, even lineage OS on this thing.

249
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,780
It's got, you know, it's an old drive in here.

250
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,500
You could do it what you want.

251
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,460
But emulation station has that family acceptance factor.

252
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,740
And I'm really glad they made that

253
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,420
their default Ubuntu image.

254
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,940
Because if you can use a console, a game console,

255
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,220
you can use the UI on this tiny little handheld Linux computer.

256
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,300
And the fact that all the games are just listed there,

257
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,780
all of the different emulators, simple, easy,

258
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,540
the family approval factor has been high.

259
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,620
They pick it up and they go

260
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,860
like they would with any commercial device,

261
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,860
like they would with a multi hundred dollar device.

262
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,980
And I've loaded up with a bunch of great games.

263
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,180
So they don't even have to think about it.

264
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,980
They just sit down and start playing.

265
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,860
How was that process?

266
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,860
Was it easy to get them loaded?

267
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,260
Was there just a folder you could dump them to

268
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,100
on the SD card?

269
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,380
Did you do it over USB?

270
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,220
How did that work?

271
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,580
You got a couple of options.

272
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,700
This is where I think maybe Wes,

273
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,820
it's kind of a little bit for more technically savvy people.

274
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,540
If you don't have any experience with computers,

275
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,620
it's going to be tricky because-

276
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,620
So people who like to mess with computers.

277
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,460
Oh.

278
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,380
It's for people who like to mess with computers.

279
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,500
Yeah, you have to either use Samba or SCP

280
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,820
once it's up on the network to get the files on there.

281
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,260
You could probably pop in the SD card

282
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,460
and mount them and find them there.

283
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,860
But what they've done by default is they've turned Samba on

284
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,860
and they've shared out a couple of directories,

285
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,700
a config directory that you need to say,

286
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,780
enable Sega CD support,

287
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:30,100
and which I have links for information on that in the notes.

288
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,180
And like another directory

289
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,820
for all the different ROMs that are supported.

290
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,540
And it has each architecture that it supports in there.

291
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,300
And then you just drop the ROM files in there.

292
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,100
Over Samba is kind of the best way.

293
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,420
And that's with you like bridging

294
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,820
with the USB 2 port then,

295
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,260
like you're plugging that into your phone or something

296
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,980
or right into a network device?

297
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,740
I opted just to plug in an ethernet dongle

298
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,740
into the USB-A port.

299
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,980
Oh, sure, right.

300
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,580
Cause this is, this thing's just running Linux.

301
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,540
So USB ethernet adapter, right?

302
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,220
Anything the Linux kernel supports, this thing supports.

303
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,380
And so I've got an ethernet adapter

304
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,300
that works great with Linux.

305
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,420
It's USB 3.

306
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,620
This is only a two port,

307
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,620
but I plug it right in and works.

308
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,340
I just love the image of that too, right?

309
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,940
Like that's not something you generally would see

310
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,140
on a switch version of this.

311
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,980
It's just this nice dongle hanging off the side

312
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,820
with an ethernet jack.

313
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,900
And that's how you know it's meant for nerds.

314
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,900
You know, it works too.

315
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,740
Cause if you think about it,

316
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,940
you're mostly playing all retro ROMs on this thing.

317
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,500
And you don't add a lot of those at a rapid pace.

318
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,660
You kind of get them all on there

319
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,740
and then you're kind of done.

320
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,580
Right.

321
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,780
And they don't have network connectivity.

322
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,300
So you don't need it for that.

323
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,660
Right.

324
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,860
So besides the initial setup,

325
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,260
I haven't missed having wifi.

326
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,740
And the fact that this has great battery life

327
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,060
and we can take it in the car

328
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,380
and my kids don't need to ask

329
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,540
if they can like tether to my phone to use their app.

330
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,460
You know, they can just play games and it just works.

331
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,500
And at $80, I feel much more comfortable

332
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,640
buying a few of these for my kids

333
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,660
than I do switches at $300.

334
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,340
And the fact that I could just duplicate the SD cards

335
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,740
so they all have the same games and the same UI.

336
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,660
It's a much more manageable experience that way.

337
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,800
I don't know if I'm necessarily going to keep it for myself,

338
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,220
but I think I'm going to take emulation station.

339
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,500
And I think I'm going to put that on a Raspberry Pi,

340
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,340
my Pi 400 potentially,

341
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,660
and use that as a great, and hook up a controller

342
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,180
and just use that as a way to play retro games.

343
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,780
Cause emulation station is fantastic.

344
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,580
And you don't need a Odroid for that.

345
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,760
You can put it on pretty much any system.

346
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,600
And then I'll let my kids play with this.

347
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,060
Oh yeah, they've even got windows support on here.

348
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,860
Raspberry Pi dedicated images,

349
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,300
as well as support for Debian and a package in the AUR.

350
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,300
I just put a little SanDisk Ultra 256 gigabyte

351
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,600
micro SD card in it.

352
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,380
And you know, these ROMs,

353
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,020
with the exception of like the PlayStation portable ROMs

354
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,040
and the Sega CD ROMs, all the other ROMs are tiny.

355
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,100
They're tiny.

356
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,460
But man, the Sega CD games were not as good as I remembered.

357
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,220
I haven't been able to emulate a Sega CD

358
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,060
in a very long time.

359
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,380
My dad got one, way back in the day.

360
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,740
And I guess he didn't like it,

361
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,780
cause he ended up giving it to me

362
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,700
and I put it in my bedroom.

363
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,180
And at the time I didn't really connect the dots

364
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,780
and it was because my old man didn't like it very much.

365
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,180
But then I loaded the Sega CD up on this thing

366
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,400
and started the old Jurassic Park game.

367
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,080
And it was like a low rent version of Myst.

368
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,020
It was real bad, Wes, so bad.

369
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,580
But you got all that nostalgia.

370
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,620
There's a lot of great ways to play retro games.

371
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,540
We are not lacking.

372
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,020
There's RetroPie.

373
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,220
There's this Odroid Go Super.

374
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,340
This though, I think this sort of takes the cake

375
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,800
because it's the controller, it's the Linux box.

376
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,100
It's all in one.

377
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,000
And it's got that beautiful five inch screen

378
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,580
that just crushes it for these old retro games on there.

379
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,500
And then once it's set up,

380
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,180
it's essentially appliance level.

381
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,540
It just, you turn it on, it boots fairly fast

382
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,460
for an entire complex operating system on there.

383
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,420
And you're off to go to the races.

384
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,260
And if you want to be crazy and SSH in there

385
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,300
and install a web server or something, you absolutely can.

386
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,820
So for 80 bucks, I think it's an easy recommend.

387
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,820
I describe it like this.

388
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,460
It feels like a device that's about 90 to $100

389
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,260
in manufacturing quality for $80.

390
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,620
Hey, that's not a bad deal.

391
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:05,460
Right, you do have to add your own wifi,

392
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,660
your own storage and likely your own power too

393
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,840
because I don't think mine came with a power adapter.

394
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,300
It just uses USB-C.

395
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,380
It does seem like a nice deal for that price though

396
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,420
just in that if you want something

397
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,060
kind of hanging around a portable device

398
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,260
that you can use for gaming if you're into that

399
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,060
or maybe you get bored with some of the ROMs that you have

400
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,420
but you can also just use it as an extra Linux machine

401
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,260
to hack on.

402
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,780
I mean, I'm already kind of imagining some fun projects.

403
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,380
Like I wonder if our software would use to control

404
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,340
the mixer in the studio would run on there.

405
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,900
Yeah, and I think the takeaway from this

406
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,420
is check out Emulation Station too

407
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,760
if you're not interested in buying a piece of hardware.

408
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,260
This reminds me of this cartridge that I got.

409
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,980
It's called the EverDrive and it's a Super Nintendo cartridge

410
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,980
that you plug into a physical Super Nintendo console.

411
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,860
And what makes this cartridge special

412
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,420
is it has an SD card slot in the top of it

413
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:55,100
that you can pop in there loaded with ROMs.

414
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,060
And so you can take every SNES game that ever existed

415
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,580
and put it on this SD card and pop it in the cartridge,

416
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,460
put that in your Super Nintendo

417
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,780
and you get access to every Nintendo game from one cartridge.

418
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,940
It's really great,

419
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,140
but you have to have all of that old retro hardware.

420
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,060
And I have that here in the studio.

421
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,140
We got a Super Nintendo.

422
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,300
We even got a CRT monitor for it.

423
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,100
We have the controllers and it works great.

424
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,300
But you get all that kind of same experience

425
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,580
with this Odroid,

426
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,180
and you could probably on something else, I admit,

427
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,480
but the Odroid lets you do it all in one package.

428
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,320
So I really like it.

429
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,980
The Odroid goes super for 80 bucks.

430
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,900
We'll have a link in the show notes.

431
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,740
It's not a sponsored thing.

432
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,720
They didn't pay or anything like that,

433
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,900
but I wanted to pick it up for you guys

434
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,700
and I've been holding onto it while it's been out of stock.

435
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,540
And Wes, you got a chance to play around with it too.

436
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,260
I'm curious, what were your kind of initial impressions

437
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,660
of the build quality and stuff?

438
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,820
Yeah, really not bad.

439
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,260
This green seemed quite bright and I liked the colors.

440
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:48,780
The joysticks left a little bit to be desired.

441
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,340
I mean, definitely not like full regular sort of game,

442
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:56,200
you know, first class game controller level, but not bad.

443
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,420
I mean, I think it would work,

444
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,380
especially for some of these, you know, classic games

445
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,860
where you don't need that fine of control.

446
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,980
Anyway, the D-pad felt not bad

447
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,560
and there were a lot of buttons.

448
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,580
Not all of them were great,

449
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,100
but it seemed like you could make it work

450
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,380
for a variety of use cases.

451
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,860
Linode.com slash unplugged.

452
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,980
Linode is our hosting provider for everything

453
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,580
that we've built over the last couple of years.

454
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,840
And if you go to linode.com slash unplugged,

455
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:23,940
you get a $100 60 day credit towards your new account.

456
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,400
And you can try everything out

457
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,460
that we've been talking about.

458
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,420
And unlike entry-level hosting providers

459
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,740
or the big clouds like AWS that try to lock you in

460
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,140
and tie your hands down,

461
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,200
Linode gives you the tools to get the most

462
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,900
out of their crazy fast systems.

463
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,500
You get 11 data centers to choose from

464
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,340
and every service level is backed

465
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,300
by the best customer support in the business.

466
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,580
And when that matters,

467
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,460
it really makes all the difference.

468
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,660
It's not just like one great thing about Linode

469
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,580
that we go on about,

470
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:53,780
but it's all of the very aspects of Linode coming together

471
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,480
that makes them our go-to choice

472
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,860
for anything we're gonna build today or in the future.

473
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,260
It's really kind of a special combination

474
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,580
of super fast hardware, really dedicated staff,

475
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,740
people who see deeply into the future of Linux

476
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,580
and are really passionate about that.

477
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,220
And kind of a mission to focus on a core set of products

478
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,180
and make them as good as possible.

479
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,780
And now they are the largest

480
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,340
independent cloud computing provider.

481
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,220
Been around since 2003.

482
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,740
And they always ask themselves that what layer

483
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,980
can we now bake in Linux

484
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,420
when they're building the next thing.

485
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,000
On their blog, they have the story

486
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,980
about becoming their own ISP.

487
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,060
And this was a while ago.

488
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,220
And so the areas that they were gonna use Linux

489
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,780
and networking was really pushing the envelope.

490
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,500
But again, they saw where Linux was going.

491
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,300
And so they built towards that.

492
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,420
And if you're not catching out Linode's tutorials

493
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,620
that they've been doing with HackerSploit,

494
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,620
you're missing out on some of the great chances

495
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,220
that Linode makes for you to learn

496
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,960
and kind of get insights into securing servers

497
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,180
on the public web.

498
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,720
One of my favorites recently is learning the various tools

499
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,580
for commands and logging and monitoring

500
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,740
and just checking on the health of your box.

501
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,080
We'll have a link to that.

502
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,780
But really go over to linode.com slash unplugged.

503
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,620
Get that $100 for your new account

504
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,020
and try this stuff out for yourself.

505
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,460
Go build something,

506
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,540
or maybe use this as an opportunity to learn something.

507
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,420
They have really quick ways to take snapshots

508
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,300
and destroy systems and rebuild systems

509
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,580
and bring them right back to where they're at from backups

510
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,780
if you wanna try learning something as well.

511
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,780
There's a lot of ways to host something.

512
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,680
And there's a lot of various companies

513
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,720
that are gonna let you host.

514
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,220
They're gonna do it.

515
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,060
But none of them, none of them are as good as Linode.

516
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,220
Go see why we choose Linode every single time.

517
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,620
Linode.com slash unplugged.

518
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,620
All right, let's do ourselves a spot of housekeeping.

519
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,620
I'm curious, I didn't ask you before the show, Minimac,

520
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,860
but I'm curious to know how the Luplug went this Sunday.

521
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,860
It went really well.

522
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
We had a good attendance.

523
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,180
We had over 20 people.

524
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:52,180
And we had a deep talk about the Minecraft project.

525
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,460
The recording is about one hour, one and a half hour.

526
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,060
And yeah, it was really, really fun.

527
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,340
And yeah, it was really, really cool.

528
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,180
That's great.

529
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,500
Again, I have to thank all the people

530
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,560
from the Minecraft community.

531
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,780
Yeah, I saw some really great tweets afterwards.

532
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,540
It seemed like it was a really good coming together

533
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,660
of two different communities and sharing ideas.

534
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,680
That's great.

535
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,100
Look what the Luplug's becoming, man.

536
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,580
That's so awesome.

537
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,420
I love to see that.

538
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,780
It happens every Sunday.

539
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,940
And you know, every now and then we crash a live party.

540
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,060
Do you guys have plans this Sunday if we were to crash?

541
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,460
Would we interrupt anything?

542
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,460
Well, it will be a normal Luplug,

543
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,940
but if you are recording afterwards,

544
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,660
I guess the whole community will join the show.

545
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,820
Heck yeah.

546
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,860
That's great.

547
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,300
If you'd like to join the conversation in between episodes

548
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,980
or catch up with some of the hosts on the network,

549
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,420
join our telegram at jupiterbroadcasting.com

550
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,580
slash telegram.

551
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:46,700
And also the Jupiter garage sale remains.

552
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,380
A few sway bags are left, but more importantly,

553
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,100
it's the very, very last

554
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:54,420
of the Linux Unplugged 400 beer postcards.

555
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,940
I've been including a personalized message

556
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:00,860
and a postcard with our LuP 400 CNX Tuesday beer on there.

557
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,540
In every rando retro swag bag order,

558
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,940
we slip one of those in

559
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,340
and there is just a small handful left.

560
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,860
So you've been thinking about getting some retro swag

561
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,660
and you'd like to get one of those LuP 400

562
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,700
limited keepsake postcards.

563
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,100
Well, jupitergarage.com now, they go really quick.

564
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,260
So go grab one if you'd like one,

565
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,220
because I think they're pretty neat

566
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,980
and we're not doing them again after this.

567
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:25,820
So it's a limited time to get that LuP 400 postcard.

568
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,100
And that is the housekeeping.

569
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,500
So this last week,

570
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,380
we really kind of saw Nitrix pop up on our radar

571
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,860
for a reason that isn't typical.

572
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:41,500
This is a distribution that we wanna talk about today.

573
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,820
It's really kind of something special.

574
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,020
And we were pretty impressed when we jumped in there,

575
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,500
but unfortunately the reason why it was on our radar

576
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,140
is kind of a negative one.

577
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,580
They published an open letter to DistroWatch

578
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,860
stating amongst other things

579
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,860
that for a better part of three years,

580
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,100
they've remained silent about ongoing efforts

581
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,020
at DistroWatch to affect people's perception

582
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,660
of their Linux distribution.

583
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,260
They go on to say they've tried their best

584
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:11,140
not to engage with DistroWatch's hostility

585
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,580
and their disregard to inform viewers and listeners,

586
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,220
and they've also tried to reach out and correct facts

587
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,380
when mistakes were made.

588
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,500
Going through the blog of the lead developer

589
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,060
of the distribution and reading their open letter,

590
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,260
you know, it seems like they've had a real struggle

591
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,380
with DistroWatch and a lack of exposure there.

592
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,060
And when DistroWatch has reviewed Nitrix,

593
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,500
seems like they've made numerous somewhat obvious mistakes

594
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,340
that have been very upsetting to the distribution.

595
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,500
And I normally wouldn't talk even about something like this

596
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
because we can't really speak

597
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,140
to their particular experiences.

598
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,660
Right, we don't make the distro

599
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,460
and we didn't do those reviews.

600
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,940
Yeah, my personal experiences with DistroWatch

601
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,900
does sort of lead me to believe their accusations

602
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,060
as kind of out there as they are,

603
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,660
and as intense as they are,

604
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:02,140
my personal experience having experienced some,

605
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,580
I would say hostilities from DistroWatch,

606
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,140
it would kind of line up with what they're seeing.

607
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,380
So they may actually be onto something

608
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,260
and we thought, well, what could we do?

609
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,260
We could do our part

610
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,820
and help them get a little exposure here

611
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:16,740
because, you know, you can look at this distribution today

612
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,540
and you can see it's really likely going somewhere

613
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,860
if the developers can stick with it.

614
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,140
And Nitrix 1.40 was released on May 2nd of this year.

615
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,580
It's based on Debian SID

616
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,780
and a little bit of neon in there, it seems.

617
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,180
And well, it's really kind of a mix

618
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,860
of a lot of Debian based systems,

619
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,620
but it's really rocking a few special components

620
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:40,020
like a hyper modern plasma on top of a Debian base.

621
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,740
That was enough to get my attention.

622
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,660
But then as we dug into the distribution,

623
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,420
we found a lot of surprising things.

624
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,820
Yeah, we really did.

625
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,820
And that's where I can maybe understand

626
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,300
some of the mistakes on the DistroWatch side

627
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,540
or some of their issues understanding Nitrix

628
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:58,100
because really Nitrix had a long and complicated history

629
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,740
and there's a lot going on in the project.

630
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,060
I mean, there's a lot of new or original takes on ideas

631
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,900
and there's just a lot of changes they've made.

632
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,580
Like in the past, they were really targeting snaps,

633
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,660
but these days it's now all about app images.

634
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,700
Very much so.

635
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,380
The app image integration is so slick.

636
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,260
It is like I've never really,

637
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,780
I guess I don't use app images a lot.

638
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:22,740
So it's neat to see a distribution kind of focus

639
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,860
on app image because it gives me an opportunity

640
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,820
to experience it at the same level of integration

641
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,780
I've experienced snaps and flat packs.

642
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,620
You flat pack floozy you.

643
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,100
I do love me some flat hub.

644
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,940
But you know what?

645
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,980
It was great to go check out app image hub for once

646
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,660
and download a few app images

647
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,460
and Nitrix impressed the hell out of me

648
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,860
because you download an app image,

649
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,180
just the action of downloading the son of a gun,

650
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,140
not launching it, not having to install nothing.

651
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,420
You just download the app image

652
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,700
and the system indexes it and adds it to your launcher

653
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,100
immediately, pretty much.

654
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,740
And so you just do nothing.

655
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,220
It's a very different sort of workflow and mindset

656
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,380
from a traditional Linux distribution,

657
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,940
where everything's sort of sprawled out

658
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,380
all over your file system and your package manager

659
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,860
has this detailed little index and database

660
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,700
it keeps of, oh, this package owns these files

661
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,540
and I've done them here

662
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,260
and here's the state that they're in.

663
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,220
And Nitrix and a lot of what they've been working on

664
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,580
and by targeting app images,

665
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,220
it's almost more like Mac OS

666
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,260
but the old days of Mac OS

667
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,900
where you have things more self-contained,

668
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,900
I can just download the stuff, stick it on my thing,

669
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,420
move it to another machine and it just works.

670
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,660
It was really pretty surprising.

671
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,980
You go to do a whole bunch of extra work

672
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,140
and all of a sudden you discover

673
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,460
it's just there and already done

674
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,820
and you have that kind of, oh, wow.

675
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:40,260
That was so easy I expected it to be harder moment

676
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,380
this one is what you basically have.

677
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,900
And I'm really impressed by that.

678
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,780
But here's the thing that you realize

679
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,020
after using it for a little bit

680
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,700
and we didn't get like a ton of time with it

681
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,940
but we had enough time to realize

682
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,380
this is an opinionated desktop here

683
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,060
and not too surprising because you could trace

684
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,220
the roots of this distribution back to a theme

685
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,540
where somebody was very opinionated

686
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,620
about how things should look

687
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,740
and how icons in the breeze theme should look.

688
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,660
And you move forward now to a desktop distribution

689
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,940
that has brought that same opinionated design

690
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,580
and thinking forward and you end up with something

691
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,660
that's like no other plasma desktop.

692
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:16,700
It has a top bar, it does the integrated top bar thing

693
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,340
when you maximize your windows,

694
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:21,540
your maximize and minimize buttons go up under the top bar

695
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,700
but it also has a dock and it has its own custom set

696
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,260
of apps using Maui kit that enables things

697
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,020
to be more convergent, you can resize them.

698
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,780
They have a whole suite of applications

699
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,100
that they've brought to the desktop that are unique.

700
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,780
Yeah, things like Station, a terminal emulation app

701
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,500
with tabs, vertical and horizontal splitting

702
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,140
and some nice features that maybe you wouldn't

703
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,460
take advantage of on your regular Linux desktop

704
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:48,300
but if you were in a convergent situation,

705
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,060
they've got things like handy buttons

706
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,820
if you wanna send a tab or a control

707
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,740
as well as easy ways to do copy and paste

708
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,140
which hey, honestly, that's just kinda nice

709
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,380
anytime in the terminal.

710
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,220
Yeah, if you've ever used like a mobile app

711
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,540
terminal emulator that adds some of the common buttons

712
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,500
to the bottom, their terminal emulator

713
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,980
does something similar.

714
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,940
They have a video player app that they've built,

715
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,140
they have a music collection manager

716
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,460
and probably the most pronounced application

717
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,900
you're gonna use is Index which is their own file manager

718
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,980
with an embedded terminal, split views, file previews,

719
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,540
experimental web dev support, tags, support for files

720
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,700
and it's a QT app, it's just a little bit different.

721
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,420
It's not Dolphin, it's its own thing

722
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,860
and it's really well done and it works really quick.

723
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,260
It's very smooth and you come away with this almost,

724
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,540
I hate to say it but it's true,

725
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:43,260
almost elementary OS type experience,

726
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,180
maybe not quite as refined yet

727
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:48,420
and it's using Qt and Plasma technologies

728
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,180
instead of GNOME, Shell and GTK and Pantheon

729
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:57,380
but it is a curated Qt environment with their own apps

730
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,340
that have a surprising amount of functionality

731
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,660
and yet a simplicity to their layout

732
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:05,700
and also a common design language to their layout.

733
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,900
Yeah, that's just it, sort of the integration,

734
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:12,140
the holistic approach to the whole desktop experience.

735
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,820
Obviously, there's a ton of differences

736
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,660
but in those aspects, you're right,

737
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,140
it does kind of remind me of elementary

738
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:22,140
or almost also kind of of the very early days of Solus

739
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,260
because experimenting with different

740
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,420
package management scenarios,

741
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,340
different ways to lay out the Linux file system,

742
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,060
that's a lot of what I like about Nitrux

743
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,220
because I think we sort of debate in the community

744
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,140
like what are the value of these

745
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,660
sort of one-off small time distros

746
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,100
but to my mind, some of that value

747
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,020
really is in experimenting and figuring out like,

748
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,940
are there better ways that we should be doing that

749
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,980
even if this isn't what you end up using

750
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,540
on your enterprise desktop?

751
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,980
It might inform the future versions down the road.

752
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,540
Yeah, I think it is a solid contender

753
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:55,300
for somebody who just wants a modern Debian workstation

754
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,340
and really, they're pulling in aspects

755
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,060
like the Plasma stuff from Neon

756
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,940
so you're getting a really super current Neon

757
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,660
and like Pycrash has pointed out in the chat room,

758
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:06,660
some of these apps, some of these convergent apps

759
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,340
are making their way into the Manjaro KDE mobile spin

760
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,820
so you can actually use some of these same powerful

761
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,740
desktop apps in a mobile UI

762
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,580
and you know, as Wes and I were talking about this

763
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,140
before the show and we were looking at these apps,

764
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:22,100
we started thinking, yeah, maybe this isn't such a bad idea.

765
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,060
You come to love a desktop application

766
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,340
like say, Nota, which is their text editor

767
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,100
with syntax highlighting and focus mode,

768
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,860
it looks like a really nice text editor.

769
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,580
Maybe you come to love Nota

770
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:35,780
and now you could take that same exact application

771
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,300
and you could just resize it and run it on a mobile device

772
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:42,580
and there might actually be something to that there.

773
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,260
I like the idea at least.

774
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,700
So this Maui kit works with, what is it,

775
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,580
Kirigami, isn't that what it is, Wes?

776
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:51,100
Yeah, Maui kit and then Kirigami as well

777
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:51,940
under the hood there.

778
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,620
Yeah, and that technology stack

779
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,700
isn't like something they've just invented on their own

780
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,100
but they've brought in their own special sauce

781
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,060
with Maui kit but it's, you know, it's cute.

782
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,940
It looks like a cute application.

783
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,820
It's not gonna be some weird toolkit

784
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,820
you've never seen or something.

785
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,220
It's gonna look totally normal.

786
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,460
No, but it does seem like there's a lot of nice features.

787
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,060
You know, you get a little bit of a higher level.

788
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,420
You get more aspects of things

789
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,620
that help you keep things convergent

790
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,340
but also just, you know, helpers that you might need

791
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,100
when you're making any app.

792
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,980
At least if you listen to Yuri Harara, the lead dev,

793
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,020
he's done several interviews.

794
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,260
You can find some stuff linked in the show notes.

795
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,140
It really sounds like, you know,

796
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,100
much like elementary folks have focused somewhat

797
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,420
on the developer experience, you know,

798
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,300
with things like Vala.

799
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,540
That's happening over here too,

800
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,700
aiming to have something that's a pleasant experience

801
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,740
to write yourself a Linux desktop application.

802
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,580
Right, yeah.

803
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,660
Yeah, another good comparison there to elementary OS.

804
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,020
I think it's also, this is a distro for anyone

805
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,220
who is currently a KDE Neon user to consider

806
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,100
because you're getting very, very, very fresh plasma.

807
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,620
Plasma 5.21.5 running on Wayland

808
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,660
and they're pulling in the packages from Neon.

809
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,940
So it's, you get something that's a little more curated,

810
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,940
a little more polished, a little more like,

811
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,140
yes, we know you're using this as a daily driver,

812
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,540
but with the fresh packages.

813
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,820
But they do something a little different.

814
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,860
And this is again, where when you see people out there

815
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,940
like DistroWatch who claim it's Ubuntu based,

816
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,180
they're totally missing the mark

817
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,420
because this system does not use systemd.

818
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,260
What?

819
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,300
Dun, dun, dun.

820
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,060
Yeah, they use the open RC.

821
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,060
And I don't even think I noticed

822
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,940
for the first couple of days.

823
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,380
I think you had to say something before I went and looked.

824
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,700
Yeah, I mean, if you're not looking at the boot screen,

825
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,060
because by default they've got a nice,

826
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:33,100
you know, sort of visual splash boot, you won't notice.

827
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,500
I only started to notice when I went to go try

828
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,540
to make some changes to the system as I do.

829
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,820
And I was like, oh, wait, systemd isn't here.

830
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,300
How do I change things?

831
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,140
You know what?

832
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,340
Somehow the world didn't come crashing down to an end.

833
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:47,420
Somehow I just got on using the Distro just fine.

834
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,260
No, right?

835
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,860
I mean, otherwise it's a super modern plasma.

836
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,060
It's running on Wayland.

837
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,060
It's a really slick setup and theme on plasma.

838
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,580
Like in every other respect, it feels super modern.

839
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,700
And it's interesting living in a parallel universe

840
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,220
that still just works.

841
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
I mean, maybe there are some nitty gritty details

842
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,480
down the line or systemd features you might miss,

843
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,340
but it's nice to see this all fleshed out.

844
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,500
Yeah, and you get a very, at the end of the day,

845
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,420
a very opinionated plasma setup with that.

846
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,740
Like we said, with that global menu,

847
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,940
that top bar based on Wayland,

848
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,220
they use the Nitrix theme, obviously, out of the box.

849
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,020
And it's one of those distros that when you log into it

850
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,740
for the first time, you immediately go, oh, this is different.

851
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,300
It's one of those immediate kind of things.

852
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,180
It's not like, oh, let's go, it's like, oh.

853
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,540
And then you begin to use it and you realize

854
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,840
it's even more different than you realize,

855
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,880
but in positive ways that are fun improvements

856
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,720
in a way that I haven't seen in a while.

857
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,500
So go for it, I say.

858
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,300
I think this is a great distribution

859
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,660
and it's a shame maybe it hasn't gotten the recognition

860
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,700
that it should.

861
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,260
They also offer minimal images

862
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,720
if that's how you roll with i3, if that's your style.

863
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,980
Yeah, I think that's pretty new.

864
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,860
They're also, with that minimal image,

865
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,300
they're offering other ways to install

866
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,100
different desktop environments on top here.

867
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,260
They do note that they really are focused

868
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,180
on the Maui stuff and plasma,

869
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,060
but if you wanna keep the underlying base system

870
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,180
and have something different on top,

871
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,140
that's now supported in the latest release.

872
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,880
You know, Wes, I'm curious what your thoughts were

873
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,220
about the app image based workflow

874
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,340
for getting new applications installed.

875
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,280
How did that appeal to you?

876
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,340
Because that was something for me that was like,

877
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,620
oh, okay, I gotta wrap my head around a different way

878
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,460
of loading apps.

879
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,500
I mean, I can use apt, but this is clearly

880
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,940
kind of the direction they want us to go.

881
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,700
It is, you know, I found it a little confused.

882
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,420
On the one hand, like you're mentioning,

883
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,140
there are some really nice integrations,

884
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,420
but on the whole, I had a little bit of trouble.

885
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,380
And really, this definitely shows from us

886
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,540
only recently having started to play with this.

887
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,020
You know, this is a first take at Nitrix.

888
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,820
But because there's so many different takes

889
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,620
and new ideas involved,

890
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:48,340
it felt like there were multiple different

891
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,500
transitionings happening.

892
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,260
I'd find some mentions of systems

893
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,540
or ways of doing things in the docs

894
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,080
that didn't seem to be the case.

895
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,060
Or for instance, there's a set of additional app images

896
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:59,340
that you can have and that are mentioned

897
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,500
as part of what makes Nitrix interesting,

898
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,760
but they're not currently installed by default.

899
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,580
So I had to go find an app package

900
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,700
that I think under the hood just went and downloaded

901
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,840
all these app images, almost reminded me

902
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,380
of the Snap situation in the Ubuntu world.

903
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,580
So I wasn't quite sure, because I got, you know,

904
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:16,500
I didn't have an app image store by default.

905
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,680
I had Discover and the normal system.

906
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,460
So I wasn't really sure which direction I was being pushed.

907
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,420
I had that similar experience.

908
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,280
And I think when the NX software store

909
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,420
is sort of shipping by default,

910
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,900
it'll be a really nice portal

911
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,980
to get access to some of the stuff.

912
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,300
And that's gonna be a little more clear.

913
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,660
There's things that are just slightly different.

914
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,260
It's not really Plasma, it's the NX desktop,

915
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,900
which is based on Plasma technologies

916
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,580
and looks an awful lot like Plasma,

917
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,280
but there's things that are slightly different.

918
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,700
And I would argue perhaps better,

919
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,000
I sure do prefer the way they handle menu bar icons

920
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,020
and notifications and that kind of stuff.

921
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,340
I think it's pretty good.

922
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,900
The notifications especially, really slick.

923
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,300
Yeah, and it's a real, you know,

924
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,460
it is a really kind of close to Plasma experience,

925
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,040
but not quite Plasma.

926
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,860
And so there is a little bit of this,

927
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,700
am I in an alternative reality?

928
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,140
Because I'm using Debian,

929
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,980
but it doesn't quite feel like Debian.

930
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,780
I'm installing app images,

931
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,620
but it's not quite what I expected.

932
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,300
And it all, but at the end,

933
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,300
it was all very positive experience.

934
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,220
And I felt like we had kind of missed

935
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,180
that something kind of special was happening over here,

936
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,260
because if you take this where they're at right now,

937
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,540
if you take this out another year

938
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,620
where their software center is shipping in there

939
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,700
and some of those other app images are installed by default

940
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,160
and some of these things have been just even slightly

941
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,680
more refined by a team that seems to have a strong opinion

942
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,400
and be executing really well on it.

943
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,620
When you zoom that out,

944
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,420
what you're gonna find is something

945
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,740
that makes for a very special distribution.

946
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,740
And I think at the end of the day,

947
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,780
it's unique value is going to be very modern desktop

948
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,600
on a Debian base.

949
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,460
You don't have to worry about distro politics.

950
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,100
You don't have to worry about what Fedora is doing

951
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,260
or Ubuntu is doing.

952
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,820
It's just good old reliable Debian.

953
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,420
And that's appealing.

954
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,360
Yeah, and that means things just work, right?

955
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,900
Like I needed to get Slack installed, unfortunately,

956
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,980
but I did and I didn't have time to fuss with,

957
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,820
okay, what's the one,

958
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,900
is there a community person who's packaging an app image?

959
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,060
Like I could just download the regular old Deb

960
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,180
off their website, unfortunate as that may be,

961
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,200
and get it working,

962
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,340
because it still had those hooks of a traditional system.

963
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,540
And then when I started using their custom apps,

964
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,900
like station, which is their terminal emulation app,

965
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,860
my first reaction was, oh, well, why not console?

966
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,700
Console's great.

967
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,860
I love console, but yeah, I started using it over.

968
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,140
And I started appreciating things that they've added

969
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,600
and the consistency of the applications

970
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,540
and the way that all these technologies work anyways,

971
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,300
they're all built on top of each other regardless.

972
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,220
It's not like it's some crazy foreign thing.

973
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,180
And at each app, as I started using it,

974
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,060
like index, the file manager,

975
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,540
or shelf, the document viewer,

976
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,780
as I started using each one of these applications,

977
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,940
I got more and more used to them.

978
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,280
And I didn't have that typical reaction that I have,

979
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,040
which is, oh, great, another file manager,

980
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,380
just what we needed.

981
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,540
I was impressed with that too.

982
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,580
It was surprising how low friction it was to switch,

983
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,820
cause I mean, especially I use a plasma desktop

984
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,660
all the time.

985
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,120
So I was like, okay, I'm already used to console,

986
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,300
like, what am I gonna have to do here?

987
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,420
But no, it was no problems.

988
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,020
I could do all of my regular workflows

989
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,300
to support things like tabs, all the normal stuff,

990
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,860
like just no issues.

991
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:16,200
Yep, so I think it's a big recommend for Nitrux 1.4.0

992
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,180
here on this show, pretty fresh release,

993
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,340
just released like 10 days ago

994
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,340
as we recorded nine days ago.

995
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,700
We'll have some links in the notes.

996
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,700
There's a lot more to this.

997
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,100
There is probably a three episode,

998
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,820
you could probably do a three episode series

999
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,740
just on this one distribution alone.

1000
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,780
So we'll try to cover some additional bases

1001
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,900
by putting some links in the show notes

1002
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,380
for you to go check out.

1003
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,660
And head over to their website to get Nitrux, which is?

1004
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,380
N-X-O-S.org.

1005
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,660
Yeah, go over there and grab that and give it a spin.

1006
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,540
I think you're gonna be pretty dang impressed.

1007
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,300
And hey, maybe send us some feedback,

1008
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,860
new Nitrux users out there,

1009
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,580
because I'm sure there are details

1010
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,300
and great things about it that we've missed

1011
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,980
or maybe some possible issues.

1012
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,260
MailRoute.net slash Linux.

00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,660
and no credit card required.

1016
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,900
MailRoute is how we're doing our mail protection

1017
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,460
for our new Jupiter colony mail server.

1018
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,860
And for 24 years, MailRoute has focused

1019
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,060
on its core competence, providing cutting edge

1020
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,460
email security.

1021
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,100
MailRoute protects your email server

1022
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,540
with a suite of services designed to remove spam

1023
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:26,100
and viruses and honestly prevent awful, horrible,

1024
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,700
debilitating downtime.

1025
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,780
And I gotta be honest, sometimes it's tricky

1026
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,540
with an ISP that blocks certain ports

1027
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:35,540
because they're jerks or maybe you ended up

1028
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,780
on a blacklist for some stupid reason.

1029
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,980
MailRoute solves all kinds of problems like that too.

1030
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,260
And you know, admins, it's also very, very, very nice

1031
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,180
to be able to queue up mail externally

1032
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,540
so that way you have time for maintenance and downtime.

1033
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,260
That was a number one priority for us

1034
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,060
because there's gonna be times for the show

1035
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,620
that we're gonna wanna upgrade our system.

1036
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,380
And MailRoute will queue up messages for us

1037
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,140
and then when our mail server comes back online

1038
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,540
and the servers can start talking again,

1039
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,860
MailRoute just conveniently delivers all the email

1040
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:07,020
like nothing ever happened, no big deal.

1041
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,980
And it's great for compliance too.

1042
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,220
If you work in government and you have certain compliance

1043
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,060
that you have to follow, MailRoute's gonna do that.

1044
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,100
In fact, MailRoute's one of the few ways to do that.

1045
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,580
It's super easy to switch as well.

1046
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,340
They have one-click migrations for both Office 365

1047
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,860
and G Suite users and realistically,

1048
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,020
it's so straightforward.

1049
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,060
You set up your MX records to point to MailRoute

1050
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,300
and then you configure MailRoute

1051
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,180
to point to your email server.

1052
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,260
And then you can just shut down accepting email

1053
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,900
from anywhere else on your email server.

1054
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,700
Only accept mail from MailRoute.

1055
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:39,540
That greatly reduces your attack surface and spam potential.

1056
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,780
And then you can go into MailRoute

1057
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,820
and they have real-time logs and filtering

1058
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,860
that you can look at which is also fantastic

1059
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,500
when you're trying to troubleshoot.

1060
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,980
That's something I really, really recommend for admins,

1061
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,340
get that real-time log search going

1062
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,900
when you're trying to figure out if an email even got sent.

1063
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:56,180
I mean, that is just great right there.

1064
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,780
So go get 10% off the lifetime of your account

1065
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:01,620
and get a 30-day free trial with no credit card required

1066
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:04,620
just by visiting mailroute.net slash Linux.

1067
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,700
Go protect your mail server, keep your system online,

1068
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,540
keep receiving email, prevent all this crap

1069
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,580
from getting on your server

1070
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,580
that gets stashed into emails today.

1071
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,860
It's just ridiculous.

1072
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,540
And you know, it's only gotten worse

1073
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,380
since people started working from home more.

1074
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,740
Like whatever reason the spammers went crazy

1075
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:24,340
during the COVID work from home situation.

1076
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,180
It's gross.

1077
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,180
It's just MailRoute scans and prevents all that stuff

1078
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,020
from even touching your system and wasting your bandwidth.

1079
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,180
MailRoute just makes email better.

1080
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,900
mailroute.net slash Linux.

1081
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,780
All right, Wes, we have some feedback.

1082
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,100
Last week, we asked for Slexi alternatives,

1083
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,180
which is what we used for Pastebin and Ben wrote in.

1084
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,820
You mentioned in your last episode

1085
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,060
that you're looking for a self-hosted Pastebin

1086
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,460
or GitHub Gist alternative.

1087
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:55,180
I've had a ton of luck with Privatebin,

1088
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,260
which has first-class container support

1089
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:59,460
and has been excellent for me.

1090
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,140
And then of course, thanks, Ben.

1091
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,660
He linked us right to their Docker NGINX FPM Alpine image.

1092
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,700
So that's handy.

1093
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,580
That is, and we've got a couple of recommendations

1094
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,420
for Privatebin.

1095
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,220
So that seems like one we should go.

1096
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,460
We had an email in for the security conscious out there.

1097
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,340
I repeatedly recommend a Pastebin alternative

1098
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,460
called Defuse, defuse.ca,

1099
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,460
which is a pre-internet encryption for text, they say.

1100
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,100
It's pie, pie, pre-internet encryption text.

1101
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,940
That's pretty nice.

1102
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,420
And then David wrote in with cryptpad.fr

1103
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,580
an end-to-end encrypted collaborative,

1104
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:37,580
a GPL3 self-hostable Pastebin alternative called Cryptpad.

1105
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,740
Yeah, you know, David's actually a member

1106
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,980
of the Cryptpad team

1107
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,220
and it might be a little more than we need,

1108
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,740
but boy, is it fancy.

1109
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,300
I mean, it's almost a whole online document solution.

1110
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,540
They've got a crypt drive.

1111
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,300
They've got a fancy syntax highlighting support

1112
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,300
for various programming languages in there.

1113
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,940
I only had time to give it a cursory review

1114
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,980
when I was going through the mail,

1115
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,780
but boy, Cryptpad looks nice.

1116
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,580
Zach writes in with a tough one.

1117
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,460
He says, I'm a network engineer, but I hate it.

1118
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,140
Having never worked on Linux in a professional capacity,

1119
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,100
how do I make the career switch to a Linux administrator?

1120
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,140
I know some Ansible automation for networking,

1121
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,660
so is that transferable?

1122
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,300
What other skills could I transfer

1123
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,900
as a Fedora Linux gamer to an actual career, Zach?

1124
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,340
Well, it sounds like you're honestly

1125
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,380
in a pretty good start already.

1126
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,740
Clearly you're interested in Linux, you're using Fedora,

1127
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,980
so you're keeping up with the latest

1128
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,700
and greatest in Linux technologies.

1129
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,860
Maybe you're not engaging with them,

1130
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,820
but they're there under the hood and available

1131
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,140
for you to play with.

1132
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,180
Plus, you've already got networking knowledge,

1133
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,020
which is a big win, and let me tell you,

1134
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:36,820
there are a ton of developers

1135
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,620
and system administrators out there

1136
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,700
whose networking chops are not quite up to snuff.

1137
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,660
So I think if you can get your foot in the door,

1138
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,340
those will be assets.

1139
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,220
Knowing Ansible and for automation,

1140
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,500
that's also gonna be huge.

1141
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,900
I think you just need to develop some experience,

1142
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,620
be able to talk through things.

1143
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,900
You've already got work experience,

1144
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,980
that's on your side too, so set up some Home Lab stuff,

1145
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,020
set up some stuff in the cloud,

1146
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,740
play more with automating more than networking,

1147
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,220
setting up various systems, maybe with virtual machines,

1148
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,500
start playing with containers,

1149
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,900
if that's the kind of work that you might wanna get into.

1150
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,660
Target that, and I think your experience

1151
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:12,020
with professional systems already will really help you out.

1152
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,780
I completely agree.

1153
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,180
Zach, something else you could consider

1154
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,260
is joining the self-hosted Discord server.

1155
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,540
You'll probably get a few project ideas

1156
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,420
in our Discord for self-hosted.

1157
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,420
Of course, you could always skim that show

1158
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,020
and see if any of our topics give you an idea

1159
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,300
for something to build.

1160
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,940
Getting hands-on with something really just is a,

1161
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,900
it's like an invaluable opportunity to learn.

1162
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,500
You can read about stuff,

1163
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,380
you can watch YouTube videos and visualize stuff,

1164
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,100
but really going hands-on makes all the difference

1165
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,100
and makes it possible for you to speak confidently

1166
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,700
about stuff and describe things in simpler terms,

1167
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,660
which is gonna do well in an interview.

1168
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:49,700
That's just it, cause I mean,

1169
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,980
you likely already have troubleshooting experience,

1170
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,620
which is a huge part of the job of a system administrator.

1171
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,140
You just need those concrete examples

1172
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,740
of like, oh, hey, you know, this isn't working.

1173
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,180
I can't make a network connection.

1174
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,100
Oh, it's because IP tables, you know,

1175
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:04,340
it's a different syntax, different subsystem,

1176
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,660
but the process is basically the same.

1177
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,060
And you learn that it's always SELinux, actually.

1178
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,460
It's always because of SELinux.

1179
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:12,220
That's really what you learn, and that's invaluable.

1180
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,140
Yeah, just turn that off right from the get-go.

1181
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,860
Also, Zach, you always wanna be logged in as root

1182
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,260
and do everything as root,

1183
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,180
including browse the web with your web browser as root.

1184
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,860
And don't bother updating either.

1185
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,100
Keep that stuff, once you get it set up and working,

1186
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,580
never touch it, ever.

1187
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:28,220
Ha ha ha ha.

1188
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,220
You know what we could do?

1189
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:31,740
Is we could basically tell Zach how to become a Linux expert

1190
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,980
by just telling him all the things he should never, ever do.

1191
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:37,420
Also, when you're at a coffee shop with your laptop,

1192
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,180
be sure you walk away with your laptop screen unlocked

1193
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,300
and fully logged in as root for extended periods of time

1194
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:44,340
without keeping an eye on it.

1195
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,380
That's a great idea.

1196
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,540
Ideally, SSH and do a few of your key servers before you go.

1197
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,980
Yeah, make sure they're left up on the screen

1198
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,900
and easy to identify.

1199
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,820
Bill writes in and he has a real good, long question, Wes.

1200
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,620
And I'm kind of tempted to say we should keep this

1201
00:43:58,620 --> 00:43:59,980
for our AMA episode.

1202
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:02,660
This could be one of our first questions in the AMA episode.

1203
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,980
I think you might just be onto something.

1204
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,020
So Bill, if you know your email,

1205
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,740
you know the stumper you wrote in.

1206
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,540
So be sure to check into the AMA episode

1207
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,340
and everybody else go to asklup.com

1208
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,220
to help us fill out our AMA episode.

1209
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,460
We do have some pickage before we get out of here.

1210
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,660
And I wanted to talk about an oldie, but a goodie.

1211
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,940
And it's a real oldie, but it's still a real goodie.

1212
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,820
And that is TLP, the project that

1213
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,500
helps you optimize your Linux laptop battery life.

1214
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:36,820
Yep, it's still around and it's still useful.

1215
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,820
Friends, gather around and let me tell you a tale of woe.

1216
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,860
Stay a while and listen.

1217
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,620
So you know I've got this X1 Carbon, the Fedora edition.

1218
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,140
Nice little laptop.

1219
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,980
That's your shiny new rig, right?

1220
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,780
It is a Fedora 34 machine, Wes.

1221
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,500
Love it for that.

1222
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:58,460
I wanted to keep my battery as healthy as possible.

1223
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:02,340
I think maybe I overthink battery health in general

1224
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,660
for all my devices.

1225
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:05,860
I don't know about any other dads out there,

1226
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,180
but I'm the battery guy.

1227
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:09,100
I'm making sure all the devices are always charged

1228
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:12,500
in the family, plugging in tablets and devices constantly.

1229
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,100
And I unplug things when they've been plugged in

1230
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,180
for too long so that way you're not wearing the battery out.

1231
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,500
Because with lithium ion batteries,

1232
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,620
when they hold at 100% charge, it's

1233
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:25,100
kind of like keeping a muscle fully flexed all the time.

1234
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,220
It's actually not super great for them.

1235
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:31,420
They do better between 40% and 80% range.

1236
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,260
And I like to keep mine between the 40% and 60% range

1237
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:37,000
state of charge, unless I'm planning

1238
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,620
to use them for something heavy, where I'll

1239
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:39,660
charge them all the way up.

1240
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,660
So picky, these devices.

1241
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:44,300
And then you know what, even with that, Wes, sometimes

1242
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,900
I'll even do a full cycle regime.

1243
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,900
If I'm keeping a battery, say, at 60% on average,

1244
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:54,340
about once a month, I'll do a full all the way down to zero,

1245
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:57,060
back up to 100 kind of cycle as well,

1246
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,860
trying to keep them in prime shape.

1247
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,560
So that's why you're so busy.

1248
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,140
It's mostly just maintaining batteries behind the scenes.

1249
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,660
Yeah, I'm in a lot of battery debt right now, I got to say.

1250
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,820
So I took the old X1 Carbon out, and I installed TLP,

1251
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,580
which Fedora has some great documentation on,

1252
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:17,060
specifically for enabling support for ACP IP aspects

1253
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,740
that are unique to ThinkPads, so you

1254
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:21,620
can get really good data for your ThinkPad laptop.

1255
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,860
I installed all this, I'll have links in the show notes

1256
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:24,460
for that.

1257
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:28,300
And I do a TLP report to get my battery health.

1258
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,900
Now, mind you, and what is this X1 Carbon, Wes?

1259
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:32,780
Is it like three months old, four months old?

1260
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,660
Can't be much more than that, maybe six months at most.

1261
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,760
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

1262
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:38,980
I mean, it's not that old.

1263
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:41,020
Maybe it's, I don't know, maybe it's six months.

1264
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,740
I get the battery report back, and it

1265
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:46,460
says my battery health is down to 94%

1266
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:48,420
on this brand new laptop.

1267
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:51,280
And I know different batteries and different machines

1268
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,820
age at different rates, but this is the worst

1269
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,460
I've ever had on any laptop.

1270
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,140
I've never had a laptop within a couple of months

1271
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,520
already be below 95% or something.

1272
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,140
I mean, it's just outrageous.

1273
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:09,400
I've got laptops from 2017 that are maybe at like 86% battery

1274
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,860
health still, like they've declined at a much slower rate.

1275
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,900
I was actually upset about this, because I am very

1276
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,860
justidious about battery health.

1277
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:22,480
And so to have a 94% battery health on a brand new device,

1278
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,680
it was outrageous.

1279
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,580
Yeah, already.

1280
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,820
I mean, it's just going to make you worried about how long

1281
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:27,980
is this thing going to last.

1282
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,980
And surely that battery is soldered in there,

1283
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,580
so what can you even do about it?

1284
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:32,300
Right.

1285
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,180
And I want this thing to last forever.

1286
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:36,980
I'd love to use this thing until the wheels fall off, basically.

1287
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,860
So that's where TLP is going to help me out.

1288
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,940
One of the options when you go through this really long

1289
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:47,500
etsy-tlp.com type config, but it's very simple, very well

1290
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,660
documented with the comments just in line,

1291
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:51,900
there is a section in there.

1292
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,940
And I'm going to do this for a while,

1293
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,680
so feel free to check back in with me

1294
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:58,260
and ask me how it's working, if you want to do this

1295
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,740
for your laptop out there.

1296
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:05,540
But I'm sticking this thing to limit the charge to 60% for now.

1297
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,220
And the way you can configure it is you can say,

1298
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:11,520
charging kicks in when the battery reaches 55%,

1299
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,140
and charging discontinues when the battery reaches 60%.

1300
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,980
And so then the battery just kind of fluctuates

1301
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,500
between this 5% range.

1302
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:22,160
When it reaches the bottom of that range, it starts charging.

1303
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,480
When it reaches the top of that range, it stops charging.

1304
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,360
And then you can go in there and turn this off

1305
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,700
and let it completely cycle.

1306
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,220
And that's going to be, it's a little manual at the moment,

1307
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,940
but that's going to be my approach with this laptop going

1308
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,460
forward, because I think perhaps what had happened

1309
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:39,220
is I committed that 100% sin too many times, where

1310
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,540
I got the laptop all set up, because it's often

1311
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,020
my work from home machine.

1312
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,340
I got everything all set up on my arm

1313
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,000
and my external monitor and my external eGPU,

1314
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,140
and I just left everything plugged in.

1315
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:53,300
And I think that's sort of what brought this on.

1316
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:53,940
Yeah.

1317
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,060
It's not always easy to have time to unplug it, too, right?

1318
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,300
I mean, you've got to remember, sometimes you actually

1319
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:00,020
do just need it to work for multiple hours at a time,

1320
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,620
so it can be difficult.

1321
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:02,340
Yeah.

1322
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,900
I don't want to think about it, Wes.

1323
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,340
You know, I got other stuff to do.

1324
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,380
So this will just automate it for me.

1325
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:09,380
Even when it's plugged into AC power,

1326
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,580
it'll stop charging at 60% now.

1327
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:14,980
Now, the trick is to remember that if I need this thing out

1328
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,980
and about for like a day or so, I

1329
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:19,020
have to remember to disable this first

1330
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,420
before I take it off the charger.

1331
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:20,580
Right.

1332
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:22,980
Before you leave, remember, OK, I got to undo this.

1333
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,780
Let it charge all the way up.

1334
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,420
Is that easy?

1335
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,580
Do you have to go change the configs?

1336
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,340
Is there like a mode you can change it to?

1337
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,180
I think.

1338
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,820
I haven't really.

1339
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,420
I mean, there is for everything else in TLP,

1340
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:35,700
but I don't really see it for this option.

1341
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,060
So that is a little confusing.

1342
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,700
I'll have to watch that and see if you

1343
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,980
can do it in different modes.

1344
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,420
The orange ones, you just got yourself a ThinkPad.

1345
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,500
Have you installed this?

1346
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,660
Have you taken a look at what your battery health is?

1347
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,900
I have TLP installed.

1348
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:51,940
I've got to say the very depressing thing

1349
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,300
that it's not actually running on the machine, which sucks.

1350
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,860
But I mean, definitely after this,

1351
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,260
I'm going to have a play around.

1352
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:00,780
I've seen the TLP conf.

1353
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:02,660
It's absolutely huge.

1354
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,340
It is.

1355
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:05,140
So I'm definitely going to be playing around

1356
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:06,620
with this for the next couple of days.

1357
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,940
In part, it's so big, though, because it's documented so well.

1358
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:14,820
And there's a lot of just documentation via comments

1359
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,780
in line in the config file.

1360
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,120
The orange one, if you want to check your battery health

1361
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:24,700
right now, you can do sudo TLP-STAT space TACB.

1362
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,300
So that's TLP-STAT space TACB, and you

1363
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:28,860
have to do it with sudo privileges.

1364
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,920
And then that'll tell you, you just

1365
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,180
have to have it installed.

1366
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,820
And that'll tell you the health of your battery.

1367
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:34,420
I'm given lots of numbers.

1368
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:35,620
Any idea which one it is?

1369
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,040
Well, what you should see come back

1370
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,620
is what your current charge is and what your capacity

1371
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:41,020
percentage is.

1372
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:41,940
Oh, yeah.

1373
00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:44,060
I'm at 96.6.

1374
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,700
And your machine's from February,

1375
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,780
so your battery is at 96% of its original capacity.

1376
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,420
Yeah, that's depressing.

1377
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,300
I mean, it does spend, given it's my work machine,

1378
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,820
so working from home, it spends all of its life plugged

1379
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,020
into a Type-C monitor.

1380
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:00,540
But that's not great.

1381
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,340
I think they lose a bit almost immediately.

1382
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,500
So it's just the way lithium ion batteries work.

1383
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,100
But it's different for each battery,

1384
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,620
so it's hard to say how that one's manufactured and whatnot.

1385
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,620
But yeah, there's also TLPUI, which

1386
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:16,780
is a GTK interface for TLP that's written in Python.

1387
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,280
And I think that'll give you this information as well.

1388
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,760
And we'll have that linked to the show notes for those

1389
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,300
of you that want to try it out and get

1390
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,620
the bad news about your battery.

1391
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,460
The nice thing about the TLPUI, though,

1392
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:30,380
is it lets you go through a lot of that huge config

1393
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,540
with a graphical front end, which

1394
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,380
might have been a better way to go through it,

1395
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,220
honestly, because maybe it'd give me more

1396
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,740
kind of idea of what it does.

1397
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,980
So we'll have links to all that in there.

1398
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,100
Although I'm not sure if it'll have

1399
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,420
all the nitty gritty for each of the niche features,

1400
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,620
because while most of TLP is not ThinkPad only,

1401
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:47,140
this stuff is, right?

1402
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,020
It's dependent on your ACPI extension.

1403
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,020
So there's ThinkPad ones.

1404
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,420
There's a couple of different ones.

1405
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,580
And then that's how it reads all the smart battery

1406
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,580
information.

1407
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,220
ThinkPads are the easiest, I think.

1408
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,300
Right, well, because my understanding

1409
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,300
was there's some tools out there for ASUS and Huawei as well.

1410
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,380
But I don't think TLP currently integrates

1411
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,660
with those, unfortunately.

1412
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,220
Oh, maybe not.

1413
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:04,740
OK.

1414
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,060
Now, separate commands then?

1415
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,740
Yeah, I think they have some of their own helpers,

1416
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:09,540
because they've got the details provided

1417
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,500
by the firmware and the hooks necessary,

1418
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:13,940
but they're not talking the same language.

1419
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,900
Oh, man.

1420
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,340
94%, just outrageous.

1421
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,060
Just outrageous for a brand new machine.

1422
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,500
Now I'm going to be checking all the time.

1423
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,020
But it's really nice to see.

1424
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:24,740
TLP is just a great idea.

1425
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,740
And it's one of those things that I suspect if there could

1426
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,180
have been an alternative reality where vendors

1427
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:33,340
kept bundling this, and pre-setting it up,

1428
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:35,420
and integrating it with their laptops and whatnot.

1429
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:37,500
Because it does make your battery last longer.

1430
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,340
We've talked about it before on the show,

1431
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,500
and it still holds up.

1432
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,220
It's still a solid pick.

1433
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:42,900
There you go.

1434
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,620
Somebody think of the children, or batteries.

1435
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:48,460
Children's batteries, yeah.

1436
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:50,660
Unpluggedcore.com, that's where you become a member.

1437
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,820
Thank you to everybody who supports the show over there.

1438
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,020
You did get a special note from me a couple of weeks

1439
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:00,660
ago as a trial balloon to see if we can give discounts

1440
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,260
to our members on The Garage.

1441
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:04,860
And I did not get a single issue.

1442
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,140
In fact, the only order that had a problem

1443
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,820
was my own test order.

1444
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:11,200
Because I put some crazy character in there as a test,

1445
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,740
and it totally caused a problem.

1446
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,540
But nobody else had any problems.

1447
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:17,080
So very soon, our members will be getting exclusive discounts

1448
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,660
on Jupiter Garage original merchandise.

1449
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:24,180
The retro stuff we sell is just sold at ridiculously low prices

1450
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:24,900
already.

1451
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,140
So go over there and become a member and support

1452
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:28,380
the show at unpluggedcore.com.

1453
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,300
You get access to two different feeds.

1454
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:32,900
A limited ad feed, nice tight, same full Joe Lovin,

1455
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,700
but just a little bit shorter, because it's got limited ads.

1456
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,180
Or go the exact opposite direction.

1457
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:39,820
Go all in.

1458
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,780
Get the full live stream.

1459
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,280
All our screw ups, all the stuff that never

1460
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,780
makes it into the show, the conversations that probably

1461
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,120
should have made it into the show,

1462
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,900
but we weren't recording properly yet.

1463
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,400
All of that is in that second feed.

1464
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,980
And you get access to it, either one, as a thank you.

1465
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:55,980
Or I suppose both, if you're a maniac,

1466
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,260
like Westpain over there.

1467
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,980
That's the kind of maniac Westpain is.

1468
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,220
I'll just take all the feeds.

1469
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:01,180
I don't discriminate.

1470
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,300
That's right.

1471
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,100
Thank you to our sponsor, Cloud Guru 2.

1472
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,740
You can go find them on social media.

1473
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,820
It's pretty simple.

1474
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,640
They're just slash a Cloud Guru everywhere.

1475
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,340
And you'll find them.

1476
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,340
If there's a social media site, they probably

1477
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:15,900
have a page at slash a Cloud Guru.

1478
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,820
Thanks for joining us on today's episode.

1479
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:19,260
If you do the Twitter thing, you can

1480
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,740
follow us at Linux Unplugged.

1481
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:22,260
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1482
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,580
And the entire network of all of these fantastic podcasts,

1483
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:29,540
there's a lot more shows over at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

1484
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,940
Some of them may even have some Westpain,

1485
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:33,420
like that Linux Action News.

1486
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,340
If you work in the tech industry,

1487
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:37,900
do not miss Linux Action News.

1488
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,700
Every Monday morning, Wes and I break down

1489
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,860
everything that matters in the world of Linux.

1490
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,500
And it's a great way to get informed on your way

1491
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,340
into the office.

1492
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,700
And we do our best to make sure we get the details,

1493
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,020
that we do the research to make sure

1494
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,480
that when you listen to it, you're

1495
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,580
taking away something new, potentially,

1496
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,900
or learning something new.

1497
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,180
That's our goal with that show.

1498
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,700
Let us know how we did, something we

1499
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:58,500
try to hit every single week.

1500
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,820
See you next week.

1501
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,380
Same bad time, same bad station.

1502
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,180
That's right.

1503
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,380
You can join this show live.

1504
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,180
We keep the Linux rolling on Tuesdays.

1505
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,900
Join us at 12 PM Pacific, 3 PM Eastern.

1506
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,340
Show up and chat with Wes and I, or join our Mumble Room

1507
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:15,220
and chat with the entire world.

1508
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:17,660
And links to everything we talked about today,

1509
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:21,460
how to contact us, the Mumble server info, the Matrix server

1510
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:24,620
info, and even how to subscribe to our RSS feeds.

1511
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,740
We've put it all at linuxunplugged.com.

1512
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,620
Don't forget, though, we want your questions at asklup.com,

1513
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:32,420
or you can use the contact form.

1514
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,140
We just want a whole bunch of questions, a whole bunch.

1515
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,420
Thanks for joining us on this week's episode of the Unplugged

1516
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,260
Program.

1517
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:42,380
And we will see you right back here next Tuesday.

1518
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:47,380
Bye.

1519
00:55:47,380 --> 00:56:16,380
And we'll see you next week.

1520
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:21,220
JBtitles.com, JBtitles.

1521
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,900
Let's go boat.

1522
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,820
One last email, though.

1523
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,780
Dan wrote into the show.

1524
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,300
This is really the most important email of the day,

1525
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,260
but just made it in the post show.

1526
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,220
Texas Tendies.

1527
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,700
That's the subject, so you can tell already

1528
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,620
this is a high priority email.

1529
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,020
Says there's also Chicken Express.

1530
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,020
You guys were talking about chicken restaurants last week,

1531
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:43,020
but didn't mention Chicken Express.

1532
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,980
It's not nearly on the level of babes or canes,

1533
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,940
but I'm just so happy to hear the proper homage paid

1534
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:52,580
to the heartland of chicken.

1535
00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:53,580
Thank you, Dan.

1536
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,540
I did forget about Chicken Express.

1537
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:59,060
I just, I think a good chicken strip is a piece of art.

1538
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,220
But you know what a good chicken strip needs, Wes?

1539
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,460
A good dipping sauce.

1540
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,380
That's right.

1541
00:57:03,380 --> 00:57:06,100
Nothing like a great honey mustard or like a house sauce

1542
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,260
that's special just to that shop, you know, that place,

1543
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,420
that restaurant.

1544
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:10,380
Oh, man.

1545
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:16,580
That's quintessential American eating right there.
