1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
So, Wes, you caught this one. Maybe we could talk about this on the pre-show here.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,360
Cheapoo? Is that how you say it?

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,440
Yeah, I have no idea how to say it.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,640
Take a shot of that one.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,280
Shepow?

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,080
Shepoo?

7
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,840
Shepow. Oh, let's go with Shepow.

8
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,040
That's the most fun way, I think.

9
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:21,200
So, Shepow 23 Beta 2 is out, and Shepow is another remake of the Fedora project.

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,600
And I normally don't cover all these derivatives, but I've...

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,760
How did they... Oh, the 23 comes from Fedora.

12
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,320
Yeah, exactly.

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,560
How did they get to version 23 without me having ever heard of it or known how to pronounce it?

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,040
Magic.

15
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,840
Throw version on steroids.

16
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,040
Magic. No, yeah, it's... Yeah, because they're just basing on Fedora 23.

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,560
Here's why I think this is noteworthy.

18
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,840
Because remember how, like, before, a couple of releases ago,

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,160
like, nobody was basing stuff off Fedora anymore?

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,480
Yeah.

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,160
And now we've got a few of them.

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,400
And so these guys, they have themselves one of them good-looking desktops.

23
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,960
They've gone ahead and made things actually look usable.

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,560
And like most respins of Fedora, you get your third-party content, like your codecs

25
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,760
and your Adobe flashes and your DVD and Blu-rays.

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,760
You also got the curation.

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,440
And they say it's gaming-ready.

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,400
What do you think, Wes?

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,600
What did you think when you first found this one?

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,320
Gaming-ready?

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,120
You know, I was just surprised I hadn't heard of it before.

32
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,680
But you're right.

33
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,960
I do like to see more things based on Fedora because, I don't know,

34
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,360
I think to some users still, they're just just installing Fedora.

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,600
There's kind of a lot you have to do still to make it...

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,080
If you're used to something, you know, like Mint or something where you have

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,560
everything installed, it's ready to go, you can kind of get whatever you want.

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,600
Fedora takes a little more work.

39
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,920
So if this is like a really nice, polished...

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,200
You know who this would be good for?

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
You know who this would be really good for in like three, four, five years,

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,640
maybe just a couple of years even?

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,520
It's like Noah's kid.

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,080
Yeah, right.

45
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,520
Because Noah loves that Fedora.

46
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,480
And so BXNT in the chat room says that it's Shupow?

47
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:38,960
Shupow?

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,440
How do you...

49
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,240
Chapeau.

50
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
Chapeau, which is hat in French.

51
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,720
Yeah, it's French for hat.

52
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,280
Yeah, there you go.

53
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,760
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 120 for November 24th, 2015.

54
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,960
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that encourages you to...

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,000
Come on now.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Encourages you to brine that turkey.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,160
Wes, my name is Chris.

58
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,960
My name is Wes.

59
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,680
I know that.

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,240
You know that?

61
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,480
Yes.

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,920
I'm sitting right here. You've seen me before.

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,240
Listen, Wes, we have a huge show. It's a holiday week.

64
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,360
And we thought what we would do is get ourselves a little eggnog,

65
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,440
pour ourselves a drink, and have one of the biggest shows of the year.

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,200
That's what we thought we would do for this episode.

67
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,160
Stuff ourselves, you know?

68
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,680
Everyone else will be doing it later this week.

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:29,920
Yeah.

70
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,800
Getting started early.

71
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,440
We did have a little bit of bird tirade on the pre-show.

72
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,280
So for those of you that are joining us live,

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,680
I hope you enjoyed the warm up session where apparently I went on a complete rant against

74
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,720
having birds, but that is not going to make it into the show.

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,880
This is a Linux show, believe it or not.

76
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,560
Yeah, we're going to talk about Linux and open source things.

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,560
And to that end, one of the gentlemen from the Vivaldi project

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,720
is joining us, a new browser out for the Linux desktop.

79
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,520
After that, we're going to talk about Solus.

80
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
We're going to have the developer of the Solus project on here

81
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,240
and talk about his desktops inspired by a bird's name,

82
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,920
hence the rant earlier in the show.

83
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,080
And then, later in the show today, listen, I love Linux.

84
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,120
I love open source.

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,480
We've all been here a long time.

86
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,760
GIMP just hit 20 years old.

87
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,720
LibreOffice just got a thousand developers.

88
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,960
Big milestone, hit a thousand developers.

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
But let's be honest, these projects are still not good enough.

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,560
GIMP still isn't there yet.

91
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,680
Doesn't have CMYK support.

92
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,040
Doesn't have non-destructive editing.

93
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,320
It's still not competitive with Photoshop after 20 years.

94
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,440
Is it time to just admit that sometimes open source projects are never going to get there?

95
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,080
LibreOffice, a thousand developers, getting better all the time,

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,960
but still maybe not competitive with Microsoft Office.

97
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,920
How many developers?

98
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,480
How many years does it take until open source software

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,680
can actually compete with the commercial alternative?

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,560
Or have I got it all wrong?

101
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,920
We'll talk about that coming up at the end of today's episode of Linux Unplugged.

102
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,800
So no bird talk.

103
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,160
None of that, Wes.

104
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,600
Except for I do highly encourage you to brine your turkey.

105
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,160
Well, of course.

106
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,440
Yeah, that makes it delicious.

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,520
Go look up Alton Brown's recipe.

108
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,240
It's really good.

109
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,080
Hey, we've got a great mumble room.

110
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,960
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Dug.

111
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,460
Hello.

112
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:07,960
Hello.

113
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,460
Hello.

114
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:08,960
Hello.

115
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,460
Hello.

116
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,960
Hello.

117
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,460
Hello.

118
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:10,960
Hello.

119
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,600
OK.

120
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,080
I got to know.

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
Poppy, how do you always manage to be the first?

122
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,200
Like, what do you do exactly?

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,960
I'm in your head.

124
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,280
OK.

125
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,560
I mean, that's what I thought.

126
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,760
That's exactly what I thought.

127
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:19,920
All right.

128
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,840
Well, we have a couple of stories I wanted to follow up on

129
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,680
that are kind of big news that have broken since the Linux action show was on the air.

130
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,600
And let's start with the first one here.

131
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,960
AMD's got something for your face, an open source driver.

132
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,000
It's been released and supports the latest AMD GPUs.

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,800
The announcement has been made on the Xorg announcing mailing list

134
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
from, obviously, the Xorg Foundation.

135
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,840
And according to, I'm going to call Mr. Dan.

136
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,640
According to Mr. Dan, the brand new XF86 video AMD GPU driver,

137
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,200
version 1.00 driver, has been forked from the open source project.

138
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,400
And it has been, if you have Linux kernel 4.2, which has the new AMD GPU kernel driver,

139
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,800
then, Wes, a good batch, and I think they're in the SoftPD article they mentioned,

140
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,520
a good batch of the current Radeon cards are now supported by this totally open source driver.

141
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,360
Do you see the list there?

142
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:09,760
Here you go.

143
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,560
It's this paragraph right there.

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,200
What's that say there?

145
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,240
Oh, yeah.

146
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:12,480
OK.

147
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,240
XF86 video AMD GPU 1.0 currently supports AMD GPUs from the Fiji, Carrizo, Tonga, Stoney,

148
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,800
and Iceland.

149
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,280
There it is.

150
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,680
There it is.

151
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:21,840
Yeah.

152
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,640
So if you've got an AMD GPU in that range of cards and you've got Linux kernel 4.2,

153
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
this is some pretty exciting stuff.

154
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,280
This is some stuff that really NVIDIA hasn't even gotten to yet.

155
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,280
And it's stuff that we've been covering in the news on the Linux action show for like

156
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,320
a year now.

157
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,360
And I think we're all kind of wondering, like, OK, they've talked about doing it,

158
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,440
but when are we going to see the code shipping?

159
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,040
So here's another piece of that.

160
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,360
And Aiki, you're mentioning that 4.3 of the Linux kernel also has some more AMD GPU stuff.

161
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,920
What's that about?

162
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,920
So I was recently updating the kernel inside of Solus.

163
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,800
There's a lot more changes made for basically more devices in the 4.3 kernel.

164
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,040
And it's going to be replacing the old ancient defunct driver, which I'm just trying to find

165
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,480
out exactly how old it is.

166
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,040
One second.

167
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,160
The ancient one, huh?

168
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,520
What do you think, Wes?

169
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,720
Well, yeah, my understanding is that at least part of what this article talking about is

170
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,960
the X specific component of the driver, you know, where there's also a kernel part and

171
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,240
then the Mesa part as well.

172
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,200
And so we need all of those components to come together so that we can have a functioning

173
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,360
AMD open source graphics.

174
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:33,040
So this really could take the process of getting a semi-recent AMD GPU from one of the more

175
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,520
challenging processes to get full 3D support to potentially works right out of the box.

176
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,800
I wonder if we'll see more support, you know, I mean, I think a lot of people, the people

177
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,600
interested in gaming on Linux kind of tend to skew to NVIDIA these days, you know, maybe

178
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,560
pretty strongly.

179
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,760
I wonder if this can shake that up.

180
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,280
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
And also, could there be some other work cases?

182
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,240
You know, because I can very clearly see NVIDIA's reason.

183
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,080
NVIDIA has got their proprietary driver.

184
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,760
They have a lot of certain types of work cases that offload the different types of processing

185
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,120
to the GPU that the Linux desktop is great for different institutions.

186
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,240
I don't, AMD has those same capabilities, but I don't know if things like the, I mean,

187
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160
it seems everything's like focused on CUDA these days.

188
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,160
And I think AMD GPUs are more open CL, which is great, but I don't really, I don't know

189
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,400
what the big work case scenario is in the enterprise for AMD GPUs.

190
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,440
Maybe it's editing.

191
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,720
I'm not sure.

192
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
Aiki, did you find the info you were looking for?

193
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,840
So I had an update in 2014, another release today, so that was once a year.

194
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,720
So you can see, really, there wasn't a lot of effort going on in there.

195
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,680
Yeah, no kidding.

196
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,440
To be fair, it's better than the Nova driver.

197
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,280
I mean, that's ancient, and everyone's having to use Git build, so fair play to AMD for

198
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,720
actually maintaining something.

199
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,680
Yeah, yeah.

200
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,760
And while we're talking about the display stack, kind of a fork from that topic.

201
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,080
Fedora is seeking for some testers on Wayland.

202
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,000
You know, they're getting serious about shipping Wayland in Fedora 24 workstation.

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,440
It's become the default option already in Rawhide, the rolling development version of

204
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,160
Fedora, but the plans are not yet carved in stone for Fedora 24 to actually ship with

205
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,800
Wayland, despite what's been reported by a lot of places online.

206
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,360
And really, it kind of comes down to us.

207
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Before GNOME on Wayland becomes the default in Fedora, we need to ensure the transition

208
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,320
is smooth, says the Fedora Magazine site, and the users won't recognize a difference.

209
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:31,520
Now, that's a high bar to set, and I'm sure it's probably the same exact bar Canonical

210
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,240
must have set.

211
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,600
So we need reports on deficiencies that occur on Wayland, but not X11, and I have it linked

212
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
in the show notes, too.

213
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,520
They have a queue, well, a guide, really.

214
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,520
The Fedora QA team has written up a comprehensive guide on how to debug Wayland-related problems.

215
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,480
So if you want to see this happen, this is a real way you, as an end user, could actually

216
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,200
participate in the adoption of Wayland.

217
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,040
You could go follow these links in the show notes.

218
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
You could read their QA guide.

219
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,640
And I'm willing to bet this comprehensive guide is probably just good reading in general.

220
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,040
Yeah, probably.

221
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,360
You know what?

222
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,400
Especially if you're interested in Fedora.

223
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,600
I got it linked right here.

224
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,640
Let me go see if I can find it.

225
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,040
I'm kind of curious to see what they actually say, because this could be one of those things

226
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,880
that could really apply to a lot of things.

227
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,080
And it's really kind of nice that they did this.

228
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,840
So this is over on the Fedora Project Wiki.

229
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,920
How to debug Wayland problems.

230
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,360
Here you go.

231
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,920
They say Wayland is intended as a simpler replacement for X11.

232
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,600
It changes the design of the Linux desktop architecture.

233
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,840
That's good background information for you.

234
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,960
Yeah, exactly.

235
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:35,200
And so they have tips in here for reporting issues and looking for similar reports, how

236
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,520
to file a bug, information to include in your bug report, debugging the gnome shell.

237
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,720
See, OK, well, all those first few things are going to be good for anything, right?

238
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Debugging mutter, known issues, frequent complaints, and fundamental changes.

239
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,400
It's also really good so you're not creating dupes and things like that.

240
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,600
It's like a really good reference just for people transitioning or looking to transition

241
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,080
to Wayland.

242
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,200
Yeah, I think this is nice.

243
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,480
And this is what's really cool about when Microsoft dumps their new Windows 10 in your

244
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,440
face and tells you it's the best thing ever, and Apple tells you the next thing is magical.

245
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
I thought it was the best thing ever.

246
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,640
That's why we're using it here, right?

247
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,400
Well, maybe eventually they can get it there.

248
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,080
But in the meantime, this is something we as end users could actually go participate

249
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,560
in today.

250
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,480
I like that quite a bit.

251
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,280
And regardless of what distro you run, I would assume some of the work done here is going

252
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,120
to also help other distributions.

253
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
So it's a nice place to go.

254
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,120
And we'll have links for that information in the show notes if you guys want to get

255
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,920
involved on that.

256
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,040
I just like that kind of stuff.

257
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,320
Yeah, it's nice to see.

258
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,960
And Fedora's doing a great job of trying to push things like that.

259
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,360
Yeah.

260
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,120
Wes, you found a kickass guy that looks really nice.

261
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,520
He even has some stuff in here for the Mac users.

262
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,760
But this is the art of the command line.

263
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,040
You know, like the meta overview, the basics, everyday use, processing files and data, system

264
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,760
debugging, one liners, obscure but useful commands, and then crap just for the Mac users,

265
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,120
resources, and all kinds of stuff.

266
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,800
The art of the command line.

267
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,320
And I started reading some of this.

268
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,960
And this is a really nice guy.

269
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,920
You know, it's pretty in-depth.

270
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,920
It looks like it's been well worked over, you know, kind of only the things that need

271
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,960
to be there are there.

272
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,360
But there's a lot of stuff for, I think, any level of user.

273
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,800
I also like seeing, you know, like one of the things they have the HTTP IE program,

274
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,280
which is like a curl alternative that's a little easier for interactive.

275
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,480
Maybe you're doing like a RESTful JSON API kind of stuff.

276
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,400
They have a lot of these modern tools worked in with the classic Unix examples, which is

277
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:18,960
really nice.

278
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,920
Yeah, that is cool.

279
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,440
And it's, you know, it's a nice resource that I was looking at the edits.

280
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,480
It's getting updated fairly frequently, which is nice.

281
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,440
So you can check it out.

282
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,160
We'll have a link to that.

283
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,200
The art of the command line.

284
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
You could probably also Google and find it.

285
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,680
It is posted up on GitHub and it is all formatted in.

286
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,040
Markdown.

287
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,920
That's right, sir.

288
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,480
That's right.

289
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,960
Very good.

290
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,920
Very good.

291
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,160
So Wes, you're a trooper this week.

292
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,200
You have in here.

293
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,680
What is this?

294
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,520
Is this is this actually a Sputnik or, you know, it looks like it's one of the Sputnik

295
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:45,840
series.

296
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,640
You know, it might be.

297
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,160
I'm I'm actually not sure.

298
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,880
I didn't ask.

299
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,760
It looks just like it.

300
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,160
But it does.

301
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,800
It was actually.

302
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,560
Yes, I think it must be because on Dell's website, they have it listed with the.

303
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,440
So he's got one of these one of these Dell laptops here, like the Sputnik line.

304
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,280
And for this week, you've installed what on there?

305
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,880
Velt OS, Velt OS.

306
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,760
And Velt.io is their website.

307
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,240
Yes, sir.

308
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,320
And we're going to talk to Ike about that in a little bit to see what he thinks about

309
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,120
this.

310
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,800
But Wes has been trying out a bunch of different things.

311
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,440
And you know what?

312
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
I love it because a lot of times you come in and you've been trying out a different

313
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,400
distribution.

314
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,960
And I'm curious to know your thoughts on Antigros.

315
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,160
So check this out.

316
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Their latest ISO is laying the groundwork for a ZFS.

317
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,120
Oh, I said it.

318
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,920
ZFS kernel module in preparation for ZFS support in their future installer.

319
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,960
Hey, that's great.

320
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,280
Yeah.

321
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,160
So ZFS installation right there in the Antigros installer.

322
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,400
So you get a rolling arch based distribution with minimal modifications from upstream arch

323
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,480
with ZFS support in a GUI installer.

324
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,360
Your thoughts?

325
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,840
I love it.

326
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,560
Honestly, I don't usually install Antigros, but it is my go to live city.

327
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,760
I think it's a great environment.

328
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,400
It's polished.

329
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:52,800
It's pretty.

330
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,080
It's got that nice new mix theme.

331
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,680
And also it's arch.

332
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,240
So I know you have all the AURS support.

333
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,600
You have all the latest packages.

334
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,840
And if I want to install arch Linux, it already has all the installation tools.

335
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,800
So if I can do that and have easier ZFS support, I mean, what's not to like there?

336
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,560
I thought on the Linux action show subreddit xoo's take was the best.

337
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,360
Hey, Alan, your troubles are over, Alan.

338
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,320
That's just baiting.

339
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,880
Look at that.

340
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,360
But this is not news.

341
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,000
Like Ubuntu announced they were going to do it first.

342
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,360
Yeah, then everybody's like, oh, well, if it's OK for them to do it, then everybody

343
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,080
can do it.

344
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,120
It appears to be the case.

345
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,840
My concern is how differently it's going to be done in a bunch of different Linux's.

346
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,440
Yeah, because like it seems like only like when you're setting it up in the installer

347
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,720
as someone who's written the installer for ZFS and required multiple iterations to get

348
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,560
it right, are they going to do boot environments?

349
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,640
Because if not, they're kind of wasting their time.

350
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,160
Yeah, I certainly hope so.

351
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,840
I imagine I don't know yet because if they're going to use DKMS to make it work, then I

352
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,760
don't want my boot environment using it.

353
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
So I mean, it seems to work, but.

354
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,680
Right.

355
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,040
So, yeah, there's a bunch of questions.

356
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,640
There's having ZFS and there's booting from ZFS.

357
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,840
And then it comes out, you know, at some point, Grub would have to do a release, which they

358
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,080
haven't done in a couple of years in order to actually get all the features we push back

359
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,880
into Grub actually in a version that people might use.

360
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,760
Although random distros might just pull from their head or master branch or whatever you

361
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,880
want to call it and get.

362
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,720
But it seems like that's a bad way to run a software project.

363
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,440
What's the objection with having boot on something else and everything else like all

364
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,640
your main storage on ZFS?

365
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,600
Yeah, I don't see a downside.

366
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,480
There's no objection to that.

367
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,400
It's just you lose boot environments.

368
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:42,640
So on FreeBSD with boot environments, you can boot off an older a clone of a snapshot.

369
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,040
So, like, before you do a kernel upgrade, you can just roll back.

370
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,320
But you can roll back everything.

371
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:54,000
Before you run apt upgrade or whatever the equivalent is, you would take a snapshot and

372
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,640
you can roll back so that if the latest package update install the version of GNOME that likes

373
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,440
to crash, you can just be like, give me the one I had 10 minutes ago.

374
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,400
Oh, look, it works.

375
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,800
I don't see how having a separate boot removes your ability to do that.

376
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,320
I'm not a ZFS expert, though.

377
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,720
Well, if the separate boot is not ZFS, then it wouldn't be included in the snapshot.

378
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,720
Other file systems do snapshots, though.

379
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,400
The idea would be one set of tools, though, to manage all of it, right?

380
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,280
So, I mean, there is a disadvantage to managing ButterFS to get your boot environment working

381
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,760
again and then managing ZFS or ZFS to get your data environment and your OS environment

382
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,000
working.

383
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,800
That's not ideal.

384
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,840
It's not optimal, right?

385
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,160
Yeah, the entire point is to keep them in sync, right?

386
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,520
So, it's like, or I actually have online two separate environments that's, hey, this is

387
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,840
FreeBSD 10 with FreeBSD 10 packages and this is FreeBSD 11 with 11 packages.

388
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:52,480
The thing is, I do go back, though, rebuilding your boot environment is a pretty, like, in

389
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,040
terms of recovering your server and getting it back online, rebuilding slash boot is,

390
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
I mean, there's worse things that could happen.

391
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,960
I mean, by boot environment.

392
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,080
Boot environment is what we call the different snapshots.

393
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,440
So, that would be, what, kernel version and everything?

394
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,280
Or what exactly is a boot environment?

395
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,960
The boot environment is a complete snapshot of everything in the system except for directories

396
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,120
you exclude, like your home directory and VAR log.

397
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,720
So, it is the perfectly working kernel and packages and your entire environment that's

398
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
not volatile data, basically.

399
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,280
Sort of like Undentified is pointing out, sort of like SUSE is doing right now with

400
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,880
Snapper and ButterFS, but it's...

401
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,040
Yeah, they're copying the ZFS version.

402
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,760
But it's ButterFS.

403
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,640
Yeah, well, it's something Solaris came up with like 10 years ago, right?

404
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,360
And that's where all new technology comes from.

405
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,120
We live in the freaking Star Wars universe where we don't invent anything new.

406
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,160
We just steal older stuff and pretend like it's new.

407
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,560
Oh, God.

408
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,080
Human progress.

409
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:53,440
Why can't we live in the Star Trek universe where we actually invent new things?

410
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,600
Well, I actually...

411
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,640
Boy, that's a whole other...

412
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,000
Boy, we could do a whole episode on that.

413
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,040
Holy smokes.

414
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,640
So, I'm not quite sure how Antigros is actually...

415
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,080
Rodden, have you had a chance to look at this at all?

416
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,880
Do you have any insights on how Antigros is actually rolling this out or...

417
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,680
No, not the technical aspects of what you're talking about, like the boot environment stuff

418
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,880
like they haven't really given a full detail of that.

419
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,520
It would probably...

420
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,880
Even just usable, you know, ZFS's storage would be very nice to see on Linux.

421
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,600
Yeah, I guess it would.

422
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,080
I think as a first cut, that's almost certainly what will happen.

423
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,960
You know, those advanced restore and recovery stuff I think would be further down the line,

424
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,560
but for a first, given this is going to be our first release with it in,

425
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,000
I suspect it will be mostly focused on storage and you will have to, you know,

426
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,840
do your own thing for how you recover the things that are not ZFS

427
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,000
or the things that are not being snapshoted.

428
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,880
Right, that makes sense.

429
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,680
And that makes sense.

430
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,840
And, you know, that's how FreeBSD did it for a long time.

431
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,880
And even when it supported root on ZFS, many people were like,

432
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,520
I don't trust it enough, including myself.

433
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,160
Yeah, it would probably...

434
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,960
I still have my very first ZFS server, which is still running perfectly fine,

435
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,720
but it's still boots off UFS because I didn't trust ZFS back then.

436
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,840
Now, I actually trust UFS less, but...

437
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,680
Was that what the Chrisney says here,

438
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,320
something about the ButterFS boot support isn't in mainline grub?

439
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,680
Is that accurate?

440
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,240
It is.

441
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,280
Yeah, that does sound right.

442
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,920
It actually depends on what kind of features you've enabled in ButterFS

443
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,440
and of course, as well in ZFS.

444
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,480
I was going to say, because I use sub-volumes to boot from in grub.

445
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,320
And most distros are actually rolling a git version of grub anyway.

446
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,120
There you go.

447
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,960
Kind of taking their own snapshots over time.

448
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,440
If you look at it, it's almost certainly a git version of grub.

449
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,960
Well, it's like I said, grub really needs to, you know, do release.

450
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,720
Hey, man, I'm still sticking with Lilo.

451
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,520
So what's up?

452
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,120
Lilo for life.

453
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,080
Lilo for life.

454
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,040
That's worse than birds.

455
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,080
That's a title right there.

456
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,680
It's worse than birds.

457
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,800
You're right about that.

458
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,200
You know, speaking about living in the Star Trek universe,

459
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,680
I'll tell you what feels like living in the Star Trek universe ting.

460
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,880
Go to right now, linux.ting.com.

461
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,560
But don't get a phone.

462
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,960
This is the worst time ever to get a ting device.

463
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,680
You shouldn't get a phone.

464
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,520
Do not get anything from ting right now.

465
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,400
Okay, okay.

466
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,960
Don't do it.

467
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,600
You told me not to.

468
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,120
Yeah, no, I'm telling you right here on linux unplugged on November 24th,

469
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,760
don't buy anything.

470
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,680
It's the worst time ever to buy something from ting.

471
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,120
Because on Black Friday, they are having a crazy sale.

472
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,880
And if you can wait just a couple of days, I would definitely go that route.

473
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,440
Like 30% off some of their top devices, like free shipping,

474
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,840
starting about 8 a.m. Eastern time, the virtual doors open and you can go cray.

475
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
They got great deals on smartphones.

476
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,760
They have a really good, like the best chance to get like the ting sims.

477
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,880
If you have a couple of devices.

478
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,840
$5, maybe I'll pick up.

479
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,040
$5 sims, $5 sims, exactly.

480
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,400
And of course, free shipping on everything.

481
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
So you can, I mean, they really are $5 sims, which is awesome.

482
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,520
So go to linux.ting.com.

483
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,320
Then you can combine that with savings for our show.

484
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,720
And you support our show when you go to linux.ting.com.

485
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,600
Why go to ting?

486
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,080
Well, they have a CDMA and GSM network to get to choose from.

487
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,280
So you could be a boss.

488
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,520
But also it's pay for what you use mobile.

489
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,680
No contracts, nor the termination fees.

490
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,720
You only pay for what you use.

491
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,480
It's a flat $6 for the line.

492
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,520
So go to linux.ting.com to support the show.

493
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,000
Check them out.

494
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,960
Try out their savings calculator and go back on Black Friday.

495
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,720
Go get yourself an unlocked device.

496
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,640
Get updates from the Googs or wherever.

497
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,160
I mean, if you get a Googs phone.

498
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,120
You get the updates directly from the Googs on a network

499
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,680
that you only pay for what you use with no contract.

500
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,600
And you get to choose between CDMA and GSM.

501
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,600
That's ridiculous.

502
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,720
linux.ting.com.

503
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,640
Go check them out and go get their Black Friday sale.

504
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,960
I'm tempted to see.

505
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,480
I'm hoping there's a couple of different Android devices

506
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,920
that are on my wish list to go on sale.

507
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Oh, man.

508
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,880
That would be really exciting.

509
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,720
I'm still, where is my phone, Wes?

510
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,560
How cracked is my screen?

511
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
How many, I mean, that thing is just, it's all, Wes.

512
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,280
That is ugly.

513
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,400
It is all jacked up.

514
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,720
It is all, look, you see those chips right there?

515
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,200
Yes, I do.

516
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,640
That is a jacked up phone, Wes.

517
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,160
Kind of looks like, does it hurt to touch?

518
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,840
It actually hurts to put up to my ear.

519
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,120
Yeah, it actually does.

520
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,480
So I have, but I have been-

521
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,560
I think it's the representative of this podcast

522
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,280
and the whole network.

523
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:01,600
Thank you.

524
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,280
You just can't, you can't have a device like that.

525
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,000
I've been holding fast and waiting for the Black Friday sale.

526
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,280
Not only do I love putting a whole bunch of turkey in my mouth,

527
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,480
but I love good sales.

528
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,760

And thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged Show.

535
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,000
You guys are awesome.

536
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,360
I'm really glad you're doing such a big sale.

537
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,240
That's really cool.

538
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,120
All right, Wes.

539
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,800
So I'm really happy to recommend,

540
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,520
recommend to welcome a representative

541
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,640
from the Vivaldi Project, a new web browser,

542
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,720
really that's designed for their friends, they say.

543
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,920
They have a Linux version out.

544
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,280
You've been checking it out for a little bit.

545
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,160
Yeah, we're running it here today.

546
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,120
Yeah, I've run different builds of it all along.

547
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,640
They have the brand new beta out.

548
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,400
So I installed it last night on my rig

549
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,360
just to give it a try.

550
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,680
And Rory joins us from Vivaldi

551
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,520
to tell us a little bit about their new release.

552
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,800
Rory, welcome to Linux Unplugged

553
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,960
and congratulations on the new beta.

554
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,320
Thanks very much.

555
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,360
We appreciate it.

556
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,600
So you're trying to get the word out

557
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,080
about this desktop browser,

558
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,800
which is sort of entering maybe

559
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,320
the most competitive browser market

560
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,200
we've seen in the last few years with Chrome from Google.

561
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,760
Firefox is really doubling down on features.

562
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,720
Microsoft's got their new Edge.

563
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,680
Even Microsoft.

564
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,240
Yeah, even Microsoft, yeah.

565
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,400
And so are you guys crazy

566
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,920
or do you actually have something here?

567
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,920
You'd think so, but actually,

568
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,360
I think it's a perfect time to do it

569
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,280
because all of those browsers,

570
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,640
the ones that you mentioned,

571
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,160
they're all going in a similar direction

572
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,640
in terms of offering something very simple

573
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,360
for what they believe is the common user.

574
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,560
And what we're trying to do

575
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,080
is we're trying to make something

576
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,680
for everyone else, right?

577
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,520
The common user, but also just people

578
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,440
who want something extra and a bit different.

579
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,560
And so rather than remove features,

580
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,080
which you probably saw the other day,

581
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,880
Firefox are dropping their tab grouping solution,

582
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,240
they're dropping their themes.

583
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,520
We're adding those things.

584
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,720
So this is a browser for everyone else, if you like.

585
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,560
So are you basically saying

586
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,560
it's a browser that appeals to power users

587
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,160
but at the same time isn't too hard to use?

588
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,520
Because I'm looking at it and honestly,

589
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,080
you know, I have to say, using it,

590
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,320
it doesn't feel like a complicated browser.

591
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,480
So how are you delivering something

592
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,880
that isn't reducing features but not being complicated?

593
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,400
Because everybody else tells me

594
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,600
that's completely impossible.

595
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,080
Yeah, I think there are a few things there.

596
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,160
I mean, we've got a very good design team,

597
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,080
so I think it looks nice and clean

598
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,360
in its default layout.

599
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,440
But on top of that, what really works

600
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,720
is the technologies we're using.

601
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,640
There's been a lot of talk of making a browser

602
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,280
with HTML, JavaScript, CSS technologies,

603
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,960
and we're one of the first to release

604
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,080
and we're the first to really do it.

605
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,560
And I think that wraps up how fast we can add things.

606
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,960
And we've been trying to look at those ways of doing things.

607
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,440
Really?

608
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,400
Yeah.

609
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,560
I mean, I guess I knew that,

610
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,680
but you know, actually in using the browser in practice,

611
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,600
I have to say it, to me,

612
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,280
feels like it has the fastest UI elements.

613
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,480
It's very snappy.

614
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:56,720
Yeah.

615
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,240
I mean, very few glitches.

616
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,480
In your impression and my impression, Wes,

617
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,600
like when you pull, when you like,

618
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,800
say you bring out the bookmarks bar,

619
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,240
I mean, it immediately snaps out

620
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,240
or the downloads immediately snap out.

621
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,360
And it's animated, but it's not exaggerated animation, right?

622
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,720
Like it's like enough animation.

623
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,280
Yeah.

624
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,840
Or what I really like is the way that the tabs

625
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,720
will assume the color of the site you're on.

626
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,120
And then now the tab coloring is based on the site you're on,

627
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,520
but it all happens very nice, very quickly.

628
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,800
So I guess what kind of black magic

629
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,160
is making this feel so fast?

630
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,800
And, you know, my primary experience

631
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,840
has been on the Linux desktop,

632
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,320
but we're now today also we tried it on the Windows desktop.

633
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,760
It also feels very fast.

634
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,080
It feels like maybe it has the best scrolling

635
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,200
out of any of the browsers on the desktop here.

636
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,960
The UI elements are exceedingly snappy.

637
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,000
What is being done there to make all of that happen?

638
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,000
I think it's just a question

639
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,520
of where we are with the web today.

640
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,000
And HTML, JavaScript in particular

641
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,080
has had massive performance increases

642
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,080
and you can just do those kind of things now.

643
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,840
A few years ago, that would have been a pipe dream,

644
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,360
but now we're really there.

645
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,480
And so it's just,

646
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,240
we were the one of the first to kind of try it

647
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,440
and it seems to work well.

648
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
I think actually, I'm really glad

649
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,880
that you found it so snappy,

650
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,720
but I think there's even further we could go with that

651
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,240
because for our part,

652
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,600
we know there are things we can improve

653
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,880
and we're definitely working on them.

654
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,160
I wanted to kind of ask you

655
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,680
about the underlying technology

656
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,520
because it seems like the hard problem

657
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,280
you're gonna have with technical users

658
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,720
that are listening to our show

659
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,000
is they're gonna look at this and go,

660
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,920
well, this is based on Chrome.

661
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,680
This is a reskinning of Chromium.

662
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,240
This is Blink or WebKit.

663
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,440
And if I really just wanted to use this,

664
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,560
I could just use Chrome.

665
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,320
I don't need something that just lays down a UI

666
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,360
on top of it and has a bunch of stuff

667
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,200
just built in that I would rather use as extensions.

668
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,680
But that is not actually what's happening here.

669
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,400
What is sort of the go-to rebuttal for that?

670
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,800
I think the thing with extensions,

671
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,520
I mean, they're great.

672
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,680
I used to work at Opera before

673
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,240
and I had 20 plus extensions.

674
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,560
They're good, but they often get in the way

675
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,880
or there's an upgrade and something slightly out of sync

676
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,800
and this extension doesn't work anymore.

677
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,560
So it's about giving a whole package

678
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,640
and making it very simple.

679
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,560
You go into settings, you switch something on,

680
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,520
you switch something off.

681
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,280
You don't have to go and find the extensions.

682
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,520
You install the browser somewhere else.

683
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,960
It's just tweaking a few settings

684
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,160
and you're back to where you were.

685
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,400
So I think it's just that simplicity,

686
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,520
that ease of being exactly how you want it straight away

687
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
without having to configure 20 extensions

688
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,000
or worry about will the next upgrade,

689
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,280
will this break my extensions?

690
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,760
It feels to me like it's a guarantee of some features.

691
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,960
Like, well, these are important enough

692
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,040
that they're in our core feature set.

693
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,560
We will, these will always work

694
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,800
and they will work in a really well, really good way.

695
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,280
And like, you know, one of the good examples of that

696
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,280
and this one that I wonder if people have really explored much

697
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,880
is the taking notes and things like that

698
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,320
just built right in.

699
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,200
But you know, Rory, I wonder, it feels like today,

700
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,640
the biggest thing that I miss

701
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,680
when I switch from say Chrome to another browser

702
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,120
is now today when I install Google Chrome,

703
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,760
one of the first things that happens is Google says,

704
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,240
hey, why don't you log into your Google account?

705
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,680
And at the moment that I do that, it pulls down everything.

706
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,560
All of my extensions, all my themes, all my bookmarks

707
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,000
and not only that,

708
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
but it logs me into all the Google properties,

709
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,160
which is a major convenience.

710
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,400
And so when I look at switching to a new browser,

711
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,240
like I did last night when I switched to Vivaldi,

712
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,680
I had to go through the process of importing bookmarks

713
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,320
and all these things.

714
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,200
And I wonder, do you feel like perhaps

715
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,280
this is the biggest area of competition

716
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,480
where the browser maker, like Firefox as well,

717
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,840
now has this sync service.

718
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,400
And essentially it's this backend infrastructure

719
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,080
I rely on for some of these browsers

720
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,160
that's the most appealing aspect to them.

721
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,880
And how does Vivaldi sort of draw me away from that

722
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,840
and give me something else that says maybe also competitive?

723
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,320
Well, I think something you should bear in mind

724
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,840
is we're not anti-sync at all.

725
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,240
I mean, it's something we've put a lot of man hours into,

726
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,840
but we're not quite there yet,

727
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,280
but we fully intend to have sync.

728
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,240
So those kind of things will appear in Vivaldi in the future.

729
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,800
But we're coming up to our first version.

730
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,680
We've just had one beta, so we're not quite there yet.

731
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,760
But yeah, sync is something we want as well.

732
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,200
And sync is something that we intend to deliver in the long run.

733
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,040
So they'll essentially be sort of the same kind of implementation

734
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,200
that I will be able to sync those things across.

735
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,760
And one of the kind of nice power user features I noticed

736
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,440
is right out of the box, you can check a box,

737
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,400
you have a dark theme.

738
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,280
Love that.

739
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,800
Also something else that's very cool

740
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,680
is there is a quick commands, like you hit F2,

741
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,000
and it's a keyboard-based command system for the browser.

742
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,080
Really like that a lot.

743
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,160
What other kind of power user features are in Vivaldi

744
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,120
that maybe I'm not familiar with?

745
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,240
You mentioned the panels on the side

746
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,400
and things that you sort of like notes,

747
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,680
but we also have panels for each of our different properties.

748
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,840
And we also have a thing where you can add a panel.

749
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,880
If you click on the plus, you can add a URL,

750
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,960
and it will add that as a page.

751
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,840
It actually sends a phone user agent.

752
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,800
So it usually gets a page optimized for a phone,

753
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,160
so it has the right size.

754
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,920
And then it's a way of like adding an app

755
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,800
or checking on something.

756
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,520
You can add a page which has maybe nice RSS feed

757
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,720
or some news items,

758
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,640
or maybe you want to stick Twitter in there

759
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,040
and then you can keep track on Twitter or Facebook

760
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,640
or whatever it is you're interested in.

761
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,760
You just add that in the side

762
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,280
and then you can carry on watching.

763
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,520
I love that actually.

764
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,800
That's really cool.

765
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,080
Yeah, that's a great idea.

766
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,640
Picture in picture.

767
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,240
You mentioned the quick commands.

768
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,480
The quick commands, I don't know how much you played with them,

769
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,640
but when you're typing, it can be both,

770
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,160
you can type addresses in there.

771
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,840
It will search your address book.

772
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,280
It will give you the option to search,

773
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,840
but it also will narrow down your list of tabs.

774
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,520
So it's a way to switch tabs.

775
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,400
It also will allow you to type actual commands.

776
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,720
So when you said, when it's called quick commands,

777
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,360
it really means that.

778
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,280
So for example, if I type new,

779
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,960
you'll see in the list below the search engine,

780
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,120
it says new window, new tab, new.

781
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,920
And so they're commands that you can just hit enter on,

782
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,400
arrow down and hit enter and it does the action.

783
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,320
Yeah, like a new private window, for example.

784
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,880
Yeah.

785
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,440
Very cool.

786
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:53,920
That's very nice.

787
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,600
As someone who's used a lot of like,

788
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,240
you know, like VI type extensions for other browsers,

789
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,600
having those kind of quick commands

790
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,040
just from the keyboard is really nice.

791
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,440
Yeah.

792
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:01,680
Yeah.

793
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,960
I think having it built in and making sure it works is what helps.

794
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,200
I mean, we have other things as well.

795
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,040
We have a keyboard navigation.

796
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,040
If you go to a page and you hold shift,

797
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,600
you could use arrow keys to go around on links and so on.

798
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,240
And then you can hit enter to go on the links.

799
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,760
I like that.

800
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,240
We also have tab stacking.

801
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,400
So again, you can drag one tab over another.

802
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,120
They will combine.

803
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,840
They're a stack.

804
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,560
You might keep maybe a stack of, say, you're looking,

805
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,360
you're doing shopping or you search for various things

806
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,000
on Google.

807
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
That is really cool.

808
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,640
Yeah, I'm seeing that.

809
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,800
And when you're done, you just delete the whole stack.

810
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,640
You can also, things that are in a stack,

811
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,480
you can right click on the stack and you can choose to tile it.

812
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,160
So you can see two sides, side by side.

813
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,120
Oh, I got to try that.

814
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,680
All right.

815
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,640
I got to try that.

816
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,280
I got to try that.

817
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
So I will open up a couple of tabs here.

818
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,960
And I will drag a couple of episodes

819
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,720
of Jupyter broadcasting on top of stuff.

820
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,880
Oh, it's kind of hard to drag it on top of stuff.

821
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,360
But I see.

822
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,280
I'm bound and determined, Wes.

823
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,320
I'm bound and determined to do it.

824
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,920
I think once you just get over it a little bit,

825
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,840
like when the back one fades, then you can do it.

826
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,240
Yeah, OK.

827
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,560
There you go.

828
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,360
It colors slightly.

829
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,160
There you go.

830
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,680
OK, so then how do I stack them?

831
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,320
What do I do now?

832
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,120
OK, there's a couple of different ways you can do it.

833
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,760
There's down at near the bottom of the UI.

834
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,320
Oh, I see.

835
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:10,880
To the bottom right, there's a little.

836
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,400
Oh, my gosh.

837
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,520
You've got tile.

838
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,240
Oh, my gosh.

839
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,440
That is so cool.

840
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,800
That is so cool.

841
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,560
I'm glad you like it.

842
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,200
Yeah.

843
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,720
That is really kind of something, isn't it?

844
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,640
I could see people, though, who keep

845
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,760
track of a lot of different things.

846
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,520
You know, you're kind of trying to get an overview,

847
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,480
or you have to monitor a certain thing.

848
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:26,880
Yeah.

849
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,000
Or I was, you know, social media feeds, RSS feeds.

850
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,240
Yeah.

851
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,560
Monitoring for your like, you know,

852
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,800
uptimes and like Nagios type stuff.

853
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,040
Exactly.

854
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,000
That could be super cool.

855
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,520
Huh.

856
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,920
Now, producer Rottencorp, you had something

857
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,640
you want to jump in here with the web panels and extensions

858
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,320
and things and quick options and things like that.

859
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:44,820
Go ahead.

860
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:45,840
Yeah.

861
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,920
One of the things I found out that I really liked about it

862
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,520
was one of the, like, there was an extension I had to test

863
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,160
some, like, the tab group concept that Firefox has since

864
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,120
they're getting rid of it.

865
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,800
I was wondering if there was something you could do with,

866
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,760
like, Baldi or something.

867
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,120
Yeah.

868
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,240
I mean, the tab stack.

869
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,480
I actually took, I found a cool extension.

870
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,200
And you can take the extension controls

871
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,120
and turn it into a web panel so that you always

872
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,960
have that extension just quick shortcut.

873
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,200
OK.

874
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,840
You can have, like, just the options and the controls

875
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,160
for a particular extension can also be it.

876
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,280
So it doesn't have to be a website.

877
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,160
So this is a pretty competitive market, Rory.

878
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,400
Do you suppose that the market for the Vivaldi browser

879
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,920
is the user who wants something a little more capable

880
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,640
than just the sort of watered down mainstream browser?

881
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,920
Or is it somebody that is, like, doing research?

882
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,000
What's the, like, when you look at the core demo

883
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
for the Vivaldi browser, who is it?

884
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,800
And why is the Linux desktop part of that story?

885
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,960
I think it is for those types of users,

886
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,320
but I don't think it's only them.

887
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,000
I mean, a lot of people used to joke back

888
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,040
when we worked at Opera about Opera having no users.

889
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,600
But I was there when we had 60 million users

890
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,760
back for Opera 12 and so on.

891
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,400
And there are a large number of people,

892
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,240
more than you would think, who like to have,

893
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,600
maybe even it's just one feature.

894
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,800
They just appreciate one thing.

895
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,160
They appreciate having notes.

896
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,000
And they don't use any other power user features.

897
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,800
Or they just appreciate having web panels.

898
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,960
So I think it's bigger than that.

899
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,160
But yeah, sure.

900
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,720
I mean, that's our core demographic right now.

901
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,080
That's who we focused on.

902
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,120
The browser is, we call it a browser for our friends.

903
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,680
And really, Jan von Teichner, who's the founder

904
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,520
of both Opera and now Vivaldi,

905
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,360
I mean, that is really what he meant by.

906
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,800
He's making it for the kind of people

907
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,960
who are real fans of the old Opera,

908
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,640
for people like him, for people who want

909
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,720
those power user features first and foremost.

910
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,400
We expect others will come as well.

911
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,520
And then I'm wondering, Rory,

912
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,880
if there's anything you could comment.

913
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,800
I mean, legitimately, if I'm gonna switch to this

914
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,880
as my main browser, one of the first questions

915
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,880
that comes to mind is what steps is Vivaldi taking

916
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,280
to ensure my privacy when you're looking at

917
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,200
upstream Chromium code and you're making

918
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,560
a browser based off that?

919
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,960
Is there things being removed that Google includes?

920
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,720
Is there any kind of tracking?

921
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
What's the privacy situation with the Vivaldi browser

922
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,880
versus, say, the upstream project?

923
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,400
Yeah, if you open the settings, just Alt-P

924
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,240
and go to privacy, you'll see that there's

925
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,240
a bunch of stuff that you can tick off.

926
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,400
So if you don't like the Google phishing

927
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,840
and malware protections, for example,

928
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,560
you switch that off.

929
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,840
You switch off diagnostics.

930
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,400
Whatever you don't feel comfortable with,

931
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,440
you can just switch that off.

932
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
We also looked at some of the options.

933
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,480
Like, for instance, some people are worried

934
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,960
about the amount of data that, say, Google collects.

935
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,200
And so when we came to do our HTML5 notifications,

936
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,400
when we came to look at things like tracking,

937
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,880
so when you're on Google Maps and you click

938
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,120
to find your location, a lot of people

939
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,480
use a Google service for that.

940
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,360
We actually use one provided by the guys at Mozilla

941
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,520
just to give something different.

942
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,680
So we do look at those kind of issues.

943
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,280
And if people raise them, if they say,

944
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,120
you know what, I don't like the way you do this,

945
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,920
or I feel like this is some form of tracking,

946
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,520
we are very open to adding options

947
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,880
for those kind of things.

948
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,600
Yon has like a catchphrase, which is basically,

949
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,280
when in doubt, we'll add an option.

950
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,080
And we really do do that, which is why a browser which

951
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,560
hasn't even been released has so many options already.

952
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,080
I have to appreciate that.

953
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
As somebody who's been using the web browser

954
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,880
for more than six months, it turns out

955
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,040
it's really nice to actually have some configuration

956
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,480
control over some of these things.

957
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,080
So I really do appreciate that.

958
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,520
Roy, is there anything else you want to touch on

959
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,440
before we wrap up on all this stuff?

960
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,320
This has been really cool.

961
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,120
The only thing I'd like to say is that the Linux community

962
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,320
have been great with us.

963
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,560
And at the moment, we have two package types.

964
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,920
We have RPMs and devs.

965
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,760
We do really support the browser with as many distros

966
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,480
as possible, though.

967
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,040
The only reason we don't do more packaging types

968
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,440
is simply because we think that the distros do it better.

969
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,960
So I think it'll happen more when we get to final.

970
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,680
Distros may consider putting us in one repository or another,

971
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,960
which is appropriate.

972
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,200
But we would like to work with package maintainers

973
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,040
to get native packages, because we think that's

974
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,560
the best experience for users.

975
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,080
Our packages are OK, but people who do packaging all the time

976
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,880
do a much better job.

977
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,920
Yeah, I was very thankful.

978
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,640
It was really easy to install from the Arch user repository.

979
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,440
They have the beta in there.

980
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,960
They have the git build, and they have the stable.

981
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,320
And I just installed that real quick,

982
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,720
and I was able to use it for the evening.

983
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,960
You know, actually, the one bit of feedback I would have

984
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,560
is I wasn't able to watch Netflix.

985
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,240
I wanted to watch the new Jessica Jones series,

986
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,160
and I couldn't watch it in the Vivaldi browser.

987
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,280
OK, yeah, we're looking at the Widevine support now.

988
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,160
That's a proprietary component that we have to pick up from.

989
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,280
Yeah, we do do a little trick right now,

990
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,360
because we have to test these things internally.

991
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,680
If you got it from Arch, there's a package there

992
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,120
in the recommends that they suggest,

993
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,720
which gives you H.264 support.

994
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,360
If you install that, we'll also do another trick.

995
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,120
If Chrome happens to be installed,

996
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,360
like as a test while we're seeing how this works,

997
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,680
we'll use their Widevine installation that is there.

998
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,200
So you should be able to use it if Chrome's installed them.

999
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,280
And of course, we don't want to encourage you to install Chrome,

1000
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,120
but just in the interim thing.

1001
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,400
Yeah, all right.

1002
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,400
And Rory, if you wouldn't mind, Heaven's Revenge

1003
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,560
has a couple of questions that he wants to ask.

1004
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,280
Go ahead, Heaven's.

1005
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,440
And I would be curious to hear what you think,

1006
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,560
because I've been using it.

1007
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,440
I've been pretty impressed.

1008
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,400
So fire away.

1009
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,240
Hello.

1010
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,520
Well, I used to be a very massive Opera 15 or 12 fan

1011
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,560
back in the day.

1012
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,800
But this is basically a reborn version of the old Opera,

1013
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,320
a nice customizable power user version of Opera.

1014
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,840
What prevents another company from just buying Vivaldi out

1015
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:39,120
and changing the new wicked Vivaldi into the new Opera

1016
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,120
that doesn't have all the power user options

1017
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,400
and just destroys the old user power user base

1018
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,120
that we used to...

1019
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,280
It was beautiful, the old Opera.

1020
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,880
And it's just saddening.

1021
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,240
And I would hate for the same thing to happen to Vivaldi now.

1022
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,160
I think there's an interesting story there.

1023
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:54,960
If you look at...

1024
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,760
I don't know how much...

1025
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,160
If you're an old fan, you probably remember Jon Pontechno,

1026
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,920
one of our two founders of Opera.

1027
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,000
And he's the guy who runs Vivaldi.

1028
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,480
And it got to a situation where obviously there were more

1029
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,640
and more shareholders involved,

1030
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,880
and they were able to do things outside of maybe

1031
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,240
the way he would have liked it to go.

1032
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,840
I think what we have at Vivaldi is what Jon would have wanted

1033
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,640
Opera to be.

1034
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,240
Our company is wholly owned by him really at the moment.

1035
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,080
I mean, the employees have small amounts of share,

1036
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,280
but I don't think this is intended to be floated anytime soon.

1037
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,040
This is a reaction to the fact that Opera isn't the way

1038
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,040
people like Jon wanted it to be.

1039
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,920
And so there's kind of a protection there in a way.

1040
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,000
He's not going to sell this out anytime soon.

1041
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,400
And that those of us who have small shareholdings in it,

1042
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,200
neither are we.

1043
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,680
This is...

1044
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,600
I don't think this is going to be floated anytime soon.

1045
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,840
So he's more of the embodiment of the old loved Opera

1046
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,120
that we all used to love.

1047
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,400
Very much so, very much so.

1048
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,280
I mean, Jon is very much that kind of a guy.

1049
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,600
I mean, a lot of us joined purely because it was him

1050
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,280
and we know his thoughts on the matter.

1051
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,200
I mean, I myself was working at Opera.

1052
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,400
I had a job there.

1053
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,960
There was...

1054
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,320
Not long ago, I don't know how much you follow the news,

1055
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,720
a bunch of people were fired from the Oslo office.

1056
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,520
I was not, but I quit because I specifically wanted to work

1057
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,080
with Jon because I know how he feels about these things.

1058
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,640
So what...

1059
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,880
You know, this is a horrible question to ask really,

1060
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,320
because nobody likes to talk about this.

1061
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,960
But also, I kind of wonder...

1062
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,000
I totally grok why Google makes a browser,

1063
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,200
makes sense, I even grok why Apple and Microsoft

1064
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,720
make their crappy browsers.

1065
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
I understand why Mozilla does it.

1066
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,680
What is the long-term sort of revenue model?

1067
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,640
What's the path to success for Vivaldi?

1068
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,400
Obviously, you're probably not going to charge

1069
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,000
for the browser itself.

1070
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,400
And it may not be in stone yet, but is there sort of...

1071
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,800
As somebody who might become really passionate about this,

1072
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,240
I like to know you guys are going to be around here

1073
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,640
for say, five, 10, 15 years.

1074
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,600
What's going to make that happen?

1075
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,560
I mean, the revenue model is actually the same

1076
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,160
as we had at Opera.

1077
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,960
It's the same way that Firefox makes their money.

1078
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,560
I mean, there are a few things that you can do

1079
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,760
to make money from the users, which also benefit the users.

1080
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
One of them is doing search partnerships,

1081
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,160
and that's where most of the browsers nowadays

1082
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,440
make most of their money.

1083
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,080
So like, a fraction of a fraction of a penny

1084
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,920
for every X number of searches we get paid on.

1085
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,600
And so we add some search engines there

1086
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,720
and we do deals with them.

1087
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,240
We do other small deals as well,

1088
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,400
but the idea that we always had at Opera,

1089
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,520
and I think we did quite well,

1090
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,880
is to add things that are both benefits to the user

1091
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,760
and benefits to us.

1092
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,680
I mean, people want those search engines anyway, right?

1093
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,040
Sure, yeah.

1094
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,960
You try to walk that line.

1095
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,560
Yeah, exactly, try to walk that line.

1096
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,800
And it was feasible to do at Opera.

1097
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,960
You need some millions of users to make it work,

1098
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,120
but I think that we can get to those millions of users

1099
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,560
and it should be self-sufficient.

1100
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,680
As it happens now,

1101
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,760
to show you the level of commitment that Jon has,

1102
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
I mean, he's bankrolling pretty much this

1103
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,600
until we get to that level.

1104
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,840
So when I said he's making this for his friends,

1105
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,680
he's doing it, he's putting himself on the line

1106
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,720
and he's gonna make it happen.

1107
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,360
So, you know, I think you can feel comfortable

1108
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,920
because it's different from the old Opera

1109
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,920
in that he has much more control here.

1110
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,640
And so, of course, we are on Linux Unplugged

1111
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,480
and one of the questions can probably be very nicely

1112
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,520
summed up by Heaven's Revenge.

1113
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,760
I think Heaven's Revenge, you've been asking,

1114
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,320
what's sort of the open source story here?

1115
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,360
We know it's built on top of some open source technologies,

1116
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:10,240
but some of the things that the Vivaldi's offering

1117
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,040
are closed source.

1118
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,560
And Heaven's, I don't mean to cut off your question,

1119
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,480
but is that essentially what you're asking?

1120
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,480
Yes, considering they were touting how fast and fluid

1121
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,760
their user interface is.

1122
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,320
And it is.

1123
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,640
Because it is JavaScript and CSS based.

1124
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,400
And since the old, or at least Chromium project

1125
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,920
is what they're based upon,

1126
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,720
will they go down the old path of Opera,

1127
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,400
which is a closed project and a proprietary one,

1128
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,800
which prevents a default installation

1129
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,600
on a lot of live disks and a lot of distributions?

1130
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,160
Yeah.

1131
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,840
That is what prevented Opera from being so widely used

1132
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,120
on a lot of distributions.

1133
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,600
Being legally allowed to, yeah,

1134
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,800
like so could a distribution legally redistribute the browser.

1135
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,440
Right.

1136
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,120
And honestly, there's a lot of people out there

1137
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,360
that are looking at this thinking,

1138
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,400
if I'm going to switch to something,

1139
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,320
I want to be able to trust it.

1140
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,640
It's a little more trustworthy if it's open source.

1141
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,480
Or at least Firefox and Chromium

1142
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,600
just because they're open source.

1143
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,880
So Ubuntu won't even give Chrome,

1144
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,640
because of its closed nature,

1145
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,640
Chromium or Firefox is their default options.

1146
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,320
Unfortunately, to that end too, yeah.

1147
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,000
So what do we get?

1148
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,880
So, okay.

1149
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,240
So there are a couple of things there.

1150
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,360
Firstly, all the stuff on Chromium,

1151
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,360
all of the C++ code and everything that makes up Chromium,

1152
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,800
the changes that we make there are essentially to run our UI,

1153
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,920
which is written in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and so on.

1154
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,560
And all of those changes we make,

1155
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,640
some of it we'd have to anyway,

1156
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,160
but not everything because there are different licenses

1157
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,600
in Chromium and Blink and so on.

1158
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,760
We put up a source code.

1159
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,720
If you go to vivaldi.com slash source,

1160
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,960
you can download the source code package.

1161
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,440
And that is basically the Chromium version

1162
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,560
we're currently based off plus all of our changes.

1163
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,840
And any change that we made will either match license,

1164
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,000
say for example, if we'd adjusted FFmpeg,

1165
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,600
we haven't, but it's LGPL,

1166
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,320
it would inherit the LGPL license.

1167
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,640
In any other case, we give it under a BSD license.

1168
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,240
The details are explained in the readme

1169
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,520
and the license file and so on.

1170
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,040
So it's only our UI, which is proprietary.

1171
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,000
That is, however, auditable because it's,

1172
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,520
you can just get that from the package,

1173
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,400
the regular package.

1174
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,600
I mean, it's just, as I said, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

1175
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:25,360
It is minified, but you can go through it

1176
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,760
and see what it's doing and people have tweaked it.

1177
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,200
We have talked internally about possibilities

1178
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,600
for other licenses and it's definitely a door

1179
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,480
that's open to us.

1180
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,480
I think that there are people here

1181
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,680
who want that in the team

1182
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,920
and that our whole team works together

1183
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,320
so we can make that happen, maybe.

1184
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,080
But I'm not gonna promise it,

1185
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,760
but it's definitely something we look at.

1186
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,840
And it is a box that is already being called Pandora

1187
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,280
because there's a distribution

1188
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:54,560
we're gonna talk about later in the show today

1189
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,880
that's already shipping with Vivaldi as the default browser.

1190
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,760
And you know, we're fine with that.

1191
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,720
We're absolutely fine with that.

1192
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,640
I mean, in Opera back in the old days,

1193
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,680
the Opera 12 days,

1194
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,320
we had a situation where the license for...

1195
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,120
It was quite a proprietary company in some ways,

1196
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,440
but we had a license for Linux,

1197
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,520
which was different from the other desktop browsers,

1198
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,800
and it allowed redistribution and repackaging

1199
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,000
to fit the distro.

1200
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,600
At some point, we tweaked the license unintentionally

1201
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,080
and basically, if you read it literally,

1202
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:25,760
it didn't look like you could redistribute

1203
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
and a bunch of distros actually dropped us

1204
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,720
and it was sad.

1205
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,960
And it was a lot of effort to get us back in Arch.

1206
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,640
I did a lot of the community work there.

1207
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,320
I maintained the package myself for a while.

1208
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,480
I got another guy to take over.

1209
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,280
He's actually the guy who maintains the Vivaldi package now.

1210
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,240
He's one of our volunteers.

1211
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,320
We have a small volunteer team who help us as well.

1212
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,240
So, you know, we would bend over

1213
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,480
to kind of help people get it in the distro.

1214
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,000
We would really help them.

1215
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,360
If they wanna get something in the distro,

1216
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,160
we'll see if we can do...

1217
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,640
Tweet the license if that it needs be.

1218
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,960
We just, we try to protect certain things.

1219
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,160
I get, maybe it's the wrong word,

1220
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,720
but we are willing to work with distros

1221
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,320
to allow them to distribute it.

1222
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,000
It also suits them.

1223
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,600
Lovely.

1224
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,040
Well, I have...

1225
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,320
John is an amazing guy.

1226
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:11,520
Hey, Chris.

1227
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,720
No, go ahead.

1228
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,960
John was a great man,

1229
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,960
but I don't want him to bring his mistakes of Opera into Vivaldi.

1230
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,680
Hopefully he learned from the potential mistake

1231
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,200
of being the browser closed

1232
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,440
and not make the same mistake with Vivaldi.

1233
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,240
I think that John is open to things.

1234
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,680
As I said, I don't wanna promise stuff

1235
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,640
because it's still discussions we have internally,

1236
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,640
but I think he's very much open to things.

1237
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,720
He likes people messing with the browser.

1238
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,800
Back in the old days in Opera,

1239
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,920
we had a situation where there was a guy there

1240
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,360
who was just a fan

1241
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,720
and he used to binary patch Opera to tweak certain things.

1242
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,280
Later on, because he was interesting in the community,

1243
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,000
we hired him.

1244
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,680
That part is great.

1245
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,160
Yeah, there you go.

1246
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,280
So we're not anti-people messing with it.

1247
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,520
And some of them, as I mentioned briefly,

1248
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,040
we have this volunteer community,

1249
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,600
a group of people who just help us out for free,

1250
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,800
who are like in a circle.

1251
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,000
They end up on our Slack channel and so on.

1252
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,960
One of them is the package maintainer

1253
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,240
and those guys have been tweaking

1254
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,920
and adjusting small things here and there.

1255
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,720
Okay, so to sort of summarize for those listening,

1256
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,040
if you are creating a Linux distribution today,

1257
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,000
the Vivaldi project on the most part

1258
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,360
is okay with you including it in your distribution by default.

1259
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,240
Is that correct?

1260
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,760
Yes, yeah, yeah, that is.

1261
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,920
And if they want to tweak the packaging slightly,

1262
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,600
because not everyone's RPM on dev

1263
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,120
or they hate our RPM on dev,

1264
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,640
so we're cool with that as well.

1265
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,360
Sure.

1266
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,360
All right, so we'll have links to download it

1267
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,160
in the show notes.

1268
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,600
It's also in a lot of distributions repositories already.

1269
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,600
And I have to say, it's pretty exciting

1270
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,320
because it's fast, it is very feature rich.

1271
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:47,440
And if you need to take notes,

1272
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,800
if you do research and things like that,

1273
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,640
it has some of that stuff built in,

1274
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,920
which is nice because I have yet to find an extension

1275
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,600
that doesn't drive me fricking crazy

1276
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,800
that does that kind of functionality.

1277
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,960
So it's nice to just have that included in the browser.

1278
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,960
And also feel like the UI makes my computer

1279
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,000
feel like a super machine.

1280
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,520
Like everything snaps open super fast.

1281
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,440
I'm like, oh yeah, it's 2015.

1282
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,880
So if you want a browser that feels like that,

1283
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,920
go check out Vivaldi.

1284
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,120
We have a link in the show notes.

1285
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:11,040
Rory, thank you for joining Linux Unplugged

1286
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,400
and telling us a little bit about it.

1287
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,000
And congratulations on the new release.

1288
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,520
Yeah, thanks a lot.

1289
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:16,960
All right, so check it out.

1290
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,480
We'll have a link in the show notes.

1291
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,960
And Wes, what do you think after using it for a bit?

1292
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,160
Your closing thoughts, sir.

1293
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,200
I haven't heard from you.

1294
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,680
You know, I'm really happy to hear

1295
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,960
that it's built on standard technologies, HTML, CSS.

1296
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,640
I have mixed feelings about the closed source nature,

1297
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,920
but it does perform really well.

1298
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,520
And it is built a lot on our open source tools

1299
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,200
that we use anyway, Chromium, et cetera.

1300
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,240
This is what I like about it.

1301
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,520
What I like about it is it adds some competition

1302
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,320
to this landscape.

1303
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,680
Yeah, I think it brings a lot of, you know,

1304
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,560
it's well designed.

1305
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,600
It brings a lot of features.

1306
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,520
And even if I don't end up sticking with it,

1307
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,760
I think it should probably help the ecosystem.

1308
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:54,080
And I feel like it's a pragmatic competitor

1309
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,880
in the sense that it acknowledges some of the innovations

1310
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,480
that Google have done are legitimate,

1311
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,240
and they really have brought some new blood

1312
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,600
into the web browser market.

1313
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,400
But at the same time, it's sort of pulling away

1314
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,160
some of the black magic and allowing you access

1315
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,200
to some of those privacy things,

1316
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,640
like being able to opt out of Google's content filter

1317
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,240
is actually a big deal because that means

1318
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,480
you're sending them a hell of a lot less data.

1319
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,480
And it's nice to see someone using the Chromium base

1320
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,800
that's not Google but that has a little more heft,

1321
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,880
you know, like this will exist for a while.

1322
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,840
Right, also, and this is kind of my closing thought on it,

1323
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,200
what I really like about it is you have a group

1324
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,240
that is just legitimately focused on a great browser.

1325
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,360
Yes, exactly.

1326
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,520
At the end of the day, Google is focused

1327
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,600
on collecting data, selling, advertising,

1328
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,960
and really moving their whole web agenda forward

1329
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,440
because the web is very important to Google as a company.

1330
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,560
Chrome is just a piece.

1331
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,480
Chrome is an important piece to that.

1332
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,080
One of the things about the Mozilla Foundation,

1333
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,560
and obviously with Vivaldi and other projects like them,

1334
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,240
I really, really respect the fact

1335
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,640
that what they actually are focused on for the most part

1336
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,760
is just creating a great browser.

1337
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,360
Now, the Mozilla Foundation, you know,

1338
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:00,560
that's not their only focus,

1339
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,160
but it's a huge part of their focus.

1340
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,160
And at the end of the day, as a user,

1341
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,920
I really like where their intentions begin.

1342
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,280
And I think that's really awesome too,

1343
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,080
so I'm glad to have another thought leader in that space.

1344
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:10,560
So check it out.

1345
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,760
We'll have links in the show notes.

1346
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,840
And in the meantime, I encourage you to spend

1347
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,840
your holiday weekend not consuming turkey

1348
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,600
but checking out DigitalOcean.

1349
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,960
Head over to digitalocean.com

1350
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,880
and use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED,

1351
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,360
DOUNPLUGGED, one word, lowercase.

1352
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,120
You know, it's way better for the waistline.

1353
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:25,680
Exactly.

1354
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,440
Don't eat that stuffing.

1355
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:27,920
Nope.

1356
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:29,360
Don't eat that crap cranberry from the can.

1357
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,240
Ignore your family.

1358
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,320
You should play around with DigitalOcean instead.

1359
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:34,320
Which is way better for your psychology.

1360
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,360
Let's be honest.

1361
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:36,080
You know what, guys?

1362
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:36,800
Here's the thing.

1363
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,600
I am 33 going on 34.

1364
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,000
And let me tell you something.

1365
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:42,960
It doesn't get any better.

1366
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,360
The family is, it is...

1367
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,360
Let me tell you something.

1368
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,280
The family, you could just avoid that.

1369
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,680
I can tell you after 33 years, just avoid them.

1370
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,520
This is my personal recommendation.

1371
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:54,880
Stay home and play with DigitalOcean.

1372
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,520
And if you're not going to do that, like I tell you to,

1373
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,600
that's Chris's personal recommendation.

1374
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,800
Don't get mad at him, folks.

1375
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,400
Yeah, hey, I warned you.

1376
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,600
Just carve, if you'll excuse the pun,

1377
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,400
carve a little time aside to go play with DigitalOcean

1378
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,840
and use the promo code DOUNPLUGGED.

1379
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,440
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider

1380
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,000
dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way

1381
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,600
for you to get your own Linux rig

1382
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,600
up on their super awesome SSD-based cloud

1383
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,120
with 40 gigabyte connections all running on KVM

1384
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,480
with Linux as the infrastructure

1385
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,720
because Linux is a boss, right?

1386
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,520
So they got KVM, which is a super great virtualizer.

1387
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,080
It's awesome.

1388
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,040
It is.

1389
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,760
Did you know that we have a KVM rig here in the studio?

1390
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,800
I did not know that.

1391
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,320
So before DigitalOcean was like a thing in Chris's world,

1392
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,160
they existed, but it wasn't in my world yet.

1393
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,560
I was out building KVM machines off of old rigs

1394
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:46,160
that are just monsters with ridiculous water cooling.

1395
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,720
And I mean, yeah, it is a system, Wes.

1396
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,840
And you'd be pretty, I should show it to you

1397
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,320
before you leave.

1398
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:50,880
You should, yes.

1399
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,800
And anyways, this was how I was going

1400
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,120
to grow the Jupyter broadcasting infrastructure.

1401
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,080
Thinking about scale here.

1402
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,640
Yeah, yeah.

1403
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,520
I was going to spin up machines on this rig in my garage.

1404
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,960
It's just so ridiculous.

1405
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,280
Now that I think about it now, because for $5 a month

1406
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,400
I can get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD,

1407
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,560
one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer, right?

1408
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,840
That's tier one bandwidth.

1409
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,400
That's the beginning.

1410
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,600
What tier do you have, Chris?

1411
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,400
Here at home, do you think?

1412
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,120
I don't even, so for those of you, hopefully,

1413
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,200
you don't even know, but we've actually

1414
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,080
had to stop recording and rerecord parts of the show

1415
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,720
because we've had connectivity issues here at the studio,

1416
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,120
which, as Wes can attest, made Chris a little grumpy.

1417
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:25,920
Yes, just a little bit.

1418
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,800
I got a little grumpy because I started cussing.

1419
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,320
I started talking about how much I spend.

1420
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,640
And you know, the thing is, $5 a month,

1421
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,320
that's less than a Big Mac.

1422
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:34,880
It's nothing.

1423
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,600
It is less than I spent on beverages for this show

1424
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,560
by quite a bit.

1425
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,560
You go to DigitalOcean, use the promo code DOUNPLUG,

1426
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:41,280
you get $10 credit.

1427
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,760
They got data center locations in New York, San Francisco,

1428
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,280
Singapore, Amsterdam, London, and a brand new one in Toronto.

1429
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,880
And they're super nice, kind of brand new,

1430
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,840
not as new as Toronto, but it still smells like that.

1431
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,000
It has that new data center smell in Germany.

1432
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,200
But it's that interface.

1433
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,880
Man, is it that interface.

1434
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,040
They have a great interface that really makes

1435
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,280
all of the kind of virtual machine management

1436
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,120
really straightforward, deploying applications,

1437
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,160
destroying your machines.

1438
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,080
You wanted to go deploy a free BSD rig,

1439
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,840
a Core S rig, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora 23.

1440
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,360
Yeah, they have Fedora 23.

1441
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,800
You can go deploy them right now.

1442
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,240
Use the promo code DOUNPLUG.

1443
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,960
You get that credit.

1444
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,680
You get that credit.

1445
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,160
You put it up in that little spot they got there.

1446
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,200
No credit required.

1447
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,720
Feel like getting a little credit spot there, Wes.

1448
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,320
They got a little credit spot, you know?

1449
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:29,200
That's what they call it.

1450
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,200
And you know, the other thing I really like about DigitalOcean

1451
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,840
is, well, they got some really, really good tutorials.

1452
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,960
They have a brand new one up.

1453
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,520
I recommend you go check out How to Create a High Availability

1454
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,200
Setup with Heartbeat and Floating IPs on Ubuntu 14.04.

1455
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,360
This is a really, really nice write-up

1456
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,080
with some super great visuals, the basic understandings.

1457
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,040
Because what DigitalOcean has done

1458
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,600
is they've hired professional content editors

1459
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,880
to actually edit this stuff.

1460
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:51,760
It is good.

1461
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,320
It is good.

1462
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,920
And it's all just included with DigitalOcean.

1463
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,960
Use the promo code DOUNPLUG.

1464
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:55,680
Get a $10 credit.

1465
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,360
Go deploy an own cloud server, Minecraft server,

1466
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,000
SyncThings server.

1467
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:58,880
My gosh, you guys.

1468
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,240
There's so many things you can do with it.

1469
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,320
Wes, do you have anything you'd be wanting to add?

1470
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,640
It's just, I mean, just the kind of level of stuff.

1471
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,520
You don't have to get, you know,

1472
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,000
you don't have to buy a really nice edge firewall

1473
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,040
that you put on your network.

1474
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,480
You know, you could just get floating IPs.

1475
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,600
You can have these kinds of enterprise-style setups.

1476
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,100
I know.

1477
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,000
But for your own peace of mind.

1478
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Now, Wes, is there a way I could take

1479
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,120
my MB Fedora 23 Droplet and combine floating IPs

1480
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,840
so that way I could have high availability MB?

1481
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:26,480
Can you think of?

1482
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,120
I'm just spitballing here, Wes.

1483
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,240
I'm spitballing with you.

1484
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,520
I don't know if that's possible.

1485
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,080
But it's open source.

1486
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,520
So we can make it happen.

1487
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,240
Screw you, Plex.

1488
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,320
Go over to digitalocean.com and use the promo code

1489
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,960
DOUNPLUG at a $10 credit and try out DigitalOcean.

1490
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,040
And say, sorry, family.

1491
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,440
I got more important things this holiday season.

1492
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,520
That is the holiday spirit here at Jupiter Broadcast.

1493
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,200
And use the promo code DOUNPLUG.

1494
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,080
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

1495
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,640
Linux Unplugged.

1496
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:55,040
All right.

1497
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,440
So on this week's episode of the Linux Action Show,

1498
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,200
we talked about Solus OS, a really slick, built

1499
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,680
from scratch operating system distribution,

1500
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,960
if you will, of Linux, GNU slash Linux, by the way.

1501
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,080
Don't get that s wrong.

1502
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,600
That is embarrassing.

1503
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,920
GNU slash Linux distribution.

1504
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,080
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

1505
00:54:14,080 --> 00:54:15,040
Yeah, there you go.

1506
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,480
And we talked about it.

1507
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,360
We reviewed it.

1508
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:21,280
It has a really nice desktop called Budgie based off

1509
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:23,680
of a little bit of Gnome.

1510
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,560
And I could tell you all I could go on about it all.

1511
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:30,160
But instead, Aiki, who is the guy behind the distribution,

1512
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,520
who has joined us before on the show,

1513
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,680
has come back on Linux Unplugged to not only do

1514
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,360
a little bit of follow up on the review,

1515
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,080
but correct pronunciations, tell me anything I've missed,

1516
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,800
and maybe hopefully tease the big release.

1517
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,480
Aiki, welcome back to Linux Unplugged.

1518
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,480
Thank you very much.

1519
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:51,920
So what was the biggest thing I got wrong in my review,

1520
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,520
or our review?

1521
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,160
Let's blame Noah.

1522
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:54,640
Noah's review.

1523
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,040
What was the biggest thing Noah got wrong on this week's

1524
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,200
episode of the Linux Action Show while we were talking about Solus?

1525
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,920
To be honest, it was mainly just the stuff about Solus.

1526
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:02,400
Yeah, sure.

1527
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,440
Yeah, that would make sense.

1528
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:04,880
That would kind of be the range.

1529
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,120
Yeah, so anything pertaining to the actual review

1530
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:07,920
was probably wrong.

1531
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:11,440
And so where do you want to start?

1532
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,880
Is there anything that really jumped out at you

1533
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,680
that was offensive?

1534
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,200
No, not offensive as such.

1535
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,240
I think there was probably a misunderstanding about what

1536
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,120
the whole thing is about.

1537
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,640
So we won't be doing a 1.0 until a day later.

1538
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,320
Until a date that I haven't got because of Murphy's Law.

1539
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:33,760
Well, wait a minute now.

1540
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,160
I saw specific GIF animations that implied it may be coming

1541
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,840
to a stocking stuffer near me.

1542
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,880
This is your source.

1543
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,600
Yeah, GIFs.

1544
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,920
But they are GIFs on the Solus Project website.

1545
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:46,640
You didn't say that.

1546
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,160
Yeah, there you go.

1547
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:48,560
Yeah.

1548
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,040
Busted.

1549
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:54,560
So there's no specific date yet, just sometime before Santa

1550
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,320
turns up, which is not hard.

1551
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,000
You know, he's fat, so we should make it.

1552
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,720
Yeah, he's slim.

1553
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:02,240
Yeah, so sometime before Christmas.

1554
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,480
But I mean, there is a lot to be done yet, to be honest with you.

1555
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,640
Budgie at the moment is gone for a complete and utter rewrite.

1556
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:15,120
We put normal 3.18 for recently, which I noticed in the words.

1557
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,680
I'm not good at them.

1558
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,960
When you guys were showing up on the screen last time,

1559
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,240
it was shown normal 3.16, which kind of gave me an idea that

1560
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:25,040
that system was badly out of date.

1561
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,800
We've upgraded Kernel since then.

1562
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,520
We've done a lot of security updates since then.

1563
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,640
But in itself, it's not such a bad thing that it is out of date,

1564
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,880
because I may be completely and utterly broke, Budgie.

1565
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,600
So the 3.18 update, I mean, Budgie's nearly two years old.

1566
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,240
Yeah.

1567
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,560
So when I started out, it was normal 3.10 or something like that.

1568
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,320
We started out with the code base.

1569
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,880
And the stuff that we put in there to actually keep it all working,

1570
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:52,640
that's completely broken now.

1571
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:57,120
And GTK and Motör are on less drugs than they used to be.

1572
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:00,400
So all the workarounds that we used to have in place now break it.

1573
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,360
So we've had to do a complete rewrite of the Budgie desktop.

1574
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:07,600
But it now looks nothing like the old Budgie if you want it to,

1575
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,640
if that makes sense.

1576
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,880
It sounds like you're heading towards a cleaner version, though.

1577
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,520
Yeah, get rid of the old hacks.

1578
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,600
Basically, take out the trash, to be honest with you.

1579
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,640
There's a lot of it's built up after the last two years.

1580
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,120
So I mean, last two years, I mean,

1581
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,520
it's still two years of engineering experience put on top of that.

1582
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,560
So you're going to find a lot of stuff that makes you think,

1583
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,680
really, was that me?

1584
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,120
I'm ashamed.

1585
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,280
As in many projects.

1586
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,240
Yeah, that does happen.

1587
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:38,080
But OK, so when we were looking at it, I guess it could have been out of date.

1588
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,520
I suppose that is possible.

1589
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,160
Although I think what it was is I was showing,

1590
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,960
so every now and then I kind of waffle on this issue,

1591
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,080
almost every other review is a lot of times I get slammed for installing updates

1592
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,440
and customizing the distro.

1593
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,840
And actually, I'd be curious to hear your opinion.

1594
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,040
And then other times I get slammed for not changing the distribution.

1595
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,240
So I kind of, when it's like a boutique distro

1596
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,280
that is trying to deliver an experience, I try to go all defaults.

1597
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:06,480
And when it is something that I feel like is your day-to-day workhorse,

1598
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,000
like an LTS or a Fedora release, I try to customize.

1599
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,360
And I'm curious, Ike, so in your experience,

1600
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,920
if I was going to do a review of your distribution, say, down the road,

1601
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,360
would you prefer that I sort of live in it for a week and customize it?

1602
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,600
Or would you like me to go on air and tell people,

1603
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,280
you know, this is the experience right out of the box?

1604
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,760
Well, you see, it's not up for me to tell you what to do with your computer.

1605
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,680
We try and go over with same defaults by default.

1606
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,840
You know, you want things to look nice by default,

1607
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,960
but by no means are we trying to stop people from customizing things.

1608
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,240
I know there are certain design-led projects out there

1609
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,880
which would rather you didn't ever post a screenshot

1610
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,320
without a wallpaper within a certain hue, shade, and battery level.

1611
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,000
But we're not along those lines.

1612
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,400
You know, we're not really into the whole hipster culture.

1613
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,640
This is exactly how things should be.

1614
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,640
You know, if you want to put a picture of a dead pigeon

1615
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:59,520
or a dead budgie on there, for all matter, you can do it.

1616
00:58:59,520 --> 00:58:59,920
Yeah.

1617
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,960
Really not bothered.

1618
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,480
Okay, good to know.

1619
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,200
Noted.

1620
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,400
So, all right, so I know we're going to retread some ground,

1621
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,960
but I, you know, just in case people haven't heard old episodes,

1622
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,240
I've got to ask this question.

1623
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,200
Are you completely crazy for creating your own desktop?

1624
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,680
And why don't you just tweak the GNOME 3 desktop?

1625
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,680
Because I don't like GNOME Shell.

1626
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,560
So, I like certain things about it.

1627
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,760
And when I first started out with Budgie, I thought, well, logical step.

1628
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,760
Let's try and, you know, shove a few things in here,

1629
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:28,720
get rid of the overview.

1630
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:31,360
Let's try and put something down the bottom that looks like a panel.

1631
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,240
But at the end of the day, as nice as GNOME Shell is,

1632
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:36,080
it is monstrously heavy.

1633
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,580
Yes.

1634
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,080
So, the computer I'm running on now is actually an Intel NUC,

1635
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,000
and it has 16 gigs of RAM.

1636
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,720
Now, that's more than most people have for any reason.

1637
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,640
Most people have for any day-to-day stuff.

1638
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:48,480
And I probably shouldn't complain, you know,

1639
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,800
when I have enough RAM to do everything I want to do.

1640
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,200
However, on cold boot with Budgie,

1641
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,280
I'm using just under 200 megs of RAM,

1642
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,040
and that's obviously with Intel graphics.

1643
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,880
If it was Nvidia graphics, you know yourself,

1644
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,920
it's going to be slightly higher.

1645
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,880
They do tend to leak.

1646
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:07,680
But with GNOME Shell, I'm using something like 760 megs of RAM just to start.

1647
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,640
Another problem with GNOME Shell that I found myself,

1648
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,880
because everything is implemented as clutter.

1649
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,680
So, they have their own toolkit, which is a fork of MX.

1650
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,640
Basically, everything that's on the screen is a frame buffer object.

1651
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,640
So, if you, which is basically how clutter works.

1652
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,640
Now, when it comes to Budgie,

1653
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:28,000
the only frame buffer objects basically are the windows themselves.

1654
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,880
And that's the things that we animate around and we push them around.

1655
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,200
When it comes to GNOME Shell, every last thing,

1656
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,680
whether it's the little popover menus or the panel at the top or your wallpaper,

1657
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,000
every single one of those is a frame buffer object,

1658
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,080
which is using more of your GPU,

1659
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,400
which obviously means more GPU wakeups.

1660
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,480
And if you're using software rendering, that means a lot more CPU wakeups.

1661
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,760
That means you're actually using more power than you could be.

1662
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,680
And it also means that if you have shared video memory,

1663
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,560
you have less of that to go around for the applications or the games that you're using.

1664
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,160
All right. I mean, that's all fair.

1665
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,840
But essentially, at the end of the day, though,

1666
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:05,920
you are also sort of banking on some of the underlying technologies they're iterating on.

1667
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,000
I mean, obviously, for example, GTK 3.18 was important enough for you

1668
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,600
that you're willing to sort of bump some things around and rework on it.

1669
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:17,520
So there's some underlying technology there that you must seem sound to you, right?

1670
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,600
Yeah, I mean, that's the whole idea.

1671
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,560
So the GNOME technology, the GNOME stack, I absolutely love it.

1672
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,440
I have my problems and I do rant and bitch, but we all do.

1673
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,440
It's stuff that we work with on a daily basis.

1674
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,520
The only thing I don't like is the GNOME Shell itself.

1675
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:37,120
That's personally not for me. That's not how I want my desktop.

1676
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:41,440
That's very much, here's the experience you're getting, this is how we see it should be.

1677
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,520
But all the rest of the technology like libmotor, glib, valr,

1678
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,680
we use all those stuff and we use them quite proudly.

1679
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,960
I mean, me, myself, I'm a member of the GNOME Foundation anyway,

1680
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,480
and I'm quite happy to use GNOME technology and to see other people using it

1681
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:57,040
and improving, contributing to it myself.

1682
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,200
So I try to, when I'm talking to people,

1683
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,720
I try to get them to differentiate between GNOME and GNOME Shell,

1684
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,000
because one is built on the other. It's exactly the same with Budgie.

1685
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:10,160
Budgie is built on GNOME, but Budgie couldn't exist without GNOME.

1686
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,160
It's very, very much dependent on it.

1687
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,160
And we're happy to integrate with all that,

1688
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:17,040
because we don't have to go right in our own control centers,

1689
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,200
our own sentence demons and all that crap.

1690
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:24,480
So to me, what it seems like the elephant in the room for a distribution like this

1691
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,840
is sort of the big meta problem.

1692
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:32,960
And that is the community, the documentation, the packages, the how-tos,

1693
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:38,800
all of the tribal knowledge. And so it seems like you run the risk of

1694
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,440
basically the desktop becoming a feature of something else

1695
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,280
that's based on a more mainstream desktop,

1696
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,560
or I mean a more mainstream distribution of Linux.

1697
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,640
So what, when I'm looking at SolarOS,

1698
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,560
what do you feel is the compelling thing about the underlying operating system

1699
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:56,480
that is powering this pretty cool desktop

1700
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,480
that would actually make me choose SolarOS itself

1701
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:03,840
over, say, Budgie on something that's derived from Arch?

1702
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:04,720
What is your thoughts there?

1703
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:11,200
Well, straight off the bat, and I know everyone's going to flame me for this

1704
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,280
and say, how dare you say this? This can't be true.

1705
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,360
Solus boots faster than Arch.

1706
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,680
I know it's a controversial statement,

1707
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,080
and I'm probably going to be shot in my sleep for it, but it does.

1708
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,440
So before I did a reinstall on my Nook,

1709
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,920
Arch, I'm saying Arch now,

1710
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,640
Solus boots in just over a second for me.

1711
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,320
The highest I got it is 1.189 seconds, and I didn't bother optimizing it anymore.

1712
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:33,840
It did seem extremely fast to me as well.

1713
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,240
Yeah, the point is, Solus is not a generic distribution.

1714
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:41,600
While you can take a generic distribution and try and shoehorn it to your needs,

1715
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,920
the fact is that thing can run on everything from a toaster to a satellite,

1716
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,680
whereas Solus can.

1717
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,120
You can't put it on a Raspberry Pi, you can't put it on a server,

1718
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,480
you're not putting on embedded hardware,

1719
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,560
you don't have the potential to do any of that.

1720
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:57,920
So there isn't any situation where we have to have 100 different package codes

1721
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,280
or different package conflicts,

1722
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,520
and we have to worry about all these different groups

1723
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,120
and all these different architectures.

1724
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,720
Solus is built specifically for an x86-64 computer,

1725
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:07,840
and only for the desktop.

1726
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,600
So there's only a desktop kernel,

1727
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,760
and it's a single kernel that we maintain.

1728
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,400
It's our configuration for a 64-bit desktop.

1729
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:14,880
Focus.

1730
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,680
Yeah, and that's up and down the entire stack.

1731
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,000
Now, don't get me wrong, people say to me,

1732
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,160
well, why don't you take Debian, you know, strip it down,

1733
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,560
just do a kernel config there.

1734
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:25,840
It's still the same situation,

1735
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:28,320
because you still have all those packages, right?

1736
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,360
And I can't exactly go through rebuilding the whole distribution.

1737
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,880
Now, I've made that mistake before, and that was Solus OS.

1738
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:36,800
We all know what happened.

1739
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:38,480
I ended up closing down Solus OS,

1740
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,800
because in the early days when that was happening,

1741
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,840
at the end of 1.3, when we closed doors,

1742
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:48,000
I had over 7,000 packages that was maintained outside of Debian within Solus,

1743
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,520
because the amount of problems I had trying to implement what I wanted to do.

1744
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:56,000
So it's actually easier for me to be a from scratch distribution.

1745
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,880
The main thing with us is being focused entirely on the desktop.

1746
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:03,200
But unlike some of the projects that come out and say,

1747
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,120
yes, we are desktop-orientated,

1748
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,840
we are looking at mainstream desktop usage.

1749
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,160
That means, can I use this for my work at the office?

1750
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,080
And for me, I need to do it for my job.

1751
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,120
So I'm a software engineer.

1752
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,400
I need to be able to do that.

1753
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,200
But at the end of the day,

1754
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,040
I still need to be able to go on and watch YouTube.

1755
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:19,360
I still need Netflix.

1756
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:24,320
So Aiki, is it your impression really that my question is maybe out of date

1757
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,000
and really the end user doesn't give a shit what the underlying distro is?

1758
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,720
And as long as it watches YouTube and reads Facebook

1759
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:35,760
and does Gmail and Google Docs and Office 365 and Chrome or Vivaldi,

1760
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:40,160
is it in your impression that that would be what all that really matters?

1761
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:41,120
And if you create the own,

1762
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,680
I guess what I'm trying to ask you is,

1763
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,000
do you feel like when I look at your distribution,

1764
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,320
I think to myself, well, geez, there's all these packages not available.

1765
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:52,080
But it sounds like to you, that's not even a concern at all.

1766
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,840
No, I understand a lot of people are going to say it's like,

1767
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:57,120
well, you're building this from scratch.

1768
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,200
You've got to make all these packages.

1769
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:00,640
And that's going to be very, very difficult.

1770
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:06,400
So we've tackled quite a few problems with the whole packaging situation in Solus.

1771
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,560
It got to a point, it was probably about six months back,

1772
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:14,240
we say, right, all this manual packaging is a complete and utter pain in the backside.

1773
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,080
And so the simple answer was, automate the shit out of it.

1774
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:23,120
So I'm going to, I'll give you a link there now on IRC so you can see it yourself.

1775
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:25,940
Okay.

1776
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:32,240
Because here's where I'm going with this is, I mean,

1777
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,120
I guess, Ike, what I'm trying to get to is,

1778
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,960
is this maybe coming down to a philosophical difference?

1779
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:47,360
A fundamental, different expectation from who you're creating this distribution for

1780
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:51,440
and maybe who would normally consider themselves an advanced Linux user.

1781
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,800
And the reason why I bring this up is I want to introduce you,

1782
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:56,480
and of course, I'm sure you're aware of it too,

1783
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:01,440
Velt OS, which is using your desktop environment but built on top of...

1784
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,640
Arch Linux.

1785
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,680
Arch Linux.

1786
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:08,320
And it promises you everything Arch has with the rolling base, the AUR,

1787
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:12,080
but yet this new nice... The package manager that many people already know.

1788
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:13,600
But with this nice new desktop.

1789
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:16,960
Oh, and of course, the Vivaldi browser as default.

1790
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:19,200
What are your thoughts about Velt OS?

1791
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:23,120
And this seems like a natural kind of open source thing to happen

1792
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,640
when you have a pretty compelling desktop,

1793
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,000
but a base that maybe is not appealing to the more advanced user.

1794
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:28,800
Your thoughts, sir?

1795
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,480
Sure. I mean, you've got, I say this to everyone.

1796
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,600
People say to me about, why didn't you use Pacman for Arch?

1797
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:36,960
And to sum it up in a statement,

1798
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,640
I don't care about package managers.

1799
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,160
Okay.

1800
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,480
The fact that people still care about them in this day and age

1801
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,480
is nothing short of disturbing for me

1802
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,120
when we're saying that Linux has no mainstream adoption,

1803
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,840
yet it must have the most advanced package manager of rollbacks,

1804
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:53,680
it must have user repositories, it must have exit compression.

1805
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,000
Nobody should actually be caring about that in this day and age.

1806
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,040
They want Linux to actually get somewhere on the desktop.

1807
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:03,120
So in the case of Velt, I mean, that's built on Arch Linux, that's great.

1808
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,200
I'm actually concentrating on building something

1809
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,240
that focuses on working from the ground up.

1810
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,320
So the user never has to mess about with anything.

1811
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,920
At the same time, I don't want to make something

1812
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:14,160
that's completely condescending to the point

1813
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,240
that it's holding your hand the whole way through.

1814
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,840
So you were talking about philosophy.

1815
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:21,600
Some part of it is philosophy, the fact that it will get out of your way.

1816
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,200
And the other part is that no distribution actually exists

1817
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,680
that is optimized for a desktop experience.

1818
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,800
Everything is shoehorned because you take a generic distribution

1819
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,040
and you try and apply it to the task at hand,

1820
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:35,840
which we've already shown doesn't work.

1821
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:40,160
Now, as for Velt OS, yes, they're using Budgie Desktop at the moment.

1822
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:43,120
They've claimed that they're starting their own new desktop.

1823
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:47,360
There was a bit of attention about this on Softpedia, as I'm sure you saw.

1824
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,640
Initially said that they were forking Budgie Desktop.

1825
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,640
They later retracted the statement to say that they wasn't forking Budgie Desktop.

1826
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,680
Now, I went along and looked into their package repos.

1827
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,800
I looked on GitHub.

1828
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:04,080
They renamed the package to VOS Budgie Desktop and made another change to it.

1829
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:07,760
The mock-ups they've put up in their community,

1830
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,520
I mean, I'm not going to insult their mock-ups.

1831
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,920
They're not quite my thing, right?

1832
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:13,360
They're not quite for me.

1833
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:14,560
I follow your lead.

1834
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:18,000
But they've never at any stage ever approached us

1835
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,720
about getting changes made in Budgie.

1836
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:25,040
So they themselves are showing their own project immaturity

1837
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,880
by attempting a fork and then, you know,

1838
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,280
then going back and saying, oh, well, we're not forking now

1839
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:33,920
because they was made to look stupid, to be quite honest.

1840
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,000
Everyone was saying, why are you forking it?

1841
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,280
Well, we're not forking it.

1842
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:38,320
That's OK.

1843
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,960
But had they just approached us upstream and said, you know,

1844
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,960
these are the changes we're going to put in,

1845
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,760
even the Budgie Desktop in its current iteration

1846
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:48,000
supports applets, and it can be built out of tree.

1847
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,120
It has an API.

1848
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,320
You can develop your own plugins.

1849
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,760
You can develop your own applets.

1850
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,160
There's absolutely no need for a fork at all.

1851
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:57,200
So if it was another project, I would say, OK,

1852
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,560
maybe you've got something going.

1853
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:00,240
But I don't quite see it.

1854
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:04,240
So you feel pretty soundly that the entire,

1855
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,840
in order for the desktop experience

1856
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,080
that you're trying to create, the entire thing

1857
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,680
needs to be a complete package.

1858
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,120
It's not abstractable.

1859
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:14,160
You can't really remove the desktop from the underlying OS

1860
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:17,120
because the underlying OS is fundamentally

1861
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,520
built to sort of support what the desktop is

1862
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,240
trying to deliver.

1863
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,640
Am I following your basic logic?

1864
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:25,280
Well, I mean, if you really want to go and remove it, you can.

1865
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,080
That's not a problem.

1866
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,520
I mean, we've got normal shell and repos.

1867
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:28,080
We've got GDM.

1868
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:31,360
So you can switch to desktop if that's up your street.

1869
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,040
But I mean, out of the box, nobody

1870
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,560
has to worry about a package runner.

1871
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,240
That's kind of the idea we're getting to.

1872
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:37,200
It's an operating system.

1873
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,240
You run daily.

1874
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,760
It looks after itself.

1875
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:41,280
And this has kind of been my problem

1876
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,560
with distros and operating systems over the years.

1877
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,040
We have all these workarounds that we put into place.

1878
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,360
We have these config files that we go edit in.

1879
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,400
We have these packages.

1880
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,200
We go add in because we know that they add the functionality

1881
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:53,760
we need.

1882
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:58,240
Or we have these set fixes that we know always work.

1883
01:10:58,240 --> 01:11:00,320
Yet the distribution of the operating themselves

1884
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:02,560
never does anything about it for you.

1885
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,800
Now, my argument should be it's an operating system.

1886
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,800
So it should operate.

1887
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:09,120
It should actually do what it knows how to do.

1888
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,040
And I don't see any distribution like that.

1889
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,920
And that's my argument against any current desktop

1890
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,800
distribution.

1891
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,640
They don't look after themselves.

1892
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,560
You have to maintain the distribution.

1893
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,400
You have to maintain the distribution.

1894
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,920
It doesn't maintain itself.

1895
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,160
What is sort of the, you know, let's just say,

1896
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:27,760
let's say you managed to beat Santa.

1897
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,400
And as an end user, something I might want to install

1898
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,680
on my machine arrives.

1899
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,280
After it's installed for a bit, what does the update picture

1900
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:35,760
look like?

1901
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,640
You know, a few months down the road, a year down the road.

1902
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,640
What can I expect as sort of a long-term maintenance

1903
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,680
of my Solus rig?

1904
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,800
So in terms of support, what we decided to do,

1905
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,880
figured it'd be kind of an effort to have like one

1906
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,240
release and then an LTS release.

1907
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:54,560
And to be honest, I'm going to lose count.

1908
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,560
And I'm not the best fellow with numbers.

1909
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:59,840
So what we decided to do is we'd do a release.

1910
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,760
We'd do that release each year.

1911
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:04,240
And then each release gets a two-year support.

1912
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:07,120
Because ones and twos are very easy for me to add up.

1913
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:10,480
So every two years, you know, your distribution as it was

1914
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,280
loses support.

1915
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:14,880
But you've already had two releases since then.

1916
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:15,760
Do you know?

1917
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,960
So if I release this sometime in December, next December,

1918
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,040
there would be the new release, which would be 2.0.

1919
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,800
But the one you're already using would already

1920
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,640
be supported for that next year as well.

1921
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:25,440
Or you can upgrade.

1922
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,120
Very nice.

1923
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:28,320
That makes sense.

1924
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,280
Some options, yeah.

1925
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,720
Wes, any other follow-up questions

1926
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,840
before we wrap up here?

1927
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,880
What have you thought after using it for a bit?

1928
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,080
You looked at VELT OS 2.

1929
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,160
Was there something that struck you between the differences?

1930
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,440
VELT did feel a little more bolted together.

1931
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,800
You know, it's also very new where Solus has clearly

1932
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,440
had a lot of thought.

1933
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,560
One of the things VELT gets is sort of inheriting

1934
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,320
sort of all of that work there.

1935
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:54,320
But at the same time, I mentioned this in the review

1936
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,200
on the Linux Action Show.

1937
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,720
If you guys haven't had a chance to listen to it yet,

1938
01:12:56,720 --> 01:13:00,400
I wouldn't want to over-promote.

1939
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:01,680
But you might want to go check it out.

1940
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:02,880
I mean, you just might want to go check it out

1941
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,680
before you finish listening.

1942
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,320
You definitely should.

1943
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:04,720
Yeah.

1944
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,560
And in there, one of the things is I really

1945
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,920
like the idea of something.

1946
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,520
And I don't know if I really touched on it very well.

1947
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:10,800
But what I really like is something

1948
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,800
that's just I'm focused on the desktop.

1949
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:15,520
I'm not worried about ARM and mobile and convergence.

1950
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,240
I'm not worried about the server and cloud.

1951
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,520
I'm not worried about any of that.

1952
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,200
I am worried about kick-ass desktops

1953
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:22,640
and kick-ass laptops.

1954
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,720
And there is something about starting at the very beginning

1955
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:30,000
with that intent and moving your project forward

1956
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,560
over a series of years with that intent,

1957
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,480
but not getting so, so, so, so far lost into it.

1958
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:40,000
No offense to the elementary OS folks,

1959
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,440
because they still do great work,

1960
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,160
but not getting so lost into it that it takes literally

1961
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:48,640
years for things to happen, which is just not happening

1962
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,200
for any power Linux user.

1963
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:54,880
So what SolOS seems to be trying to strike the balance of

1964
01:13:54,880 --> 01:14:00,080
is here's something that has a pretty fast development pace.

1965
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,400
It really is truly targeted for your high-end workstation,

1966
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,640
an engineering station, a development station,

1967
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,640
a sysadmin station, whatever.

1968
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,440
You know, a great porn machine, whatever you want to do,

1969
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,640
it's targeted well for that.

1970
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,440
And you know what?

1971
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:14,880
Yeah, there's things called the Raspberry Pi.

1972
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,480
Yeah, there's things called the Nexus 4

1973
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,600
that you can install images on.

1974
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:18,640
Don't care about that.

1975
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,560
There is something about that intention

1976
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,600
that appeals to me quite a bit.

1977
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,080
What do you think?

1978
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,760
Well, I think we see that space,

1979
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,680
like just the number of developers

1980
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,120
who end up using MacBooks.

1981
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:28,960
You know, they want that desktop development

1982
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,880
or desktop environment that gets out of their way.

1983
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:32,400
They don't have to worry about package management.

1984
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,560
So if SolOS can deliver on some of those things,

1985
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,320
you know, at first I was thinking like,

1986
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,640
well, you know, it's another package manager to learn.

1987
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,160
A lot of people like to use Ubuntu on the desktop

1988
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,200
because they use Ubuntu on the server.

1989
01:14:43,200 --> 01:14:45,120
But there's lots of people already who, you know,

1990
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,120
use the Mac, use a different environment or Windows.

1991
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,200
So if this can be the kind of desktop where you install it,

1992
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,000
you don't have to worry about it.

1993
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:50,640
You've got your shell.

1994
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,480
You've got, you know, YouTube that works.

1995
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,720
And also, it's very pretty and usable.

1996
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,680
I could see that.

1997
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:58,000
There's something bold about a Linux distribution

1998
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,840
that's saying, yeah, we're for power users,

1999
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:01,840
but don't think about the package manager.

2000
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:02,480
Right.

2001
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,440
There's something kind of bold about that.

2002
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,200
I don't know how that's going to shape out.

2003
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,600
I mean, I think we'll see when 1.0 is out.

2004
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,040
But yeah, you can see how maybe it's time

2005
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,800
we start talking and going that direction.

2006
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,480
All right, Aiki.

2007
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:15,040
Yeah, go ahead.

2008
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,520
Feel free to jump in and tell us how we're wrong.

2009
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:23,440
Well, so I mean, that is definitely one of the things

2010
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,840
that I really don't care about the package manager.

2011
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,720
Now, another thing to remember is Solos

2012
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:31,920
is about having a stable core and up-to-date applications.

2013
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,120
Which is a thing of mine.

2014
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:33,600
I love that.

2015
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:36,800
I mean, yeah, so I mean, we're using the example here of Arch,

2016
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,200
right?

2017
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:38,800
Arch Linux is a role in release.

2018
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,680
So to give you an example, which many Arch users

2019
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:45,040
have gone through themselves, you have to go into the block

2020
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,880
because these binaries or these libraries are gone.

2021
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,800
So you have to now move these files across,

2022
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,440
which is unavoidable and it cannot be solved

2023
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,800
by their package management.

2024
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,560
So the package manager here doesn't mean nothing.

2025
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,680
To put a nice label on a package,

2026
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:59,600
it's a tarball with a bit of information.

2027
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,520
It's just a glorified tarball.

2028
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,360
That's all a package is, right?

2029
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:06,720
So as much as somebody might derive from Arch Linux

2030
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,400
and they might have our desktop on it

2031
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,480
and it might make it very, very, very pretty.

2032
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:11,360
At the end of the day, they're going

2033
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:12,640
to run into these update problems

2034
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:14,160
because it is a role in release.

2035
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,520
Something like a libpng update, which breaks the entire system.

2036
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:20,160
Now, I can imagine there's a few Arch Linux users around

2037
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,280
who can remember that.

2038
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:23,040
Or the rename of the JPEG libraries,

2039
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:24,240
any one of those incidents.

2040
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,160
So role in release already has a major disadvantage

2041
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:32,400
in a desktop, which is aimed at not just Linux users,

2042
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:33,840
at people who just want to use their computer.

2043
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,240
They're not going to be able to fix that.

2044
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:40,720
So yeah, that's kind of our take on it.

2045
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:44,240
In terms of adding packages, we're one of the easiest,

2046
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:47,440
if not the easiest, distribution going to package for.

2047
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,040
The average package meter information file that we have

2048
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,040
is probably about 30 lines.

2049
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,600
Most of that's auto-generated from a tarball.

2050
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:59,600
So adding a package probably takes a couple of minutes

2051
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:00,560
in our distribution.

2052
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:03,120
So if somebody wants something, we'll add it.

2053
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,640
The thing is, we're not going to go around looking

2054
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,680
for the packages to add.

2055
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:08,480
Because at the end of the day, I don't know what people use.

2056
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,920
I don't really feel like you need to defend it.

2057
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,400
It almost seems like in a year or two,

2058
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,440
it's going to be obvious.

2059
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,280
And you just might be a little bit ahead of the curve

2060
01:17:15,280 --> 01:17:19,120
because you have the XGG app stuff on the GNOME side.

2061
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:21,040
And also, the KD guy has been talking

2062
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:24,160
about containerized applications that are easily

2063
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,920
portable between distributions.

2064
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,160
You now have folks like Valve that are shipping

2065
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:31,040
Steam with the Steam runtime environment where you install

2066
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,160
Steam on Fedora and OpenSUSE and on Arch.

2067
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:35,360
And what are you actually getting?

2068
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,400
You're getting an Ubuntu runtime inside your Steam folder.

2069
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,040
And they're making this possible now by saying,

2070
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,160
target these libraries.

2071
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:44,080
We guarantee that if they have Steam installed,

2072
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:45,760
they'll have these libraries because we're

2073
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,040
putting them on the system.

2074
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,080
And I think when you have commercial vendors that

2075
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:51,760
are coming up with solutions like that,

2076
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,440
you have the open source guys that

2077
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,680
are looking at things like XGG app

2078
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,600
and containerized applications.

2079
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,680
It is being solved by multiple different sources and forces.

2080
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:04,240
And you don't have to really worry about that problem

2081
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:05,120
maybe in a year or so.

2082
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:07,440
Right.

2083
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,960
And that's one of the things I've been trying

2084
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,240
to get across a while for people.

2085
01:18:10,240 --> 01:18:12,880
So I mean, one of the things we have to accept as a project,

2086
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,880
I mean, we're coming up for a 1.0, right?

2087
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,600
Most people are like, who the hell is Solus?

2088
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,320
Never heard of you.

2089
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:19,760
Don't really care.

2090
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,840
So we have to acknowledge the fact that we

2091
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,520
will have a 1.0 come out.

2092
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,640
This is the distribution Solus come in and out and say,

2093
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:27,840
hello, we exist now.

2094
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,040
You should probably get interested.

2095
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:30,480
Yeah.

2096
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,680
Which is something you have to accept.

2097
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,000
I mean, you've got to put your foot in the door somehow.

2098
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,400
But when it comes to 2.0, I mean, one of the things

2099
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,320
we're working towards is making Solus stateless.

2100
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,680
It's one of the things I've actually adopted from work,

2101
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:44,800
which basically means there are no configuration files

2102
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,360
by default.

2103
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,320
There are no overrides.

2104
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,680
Everything is the same default.

2105
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,720
And it would quite literally mean your ETC tree being empty,

2106
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:54,320
which is something worth thinking about there, right?

2107
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,400
Another thing I want to do when we come up to Solus

2108
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,320
2.0, which I can't do at the moment,

2109
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,840
because we have to get the distro out there.

2110
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:01,360
We have to get people to know it.

2111
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:02,640
They have to say, this is Solus.

2112
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,440
Look what we do.

2113
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,960
We're very pretty, aren't we, right?

2114
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:06,480
You have to do all that sort of thing.

2115
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:09,200
But for 2.0, I mean, you're going to be seeing

2116
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,840
a complete separation between the operating system

2117
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,120
and everything that you have.

2118
01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:16,640
Because as far as I'm at, the best example I can give,

2119
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,840
like the 3.18 update that I put in for Gnome.

2120
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,640
Now, that was to put the new user land applications in,

2121
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,720
because people want the new pretty knowledge.

2122
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:25,840
They love all that shiny stuff.

2123
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,520
Thank you, by the way.

2124
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:28,720
Oh, no, it's absolutely fine.

2125
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,000
Google Drive as well, why not?

2126
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,840
But people want all that stuff, which is absolutely fine.

2127
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,040
But at what cost?

2128
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,040
That should not break the operating system.

2129
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:39,200
Now, in our case, Budgie would be considered

2130
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:40,720
part of the operating system.

2131
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,440
That's the stack in the shell that everybody gets, right?

2132
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,800
Now, that should not be broken.

2133
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,600
So when we go towards 2.0, you're going to see

2134
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,040
a separation between that.

2135
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:51,520
Applications will be out in the user's control,

2136
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,600
but you won't be able to break the operating system.

2137
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,120
So an update to an app won't break the OS, and vice versa.

2138
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:01,040
The OS itself wouldn't break the apps,

2139
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,880
which I think is something that really

2140
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:05,120
needs to start happening for something

2141
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,200
that wants to be mainstream and a desktop.

2142
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,360
Well, that's very ambitious.

2143
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,440
And I would love it if you would check back in with us

2144
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,800
from time to time and give us an update.

2145
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,240
I've also been following the blogs, like the weekly,

2146
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:18,240
like number 11 just got posted, I believe,

2147
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:21,760
which has kind of been giving some good insight on updates.

2148
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:22,640
Exactly.

2149
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:25,600
So Aiki, thank you very much for coming on

2150
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,360
and sharing with us.

2151
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,680
And I'm going to keep checking it out.

2152
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,760
I now have it installed.

2153
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:34,400
And I don't know, maybe one day.

2154
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,000
Yeah, JB community, do the same.

2155
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,120
We'll go out, try to break it.

2156
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,040
Could be the distro of choice one day.

2157
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:39,760
Check back in.

2158
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:40,880
Do make sure and break it.

2159
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,800
And while you're at it, make sure you keep an eye out

2160
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:46,160
for Budgie Next, which is the replacement for Budgie,

2161
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,840
which is very, very, very sexy, by the way.

2162
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,760
It has a notification center as well.

2163
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,280
That is, I mean, that is honestly looking like it's worth

2164
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:57,600
its own episode to discuss because the video that was

2165
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,200
posted looked very nice.

2166
01:20:59,200 --> 01:20:59,760
Yeah.

2167
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:00,400
Yeah, it's definitely.

2168
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,840
And we have links to all of that in the show notes.

2169
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:02,320
All right.

2170
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,760
Aiki, you are welcome to stick around.

2171
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,040
Thank you for coming on the show today

2172
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:05,840
and telling us about that.

2173
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:10,080
Before we move on to the last topic, which I hope,

2174
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:13,040
I hope doesn't get me fired from the show.

2175
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,720
Hopefully the boss doesn't fire me.

2176
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:17,280
But before we get to that, I want to talk about our friends

2177
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:18,960
over at Linux Academy.

2178
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,840
Now, Linux Academy is a platform built around educating you

2179
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,400
around all of the technologies that make Linux a really

2180
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,520
awesome platform.

2181
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,880
Of course, Linux itself is good.

2182
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,720
And there's tons of stuff you could learn just there.

2183
01:21:28,720 --> 01:21:32,000
So go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug to get the Linux

2184
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,200
unplug discount.

2185
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:37,280
Linux Academy is not like, I don't even want to point you

2186
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,000
in the wrong direction.

2187
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
But let's just say, I don't know if you're familiar

2188
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,480
with this, Wes.

2189
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,960
But there are a lot of resources online for learning.

2190
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:43,680
Yes, there are.

2191
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,160
Yeah.

2192
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,920
And a lot of them have what you might call features that they

2193
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,040
just kind of throw on there.

2194
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,240
It's more like a kitchen sink kind of thing.

2195
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:51,280
There you go, Wes.

2196
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,560
That's not the Linux Academy.

2197
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:54,640
It was created by people that are actually genuinely

2198
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,800
enthusiastic about Linux and open source.

2199
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,160
And then they have the idea, well,

2200
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,400
why don't we just pair up with our friends that are educators

2201
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:01,760
and get some professors in here.

2202
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,360
And then we have these folks that we

2203
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:04,160
know that are developers.

2204
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,600
They could create this incredible platform,

2205
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,480
and they've done it.

2206
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:09,120
And for me, one of the key features about Linux Academy

2207
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:11,600
is you log in and you can look at all of the courseware

2208
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,120
and all of these things that are sort

2209
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:17,200
of mythological technologies or skill sets

2210
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,840
that you've only dreamed of before are now

2211
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,760
all of a sudden quantified in hours and your commitment.

2212
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,760
And that is really a powerful situation.

2213
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,840
Go to linuxacademy.com slash unplug to see

2214
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:28,480
what I'm talking about.

2215
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,640
They've got almost 2,000 self-paced courses

2216
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,400
with instructor help available.

2217
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:34,480
Seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from.

2218
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:37,120
The courseware automatically adjusts,

2219
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,640
and so do the virtual servers.

2220
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:40,480
I really like that aspect because they

2221
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:44,160
realize it's not just a Red Hat world or a Debian world.

2222
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,520
Or an Ubuntu world.

2223
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:46,320
Thank you, sir.

2224
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,440
There's seven plus distributions

2225
01:22:47,440 --> 01:22:48,080
you get to choose from.

2226
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,640
They have scenario-based labs, which are really kick ass.

2227
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:52,160
You get to go in there and do something

2228
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:54,160
that's like something you would do actually at work.

2229
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,280
Which, what a concept, right?

2230
01:22:57,280 --> 01:22:58,960
But they really have thought this out.

2231
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,360
Also, they recognize you're probably

2232
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:02,240
going to want to work on this stuff

2233
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,400
through an SSH connection from your desktop.

2234
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:06,560
So you can just bring up your favorite terminal application.

2235
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:08,560
You can SSH into a DNS name.

2236
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:09,840
You get access to these things.

2237
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,440
If you're doing AWS training, they'll

2238
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,440
spin up the AWS rigs for you.

2239
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:14,400
It's really cool.

2240
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,880
And also, one of the things that I respect

2241
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:19,040
as somebody who gets super busy with three kids

2242
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:22,080
and my own business is they have an availability plan.

2243
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,400
You can log into the dashboard and tell Linux Academy,

2244
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,480
basically, I'm going to follow the Jupyter Broadcasting

2245
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,320
calendar and make sure I watch every live show.

2246
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,400
And every moment where Jupyter Broadcasting isn't live

2247
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,440
make me available.

2248
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,960
Or I've got a lot of work and Thanksgiving this week,

2249
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,640
so I'm not available on Thursday.

2250
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,840
I'm going to take Friday off.

2251
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:40,320
But you know what?

2252
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:42,240
I might dedicate four hours on Saturday

2253
01:23:42,240 --> 01:23:43,920
and an hour on Sunday evening after everybody

2254
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:44,640
goes to bed.

2255
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,560
You go into Linux Academy, just kind of give it

2256
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,800
your availability, and it will automatically

2257
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,000
generate courseware that matches that with quiz reminders

2258
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,280
and all of that kind of stuff.

2259
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:54,160
It is really cool.

2260
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:56,560
Also, they've done a whole new update on their CDN,

2261
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:57,840
so things are faster than ever.

2262
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,080
They're downloadable, comprehensive study guides,

2263
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:03,280
the audio stuff, and the video distributions you can watch.

2264
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,560
I've heard from several people now

2265
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,640
that listen to the Linux Academy stuff in the shower.

2266
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:11,280
Wow.

2267
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:11,920
Specifically.

2268
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:12,960
Huh.

2269
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,160
I mean, you might as well learn something

2270
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:14,960
while you're getting clean.

2271
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:16,160
I'm not making this up.

2272
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:19,600
Like, at meetups, even when I was at Denver,

2273
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,720
he's like, I'm another guy that listens in the shower

2274
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:23,760
to Linux Academy.

2275
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,120
Like, add me to the list.

2276
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:27,200
I don't know, maybe, you know what?

2277
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,560
Maybe, have you ever heard of shower thoughts?

2278
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,200
Yes, I have.

2279
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:31,440
Yeah.

2280
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:35,680
What if it's not just like really great ideas

2281
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:36,960
when you're in the shower?

2282
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,440
What if it's like your brain is in overdrive

2283
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,880
and you can crazy learn?

2284
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:42,080
What if that's what it is?

2285
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:43,040
Because I'm not kidding you.

2286
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:44,320
A lot of people have told me they listen

2287
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:45,600
to Linux Academy in the shower.

2288
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,200
And I'm trying to figure out what's going on here.

2289
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:50,000
And now I'm realizing shower thoughts plus training,

2290
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,400
oh my gosh, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

2291
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,320
Go learn all of the fundamental technologies

2292
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,520
that make Linux kick ass.

2293
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:56,720
And when you don't have a lot of time,

2294
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,240
they also have dim nuggets.

2295
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,560
These are just like deep dives into a specific area.

2296
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,480
Like, here's one on managing iSCSI,

2297
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,080
which you probably are a total expert on

2298
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:05,440
and don't need any help, I'm sure.

2299
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,960
But maybe if you wanted to be set up

2300
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,440
an HTTP secure proxy over SSH or do some SSH tunneling.

2301
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,320
And you do want to.

2302
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,520
I mean, if you don't know how now,

2303
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,800
just go learn it right now.

2304
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:15,840
Again, these are nuggets.

2305
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:16,640
And look at this list.

2306
01:25:16,640 --> 01:25:18,320
This list is cray.

2307
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:21,120
Everything from reverse tunnels

2308
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,320
to setting up active directory under Linux.

2309
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,320
I'm telling you, they've got it all.

2310
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,280
So go check them out at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

2311
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,600
And a big thank you to Linux Academy

2312
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,280
for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

2313
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,840
And I hope you guys go eat a whole bunch of turkey.

2314
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:37,840
I know some of you guys will be at least.

2315
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,800
Go put, and gals, go put some turkey in your face.

2316
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,640
So Wes, kind of a big moment happened this week.

2317
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:45,760
I don't know if you noticed,

2318
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:47,600
it might have, you might have missed it,

2319
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,160
but GNOME turned 20 years old this week.

2320
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:53,360
20 years old.

2321
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:54,400
That is impressive.

2322
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,040
Yeah, it is, man.

2323
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,280
It's been with us for a long time now.

2324
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,520
And it's brought many interesting fundamental technologies

2325
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,600
that we now use on the Linux desktop today.

2326
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,040
So it's kind of a big deal.

2327
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:05,760
And there's a lot still coming to GNOME in 20 years.

2328
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:08,320
Also, another milestone this week.

2329
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:12,240
LibreOffice hit a thousand contributors

2330
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:15,200
going from September 2010 to October 2015.

2331
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:16,640
A thousand developers.

2332
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:19,760
And they have some interesting stats too, you know?

2333
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,880
They pretty much added 16 new hackers a month

2334
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,120
since September 2010

2335
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,440
as a result of a global mentoring effort

2336
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,600
by some of the project founders.

2337
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:32,000
And after five years and a thousand new developers,

2338
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,400
they are sitting in a pretty good position now.

2339
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,080
And they have wide distribution.

2340
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,760
They're really well known.

2341
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,880
Default install on many distributions.

2342
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:45,280
And yet, both LibreOffice and the GIMP

2343
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:49,200
have really failed to unseat

2344
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:51,280
the industry professional products,

2345
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:54,720
like, you know, Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Office.

2346
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,200
20 years of the GIMP.

2347
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:03,040
Is it time to just admit that sometimes

2348
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:07,760
open source will never be a completely competitive replacement?

2349
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:08,260
Wes?

2350
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,960
Well, I think there's something to that.

2351
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,080
I think you can also frame it in a couple different ways.

2352
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,240
And I think one way to look at it is that, yes,

2353
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:20,240
I mean, there are some reasons that we really should all talk about.

2354
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:21,680
You know, that maybe this is the case.

2355
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,520
But I think the other way to look at it is that

2356
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:25,760
maybe it's not as competitive.

2357
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,440
Maybe it doesn't meet the high-end business needs.

2358
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:29,120
You know, maybe professionals aren't using it

2359
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,640
for their day-to-day workflows.

2360
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:35,760
But we do have a very successful, you know, free application

2361
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,320
that is kind of the right of any human to use, right?

2362
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:42,080
Like, as part of a free society, I think we need these essential tools.

2363
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,520
You know, you get a free operating system.

2364
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,040
You can get this free image editor.

2365
01:27:45,040 --> 01:27:47,440
And, you know, if you have a business case,

2366
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:48,800
then you have to shell out for something more.

2367
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:50,320
Let's say after 20 years,

2368
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:53,360
GIMP manages to get to 80% of what Photoshop can do.

2369
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,240
Well, then, essentially what you're saying is you flip that around,

2370
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:59,600
and that means that 80% of humanity now has access to

2371
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,120
a fairly competent photo editor.

2372
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:02,800
Yeah, right. I mean, it doesn't matter what you make,

2373
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:03,840
how much resources you have.

2374
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,240
If you have access to a computer, you can do these things.

2375
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:07,920
You can edit your photos. You can touch things up.

2376
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,600
You know, I think that's success.

2377
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:13,120
I do agree that we need more pressure to reach the higher-end features.

2378
01:28:13,120 --> 01:28:15,200
And I think that we could unseat some of that market.

2379
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:16,800
It's obviously not happening.

2380
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:18,720
Apparently, I said no at some point instead of GIMP.

2381
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,080
I have no idea. Who can keep it straight?

2382
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:24,960
I was thinking, obviously, so much of GIMP and GTK are closely connected.

2383
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,800
But does anybody in the Mumble Room have any thoughts on,

2384
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,080
here we are 20 years of GIMP,

2385
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:32,320
and it's still really not quite there yet for pretty much any professional use.

2386
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,200
I've dreamed for the day that I could switch my mom,

2387
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,480
a professional graphic artist, to GIMP.

2388
01:28:36,480 --> 01:28:37,520
Yeah, I think we all have.

2389
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,480
And it's not there yet.

2390
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,960
So, Rottencorp, you and I were chatting about this on the pre-show.

2391
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,760
What are your thoughts about it, looking at it sort of from a design standpoint?

2392
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:48,640
Well, yeah, I'm actually a professional designer, and I use Photoshop.

2393
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:55,200
In an ashamed situation where I don't want to use Photoshop,

2394
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:58,320
but it's the best option, so that's why I use it.

2395
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:02,880
And it's not necessarily the fact that they haven't been pushing it enough.

2396
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:08,880
It's mostly the fact that GIMP's problem is that the people who control

2397
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,720
the future of GIMP don't care about community input.

2398
01:29:12,720 --> 01:29:17,920
So there's been multiple forks that have created things like layer styles

2399
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:23,680
that has been one of the most important things that people wanted from Photoshop.

2400
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:27,920
People wanted from Photoshop in GIMP for a decade.

2401
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,720
It has actually existed since 2008 as a plugin,

2402
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:35,840
but GIMP refused to actually look into it at all to give it as a standard.

2403
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:41,200
And there's other things like that, like CMYK also exists as a plugin,

2404
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:44,080
but again, they refused to put it in the main system.

2405
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:48,880
And it took 10 years of people complaining to GIMP

2406
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:53,440
to get them to do a single window mode, and they don't even do it by default.

2407
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:57,840
So majority of people who use GIMP don't even know that there is a single window mode.

2408
01:29:57,840 --> 01:30:01,280
So it's mostly the fact that they have a vision.

2409
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:03,200
If you don't agree with it, they don't care.

2410
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:14,720
And that's what the biggest fundamental of that is the leaders of GIMP are not making progress.

2411
01:30:15,280 --> 01:30:20,240
And they have such a huge market in the open source graphic world.

2412
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:24,640
There's not really any competitors against them because they just kind of take over.

2413
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:30,800
So I think it's mostly they don't really want to progress it as much as it could be,

2414
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:37,520
but also they've already taken so much market away from the people who could do what

2415
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:41,920
the whole community wants that they kind of give up and the developers just go somewhere else.

2416
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:47,120
Poby, I wanted to hear from you because I hear what Rotten Corpse just said and I thought,

2417
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:51,840
okay, I think where a lot of us have been is you've got to throw everything behind GIMP

2418
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:54,800
because so often in the open source community it's fork, fork, fork, fork.

2419
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,320
Everybody's got a revolutionary idea and we constantly are rebuilding the foundation

2420
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,400
and never actually getting to that end user polish.

2421
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:03,600
And I'm curious what your take is, Poby.

2422
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,600
Here we are 20 years after GIMP.

2423
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,560
Have we sort of all been betting on the wrong horse?

2424
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:11,520
Is it just something a matter of wait another 20 years?

2425
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:12,320
What do you think, Poby?

2426
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:18,320
So this is a tricky one because I'm not a designer. I opened GIMP and I use like three features out of GIMP.

2427
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:19,520
And it works for you, right?

2428
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:25,520
Right. All I do is set the color levels on a picture of my cat and then

2429
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,800
unsharp mask and then export it out as a PNG.

2430
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:30,880
Great post by the way this morning. That was a good one.

2431
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:32,240
Thanks very much. Yeah.

2432
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,880
He's very photogenic, my cat.

2433
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:40,880
So, you know, I'm not the best person, but in an open source community,

2434
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:46,000
in an open source in general, I think part of the problem is, you know,

2435
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,880
we just don't have enough people working on the thing.

2436
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:53,680
You know, I've mentioned before that hundreds of people at Samsung who work on, you know,

2437
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:59,440
one particular component of their platform or the hundreds or thousands of people at Microsoft

2438
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,680
who work on one particular component.

2439
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:06,640
We've got people who are not necessarily working on this in full time, but part time.

2440
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:11,760
They're doing a job, then when they get home and, you know, put their kids to bed

2441
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,440
and have made food for the family, then they start hacking on free software.

2442
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:18,560
Or after they finish doing their studies, they're hacking on free software.

2443
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:22,640
Who are we to tell them that they're not doing a good enough job?

2444
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:26,400
And Wimby, I want to give you a chance to sound in here too.

2445
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:30,480
Do you feel like really in the big picture GIMP is actually good enough?

2446
01:32:32,240 --> 01:32:35,520
Well, again, I'm not a professional graphics designer,

2447
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:36,800
so you're asking the wrong person.

2448
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,440
No, actually I think...

2449
01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:41,200
A bit like Popeye, I'm more of a super user because I use four features from GIMP.

2450
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,000
This is sort of perfect, right?

2451
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,400
This is sort of Wes's premise is that really if GIMP gets 80% of the way there,

2452
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:53,200
then that means it appeals to 80% of the users, which is kind of a big deal.

2453
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:56,560
So I'm kind of curious to hear your take as a non-professional designer.

2454
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,040
Yeah, no, it does a job for me.

2455
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:05,680
I always install it as the go-to graphics editor on my Linux workstations.

2456
01:33:06,400 --> 01:33:14,400
And I think most of my difficulty with using GIMP comes from the fact that I don't know how

2457
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:17,200
to drive graphics applications in the first place.

2458
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:21,280
It's not that GIMP is hard to use, I just don't know how to do it.

2459
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,040
So I always have to go and Google, you know, the more complicated things.

2460
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:29,360
But, you know, and the other thing to think about GIMP is if it wasn't for GIMP,

2461
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:31,040
we wouldn't have GTK.

2462
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:31,600
Thank you.

2463
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:32,640
Yeah, yeah.

2464
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,000
And that was sort of what I was implying earlier.

2465
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:39,440
The G in GTK is GIMP, it's not GNOME or GNU.

2466
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,480
Right, yeah, that was what I was getting to earlier, sort of implying that.

2467
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:43,760
And Rodin, go ahead.

2468
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:46,480
As somebody who, you know, thinks about this probably a little more than most of us do,

2469
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:50,800
since we're not super power users in graphics, you have a chance to respond.

2470
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:51,360
Go ahead.

2471
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:57,440
Yeah, well, I just wanted to say that, wow, I think GIMP is atrocious for professionals.

2472
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,120
Not in the sense that it's, you know, when I say they're not professionals so they don't know,

2473
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:06,480
it's not that it's bad, it's that it's fundamentally garbage.

2474
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:14,560
When the methodologies that for normal proper technique of design are impossible to do in

2475
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:17,120
your application, it's fundamentally crap.

2476
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:20,720
You think it'll never, you think it will never serve the role that the professional needs them?

2477
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,480
No, actually, I don't.

2478
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:29,600
I think the fact that it took 10 years to just get everything in one window means that the fact that

2479
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:36,160
I want non-destructive editing and I want the ability to have CMYK and I want layer styles and

2480
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:42,560
smart objects and all these different things for multiple composites, that there is probably

2481
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,600
a minimum 10 years more for one of those.

2482
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,560
Are you going to pay a developer to do that then?

2483
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:51,520
No, I have Photoshop.

2484
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,560
No, but you say, I want this, I want that.

2485
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:59,200
You can't just like rock up to the door, knock on the door of the GIMP developers and then say,

2486
01:34:59,200 --> 01:35:00,400
I want these things.

2487
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,240
You should do it because I want it.

2488
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:09,360
I want to create, I will happily put my money in where my mouth is for having a GIMP

2489
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:14,640
is not going to be that because GIMP, the people who are behind GIMP don't want to be that and

2490
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:19,520
have specifically said that they have no intention of ever actually competing with Photoshop,

2491
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:20,560
which is fine.

2492
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:21,600
It's their decision.

2493
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,400
That's fine.

2494
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:27,040
But people should stop comparing them because they're not even remotely close.

2495
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:30,640
That is actually, that is actually just a posse right there.

2496
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:31,920
An interesting point.

2497
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:35,440
You know, I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that

2498
01:35:35,440 --> 01:35:39,120
I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not

2499
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:41,600
going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going

2500
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:45,440
to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say

2501
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:50,400
that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm

2502
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,280
not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going

2503
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:56,000
to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say

2504
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,600
that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm

2505
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,560
not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not

2506
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:06,560
going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to say that I'm not going to

2507
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:11,720
workflow, but people chose to dog on me for the wrong thing.

2508
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:18,040
What I took away from that was there are a great amount of tools on the Linux desktop

2509
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:24,200
right now that we constantly get stuck in the mode of comparing to the proprietary alternative

2510
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:31,000
like Final Cut or Adobe Premiere or in the case of GIMP, obviously Photoshop.

2511
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,240
We constantly are doing, well this is not as good as that.

2512
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:39,640
Photoshop is an incredible program with a massive legacy that appeals to a niche.

2513
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:40,640
It's market.

2514
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:44,160
I mean, that's the company for designers, so they have all of the resources there.

2515
01:36:44,160 --> 01:36:47,360
Wes, what I've been reflecting on is, so on Sunday's episode of the Linux Action Show

2516
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:52,160
coming up, because of the holiday, we wanted to talk about some open source projects that

2517
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:55,200
we are genuinely thankful for that have improved our lives.

2518
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:56,200
Well, that's a good idea.

2519
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,920
Yeah, so we're going to do like a thanks to open source.

2520
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:58,920
We haven't done it for a few years.

2521
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:03,720
In fact, I'd love to hear the audience's ideas if you want to go to linuxactionshow.reddit.com

2522
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:10,320
and submit them, but one of the things I was reflecting on about all of this really is

2523
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:19,220
if GIMP never ever is a serious alternative to Photoshop for those really high-end power

2524
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:24,040
users or designers, that is perfectly okay.

2525
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:28,560
When we're talking about something that is open source in GPL, we are literally talking

2526
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:33,600
about something that is available to humanity as long as we want to make it possible.

2527
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:37,320
Photoshop, even though it's going to be a market-dominant thing for 30, 40 years, it

2528
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:43,480
may be around for 60 years, GIMP is literally available to humanity as long as we want it

2529
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:46,200
to be available and it can continue to get better.

2530
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:52,040
The thing about that is if it is appealing to 80% of humanity and it is available to

2531
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:56,180
80% of humanity for as long as they want it for absolutely free, if they can just get

2532
01:37:56,180 --> 01:38:02,240
to the internet, it fundamentally offers something that Photoshop can never offer and can never

2533
01:38:02,240 --> 01:38:03,240
compete with.

2534
01:38:03,240 --> 01:38:05,600
When you think about it at that level, I'm pretty damn thankful about that.

2535
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:06,600
That's pretty cool.

2536
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:07,600
Yeah.

2537
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:08,600
I mean, I know I've definitely needed something in a pinch.

2538
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:12,600
I don't have time to, if I was willing to even pirate or buy or any of the options that

2539
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,120
people commonly employ.

2540
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:15,120
I can just get GIMP.

2541
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,160
I know it will work for what I use it for.

2542
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:18,160
I think you just nailed it.

2543
01:38:18,160 --> 01:38:24,800
I think GIMP just has to continue to iterate, honestly, as long as the project handles new

2544
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,720
leadership and brings in new blood.

2545
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:27,840
That is essential, yes.

2546
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:31,840
They can get another 20 years and if they can get another 20 years, then they can just

2547
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:36,640
slowly continue to iterate and yeah, it does suck for those of us in 2015 that want it

2548
01:38:36,640 --> 01:38:40,520
all right now, but it is something that's going to be available for a very long time

2549
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:44,340
and they can continue to make it better and better and better and maybe one of the places

2550
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:50,920
they'll get to is instead of it becoming commonplace to pirate Photoshop, a proprietary crap application

2551
01:38:50,920 --> 01:38:56,480
that locks your freedoms down, maybe you just decide to go get GIMP instead.

2552
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:59,460
Even if they just got, and I think they're damn well close to it, even if they just got

2553
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:04,080
the status of instead of stealing Photoshop, go download GIMP because if you're the kind

2554
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:08,400
of person that's stealing Photoshop, you probably don't actually need Photoshop to do your job

2555
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:12,320
and so you could probably use GIMP and as long as they can get that reputation, which

2556
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:16,760
I think they're damn close to already with the common person, then it is actually a very

2557
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:17,760
serious thing.

2558
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:19,480
I think it's pretty cool and you know what?

2559
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:24,840
Also, we were dogging on LibreOffice, I feel bad about that.

2560
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,480
If you don't like the way LibreOffice looks, which is kind of where I was going, I think

2561
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:31,240
LibreOffice is an awesome project, I hope you guys don't think I was dogging on it,

2562
01:39:31,240 --> 01:39:35,480
I think it's very awesome and I used to work in school districts, trust me, I understand

2563
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,760
how revolutionary it is.

2564
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:40,960
We have a link in the show notes if you'd like to get involved in maybe sprucing up

2565
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:41,960
the look of LibreOffice.

2566
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:44,840
Yeah, I mean that's the thing, it's our project, right?

2567
01:39:44,840 --> 01:39:47,640
It's everyone's, so if you want it to be something, go help.

2568
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:51,000
We got a link in the show notes to help out the LibreOffice project to get another thousand

2569
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
developers.

2570
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,600
Alright everybody, well thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged,

2571
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,560
we'll be back here on Tuesday, go to jplive.tv to watch us live, jupyterbroadcasting.com

2572
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:00,360
slash calendar, linuxactionshotoutreddit.com to contribute, see you next week.

2573
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:02,000
And shove some turkey in your face.

2574
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
Oh!

2575
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Nom nom.

2576
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:33,360
Yeah, happy Thanksgiving everybody, see you next week.

2577
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:40,680
I will answer Wimpy's encoding questions if he will answer, I have a very, I'm gonna

2578
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:42,120
be very ignorant here.

2579
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:47,920
I'm very ignorant, I don't understand why Canadians have Thanksgiving, do people outside

2580
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:51,440
of the US also have Thanksgiving, is it just a North America thing?

2581
01:40:51,440 --> 01:40:52,440
No, just you.

2582
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:56,600
Okay, alright, so what do you guys do on Thursdays, you're just super annoyed by all of us Americans

2583
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:57,600
talking about?

2584
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:58,600
It's a normal day.

2585
01:40:58,600 --> 01:40:59,600
Yeah.

2586
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,600
That sounds lame.

2587
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:05,440
I think all the retailers over here have started doing Black Friday, which is ridiculous.

2588
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:06,440
Yeah, yeah.

2589
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:07,440
That needs to stop.

2590
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:11,760
Yeah, I apologize, I bet it is extremely, extremely annoying.

2591
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:12,760
Okay so...

2592
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:15,600
It is because there's never any offers, it's one of these things where everyone says there's

2593
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,600
these big bargains and you turn up and it's like, you know, a bunch of tennis balls and

2594
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:20,600
some string or something.

2595
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:21,600
You know what you ought to do?

2596
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,240
They're doing it in Germany now too, it's just, it's wrong.

2597
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:29,400
You should just come to the US on Thanksgiving, because here's two things, we really know

2598
01:41:29,400 --> 01:41:31,540
how to eat, and man do we eat.

2599
01:41:31,540 --> 01:41:35,160
And the other thing is, besides Christmas, it's like the only other day of the year where

2600
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:36,160
everybody's nice.

2601
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,560
So if you ever want to come to the US, they will share with you.

2602
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,640
You actually want to have a good experience, you come on Thanksgiving, everybody's nice.

2603
01:41:41,640 --> 01:41:42,640
So it...

2604
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:43,640
Chris will have turkey for you.

2605
01:41:43,640 --> 01:41:44,640
Yeah, oh yeah, that's true.

2606
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:45,640
That's true.

2607
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:52,720
Speaking of coming to the US, I've just booked my ticket to come to scale, so are you guys

2608
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:54,640
going to go to scale?

2609
01:41:54,640 --> 01:42:02,040
You know, so, boy, we're actually thinking about not going to scale because...

2610
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:03,040
Fine.

2611
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:04,040
I know, well...

2612
01:42:04,040 --> 01:42:06,120
Because you're going to be there, Popeye.

2613
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,960
The timing in January is real bad, it's real bad.

2614
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:14,120
And the thing is, it's because we do a big show at Linux Fest Northwest and I have limited

2615
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:16,700
funds so I kind of have to pick and choose.

2616
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:23,560
But the other thing is, scale is a great show and it's a really good show to go to if you

2617
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:26,080
don't go to all the other shows.

2618
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:30,760
And if you go to all the other shows, scale is just a bigger version of all the other

2619
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:31,760
shows.

2620
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,200
But the thing about the other shows is they're a little more intimate, a little bit quieter,

2621
01:42:34,200 --> 01:42:35,640
and a little more focused.

2622
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:42,280
So from terms of content and actual access to the people, we get better results from

2623
01:42:42,280 --> 01:42:45,640
some of the smaller shows than we do from scale.

2624
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:52,520
So I'm still kind of like, I'm like 90% decided, but I'm still kind of on the fence about it.

2625
01:42:52,520 --> 01:42:55,880
Scale's almost getting, I don't know, like overdone?

2626
01:42:55,880 --> 01:42:56,880
I don't know.

2627
01:42:56,880 --> 01:42:57,880
I don't know.

2628
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:58,880
I don't know.

2629
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:02,900
I think there's like, so we're having an Ubicon summit thing for a couple of days along with

2630
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:09,440
scale and I think there's like 20 or 30 of us flying over there, which like never normally

2631
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:12,960
happens, but there's a whole truckload of canonical people coming over.

2632
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:13,960
Yeah.

2633
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:16,680
You know, I'm still considering, I am, it is a part of me.

2634
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:18,360
Not that that's a selling point, just...

2635
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:22,040
It would be nice, you know, I hadn't, it would be nice to just say hi to people in person.

2636
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:27,080
That would be a nice thing, but it's all these other events are really nice and they're really,

2637
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:36,200
you know, genuine, connected, like personal events and so, I don't know, if scale was

2638
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:40,880
after Linux Fest Northwest and then I knew how financially devastated I was from Linux

2639
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:45,880
Fest Northwest, then it would be easier to plan for scale because I could just plan accordingly,

2640
01:43:45,880 --> 01:43:50,360
but because scale comes before Linux Fest Northwest, I can't sacrifice Linux Fest Northwest

2641
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:51,560
in the name of going to scale.

2642
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:52,560
I don't know.

2643
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:53,560
It's a difficult situation.

2644
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:54,560
It is a difficult situation.

2645
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:55,560
Isn't Linux Fest Northwest like on your doorstep?

2646
01:43:55,560 --> 01:43:57,560
Can't you just like rock up in your trailer?

2647
01:43:57,560 --> 01:43:58,560
Right.

2648
01:43:58,560 --> 01:43:59,560
Right.

2649
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:00,560
But when you...

2650
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:01,560
But he has expectations there.

2651
01:44:01,560 --> 01:44:02,560
Well, here's the...

2652
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:03,560
Well, like last year we...

2653
01:44:03,560 --> 01:44:04,560
Lazy, lazy...

2654
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,560
No, no, no.

2655
01:44:05,560 --> 01:44:08,720
See, last year we flew the whole crew in and we did dinner and rooms and, you know...

2656
01:44:08,720 --> 01:44:09,720
It was demands for scale.

2657
01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:11,520
A live event, right?

2658
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:16,080
So it was a major expense for the network because, you know, mostly all these people

2659
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:17,160
are never actually here.

2660
01:44:17,160 --> 01:44:21,760
So to actually bring everybody together in one place was actually a rather expensive

2661
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,760
investment.

2662
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:23,760
That was...

2663
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:24,760
Oh!

2664
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:25,760
Oh!

2665
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:31,160
So then, okay, so we're gonna talk about Solus, which, am I saying Solus right?

2666
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:32,160
Yep.

2667
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:33,160
Yeah.

2668
01:44:33,160 --> 01:44:34,160
Solus.

2669
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:35,160
Solus.

2670
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:36,920
And how do I say the desktop?

2671
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:37,920
Is it budgie?

2672
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:38,920
That's what I...

2673
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:39,920
Budgie.

2674
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:40,920
As in the bird with wings.

2675
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:41,920
Cute little budgie.

2676
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:42,920
The...

2677
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:43,920
Like a birdie?

2678
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:44,920
Birdie?

2679
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:45,920
Birdie?

2680
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:46,920
Yeah, perky.

2681
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:47,920
Like the bird...

2682
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:48,920
The bird budgie.

2683
01:44:48,920 --> 01:44:50,320
I don't fucking know about a budgie bird.

2684
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:53,240
I know about crows and blue jays, I don't know about a budgie bird.

2685
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:54,840
I know bungee software.

2686
01:44:54,840 --> 01:44:56,080
I know bungee software.

2687
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:57,080
I know that pretty well.

2688
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:58,080
No, budgie.

2689
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,080
No, budgie.

2690
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:00,080
I don't know about a budgie.

2691
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:01,080
I don't know about a budgie.

2692
01:45:01,080 --> 01:45:02,080
This is not a list of approved birds.

2693
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,280
It's the kind of bird you'd have in a cage in your house.

2694
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:05,760
I don't know about a budgie.

2695
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:08,600
Okay, I accept it's a thing, but I've never heard of it before.

2696
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:09,600
And I...

2697
01:45:09,600 --> 01:45:10,600
I have...

2698
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:11,600
Bless you, Chris, and your lack of knowledge of the world.

2699
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:12,600
I know, I know.

2700
01:45:12,600 --> 01:45:13,840
But here is the thing.

2701
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:16,960
You know what I have heard of a billion times over?

2702
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:17,960
Bungee software!

2703
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:18,960
Like, haven't you guys...

2704
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:19,960
Come on, you're a bunch of kids.

2705
01:45:19,960 --> 01:45:20,960
You know what?

2706
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:21,960
You're all a bunch of kids.

2707
01:45:21,960 --> 01:45:22,960
That's what it is.

2708
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:23,960
Kids and their budgie birds.

2709
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:24,960
I used to have a budgie.

2710
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:33,200
All right, somebody link me, I want to see what this damn bird looks like.

2711
01:45:33,200 --> 01:45:34,200
You know what it is?

2712
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:35,200
I just don't give a crap about birds.

2713
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,720
I mean, the birds that fly around are great, but I always feel like the birds in the cage

2714
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:41,800
are just super annoying and loud and they poop a lot and they're not all that fun to

2715
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:42,800
look at.

2716
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:43,800
What about penguins?

2717
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:45,640
I'm telling you, birds in the wild are great.

2718
01:45:45,640 --> 01:45:50,240
That kind of bird I can get down with, but the birds that are just in a cage have never

2719
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:51,240
interested me at all.

2720
01:45:51,240 --> 01:45:52,240
I don't know.

2721
01:45:52,240 --> 01:45:53,240
I don't want to expand...

2722
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,240
Okay, you guys...

2723
01:45:54,240 --> 01:45:55,240
It's another name for the common pet pair.

2724
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:56,240
Yeah, okay.

2725
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:57,240
Yeah, I've seen that ugly ass bird that doesn't...

2726
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:58,760
That looks like a stupid bird that poops a lot.

2727
01:45:58,760 --> 01:45:59,760
Yeah, I've seen that bird.

2728
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:00,760
I don't know why you...

2729
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:01,760
I'm sorry, I can't...

2730
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,560
I don't know why you bang your desk up after that.

2731
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:06,560
That bird looks like an asshole.

2732
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:07,560
Well I made it.

2733
01:46:07,560 --> 01:46:08,560
Of course it's gonna be an asshole.

2734
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:09,560
Perfectly done.

2735
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:14,120
Perfectly done, perfectly done.
