1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
People don't talk about this, but birds fight all the time.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,400
And if you think about how absurd that is, like humans, at least when we fight,

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,200
we're fighting over territory and resources on this rock.

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,960
But the birds have the whole frickin sky and they they land on my roof

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,800
and they fight on my roof.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,560
They have like battles on my roof and I can hear them charging each other.

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,200
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, boom.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,360
And then they collide.

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,320
And then it's smack, smack, smack, smack, smack all over the place.

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,800
And they take off and they come back and then it's tap, tap, tap, tap.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,960
And they collide and they ram each other on my roof.

12
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,120
I think that it won't be a problem if we just get a live stream of the roof action.

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,680
And I can sort of the IRC room that goes out to the tubes.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,760
We'll make it a patron exclusive.

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
Put that behind the paywall.

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,760
And then we'll have to be disappointed when that becomes more popular

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,680
than this show itself. Yeah, that's true.

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,040
Yeah, crows fight a lot.

19
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,760
I know. I know. It's weird.

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,960
It's it's really strange because it's it's like,

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,440
um, I think like they don't care at all that I'm down here yelling at them.

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,480
Plus, then that also means I'm down here yelling at them like a lunatic.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,800
Right. You look crazy.

24
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,040
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 250 for May 22nd, 2018.

25
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,280
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,560
that's definitely gotten bitten by the new laptop bug.

27
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,640
My name is Chris. My name is Wes.

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,720
Hello, Wes.

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,600
This week, we're going to talk about something that's been on our minds for weeks.

30
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,800
The perfect Linux laptop for 2018.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,280
We've got a few suggestions.

32
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,600
We'll take your suggestions and we'll start a little elimination

33
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,400
and decide which one might be the best, at least for a lot of our needs.

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
Plus, I've really cracked notes on Linux now.

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,320
I mentioned this recently, but I'll go over my final setup,

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,200
how I'm using Nextcloud 13 QO notes, cloud notes for the iPhone

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,960
and notes for Nextcloud to get markdown compliant synchronized notes

38
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,840
across my desktops, my laptops, my phones and the web.

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,440
That's the holy grail.

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,160
It is. Plus, we've got some great app picks, some really useful tools,

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,760
some great community news like Gnome's performance hack fest,

42
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,160
building cute apps with Rust and some robots that are picking up balls

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,080
and Tesla's GPL compliance battle,

44
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,920
as well as why Mycroft might be integrating blockchain into future devices.

45
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,600
Yeah, I said that. Mycroft integrating blockchain.

46
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,440
The Mycroft coin could be nigh.

47
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,840
So we have so many things to talk about on today's episode.

48
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,080
So we can't go any further without bringing in the Mumble Room.

49
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,640
Time appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

50
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,360
Good evening.

51
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Hello.

52
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,360
All right, guys, we have some serious stuff

53
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,440
to get into, so I thought maybe before we got all really serious,

54
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,440
we could start with something light, an automated ball boy.

55
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,920
It's a robot powered by Ubuntu.

56
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,000
And you guessed it, it's a Kickstarter right now.

57
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,200
Players and coaches everywhere know the frustration and tediousness

58
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,040
that goes into collecting balls during the practice session.

59
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,200
And this is why we invented Tenabot.

60
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Tenabot is the world's first robotic ball collector.

61
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,200
Tenabot perfectly integrates computer vision and artificial intelligence

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,560
to detect tennis balls on the court and collect them for players.

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,160
You can let Tenabot work autonomously using the station

64
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,160
that easily attaches to the net post,

65
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,760
or use Tenabot's app to customize where in the court the device will clear.

66
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,920
Tenabot easily syncs to your phone and even your Apple Watch

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,400
to make activation quick and seamless.

68
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,640
The app also keeps track of how many balls are collected during a session

69
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,640
and how often you practice.

70
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,320
So feel free to brag to your friends about how you're stepping up your game

71
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,640
while never having to pick up another tennis ball.

72
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,320
Of course. That's right.

73
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,960
This Ubuntu powered autonomous ball boy is launching here in the US.

74
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,400
And they started as a Raspberry Pi product, then moved it on to an Arduino

75
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,200
and then eventually their own custom SBC.

76
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,760
And they say that Ubuntu was a natural choice

77
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,400
because it was easy to get working with the team,

78
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,240
it provided the stability that needed,

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,680
and there was plenty of support, and they crammed it into this robot

80
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,640
that's got all kinds of crazy cameras and sensors.

81
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,680
And Wes, I don't know if you knew this, because I'm not a sports guy.

82
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't believe in it. Don't believe it.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,920
Don't believe in sports.

84
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,960
But I'm told by these people that do that they spend sometimes more time

85
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,720
picking up balls than they do hitting balls.

86
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah, right. I mean, everyone hates it.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,360
You want to play the fun part of the game.

88
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,160
You don't want to do all the rest of the maintenance work.

89
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
This thing's got an 80 ball capacity.

90
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,080
So I don't know how much time you play, but that's more than enough for me.

91
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,680
Yeah, that's probably going to do me for my whole life, I tell you.

92
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560
So this thing comes with a companion app that tracks like how many games you play

93
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,040
and lets you like section it off to a certain area of the court,

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
which is kind of neat.

95
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,600
And it is up on Kickstarter if you want to get in on it, right?

96
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,200
So you can get it for like 600 bucks right now.

97
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,040
Eventually it's going to be like a thousand.

98
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,000
They've already smashed their goal.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
They had $35,000 goal.

100
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,920
They've raised $68,243 with 96 backers and they still got 16 days left to go.

101
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,080
Tenobot, we're on Ubuntu.

102
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
I mean, I wouldn't buy it for me.

103
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,040
But if you were like a private tennis club, it kind of seemed, you know, $650,000.

104
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,240
That's not that much for a nice piece of equipment if it lasted you a couple of years.

105
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,720
And it looks really handy and it's so cute.

106
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,720
I was asking Popi before the show, I said,

107
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,960
so did you hear anything in the halls of canonical about this robot?

108
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,880
And he said, no, but you did have a good idea for what you could use a robot like this for.

109
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,680
What was that, Popi?

110
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,080
Right.

111
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,360
Well, you know, the whole thing about Ubuntu Core is with Snaps,

112
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,320
you can deliver additional functionality after the thing has been deployed.

113
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,120
So it's not like a router that you install and then it's a fixed set of functionality.

114
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,960
With Snaps, you can add functionality.

115
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,400
So you could add an application and add a bit of extra hardware

116
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,560
and make it shoot out rotating knives instead of picking up balls.

117
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,360
It could do anything.

118
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,160
It's brilliant.

119
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,720
Yeah, it could.

120
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,360
It definitely could.

121
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,400
It could chase some of those.

122
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,360
It could chase some chickens.

123
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,320
It could throw knives.

124
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,320
I mean, you know, yeah, maybe even maybe like an automated barbecue.

125
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,600
Put a little barbecue on that thing and grill some hot dogs while you're playing.

126
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840
Wait, that's probably not the idea.

127
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
This is getting to fantasy land.

128
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,440
Autonomous Linux powered ball boy.

129
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
And you can back it right now.

130
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,200
They got an early backer, although those are all gone.

131
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,760
You could get it now.

132
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,280
You can still get it, though, for 600.

133
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,320
Nope, that's all gone.

134
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,840
Wow, this thing's really doing good.

135
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,600
So there you go.

136
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,480
Did that make you feel good?

137
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,520
That was your feel good story to start us out because the next story is a bit heavy.

138
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,640
I feel great.

139
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:36,880
Good.

140
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm glad that worked.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,320
So let's talk about Tesla's GPL compliance.

142
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,440
Oh, yeah, you may have seen this story.

143
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,680
It started out with a blog post from the Software Freedom Conservancy on the status

144
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,000
of Tesla's GPL compliance issues.

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,880
So what's happened?

146
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,440
So here's the practical aspect of what's happened.

147
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,000
Tesla has just recently done a big dump of their Linux kernel branch.

148
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,720
They just had like a generic user on GitHub called Tesla Open Source.

149
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,280
And it looks like at some point they branched or forked the Linux kernel.

150
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,800
They have made 676 changes in their code dump with 413,000 additions and 336 deletions.

151
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,160
Also, in Buildroot, there's one commit per release.

152
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,320
So there's like 643 change files in there, a bunch of additions, things like that.

153
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,280
But it's nothing major.

154
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,240
It's just this big, obtuse dump of code.

155
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,680
And you can't really suss much out of it other than maybe there's some things that are missing.

156
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,080
And that's where the Conservancy's blog post comes in.

157
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,880
So the Software Freedom Conservancy wrote on May 18th, Bradley Kuhn did,

158
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,480
that the Conservancy rarely talks about this stuff, that they try to keep the stuff under wraps

159
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,920
as part of their community oriented GPL enforcement policy.

160
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,680
They say they usually keep compliance matters confidential, not for their own sake,

161
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,520
but for the sake of the violators who request discretion and want to fix their mistakes

162
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,000
without fear of public reprisal.

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,920
I guess that would be like GPL shaming, Wes?

164
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,640
Yeah, probably.

165
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,120
And I can see that if they're showing goodwill, they're showing that they do want to get this corrected.

166
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,800
Sometimes, much like in security, you can have things go public a little too soon

167
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,440
and they don't have time to get the public face that they want.

168
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,880
Now, that may not seem fair, but I think from a pragmatic angle of,

169
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,800
we just want this code to be released and for the public to benefit, it probably makes sense.

170
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,280
Yeah.

171
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,800
So they write, they being the Conservancy, right, that we're glad that this week,

172
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,000
Tesla has accepted to publicly address its GPL violations,

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,320
and they've taken their first steps towards compliance.

174
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,320
The Conservancy has been engaging with Tesla on its GPL compliance issues since June 2013.

175
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:44,400
That's when the Conservancy advised Tesla that they had received multiple reports of GPL violations

176
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,240
regarding Tesla's Model S.

177
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Customers who had purchased the Tesla Model S received onboard systems that contained BusyBox

178
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,600
and Linux, and did not receive any source code nor an offer for the source.

179
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,960
In parallel, we also asked other entities to advise Tesla about GPL compliance.

180
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,560
We know that Tesla received useful GPL compliance advice from multiple organizations

181
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,080
in addition to the Conservancy.

182
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,600
Let's pause here for a second, though.

183
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,280
So what they're saying in here is that Tesla owners,

184
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,400
and some of them are going to be Linux users, they got their new shiny car,

185
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,920
and they start looking at the UI, and all of a sudden, they're like,

186
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,280
wait a minute, this is BusyBox.

187
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,920
This is Linux. Well, where's the source?

188
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,920
But you also have to wonder if maybe BusyBox didn't raise a red flag,

189
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,360
because they seem to come up a lot.

190
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,440
Like BusyBox seems to bring up GPL compliance issues more than most projects we talk about.

191
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Like I think the VMware case is famously a BusyBox case.

192
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,080
So this is one of those where is what's going on here is BusyBox being aggressive.

193
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,600
I've heard people suggest that perhaps BusyBox is GPL shaming Tesla into doing this.

194
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,040
Bobby, do you have any thoughts on that?

195
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,960
No, I think this is reasonable.

196
00:09:54,960 --> 00:10:00,320
Like BusyBox comes up a lot just because they're not necessarily significantly more

197
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,280
litigious than anyone else, but the significant copyright holder in BusyBox

198
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,840
is quite active in ensuring people are compliant with the law under which they receive the software,

199
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,440
the license under which they receive the software.

200
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,520
So it's perfectly reasonable who someone who has spent some time and effort making a visa software

201
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,920
and has licensed it on a free license should be able to expect the people who use that

202
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,200
should give back in the way that's expected under the license. I think that's reasonable.

203
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,600
Yeah, and BusyBox just seems to be one of the projects that's more active in doing that.

204
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,560
Other projects seem to be a little more relaxed.

205
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,400
And I think both approaches, you could argue, one is probably more corporate friendly,

206
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,160
but one is more defensive.

207
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,920
It seems like in this space too, BusyBox ends up getting shipped in embedded spaces

208
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,240
where you end up with some sort of appliance-like device or somewhere not necessarily directly accessible.

209
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,160
It's not a desktop Linux environment most of the time. So it's a bad situation on both sides.

210
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,840
Yeah, and I bet you there's way more abuses in those embedded spaces

211
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,200
where they think they're getting away with something.

212
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,840
Oh, there's only going to sell a few hundred thousand, nobody will even know.

213
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,040
And they sneak it in there.

214
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,720
I think it's twofold in the sense that they now have also the deniability when something wrong happens

215
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,200
that they have to investigate first if the car was hacked or modified,

216
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,400
because ultimately they release part of their source code.

217
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,840
And that's something that they, of course, can benefit from while also looking good for open source communities.

218
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,240
So it's just like it's win-win-win in all fronts.

219
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,920
Yeah, I see what you're saying. And for the conservancy's part,

220
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,920
they said that when they first contacted Tesla, they started working in different ways

221
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,320
to try to convince upstream providers like Nvidia and Parrot to disclose complete course management.

222
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,720
Corresponding source code. So you're going to see this acronym tossed around a lot in these cases.

223
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,560
CCS. That stands for complete corresponding source code.

224
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,680
And it's like, so you got some GPL code that also touches some other code.

225
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,040
We'd like to have that too. Nvidia.

226
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,280
During that time, Tesla privately provided the conservancy with multiple rounds of

227
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,880
complete corresponding source code.

228
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,320
And then the conservancy spent a considerable amount of time digging through that

229
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,880
and trying to validate if it was complete or not and then sending it back and saying, no, this is missing.

230
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,080
And that is the longest, most grueling part of this process.

231
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,000
And this week, that's when things changed.

232
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,400
This week, Tesla took a new and different approach.

233
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,800
They elected to publish their incomplete, incomplete, complete corresponding source.

234
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,400
So like their candidates for complete source on GitHub.

235
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,040
They're working on it.

236
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,960
Yeah, it's going to be almost there. And this is what we got so far.

237
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,560
Now, of course, it's sort of also going to open up Tesla for people knocking on their door,

238
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,520
just drive bys that are going to look through that and go, hey, I've noticed you're missing this.

239
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,880
And that can be a good thing or a bad thing.

240
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,880
It might help nudge Tesla into compliance.

241
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,680
But you got to wonder, was there some ticking clock behind the scenes that forced them to do

242
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,120
this big code dump all of a sudden?

243
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,320
And when you read through this post, it's clear that the conservancy is trying to position this as,

244
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:58,480
hey, guys, this is some of the work that we do on a routine basis that we don't get to tell you about.

245
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,440
Would you please donate?

246
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,880
Please donate.

247
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,680
We're over here.

248
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,040
We're doing a lot of good work because they don't normally get to talk about this stuff.

249
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,360
So I think they wanted to take the opportunity.

250
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,600
Karen and Bradley want to take the opportunity to point that out.

251
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,040
Yeah, it's nice to see Tesla.

252
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,480
You know, I think there's oftentimes where where it can be contentious, right?

253
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,920
They don't they want to the company wants to admit the minimal version that they can.

254
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
They struggle to go to the licenses, right?

255
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,880
And it's just a big hassle.

256
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,080
So Tesla can feels comfortable doing this in the open, especially as not a traditional automaker,

257
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,440
but something that we see a little bit more as a tech savvy tech first company.

258
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,760
It's nice to see them going in the right direction.

259
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,520
Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.

260
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,200
OK, let's now let's pick it back up again.

261
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,920
Let's keep moving.

262
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,360
I want to talk about a video game.

263
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,760
Haven't talked about games in a while on this show, so I had to have a good reason to finally do it.

264
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,880
And it's slipstream.

265
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,280
It released yesterday as we record this.

266
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,120
And here's the cool thing about slipstream.

267
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,840
It's a retro inspired arcade racer that was developed exclusively on Linux, Ubuntu and

268
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:59,600
Arch Linux to be specific, using free software tools such as Corita, Blender and GIMP for the graphics,

269
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,880
IntelliJ for the IDE, and not a single sprite of the game was made using any proprietary or

270
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,720
Windows software such as Photoshop.

271
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,240
And the author of the software says it's not really even a political statement.

272
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,120
It's just feels better when I work on Linux and free software.

273
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,760
So that's what I do.

274
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,760
How do you like that?

275
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,480
That's awesome.

276
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,120
That's kind of perfect.

277
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,680
It's not.

278
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,480
It's not annoying.

279
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,840
It's not nagging.

280
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,680
It's not some sort of Linux centric evangelism.

281
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,600
It's just, hey, guys, this platform works.

282
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,320
I got this done.

283
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,440
Check out the cool shit I made.

284
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:29,920
Yeah.

285
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,280
And it started as a Kickstarter.

286
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,880
Four hundred and forty three pledges.

287
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,040
They raised seven thousand dollars to get things finished and now it's available on Steam.

288
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,800
And it is really nice.

289
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,200
It's it's very authentic in a way, but at the same time, it's it's got newer features like the

290
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,280
parallax scrolling looks way cooler than it ever did back in the day.

291
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,080
It's still a 2D sort of 3D pursuit of game pseudo game.

292
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,760
Twenty different tracks, three different game modes, a lot like Mario Kart, five car models,

293
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,640
supposedly a pretty good soundtrack, too, and a variety of different options to customize the

294
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,960
game's visuals, including a high flute and 30 frames per second mode.

295
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:16,160
And if you are a masochist, it also has a CRT mode, which no, just don't.

296
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,800
I just don't.

297
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,440
That's awesome.

298
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,400
I don't know.

299
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:22,560
Can you use the CRT mode on your CRT if you have one or is that too much?

300
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
That's double the that's double the punishment.

301
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,640
I was going to say double the pain, but that you'd probably that's something else.

302
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,200
Yeah.

303
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,320
So that's pretty cool.

304
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,080
It's called Slipstream Retro Inspired Racer.

305
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,720
It's available up on that next cloud right now.

306
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,400
Hey, I want to talk about speaking of hitting the road, my trip to Texas, just a couple of quick

307
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,920
public service announcements.

308
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm going to Texas Linux Fest, as I've mentioned, and so we have officially launched the Jupiter

309
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,640
Broadcasting Telegram group, and you can find that at jupitabroadcasting.com slash Texas.

310
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,880
And that's where we're going to be planning all of our meetups, our barbecue events and just

311
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,960
shenanigans around Texas Linux Fest, which is June 8th through the 9th in Austin.

312
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:05,280
And that's jupitabroadcasting.com slash Texas to join that where we'd love to chat with you.

313
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,840
If you're in the area and you can follow me on my way down there, jupitabroadcasting.com slash

314
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,960
Rover if you want to meet up.

315
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,160
But I want to tell you a little more about why I'm going on this trip to Texas.

316
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,480
It's not just for Texas Linux Fest.

317
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,200
And I mean, it kind of is now, but that wasn't the spark for this Texas fire.

318
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,240
Maybe I should use a different analogy, but that's not what started this thing.

319
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,640
What started this thing was an email that I sent Linux Academy, who is based out of Keller,

320
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,120
Texas a month or so ago, and maybe a little more than that.

321
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,720
And what it basically was, was, hey, I was watching your live stream.

322
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
And I noticed a couple of technical issues.

323
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,480
Would you like to chat more?

324
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,800
And maybe I could help consult for free.

325
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,680
I wasn't trying to charge them.

326
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,560
I just wanted to help them out because they've been a great sponsor for years.

327
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,000
And they said, yes, we would love to talk.

328
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,120
In fact, we'd love to talk a little more about that.

329
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,120
And so a long story short, Linux Academy has grown like crazy in the last year and so.

330
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,960
I don't know how much of this.

331
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,800
I think they have talked about this on their live stream.

332
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,000
It's over 100 employees.

333
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,640
I think it might even be over 110 employees.

334
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,120
That's huge.

335
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,680
Yeah.

336
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,800
Can you imagine a small business as adding employees like that?

337
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,560
And it's a lot of instructors and developers.

338
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,200
I mean, it's just they're bringing, they're onboarding people like crazy.

339
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,840
And it's a huge process to scale out like that.

340
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:26,720
And Anthony, the CEO of Linux Academy, has built a really solid team around him.

341
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,720
I had a good chat, and I was really impressed with that aspect of the company.

342
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,360
But they've had the main challenge is just getting all those people on board, you know,

343
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,200
not wrecking the culture.

344
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,160
And the one thing that sort of slipped was the Linux doctrine, you know, the following.

345
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,320
Everything's Linux because you just at that scale, you really can't mandate that everybody

346
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,720
coming on board be a Linux desktop user and that everything they do be done from the Linux

347
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,200
desktop.

348
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,720
You just that's sort of impractical.

349
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,480
And so they're like, what we want to do, though, is start a Linux Academy.

350
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,360
And so they're like, what we want to do, though, is start addressing that now.

351
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,880
We want to get back to Linux.

352
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,960
You start make start writing that ship.

353
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:12,880
And what they want to do is take the experience that we have, Noah and I, converting Jupyter

354
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,200
Broadcasting from Mac OS and Wirecast to OBS and Linux and Kubuntu specifically, because

355
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,080
that's their setup now.

356
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,680
Like they've they've really they've really done a good job of integrating live services

357
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,440
into their courseware, into their service offering.

358
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,560
And they've really pulled off some amazing stuff, but they're just doing it all on a

359
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,920
Mac with Wirecast.

360
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,600
And, you know, it's functional.

361
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,320
It works.

362
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,520
But they're Linux Academy, so they want to do it on Linux and they want us to come down

363
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,360
there and help them essentially do what we've done semi recently here in the studio while

364
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,400
it's still fresh.

365
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,440
And we're really enjoying it.

366
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,720
It's working rock solid.

367
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,240
And the great thing about it is like one of those things I'm excited to do because it's

368
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,640
not just, oh, we're replacing a Mac for for because sake, it's a better solution.

369
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,600
You know, it's better performance, better stability.

370
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,520
It's way more sustainable.

371
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,880
The way more hardware options is much more flexible.

372
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,800
It's a better long term solution.

373
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,400
It's Linux and OBS.

374
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,760
Whenever you can build your your infrastructure around open source software just gives you

375
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,680
way better sustainability and flexibility down the road.

376
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,960
That's true for broadcasting as well.

377
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,560
So sensibly, the trip was about going to Linux Academy to convert their broadcast systems

378
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,120
to Linux.

379
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,600
And then the time you worked out, Texas Linux Fest sort of came up and now it's really become

380
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,200
one of the core focuses.

381
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,240
And so along this whole trip, I'm going to try to do the shows.

382
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,760
I'm going to try to keep things going.

383
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,040
And we wanted to put a shirt out there that might help cover some of our expenses while

384
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,920
we do this, while we get down to Texas, while we keep doing shows from the road, while we

385
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,720
do the meetups.

386
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
So we've launched a new shirt.

387
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
It's teespring.com slash J.B.

388
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,880
Texas.

389
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,000
Check this thing out.

390
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,080
Now this is a couple of things have gone into the shirt.

391
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,120
You may you may have noticed we haven't done any swag for a while.

392
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,880
It's because we've been thinking about this a little bit.

393
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,600
There is something we want to do with our swag that makes it uniquely ours.

394
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,200
Whenever we have tux on our swag, we want tux with a beard because we think our tux

395
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,400
has earned that beard.

396
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,200
After 11 plus years of the Linux action show, we earned that beard.

397
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,160
So our swag is going to have a bearded tux.

398
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,280
That's going to be one of the trademark things about Jupiter broadcasting.

399
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,240
And this is one of the only second times we've done this.

400
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,440
The last time was the final Linux action show shirt.

401
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,800
This is a Jupiter broadcasting, limited edition, Texas 2018 shirt.

402
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,440
It's got the circular logo like last used to have, but a special Texas edition of tux

403
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,520
with a beard holding the rocket, teespring.com slash J.B.

404
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,000
Texas.

405
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,920
It's a great t-shirt.

406
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,840
I love this particular material.

407
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,720
And I really, really like the way the white pops on some of the bolder colors and also

408
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,320
the way it really pops on that blue and on the purple.

409
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,880
It's slick looking teespring.com slash J.B.

410
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,440
Texas.

411
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,120
Yeah, you'll be sure you're looking hot.

412
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,920
Sure.

413
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,960
Yeah, right.

414
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,920
I'm going to get you one, Wes.

415
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,520
So don't you worry about we'll get you one.

416
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,160
Thank you.

417
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,440
Yeah, I am.

418
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
I am supremely looking forward to this trip.

419
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll wear it with pride.

420
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,560
Yeah, you will.

421
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,280
You know what, Wes?

422
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,800
You'll look dapper in it, too, and put it put like a scarf and I like a hat with it.

423
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,120
I mean, yes, I'm just saying you'd be a lady killer out in the town of Seattle.

424
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
So anyways, super excited about the trip.

425
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,080
Really looking forward to it.

426
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,160
You can track me on my way down there if you want to meet up.

427
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,520
And then if you're going to be in the Texas area, join that telegram group,

428
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,760
Jupiterbroadcasting.com slash Texas.

429
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,640
We'll have a link to all this stuff if you don't want to worry about the URLs.

430
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,360
It'll just be linuxunplug.com slash 250.

431
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,160
So new swag, big trip coming up.

432
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,240
I leave after Linux Action News this week.

433
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,960
We finish up that and then I hit the road.

434
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,280
I'll be on my way to Tejas.

435
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,200
Now you make sure to drive safe, OK?

436
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,240
Because we need you here at the network.

437
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,800
I'm not.

438
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:51,600
It's going to be an interesting juggling act because doing the shows

439
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,200
while I drive to Texas adds a ton of time to the travel time

440
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,840
because you have the time it takes to record the shows.

441
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,120
Plus, I edit a handful of the shows and the time to prep the shows

442
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,280
and the time to find connectivity.

443
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,000
It's going to be challenging, to say the least.

444
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,240
So if you're not subscribed to a show and you want to make sure you don't miss it

445
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,480
in case there's something that floats, now would be a good time.

446
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,520
But let's change gears.

447
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,120
Let's talk about Mycroft.

448
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,840
It's time to get to the bottom of what are beans.

449
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,320
And Mycroft is introducing blockchain.

450
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,960
And I'm going to give you a challenge, Wes.

451
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,680
Are you ready?

452
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,400
Oh, yeah.

453
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,160
The challenge is I will read this.

454
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,520
I've gone through and I've surmised it into a few choice quotes.

455
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,640
I'll read through them.

456
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,520
And then I want you to describe to me how the blockchain

457
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,920
will be functional on Mycroft, OK?

458
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,420
Yes.

459
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,480
OK, so we'll start with is the blockchain necessary?

460
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,080
One of the biggest themes was determining the necessity of adding blockchain.

461
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,320
After all, we could simply build a distributed system

462
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,960
using peer to peer technology or better yet,

463
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,120
focus on the core technology to build something that's valuable without blockchain.

464
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,240
As we examined blockchain and debated the tough questions,

465
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,800
it felt like technology could be a very it felt like that technology

466
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,240
could be a very good fit for Mycroft and our ideals.

467
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,720
Oh, and that's another thing.

468
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,240
Does it make sense for Mycroft to develop its own chain?

469
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,720
Yes, unequivocally, yes.

470
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,600
We've carefully evaluated solutions from existing blockchain communities

471
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,320
and none have the features we are looking for.

472
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,800
We need to protect user privacy, store large volumes of data

473
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,200
and securely distribute API services.

474
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:30,960
Finally, we get a lot of questions about what a Mycroft crypto mining community

475
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,920
might look like.

476
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,840
Will it be large enough?

477
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,520
Yes, a Mycroft token would be designed so that the mark one, the mark two

478
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,400
and the mark three, which you don't know about yet,

479
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,320
will be able to mine the coin.

480
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,520
That means we'll instantly have thousands of devices

481
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,760
participating in the network, of course, if they choose to opt in.

482
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,600
OK, Wes, so how is the Mycroft using blockchain?

483
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:00,640
OK, it's not really clear from this article a little bit a little bit lower down.

484
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,600
They do talk about some things they want to incentivize.

485
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,600
Things like secure storage for the network,

486
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,920
development and maintenance of useful skills.

487
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,440
And in an earlier blog post, they talk about a little bit of the motivations.

488
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,120
I like the motivations.

489
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,440
I like the idea that they want to become more decentralized.

490
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,200
They don't want to have the usefulness of these open source devices

491
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,880
reliant on some centralized incorporated entity.

492
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,800
But there's a lot of hopeful speculation in here.

493
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,920
Yeah, and it seems like a way to kind of grab some attention.

494
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,520
You know, we've seen Kodak and other companies,

495
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,160
you just sort of attach blockchain to a project or product

496
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,560
and all of a sudden you get a lot more interest.

497
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,120
Well, it lowers the cost of the product, for sure.

498
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,160
That's one.

499
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,080
They don't have to host the data

500
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,360
and they don't have to comply necessarily with GBPR and this kind of stuff.

501
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,680
I mean, I don't have anything. It's in the blockchain.

502
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,560
So you think they're going to use it for distributed user data?

503
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,600
Probably. I mean, if it's encrypted and protected, why not?

504
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,200
It's going to serve the same purpose.

505
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,640
But what about the idea of the Mycroft sitting there mining coin?

506
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,800
Like, Popi, you've used one before.

507
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,960
Is it a high-performance device?

508
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,280
The one I had was the first generation, which is based on a Raspberry Pi.

509
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,240
And if any of you have seen the videos that I've made,

510
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,760
it's not super high-performance.

511
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,960
And I guess part of that is because it was like version zero.

512
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,520
You know, it wasn't a production-ready device.

513
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,800
It was a dev. Fair enough.

514
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,000
Which, you know, is fair.

515
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,280
And I would expect consumer-level units.

516
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,600
We're talking 18 months later.

517
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,240
I would expect consumer-level devices to be a lot faster.

518
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,120
I mean, I still have to wait for my Amazon Echo to reply.

519
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,720
It's relatively quick.

520
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,040
But there's a significantly higher delay with Mycroft

521
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,320
than I think if you added in lots of heavy computational overhead on top of that.

522
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,000
It's not going to get any quicker, is it?

523
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,320
I would like to know some of the technical implementations

524
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,400
because there's lots of types of coins that don't necessarily need a CPU or a GPU

525
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,280
to do what they do.

526
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,040
They don't need a CPU or a GPU.

527
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Where do they do their computing?

528
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,680
No, I mean, they do.

529
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,800
But I mean, they don't sit there and run the CPU at full peg.

530
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,120
They're more like storage-based.

531
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,480
I mean, I don't even know if my Amazon Echoes around the house

532
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,120
are mining crypto coin or doing blockchain activities.

533
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,880
I have no idea because it's all closed source.

534
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,080
So the good thing is the stuff that's on Mycroft is,

535
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,760
as I understand it, all going to be open source.

536
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,440
So you could inspect that and see what it's doing

537
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,320
and optimize it if you're so inclined.

538
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,480
Yeah, the more we talk about it, I kind of like the idea.

539
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,960
Right.

540
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,040
I was kind of mocking it at first.

541
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,440
But the more we talk about it, it does kind of make sense.

542
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,240
And if you could do some sort of storage coin-based system,

543
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,880
I'd actually be kind of into that.

544
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,440
And if you think about it, if it could somehow,

545
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,600
they would probably have to combine it with some sort of hosted blockchain

546
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,680
because anything that got relatively large,

547
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,280
you wouldn't want to waste storage or bandwidth

548
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,960
to download and upload that thing.

549
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,880
But you could maybe cache some of it.

550
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,200
And so if you had some of your own information,

551
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,320
it could store in a local chain

552
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
and it could do lookups in the blockchain.

553
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,440
That could be pretty compelling.

554
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,800
And then it would be completely divorced from any cloud infrastructure

555
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,440
other than the hosted part of the chain that could be offline.

556
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,240
I don't know.

557
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,760
I'd really like to know more about how they're going to do it.

558
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,400
Depending how it's done potentially could mean that,

559
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,640
let's say if the encryption is to a degree that they,

560
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,760
for example, would have access to mine some of the data

561
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,880
to improve the voice recognition, et cetera.

562
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,160
Now they would still have access to that data.

563
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,400
I'd hope at least to be able to do that.

564
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,640
Having a key that they can access the voice records

565
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,680
to be able to do that to improve voice recognition, for instance.

566
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,600
And nothing says that they couldn't release the mining software

567
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,720
for desktop computers like a Linux binary

568
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,880
that you could run on a pretty powerful Linux desktop

569
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,280
that could help add the value to your contribution

570
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,960
to your Microsoft's contribution to the network.

571
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,800
So, OK, all right.

572
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,320
This is sounding less and less crazy.

573
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,280
You know what this means is we're just going to have a future full of blockchain.

574
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,400
Every blockchain, all the things, and it's going to get really annoying.

575
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,520
That's what that means.

576
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,200
No, it's until the energy bill is too high to people start realizing

577
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,440
that we need something like blockchain,

578
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,000
something decentralized, but not really blockchain.

579
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,080
Yeah, or at least something that doesn't require so much compute power to verify.

580
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,840
And I know there's some different projects that are working on that.

581
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,920
I feel like, Wes and I, you and I looked at some,

582
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,640
at some point, different projects that were using other means to validate the network,

583
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,040
but none of them, I'm drawing a blank on all of them right now.

584
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,440
Yeah, I mean, there's lots of different types of proof of stake

585
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,240
or other schemes of distributed consensus.

586
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,520
I think it's more of a question of how well is it proved out

587
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,280
and will it actually scale?

588
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:41,040
Will they really be able to transition from a centralized standard API design

589
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,600
to a distributed blockchain that could actually provide

590
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,160
the quick services needed for an interactive device?

591
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,120
I don't know, but it would be really cool.

592
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,400
Yeah, and I'm ready to hook it up to my Linux desktop now.

593
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,680
You guys got me so excited.

594
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,120
All right, let's take a moment and thank Linux Academy,

595
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

596
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:03,360
You can go there to support the show and sign up for a free seven-day trial,

597
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,760
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

598
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,160
It's a platform to learn more about Linux,

599
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,080
and they really are a company that's passionate about Linux.

600
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,320
I mean, that's why they want me to come down there,

601
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,160
is to help write that ship and make sure that they're using Linux throughout the company.

602
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,240
And they have professionals that are there full-time

603
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,080
that can help you whenever you have questions.

604
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,600
And they really know their stuff.

605
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,000
They have hands-on labs, scenario-based labs that give you real experience on servers,

606
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,600
self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

607
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:35,680
And they have simultaneous servers they spin up for you simultaneously with the courseware.

608
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,000
So as you're going along with the courseware, the servers spin up,

609
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,360
you SSH in, you do work on real servers, that kind of stuff.

610
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,400
It's really slick.

611
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,240
And they have a course scheduler if you're busy,

612
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,640
you got a lot of stuff going on, you can pick a course,

613
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,000
set a time frame to fit your schedule, and set some learning goals.

614
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,680
And if it's time for certifications, they've got courses created specifically

615
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,600
to prepare you for those exams.

616
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,040
And if you have just a little bit of time, maybe an evening here or there,

617
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,840
they have deep dives, single topic deep dives, you can just choose.

618
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,120
I have 15 minutes.

619
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,920
Here's what you can do.

620
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,320
I got five minutes, I got two hours.

621
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,120
It's pretty nice.

622
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,560
And then to combine all that together and really kind of put the sprinkle on top,

623
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,360
they got stuff you can do offline, like study guides and lesson audio,

624
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,600
which is super useful, like if you're on a road trip,

625
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,120
just saying, and they also have iOS and Android apps as well.

626
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,440
So get started by going to linuxacademy.com

627
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,400
slash unplugged.

628
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,720
That's linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

629
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,000
And a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

630
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,480
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

631
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,800
Boobaladoop, boobaladoop, boobaladoop, boobaladoop.

632
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,000
So there is some hot canonical rumors on techcrunch.com today.

633
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,320
It always strikes my fancy when I see TechCrunch writing about canonical,

634
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,680
like they're this nebulous company.

635
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,760
I don't know, it's this weird detached form of writing.

636
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,120
It's fascinating.

637
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,680
And they say, don't expect the Ubuntu maker to IPO this year.

638
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,400
And they got some choice quotes with Mark Shuttleworth

639
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,760
when he was at OpenStack Summit in Vancouver,

640
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,840
which sounds like it was a hell of a party.

641
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:04,720
And they say that, Mark says that we decided as a company,

642
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,640
and it's not just my decision, but we decided

643
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,120
that we want to have a commercial focus.

644
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,480
So we picked cloud and IoT as the areas to develop that.

645
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,200
And being a public company, given that most of our customers

646
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,760
are now global institution, it makes for us also

647
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,040
be a global institution.

648
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,560
I think it would be great for my team to be part of a public company.

649
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,360
It would be a lot of work, but we're not shy of work.

650
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,880
And think about what he's saying there.

651
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,320
We serve global companies.

652
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,040
We should be a global company.

653
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,120
Now, Shuttleworth didn't really necessarily

654
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,680
want to talk about a timeline for the IPO.

655
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,720
He said we will do the right thing at the right time.

656
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,960
But that's likely not this year.

657
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,880
There is a process that you have to go through, and it takes time.

658
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,000
We know what we need to hit in terms of revenue and growth,

659
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,840
and we're on track.

660
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,560
The company's focus is squarely on enterprise,

661
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,000
and they have big offerings now with OpenStack and Kubernetes.

662
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,400
But it doesn't necessarily mean they've forgotten the desktop.

663
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,560
Shuttleworth told TechCrunch the desktop team

664
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,960
has remained the same size as before.

665
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,520
And he noted that the desktop is still a passion for him.

666
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,280
We took some big risks a year ago.

667
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,520
We cut a bunch of stuff that people loved about us,

668
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,320
but we had to see if people were going to respond commercially.

669
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,400
That move is paying off now, though.

670
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,720
During a keynote earlier at OpenStack,

671
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,480
Mark Shuttleworth noted that Canonical

672
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,920
is now in talks for about 200 new deployments for 2018.

673
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,920
And I don't know what kind of deployments they're talking about.

674
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,840
I assume OpenStack deployments up from about 40 in 2017.

675
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,640
They're kind of vague with some of the details there.

676
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,400
But since it's an OpenStack conference,

677
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,600
I would assume that is the context for that quote.

678
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,800
Hmm, so no IPO this year.

679
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:44,640
I thought an IPO in 2018, when that was sort of bubbling up,

680
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,920
seemed pretty aggressive.

681
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,440
But it doesn't really seem like it changes anything.

682
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,480
It just seems like, OK, this is noteworthy.

683
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,200
Yeah, exactly.

684
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,320
And it makes sense that if you're already well-positioned,

685
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,980
if you're already doing well, that you'd

686
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,080
want to wait until you're at the right stride at the moment,

687
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,880
you have a lot of prospects, and that people

688
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,260
are excited about you because you want your IPO to go well.

689
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,920
Yeah, it really is all about striking

690
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,580
the moment at the right time.

691
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,480
And part of doing this right is knowing when that moment is

692
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,400
and not shooting before it's arrived.

693
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,320
There's a risk also if doing it in the wrong time

694
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,760
to lose control, which is the risk of IPO.

695
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,640
What do you have in mind when you say that?

696
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Sounds like you have something specifically in mind.

697
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,420
No, it's just you're allowing other people

698
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,080
to be part of your company.

699
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,840
That's what an IPO does.

700
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,800
And that comes with other people having a say at times.

701
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,760
So you definitely want to do it in a time

702
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,160
that you have a good vision, strong position,

703
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,720
that it's hard to move away, so you

704
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,740
benefit from having the cash flow,

705
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,760
but not necessarily have the pressure

706
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,200
to conform to new owners.

707
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,280
Yeah, I follow you.

708
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,560
All right, I think that's probably enough on that.

709
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,180
So let's talk about an app pick that you

710
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:57,640
might find pretty useful.

711
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,960
It will launch commands when you press a combination of keys

712
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,680
on your system.

713
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:05,000
Like, think of an auto-destruct or maybe just something

714
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,740
more benign, like mounting, unmounting,

715
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,660
or something like that.

716
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:11,080
But what it is, it's shortcut D. It reads kernel input device

717
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,440
nodes directly, so there's no need

718
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,920
for any graphical environment.

719
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,800
It works on whatever the software stack you're using is,

720
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,760
supports blocking and non-blocking command spawns,

721
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,200
and it's resilient to keyboard hot plugs.

722
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,440
So you can plug your keyboard in only when needed,

723
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,040
execute the combo, and then unplug it.

724
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,240
And it will actually tolerate that.

725
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,240
It's written, though, as your favorite part, in Node.js.

726
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,320
And it's been designed to execute low-level

727
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:43,040
administrative commands, like so, say, systemctl start

728
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,520
sum.service.

729
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,320
And you just press a combo on your keyboard

730
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,080
or on a headless system.

731
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,400
How useful could this be on a headless server in your house?

732
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,440
Or even a little arm box.

733
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,200
And it'll execute a series of things.

734
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,080
Pretty nice, Wes.

735
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,720
You found this.

736
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,240
I got to say, this is pretty nice.

737
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,360
Did you have anything in mind when you found this shortcut D?

738
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:07,120
You know, I don't have any actual direct day-to-day use

739
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,660
cases, but I've been playing with it.

740
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,960
And I can see now just sort of small things in my life

741
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,200
that I could make more convenient.

742
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,620
And personally, I was interested.

743
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,120
It seems like kind of a good idea.

744
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,680
For me, I usually end up having Node the runtime installed

745
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,260
anyway, so a Node script is fine.

746
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,640
But I was also kind of wondering,

747
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,620
I wonder if anyone else has seen a similar program,

748
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,040
but maybe something written in Go,

749
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,040
static binary, or just a classic C program

750
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
that does the same thing.

751
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:30,720
I've seen worse.

752
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,120
Node OS still releases and still up there.

753
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,400
I mean, last release was in June 12, 2017, but it is there.

754
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,080
Like, your primary shell is Node.

755
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,920
So that exists.

756
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,080
Animals.

757
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,400
Animals is what that is.

758
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,320
That's just barbaric.

759
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,160
OK.

760
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,160
Well, while we're talking about performance,

761
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,200
let's talk about Gnome.

762
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,880
Gnome is having a performance hack fest.

763
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,680
It had one, I guess.

764
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,160
I think it's actually done now.

765
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,260
And when I grabbed the story, I believe it was going on.

766
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,840
But it's happening in Cambridge, and that always

767
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,840
means good weather and pub evenings, as they say.

768
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
And there's a couple of tidbits that I pulled away

769
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,000
from a blog post from Carlos.

770
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,200
Number one that I noticed is that xwayland1.20

771
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,200
seems to have some large improvements for battery life

772
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,940
on a laptop.

773
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,560
They managed to drop it down to a significant,

774
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,720
from a 20-watt draw to eight or nine-watt draw.

775
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,440
That's a good drop right there.

776
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,400
And some other improvements, like work

777
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,280
towards having Mudder dump a detailed per-frame information

778
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,840
so that way they can visualize.

779
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,300
They can actually graph and visualize

780
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,320
where every single little nuance and slowdown is.

781
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:38,880
Nice.

782
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,040
And it sounds like some other projects

783
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,760
might be doing that, too, yeah.

784
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,160
And there's some other nice progress

785
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:46,380
towards getting GDM to consume as little resources as possible

786
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,760
when switched away, which has been

787
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,560
one of my complaints about GDMs.

788
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,440
It's like a whole other Gnome session running,

789
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,160
and so they're working on actually tightening that up.

790
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,120
There has been some work to make 2D sessions work better

791
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:01,000
in Gnome Classic, where you have what they call purely 2D

792
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,040
actors, which is kind of a cool OpenGL term, I think.

793
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,000
And ways to prove no memory usage

794
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,440
when it's just in the background, in general,

795
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,200
were talked about.

796
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,520
Nothing, no work done yet, but they were discussing it.

797
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
Overall, it was a nice and productive event,

798
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,600
he writes, with knowledgeable people getting deep

799
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,320
inside the Gnome stack now, trying

800
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,000
to figure out where all the little performance issues are.

801
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:22,800
That's good.

802
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,360
We had developers from the Ubuntu Desktop team

803
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,880
participating at that event.

804
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,040
Oh, do tell.

805
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,960
Well, that's as much as I know.

806
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,000
The only things I've seen is a photo stream from Marco.

807
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,680
Marco is the same developer that you

808
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,760
saw in Taipei doing the fractional scaling work

809
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,880
last year, and he's been in Cambridge helping

810
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,200
with the Gnome Shell Hackfest.

811
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,640
Going deep, going deep on Gnome performance.

812
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,360
Can I ask, is this work is still valid

813
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,200
if we go Gnome 4 and we retool the way all this stuff works?

814
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,640
Or does this work kind of go out the window?

815
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,920
I shouldn't imagine that any of these developers

816
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,400
are reinvesting time and effort into something that's

817
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,400
disposable.

818
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,680
That's what I would think, too.

819
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,960
It just makes me wonder if it's more of a sign

820
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,120
that we're not fixing Gnome in Gnome 4

821
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,640
and we're keeping things the way they are, or if it

822
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,360
is a sign that this code is going

823
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,960
to be usable in Gnome Shell 4.

824
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,760
I just don't know which one of those two things it is.

825
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,680
Well, didn't they change so that it supports multiple versions?

826
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,960
So it wouldn't matter, as your newer apps

827
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,720
would use the newer version, and the older one

828
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,680
would use the old one.

829
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
It's no problem.

830
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,600
I mean, isn't that the reason that they did that effort

831
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,160
before?

832
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,760
I suppose if it's going to be around for a while,

833
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,400
it's good to have it as good as, it's best

834
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,840
to have it as good as possible.

835
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,320
I just like seeing the updates from them, you know?

836
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,840
It's cool to see the insight and see

837
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,080
that they're taking it seriously,

838
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,760
they're concerned about it, and seemingly getting

839
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,800
a lot of good work done.

840
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,760
Yeah, you know, the Gnome project

841
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:51,280
has gotten a rep for ignoring performance and not listening

842
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,920
to users.

843
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,360
But this week, we've seen this blog post

844
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,000
about a performance hack fest, where

845
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,280
people are making an effort to show up and do work there.

846
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,360
And we saw they rolled back that decision

847
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,320
to remove binary execution from Nautilus, which is a good sign

848
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,280
that they're listening.

849
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,200
People wrote in, they said, here's my use case,

850
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,700
why I need to be able to execute binary files from my file

851
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,480
manager.

852
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,040
And the developers said, OK, all right, well,

853
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,460
we'll punt this decision for now.

854
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,160
We're going to keep talking about it, but we're going to punt.

855
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,440
So that, to me, sort of busts both those myths.

856
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,520
At least it doesn't add a data point to that line.

857
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,080
And on a similar vein, in Joe's new show, Late Night Linux

858
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,280
Extra, that just released its second episode,

859
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,680
he interviewed Jonathan Riddle.

860
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,120
And Jonathan Riddle is a well-spoken member

861
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,400
of the KDE community who I think we should hear more from.

862
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,820
And I'm really glad that he sat down and talked to Joe,

863
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,040
because he busted one of those myths

864
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,800
that KDE is really, really sluggish,

865
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,600
and it's got bad performance.

866
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
He busted that myth in that show.

867
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,540
And I think, again, it's one of those things that just

868
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,200
propagates over and over again.

869
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,320
I saw somebody on YouTube installed all of the Ubuntu

870
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,900
1804 flavors, and where possible,

871
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,480
installed the full version and the minimal version,

872
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:13,040
and then profiled their memory use.

873
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,280
And KDE, or rather, Kubuntu, was among the lowest.

874
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,240
That's quite a bit of work to do, isn't it?

875
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,320
Yeah, and I agree.

876
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,760
In my testing, it was surprisingly fast.

877
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,240
I loaded it on that 10-year machine

878
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,560
for an episode of Last I did a while ago.

879
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,520
And it was the most modern desktop

880
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,680
I could get on there that was really, I guess,

881
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,440
the best way to put it is it just sort of worked.

882
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,440
It just degraded to a point where it was still very usable.

883
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,320
It was very modern.

884
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,480
I didn't really notice that anything wasn't working.

885
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,520
But when you compare it side by side to a brand new machine,

886
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,440
I could see, OK, it's got a little less shiny,

887
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,560
a little less shadows.

888
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,140
But I didn't really have to do much.

889
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,240
It just worked on a 10-year-old system.

890
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,840
And I think the system only had four gigs of RAM,

891
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,080
and it just worked great.

892
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,920
So it gets a bad rap.

893
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,720
Gnome gets a bad rap.

894
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,840
I say, you know what?

895
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,000
Take all of those reputations, all those myths

896
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,720
with a grain of salt, because there's more nuance

897
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,960
to all of these situations.

898
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,400
Still using it three months after the KDE challenge here.

899
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,360
Yeah, good work, sir.

900
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,000
Yeah, yeah, it's going great.

901
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,920
Hey, I'm going to go all the way down to Texas

902
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,720
and put Linux Academy on it for their broadcast system.

903
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,400
I'm so into it.

904
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,280
I really think it's solid, and I've been super happy with it.

905
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,080
And I'm keeping Neon on a couple of systems,

906
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,960
too, because I like the fresh plasma goodness

907
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,840
on a couple of my machines that are really in production.

908
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,440
So one of the machines I'm working today from the RV

909
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,000
is actually a Neon system.

910
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,680
So yeah, I agree.

911
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,480
It's gone really well.

912
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,000
So yeah, I am remote today.

913
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:37,960
Wes is remote.

914
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,880
Today is like a test episode, where yeah, we're super exciting.

915
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,720
We're getting ready for the big trip.

916
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,600
And so we thought, well, before I actually

917
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,680
am going down the road, we should

918
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,800
make sure everything works, because it's

919
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,840
tricky to route all this audio for the Mumble Room

920
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,240
and Wes and myself and record everything.

921
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,640
So this is a test episode.

922
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,440
That's why it might sound a little different or whatever.

923
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,640
It's not because our editor fell asleep at the wheel.

924
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,680
It's just because we're testing different stuff.

925
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,640
And so far, it's gone pretty well.

926
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,640
And that's why I'm about to talk about Ting,

927
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,560
because this would be the really awkward spot in the show

928
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,600
if I had to say my connectivity was dropping out,

929
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,080
our live stream had been bonkers,

930
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,520
and none of our hosts could hear me.

931
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,760
But fortunately, I don't have to say that.

932
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,800
It's been rock solid, linux.ting.com.

933
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,200
This is how I'm getting down to Texas and staying connected.

934
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,720
And the great part about Ting is they've got two networks.

935
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,200
Right now, I'm on their GSM network.

936
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,500
While I go through the mountains,

937
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,720
I often switch over to CDMA.

938
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,480
Now, I'm not going to lie.

939
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,440
I don't do some sort of fancy switcheroo.

940
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,720
I just have two devices.

941
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,240
It's just the way I prefer to do it.

942
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:36,880
It's simple.

943
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,200
I just switch Wi-Fi networks on my laptop.

944
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,200
So the GSM device has a Wi-Fi network,

945
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,160
and the CDMA device has a Wi-Fi, because they're little access

946
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:44,880
points.

947
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,800
And I just, in my desktop or on my laptop,

948
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,800
I just choose whichever one I want to be on that's

949
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,200
going to be stronger in that area.

950
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,120
So a lot of times when I'm in hills and trees,

951
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,320
CDMA is just the better choice.

952
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:01,320
But if I'm in town or if I'm in a valley, GSM is rock solid.

953
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,240
I'm getting, right now, 9 milliseconds.

954
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,480
Bouncing between 9 and 14 milliseconds on my ping.

955
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,160
I have a little thing in my status bar

956
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,800
that tells me what my ping is, with a 0% packet drop.

957
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,920
And I've got VoIP connections back to the studio, to Wes,

958
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,880
all kinds of things.

959
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,720
And I'm doing it over Ting.

960
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,520
Now, the reason why I tell you all of this

961
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,560
is because this is never how I use Ting, unless I'm traveling.

962
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:24,480
Otherwise, I just use Ting as like a backup data network.

963
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,720
I use Wi-Fi when I'm at the studio or when I'm at home.

964
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:30,280
And I download my podcast, and I pin my music there.

965
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,320
And I don't really make any phone calls.

966
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,480
I don't do text messages.

967
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,640
I do telegrams.

968
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,720
And so it's like $23 a month for a phone.

969
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,800
That's usually after your minutes, your messages,

970
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,320
your megabytes.

971
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,240
That's your average, $23 per phone, per month, $6 for the line.

972
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,360
And so for this month, I'm going to use Ting for data.

973
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,560
I'll pay a little more this month.

974
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,480
Next month, I won't.

975
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,440
It's pretty simple.

976
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,400
Also, if you're interested in Ting's fiber internet,

977
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,880
they have a new frequently asked questions

978
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,760
post up on their blog.

979
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,040
Totally worth checking out.

980
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,520
So go check it right now, linux.ting.com.

981
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,840
Take $25 off a device or get $25 in service credit.

982
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,520
That's linux.ting.com.

983
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,640
And thanks to Ting for keeping me on the road.

984
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,240
And see, the nice thing, too, about having those different

985
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:13,600
Mifis is you can just pay the $6 if you're not really using it.

986
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,080
And I can afford a $6 line.

987
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,200
And it's great.

988
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,200
It's great.

989
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,960
I don't have to fuss with changing things around

990
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,360
or activating or reactivating.

991
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,920
It's always there whenever you need it.

992
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,440
Yeah, right?

993
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,520
$6, that's great.

994
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,960
Exactly.

995
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,560
So Rust is coming to Qt, possibly, to Qt and QML.

996
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,440
There is a new project out there called the Rust Qt Binding

997
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,000
Generator.

998
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,880
That's a pretty clever name.

999
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,360
And it's a generator that helps you quickly use Rust code

1000
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,360
in Qt applications.

1001
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:46,720
So you can create a Qt or QML GUI on top of Rust code,

1002
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,840
which kind of seems like my peanut butter and my chocolate

1003
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,800
are coming together into a delicious technology sandwich.

1004
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,400
I love everything about this, Wes.

1005
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,160
Yeah, right?

1006
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,120
I mean, come on.

1007
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,160
Qt, Rust.

1008
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,960
Those are your favorite things to hype.

1009
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,680
Yeah, exactly.

1010
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,880
And they say to combine Qt and Rust,

1011
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,720
you write an interface and a JSON file.

1012
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:14,280
From that, the generator creates Qt code from the Rust code.

1013
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,080
And then the Qt code can be used directly.

1014
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,920
The Rust code has two files, an interface

1015
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,440
and an implementation file.

1016
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,400
Seems like a mess.

1017
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,160
You bastard, I'm excited about this.

1018
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,600
See, OK, OK.

1019
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,400
There had been plans in the past by Rust community

1020
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,360
to make a Rust toolkit.

1021
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,920
But they've been talking about it.

1022
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,160
It's a lot of work to make a toolkit that is decent,

1023
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,320
that people will adopt it.

1024
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,440
And it's going to compete with Qt, more fragmentation.

1025
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,880
So I find it good that there's efforts

1026
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,160
to go and integrate with Qt.

1027
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,240
And there's actually already efforts that integrate with GTK.

1028
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,480
It actually already worked, was the first one to work,

1029
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,080
because Rust works with C and therefore works with GTK.

1030
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,000
Everything kind of works with GTK.

1031
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,600
That's one thing aside.

1032
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,160
But it feels like a mess to have now a process

1033
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,680
that you are not really going to be writing Qt,

1034
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,960
nor really going to be writing Rust.

1035
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,000
So this is like an intermediate step.

1036
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,680
And honestly, this is what usually makes

1037
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,160
applications kind of crap.

1038
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,560
Go to crap directions.

1039
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,560
You are going to too many hoops in the between.

1040
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,480
And there's no clear, concise way of handling.

1041
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,320
They're not doing a proper port of Qt to Rust,

1042
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:28,640
nor making a dynamic system that you bind to Qt objects.

1043
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:31,000
You are now having a generator tool.

1044
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,960
How is that any different from what Vala did?

1045
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,040
See, I kind of disagree.

1046
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:36,480
Because you're still writing good, genuine Rust.

1047
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,800
It's not like it's some sort of weird Qt Rust hybrid.

1048
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,520
You'd hope that.

1049
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:43,560
But then if you're really going to be writing genuine Rust,

1050
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,480
you will lose the ability to write genuine Qt.

1051
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,240
No, no.

1052
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,600
See, I think this is cooler than you're giving it credit.

1053
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,040
Because this isn't going to be perfect.

1054
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,520
But this is an early step to getting

1055
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,480
some really solid Qt applications where

1056
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,680
you take a core Rust core, their application core of Rust,

1057
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,000
and then there is this description JSON file

1058
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,960
that the interface, the Qt interface, genuine Qt

1059
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,600
is generated from, which isn't really all that different

1060
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,840
from how Qt applications are done today.

1061
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,160
It's just now making it possible to do it with Rust.

1062
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,880
That's how a lot of applications are being done on the Linux

1063
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,880
desktop already.

1064
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,200
It's just they're not using Rust.

1065
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,680
I think that's been proven to work.

1066
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:23,880
I wonder also will that mean, will this build momentum,

1067
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,360
even if it's not an ideal interface, will people be like,

1068
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,080
oh, yeah, hey, I'm already writing Rust.

1069
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,640
I wanted to write a UI.

1070
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,920
Turns out Qt's pretty cool.

1071
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,280
And maybe that'll be more momentum

1072
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,400
to build a better binding.

1073
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,360
That's probably more likely what will happen.

1074
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,840
Yeah, and Dar, did you want to finish?

1075
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,960
Yeah, just the other part that I really see here

1076
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,520
is also loses a little bit on the opportunity

1077
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:47,320
to build something that Rust would actually benefit from.

1078
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,920
And the principles that we currently

1079
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,680
have in Rust, for example, like borrowing.

1080
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,240
It's a concept very unique to Rust language,

1081
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,120
not quite available in C++.

1082
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,720
And you can kind of half-bake it,

1083
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,880
but you still have to do the hard work as a developer

1084
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,080
yourself.

1085
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,040
Those benefits are not going to be necessarily there.

1086
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,120
And if the automated tool starts doing it,

1087
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,720
it's like code that people can't really inspect very well,

1088
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,400
because it's going to be generated code.

1089
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,360
And generated code lacks in that transparency aspect.

1090
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,800
So I think there is a side effect that

1091
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,680
is potentially negative that is often overlooked.

1092
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,680
And it doesn't matter.

1093
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,560
And yet, Dave, we get good applications, great.

1094
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,640
That's awesome.

1095
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:31,040
But I'd prefer to see more genuine attempts

1096
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,520
of making Rust Toolkit, even though it's

1097
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,080
a harder, longer task, than to just go with that route.

1098
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,440
I agree, ultimately, that would be definitely best.

1099
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,800
And if you're going to have a really good desktop application

1100
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,840
that's really robust, that's probably

1101
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,920
the route it would have to go.

1102
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,920
So ultimately, I want to get to our thoughts on the best Linux

1103
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,520
laptop in 2018.

1104
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,040
And I've kind of rounded up the ones that come to my mind.

1105
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,280
And they're sort of US-centric.

1106
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,880
So I want to eliminate a couple off the list.

1107
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,200
I want to get a couple of more on the list,

1108
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,160
and also get at least, if nothing else,

1109
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,320
honorable mentions of ones outside the US.

1110
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:06,800
So that's where we're going.

1111
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,340
We're not quite ready to go there yet,

1112
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:11,560
because I want to close the loop on replacing

1113
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,960
Evernote and a Note system.

1114
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,400
I've been really, really tempted, because those bastards

1115
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,700
over at Canonical just released Tusk as a snap.

1116
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,480
I assume it was probably you, Popi, you tempting jerk.

1117
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:24,200
It was upstream.

1118
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:24,800
Oh, really?

1119
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,000
We had nothing to do with it.

1120
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,320
The upstream developer worked on it, created the snap,

1121
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,960
put it in the store, job done.

1122
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,920
Yeah, it looks good.

1123
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:34,440
So if you just want to stick with Evernote,

1124
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,440
check out Tusk, snap install Tusk, because that looks clean,

1125
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,520
and almost made me want to give up on this whole thing I'm

1126
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,240
doing.

1127
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,000
But I'm trying to get away from Evernote,

1128
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,500
because I think that eventually is going to be a dumpster fire.

1129
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,800
And I've also just wanted to try to self-host this stuff as much

1130
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,600
as I could.

1131
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,560
And I mentioned a couple episodes ago

1132
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:56,960
that I've been playing around with Fedora 28 and Nextcloud 13.

1133
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,400
And I consolidated my years, and years, and years, and years,

1134
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,480
and years of upgrades Fedora box onto this new 28 machine,

1135
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,920
moved over the Nextcloud container,

1136
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,280
and all that kind of stuff.

1137
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:09,800
And so since I sort of spent the time doing that,

1138
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,960
at the same time I installed this app in Nextcloud

1139
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,280
called Notes.

1140
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,200
And it started just sort of casually.

1141
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,600
And then I installed QO Notes on my desktop.

1142
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,440
And by last week's episode, I was using QO Notes

1143
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,760
and syncing it up to Nextcloud.

1144
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,760
And I thought, oh, that's working pretty good.

1145
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,120
It's nice.

1146
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,400
You know, it just has a little spot in there.

1147
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,000
You plug in your server.

1148
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,040
It connects, checks to make sure everything is OK.

1149
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,480
You're good to go.

1150
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,020
And then I started to realize that I'm using this thing

1151
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,760
on a daily basis now.

1152
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,560
I've completely stopped using Evernote.

1153
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,560
And I'm taking lots of notes right now,

1154
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,040
because this going down to Linux Academy

1155
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,120
to get them to move over to Linux is a hell of a job,

1156
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:45,600
right?

1157
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:48,280
Because it's a project.

1158
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,400
It's a full-fledged project.

1159
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,880
Because they have all kinds of crazy stuff they do down there.

1160
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,020
It's a real production.

1161
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,480
And I've got to keep track of the hardware,

1162
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:57,560
all the different hosts, the connections, the types,

1163
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,240
like all this stuff.

1164
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,840
And I've been using the hell out of QO Notes

1165
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,160
to do this, and prepping for the road trip and Texas Linux Fest.

1166
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,680
It's been really reliable and handy.

1167
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,440
And so I wanted to take it to the next level

1168
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,520
and get it across all my devices and see

1169
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,920
if that could really do the Evernote replacement.

1170
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,280
And I achieved nirvana, note nirvana this week.

1171
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,400
And to kind of help maybe get you started,

1172
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,880
I'm going to link you in the show notes, linuxunplug.com

1173
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,800
slash 250, a guide that was posted by Marco

1174
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,480
over on linuxjournal.com.

1175
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,240
And it's getting started with Nextcloud,

1176
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,200
how and why you should.

1177
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,440
And this is the more traditional approach,

1178
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,280
actually installing all of the software and the Apache stuff,

1179
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,760
configuring my SQL.

1180
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,560
I, on my latest go-about, did not do this.

1181
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:40,040
Oh, no?

1182
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:40,880
I'm using a container.

1183
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,160
I know.

1184
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,080
I thought I looked at you.

1185
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,960
I'm, mm-hmm, I did the Docker thing.

1186
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:48,200
But see, Nextcloud makes an official container.

1187
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,400
So I kind of feel like that was the way to go.

1188
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:51,480
Yeah, you know that they're updating it.

1189
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,160
They're publishing it.

1190
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:52,840
It just works.

1191
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,960
You don't have any crazy operational concerns.

1192
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:55,920
Yeah, nice.

1193
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,440
Yeah, but I'll link to the guide.

1194
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,000
I'll also link to all the stuff I'm about to talk about.

1195
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,680
So then I installed the Notes app in Nextcloud 13,

1196
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,680
because they have an app marketplace, I guess.

1197
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:05,040
I don't know.

1198
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:05,600
There's nothing.

1199
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,080
I don't think there's anything charged in there.

1200
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,800
So I installed the Notes app, which is just

1201
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,680
a basic markdown notes.

1202
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,080
And whatever you create in here, it

1203
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,120
saves it to a Notes folder in Nextcloud,

1204
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:16,120
which then, if you install the Nextcloud client,

1205
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,680
syncs that folder down to your desktop.

1206
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,120
And everything in there is just plain text markdown.

1207
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,880
And that's also the same directory

1208
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,880
that qownotes looks at.

1209
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,080
So then I installed qownotes, which

1210
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,600
is a cute note-taking application that, again, uses

1211
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:36,240
markdown and has full support for own cloud and Nextcloud.

1212
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,600
And it has a dark theme, which I happen to like.

1213
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,520
It previews markdown.

1214
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,080
And Wimpy, I know that you are also a qownotes user,

1215
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,600
because I think you mentioned that in a recent Ubuntu

1216
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:45,360
podcast.

1217
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:45,760
Yeah.

1218
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,960
Yeah, I've been using that since that

1219
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,400
was the snap that brought my awareness of the project

1220
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:50,900
around.

1221
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,160
And I've been using it ever since.

1222
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,120
I really love it.

1223
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,640
Are you doing any kind of syncing,

1224
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,440
or are you just using it on a local file system?

1225
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,480
Kind of both.

1226
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,760
So the way I've set it up is to store its data

1227
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,280
in a prescribed directory.

1228
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,840
But that directory happens to be a directory that I sync.

1229
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,360
So I get syncing via other means.

1230
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:16,640
So it hasn't got the native Nextcloud integrated.

1231
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,160
But I was just able to place the data in a location

1232
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,000
where I already sync the stuff.

1233
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,520
Yeah, and that works perfectly fine.

1234
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,640
I think off the top of my head, you don't really lose much

1235
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,520
other than if I click the Share button in qownotes,

1236
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:34,480
it actually generates a Nextcloud preview URL

1237
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,760
that renders the markdown to HTML,

1238
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,720
and then it hosts it on the Nextcloud server,

1239
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,640
which is kind of cool.

1240
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:40,880
Then you can give somebody a URL,

1241
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,040
and they can look at your notes.

1242
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:42,560
Oh, wow.

1243
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:42,920
I didn't realize they did that.

1244
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,520
Just by clicking a button in qownotes.

1245
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:44,880
Yeah.

1246
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:45,440
That's pretty cool.

1247
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,040
Yeah, it's nice.

1248
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,320
So I was playing around with that.

1249
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:51,560
I prepped this whole show in qownotes this week,

1250
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,320
and I loved it.

1251
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,580
And so the only other piece I wanted,

1252
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,160
because the other thing I was using qownotes for

1253
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,440
is I'm taking notes for a bunch of stuff with our mixer,

1254
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,280
trying to keep track of some different things.

1255
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,920
And I wanted to be able to read them off from my phone

1256
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,760
while I'm actually standing over the mixer working on it.

1257
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,480
So I had to get those notes down on my phone.

1258
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,080
And that's where Cloud Notes, now there's plenty of solutions

1259
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,560
for Android, including, of course, for both platforms,

1260
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,720
just the Nextcloud app would be able to just browse

1261
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,560
the directory structure and view the files, right?

1262
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,760
But I wanted something that was specifically

1263
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,520
designed to take notes, supported markdown,

1264
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,320
supported doing lists and things of that nature.

1265
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:29,720
And that's where Cloud Notes, which specifically positions

1266
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,920
itself as an own cloud client, but it works just fine

1267
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,680
with Nextcloud, it's $1.99 in the iOS app store.

1268
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,320
And it's not perfect, but it does native connections

1269
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,160
to Nextcloud or own cloud, supports SSL,

1270
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,240
and it syncs all of the changes back and forth.

1271
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,520
It'll render the markdown, and it lets you share the notes.

1272
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,720
It's not a perfect note client, but it does put my notes now

1273
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,960
on my desktop, my laptop, my phone,

1274
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,600
and on the Nextcloud web, and it's

1275
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,320
marked down across all of them if I want to.

1276
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,840
And they all support, they all render it,

1277
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,320
they all do highlighting, syntax highlighting.

1278
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,840
And that happens to just be my preferred way to write notes.

1279
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,640
Anyways, I've done that since I was an IT contractor.

1280
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,040
It's pretty great.

1281
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,560
I'm just closing the loop on this topic.

1282
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,960
I won't spend a lot of time on it,

1283
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:18,040
but it really does feel like a solid, self-hosted, secure

1284
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:18,600
solutions.

1285
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,960
Everything's SSL.

1286
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,280
QownNotes has AES-256 encryption by default,

1287
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,360
but this is pretty cool.

1288
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:32,120
It has a plug-in to use Keybase as a key to actually do,

1289
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:35,880
yeah, to do GNU PG encryption of all of your notes

1290
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,600
signed to your Keybase profile.

1291
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,760
That is slick.

1292
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,920
Yeah.

1293
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,840
So there's a couple other really cool plug-ins

1294
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,920
that it supports in there, including swapping up

1295
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,360
the markdown engine and all kinds of stuff.

1296
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,800
QownNotes is, I really think it's

1297
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,280
an underrated application for the Linux desktop.

1298
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:52,480
It has so many uses.

1299
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,640
Even if you don't want to ever use any kind of sync system,

1300
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,360
you just want to have files on your local hard disk

1301
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,800
or on a thumb drive or whatever, it would do great at that.

1302
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,320
Is there anything you haven't been able to get quite right

1303
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,320
yet?

1304
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:10,480
Yeah, but Google Photos, I think, could fill in the gap.

1305
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:13,920
But the thing that Evernote is great at and kind of had

1306
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,280
kept me around is when I travel, I

1307
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,880
could take pictures of business signs,

1308
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,600
and it OCRs text in the photos.

1309
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,960
That is nice.

1310
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,120
Yeah, and it's got support for business cards and stuff

1311
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:24,240
like that.

1312
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,360
But I've got other apps on my phone

1313
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,760
now, like ScanBot, that can do that kind of stuff.

1314
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,200
So it's not as necessary.

1315
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,960
When I first had that functionality in Evernote,

1316
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,640
it was the only app that really did that.

1317
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:41,400
But now I could use ScanBot to take a photo of a sign

1318
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,920
and let Google Photos sync it up, and I could search it.

1319
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,120
I haven't actually done that yet because I'm still

1320
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,200
on the fence about going back to Google Photos.

1321
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,680
But it would be an alternative.

1322
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,360
Right, you have some options now.

1323
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,520
Yeah, yeah.

1324
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,080
I'd love to know if anybody else has any solutions.

1325
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,120
I don't know how to replace that functionality.

1326
00:56:58,120 --> 00:56:59,800
I do miss that the most.

1327
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,520
I don't know if Tusk even supports that,

1328
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,440
because it's a search thing, so it might.

1329
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,400
And the Evernote client is just really heavy,

1330
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,520
so I really kind of liked having a clean, fresh start, too.

1331
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,920
And I'd love to know your solutions for how

1332
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,720
you're doing all of this and what your thoughts are

1333
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,280
on notes.

1334
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,160
Like, I'm trying to use this system for notes

1335
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:21,720
on mechanical information about my RV, everything from types

1336
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:24,920
of oil to part numbers.

1337
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,040
I'm trying to keep track of how our mixer is configured.

1338
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,920
There's a wide range of stuff I'm trying

1339
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,480
to use a note system for, so I need

1340
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,880
to be able to categorize it a little bit.

1341
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,760
I need it to be across all the devices.

1342
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,000
I want it to be secure, and I'd rather it not

1343
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,800
be on a hosted service.

1344
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,340
I mean, I'm paying for the droplet,

1345
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,260
but I'd rather it not be on a hosted service.

1346
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:44,080
I'd rather it be on something I control.

1347
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,520
And now I'm making backups of that Nextcloud instance,

1348
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,040
plus I have it in plain text on all of my hard drives.

1349
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,660
It feels like a pretty solid solution,

1350
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,960
but I'd like to know what other people are doing.

1351
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,000
You can send in a contact note at linuxunplugged.com

1352
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,920
slash contact.

1353
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,960
All right, well then, let's get to the laptop stuff.

1354
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,620
So first, let's talk about DigitalOcean.

1355
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:06,080
Go to do.co slash unplugged to get a $100 credit

1356
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:10,160
at DigitalOcean do.co slash unplugged for 60 days.

1357
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,640
If you sign up with a new account,

1358
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:15,240
you'll get $100 in DigitalOcean service credits.

1359
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,400
Now, my favorite rig is $0.03 an hour,

1360
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,120
so that's going to get you quite a while

1361
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,720
on their super fast infrastructure.

1362
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:24,200
Everything is using SSDs, from the $0.03 an hour

1363
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,880
to the ones that have huge amounts of memory and CPU

1364
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:29,680
and disk, it's all SSD.

1365
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,880
When you attach block storage, it's SSDs.

1366
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,200
It's fast, plus 40 gigabit connections

1367
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,720
coming into the hypervisor.

1368
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,800
And then they've strategically placed data centers

1369
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,600
all around the world, so it has great connectivity

1370
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:41,760
to those regions.

1371
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,680
Plus, when you combine that with their predictable cost

1372
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,960
and billing, the different optimized compute types,

1373
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,560
including their new flexible droplets

1374
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,560
where you can mix and match resources,

1375
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,520
it's really hard to beat DigitalOcean.

1376
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,480
And then they have services built in,

1377
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,880
like Cloud Firewalls, monitoring and alerting,

1378
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,520
easy to manage DNS, and of course, that API.

1379
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:04,840
That API and that dashboard really bring it all together.

1380
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,400
They're easy to use, like the API is super clear,

1381
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,040
it's easy to read, and there's lots

1382
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,920
of open source applications already built

1383
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,600
that you can just start using today.

1384
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,480
You can just start taking advantage of them.

1385
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,080
Plus, they have fantastic uptime.

1386
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,920
My next cloud instance that I've been using this whole week,

1387
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,720
of course, that's up on DigitalOcean.

1388
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,560
I put it in the San Francisco region.

1389
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:25,920
I am predominantly on the West Coast of the United States.

1390
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,200
And not always now, but almost always.

1391
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,000
And so that made sense for me.

1392
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,380
But I could move it around, I could

1393
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,240
have set up a separate one somewhere else.

1394
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,960
I like that functionality.

1395
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,240
And they have such great pricing.

1396
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,680
$0.03 an hour for my favorite one.

1397
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,160
It's just, it's crazy.

1398
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,880
So go take advantage of that $100 credit,

1399
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,320
go build something great.

1400
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,280
Go play around with an entire stack of open source software,

1401
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,280
or build something from the ground up.

1402
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,120
dio.co slash unplugged.

1403
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:56,680
Big thank you to DigitalOcean, that's dio.co slash unplugged.

1404
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,840
Going to have a straw poll linked in the show notes

1405
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,760
on the best Linux laptop for 2018.

1406
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,000
I'm going to drop it in the chat room too right now.

1407
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,440
I know not everything's on there,

1408
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,200
so here's the way this is going to work.

1409
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,640
I would like you to go vote on this,

1410
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,640
because whatever gets the least amount of votes

1411
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,320
gets eliminated off this list, and we'll

1412
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,480
put something else on there.

1413
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,080
But right now, these are the laptops

1414
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,520
that seem the most appealing to me.

1415
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,480
And I'll bust through them really quick,

1416
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,600
and then we'll talk about each one of them individually.

1417
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,600
Again, I acknowledge there's some missing,

1418
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,800
like all of the Intraware products, for example,

1419
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,240
are not on this list.

1420
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,600
But here is the top ones that I have so far.

1421
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:36,040
The ThinkPad X270, the Aurex Pro newly updated,

1422
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,320
the XPS 13 Developer Edition, ThinkPad X1 Carbon,

1423
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:43,520
and the Librem 15 are sort of my top choices

1424
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,000
right now for a 2018 Linux laptop.

1425
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,560
And each one has pros and cons, and the ones

1426
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:53,520
I probably know the least about are the Lenovo ThinkPads.

1427
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,280
But from what I've heard about NOA's 270, which isn't even

1428
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,680
the current model anymore, it seems

1429
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:00,500
like a pretty compelling device.

1430
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:02,680
You're probably a resident ThinkPad expert,

1431
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,120
Popi, do you know the difference between the 280 and the 270

1432
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,960
and why NOA says the 270 is the one you want to get?

1433
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,360
Not really.

1434
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,560
My most current laptop is a 250.

1435
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,800
I generally go for the one that's a year older,

1436
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,600
just because it's cheaper.

1437
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,160
And I can get it second hand.

1438
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,000
You get a half price than the one that's brand new.

1439
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,360
Yeah, I know that the one big difference

1440
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,640
is a crazy proprietary ethernet dongle port on the 280.

1441
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,760
They've dropped ethernet.

1442
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,060
That's a shame, that's been one of their selling points.

1443
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,440
But the reason the 270 is high on my list

1444
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:40,400
is having watched the way NOA works with his,

1445
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,280
it has incredible battery life.

1446
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:44,480
It really is an all day battery.

1447
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,880
And it's got a three cell battery integrated into it.

1448
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,000
They don't call it a battery, but it's got a three cell

1449
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,880
battery, a power station I think is what they call it,

1450
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,680
integrated.

1451
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:55,760
And then he's got a nine cell battery hanging off the back.

1452
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,040
And the cool thing about that integrated battery

1453
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,760
is he can hot swap batteries.

1454
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,720
He can just rip the battery off and slap a new one in.

1455
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,280
And that three cell internal keeps it going for a while.

1456
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,640
Yeah, I do that with my T450.

1457
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,800
It's a fantastic feature.

1458
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,120
I have three spare batteries for my T450.

1459
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:16,480
So if I want to, I can go all day and beyond

1460
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,860
and just swap out while I'm running.

1461
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,520
And it just keeps on running on the internal

1462
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:21,440
while you swap it out.

1463
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,760
It's great.

1464
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:25,280
Like I don't need that all the time.

1465
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,400
But when I need it, I super need it.

1466
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,600
So on this trip to Texas, I am the whole way down there.

1467
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,280
We are running off of batteries.

1468
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,680
And when we drive, we charge the batteries.

1469
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,800
And when we park, we drain the batteries.

1470
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,160
And it's going to be 100 degrees in some areas.

1471
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:43,320
So the fridge will be sucking batteries down like crazy.

1472
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,620
So if my laptop can avoid being plugged in,

1473
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:47,440
because the double damage with my laptop

1474
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,480
is it's converting DC to AC back to DC.

1475
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,140
It's just this brutal process where

1476
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,380
if I can avoid doing that when I'm running off of batteries

1477
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:59,120
and I can just go off of the laptop battery,

1478
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,760
that would be very, very beneficial.

1479
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,440
And that kind of kicked this whole thing off.

1480
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,280
No, it gets like 12, 14 hours.

1481
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:07,120
What kind of battery life do you get, Popi?

1482
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,640
Probably not as much as that.

1483
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:12,280
But then I'm doing quite brutal things, lots of compiling,

1484
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:16,220
lots of VMs, electron apps, all the kind of things

1485
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:19,080
that you probably don't want to run if you want that.

1486
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,760
Now, Wes, you have been shopping for a laptop.

1487
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,040
You've got the original Sputnik Developer Edition.

1488
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,720
And you were just looking at the X1 Carbon,

1489
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,680
which is the second ThinkPad on this list.

1490
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,840
Yeah, it is really handsome.

1491
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,480
I just happened to be in a store the other day,

1492
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,120
and there was the XPS 13 right next to an X1 Carbon.

1493
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:37,960
Oh, really?

1494
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,880
Boy, they're both handsome.

1495
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,160
I love how light the XPS is.

1496
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,200
It's just light and thin and feels super minimal.

1497
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,480
The Carbon, though, does have a certain,

1498
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,020
it still has that ThinkPad style feel.

1499
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:50,040
It feels a little more rugged.

1500
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,320
It feels sort of like you could really throw it in a bag

1501
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:53,720
and just not worry about it.

1502
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,320
Yeah, the XPS is a little delicate.

1503
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,240
Now, I have the fifth generation.

1504
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,400
I'm actually talking to you through my old XPS right now.

1505
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,480
That's the last laptop I have right now.

1506
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,680
And I broke it.

1507
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,800
And so the side, it squishes when I pick it up.

1508
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:13,080
It's starting to fall apart a little bit on me.

1509
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,400
So over the three years I've had it,

1510
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,880
it's maybe not held up quite as well as I wanted.

1511
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,080
But it's still fully functional, and I'm still

1512
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,440
using it as a full-fledged production machine.

1513
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,640
So it's just maybe the build quality

1514
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:29,440
could have been a little bit better.

1515
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,640
And I would bet you it has improved since then.

1516
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:35,720
When I was at scale, I saw quite a bit of the X1 Carbon

1517
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,680
floating around.

1518
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:37,920
Seemed to be a popular one.

1519
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,160
Seemed like it was fine running Linux.

1520
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,120
You do lose that ethernet port again, though,

1521
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,320
which that's a bit of a deal breaker for me.

1522
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:45,920
I really want an ethernet port.

1523
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,280
What's most important to you, the portability of the device

1524
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:52,560
or the size and comfort of the screen?

1525
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:55,200
Do you mind about how heavy it is?

1526
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,480
Not a lot.

1527
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,720
The screen is probably slightly more important,

1528
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,640
and a good keyboard is pretty important.

1529
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,640
I don't want it much bigger than the XPS 13,

1530
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,720
so somewhere around 13 inches, I think,

1531
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,120
is kind of what I'm looking at.

1532
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,640
So you're not going to be video editing on this thing, then?

1533
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,880
No, no, I don't plan to.

1534
01:05:11,880 --> 01:05:14,720
No, it's more for web, email, and audio.

1535
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,920
Right, OK.

1536
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,200
You have something in mind?

1537
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:21,280
Well, I was just wanting to clarify.

1538
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,880
There's no point in me going into it

1539
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,840
if you know what your use case is.

1540
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:29,720
But as an owner of two XPS 13s and having also

1541
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:33,880
reviewed their current model, they're really solid devices.

1542
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,800
Yeah, I am predisposed to be inclined to go with the XPS 13

1543
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:41,640
because it's got a really solid accessory market, too,

1544
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:43,520
like Docs and USB-C hubs and things

1545
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,080
like that that are really reliable,

1546
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,480
and that's attractive to it.

1547
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,880
Another advantage is that it doesn't matter

1548
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,480
what Linux you put on it.

1549
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,960
You'll be able to update the firmware via Linux

1550
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,760
with the XPS 13.

1551
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:00,480
Also, the new Hades Canyon NUC also

1552
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,120
has its firmware in LVFS, so I discovered at the weekend.

1553
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:05,360
Oh, really?

1554
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,760
A little side tangent, how is the Hades Canyon NUC going?

1555
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:11,560
That is going to be many weeks of hard work

1556
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:16,360
to get Linux working well on it is the TLDR there.

1557
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:19,920
Yeah, it's all in flight at the moment.

1558
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,880
So the GPU is not supported in current kernels.

1559
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,520
It's scheduled for inclusion in 4.18.

1560
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:30,120
So it's building kernels from Git with DRM next branches

1561
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:30,760
and stuff.

1562
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:34,560
Yeah, I think the XPS 13 is my strongest lead right now.

1563
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:37,940
The Lenovo only pulls ahead because of that power station

1564
01:06:37,940 --> 01:06:40,000
feature where I could swap batteries.

1565
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:45,280
And the 270 has ethernet, which the XPS does not.

1566
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:47,040
And it has USB-C charging.

1567
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:49,040
But you raised a good question, like the screen.

1568
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:51,160
Well, what if I wanted to go with a slightly larger screen?

1569
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,880
Because if it's going to be my main system for production

1570
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,520
while I'm on the road.

1571
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:58,880
Then the Librem 15 or the Oryx Pro, I think,

1572
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,320
become pretty solid contenders.

1573
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:06,480
I have the Librem 15 and the One Rev behind that they sent to me.

1574
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,480
And I think it's a really good system.

1575
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,600
I'm not a huge fan of the screen, but other than that,

1576
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,040
I think it's a great system with a good keyboard.

1577
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,560
And then System76 just updated the Oryx Pro.

1578
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,720
And it looks pretty nice.

1579
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:22,240
It's got 8th Gen i7 CPUs, up to 32 gigs of RAM.

1580
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:23,480
And it's a lot thinner.

1581
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:27,600
It's way thinner with a GTX 10 in it.

1582
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:31,280
The only complaint I have with it is the battery, I think,

1583
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:33,880
is like around somewhere in the 50 watt range.

1584
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:39,640
And that's not so bad on a XPS 13.

1585
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,480
But on an Oryx Pro slightly larger,

1586
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:43,400
when I'm trying to optimize for battery life,

1587
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:46,440
that's sort of not the right use case for me.

1588
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,400
If I could be plugged in most of the time,

1589
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,480
I think it would actually be a good system for me.

1590
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:53,360
But the battery life is a killer.

1591
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,680
And I can't seem to find one that

1592
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,320
beats that ThinkPad for battery.

1593
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,560
So this is where I kind of punt to the audience a little bit.

1594
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,640
I'd like to know what they think, linuxunplug.com

1595
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:01,800
slash contact.

1596
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:04,400
And we also have that poll in the show notes.

1597
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,640
I wonder if anybody's voting.

1598
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:07,960
Because what I was thinking was, is obviously,

1599
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,280
this is not an inclusive poll.

1600
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,320
So if we can pull a couple of these off the list right now,

1601
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,240
the ThinkPad X270 and the Librem 15

1602
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,920
are trailing behind the most.

1603
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,240
And the XPS 13 is pulling ahead, which

1604
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,560
is the live voting that we have with the live audience.

1605
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,280
So I'll link that in the show notes.

1606
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:25,440
I'd like to have the rest of the download audience

1607
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,160
vote on that a bit, or at least those of you that are willing,

1608
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,320
just so we can kind of get a sense of which laptop

1609
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,080
we should remove from that list, and then

1610
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,680
let us know on the contact page which laptop we should add.

1611
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,600
Wes and I are not necessarily either one of us

1612
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,400
buying a laptop today.

1613
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,520
But Wes, you've got to be getting close, right?

1614
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,400
Yeah, I think it now is the summer.

1615
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,560
I've got some traveling coming up.

1616
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:46,880
But then after that, I think it will really, really be time.

1617
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,120
Striking distance for you.

1618
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,240
Yeah, and that'll be nice.

1619
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:51,320
That way, when you launch Slack, your little fan

1620
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,040
doesn't have to spin up every time.

1621
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:52,680
Yeah, exactly.

1622
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:53,800
That'd be good.

1623
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,120
I can run two Electron apps.

1624
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:55,600
Oh, my.

1625
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,100
Yeah.

1626
01:08:56,100 --> 01:08:56,600
Yeah.

1627
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,440
Yeah.

1628
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:01,600
I know this Chrome app that we're using to talk right now

1629
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:05,080
really spins my CPUs up pretty bad on this XPS 13.

1630
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,440
That's what's pegging it.

1631
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,960
Not all the other stuff I'm doing, but that Chrome app.

1632
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:11,760
Yeah, so check out that poll.

1633
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:13,880
Go vote and let us know what you think.

1634
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,800
Mumble room, any other thoughts on laptops or hardware

1635
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:19,160
before we wrap this sucker up?

1636
01:09:19,160 --> 01:09:20,480
The Galago Pro gets a mention.

1637
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,400
Yeah, somebody in the chat room is saying,

1638
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,040
mention the Galago Pro.

1639
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:26,240
Yeah, I don't think, again, that comes back

1640
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,680
to the battery and the fan stuff with the Galago Pro

1641
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,120
are not going to make an optimal for my use case.

1642
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,120
The Dell XPS 15 is getting a mention.

1643
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,040
The Latitude E6440.

1644
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:39,000
OK, those are good mentions from the chat room, too.

1645
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,400
Ones with two 9-cell batteries?

1646
01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:40,900
Oh.

1647
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:41,680
Dang, that is great.

1648
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,400
Yeah, I'm kind of curious if there's these sleeper hits

1649
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:44,760
that we've just been missing that turned out

1650
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,320
to be a really reliable Linux laptop that no one's ever

1651
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,920
heard of because it's an Acer or something.

1652
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,360
Speaking of Jonathan Riddle, he did a pretty hard sell

1653
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:54,280
for the Pine Book.

1654
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,400
And it kind of made me really interested.

1655
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,120
You can only get them in limited quantities

1656
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:59,300
because they don't build them until there's

1657
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,400
enough of an order.

1658
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:04,400
But the Pine Book sounded pretty cool, like $100 somewhere

1659
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,920
around there for a ARM laptop that's

1660
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,360
actually decent performance.

1661
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,000
I got to be honest, that piqued my interest.

1662
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,280
That piqued my interest.

1663
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,760
All right, well, go check out more Popeye and Wimpy

1664
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,640
over at the excellent Ubuntu podcast, which

1665
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:22,080
is coming right along and always a great listen.

1666
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,120
Just caught the latest episode the other day

1667
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,580
and thought it was quite enjoyable.

1668
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:27,680
Good work, gentlemen, as always on the podcast.

1669
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,080
I recommend people go check it out.

1670
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:31,200
Thank you very much.

1671
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,880
And Mr. Wes and I do a full breakdown

1672
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:40,280
of the big bad new version, the new variant of, what was it,

1673
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:41,440
the store bypass variant.

1674
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,520
Of course, I'm totally blanking out now

1675
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,040
because I didn't plan to mention this.

1676
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,240
Spectre v4.

1677
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:46,320
Yeah, Spectre v4.

1678
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,200
We do a full breakdown on this week's episode of Tech Snap.

1679
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,000
Wes did an excellent job of digging

1680
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,340
through some of the documentation

1681
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:56,360
that Red Hat released, which was really good stuff.

1682
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:59,960
And we have a digest of all of that and more things you need

1683
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,320
to know in this week's episode of Tech Snap.

1684
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:05,160
So check that out at techsnap.systems.

1685
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:08,760
Now, this show continues on as we go down the road.

1686
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,680
I don't know exactly how or when.

1687
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,760
But it will.

1688
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:12,600
But it will.

1689
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:13,640
It will.

01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,200
linuxunplug.com slash subscribe.

1691
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,080
Just get it every single week whenever it does come out.

1692
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:22,100
And we will attempt to stream it live.

1693
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,720
You can find that at jbliv.tv.

1694
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,120
And you can find the live times at jupyterbroadcasting.com

1695
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,180
slash calendar.

1696
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,400
Links to everything we talked about at linuxunplug.com

1697
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:33,000
slash 250.

1698
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,120
How's about that for a whole bunch of Earls?

1699
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,200
How about one more for the Texas shirt?

1700
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,440
teespring.com slash jbtexas.

1701
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:40,800
Go get some swag.

1702
01:11:40,800 --> 01:12:06,120
And we'll see you next week.

1703
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:09,360
All right, we got a title, jbtitles.com.

1704
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,000
Oh, Hadidah's getting home.

1705
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,840
Hadidah has arrived home just as we finished.

1706
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:14,880
Perfect timing.

1707
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,880
jbtitles, jbjbtitles.

1708
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,120
All right, we'll see what we get.

1709
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,920
It's nice to have JBot back.

1710
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,200
See if it'll load, though.

1711
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,000
jbtitles.com.

1712
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,840
How did it feel doing it from home, Wes?

1713
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:27,560
Not too bad.

1714
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,280
A little bit different.

1715
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,160
I miss your smile and face, of course.

1716
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:31,080
But hey, workable.

1717
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,400
Oh, you're such a gentleman.

1718
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,080
You're such a gentleman.

1719
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,080
No, I mean, it was kind of nice to be

1720
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,960
able to take a breather between techsnap and live.

1721
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,800
That was kind of fun.

1722
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:41,560
Levi enjoyed the sunshine.

1723
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,600
So that was good.

1724
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:44,560
My air conditioning kicked on midway through the show

1725
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,640
because it started to get really, really hot in here.

1726
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,480
How come JB Titles isn't loading, Wes?

1727
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:52,000
Uh-oh.

1728
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:52,520
Yeah.

1729
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:53,120
Yeah.

1730
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:53,840
It's no good.

1731
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,160
It's no good.

1732
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:57,800
How are we ever going to title it?

1733
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,400
You know, we also didn't title TechSnap.

1734
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,800
This is a double title jam up.

1735
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,120
What's happening with us?

1736
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:04,080
Oh, man.

1737
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,000
Mamba Room, thanks, guys.

1738
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,280
You guys were great, as always.

1739
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,360
Hello, darling.

1740
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:08,840
Hello.

1741
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:09,400
Welcome home.

1742
01:13:09,400 --> 01:13:10,360
Did you bring home beer?

1743
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,440
I brought home beer for me and cider for you.

1744
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:12,960
Thank you.

1745
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,160
Cider for me and beer for her.

1746
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:16,320
I was just thinking, I can't believe we did the show

1747
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,760
and I don't have any booze in the show.

1748
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,200
Like, I don't have to drive anywhere.

1749
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,120
I'm at home.

1750
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:38,240
I could have had a brewski.
