WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.140
I've got a big problem and I need your guys's help

00:03.140 --> 00:07.720
I I've discovered there is a major hole in my life that I did not know was there until I got a couple of

00:07.720 --> 00:11.560
Days of downtime. I'm sitting there on the Thanksgiving holiday week in the rover

00:11.560 --> 00:15.200
I'm like, you know what? I want to do. I want to watch some TV. Maybe even I want to watch some home alone

00:18.240 --> 00:19.720
Cozy up watch some home alone

00:19.720 --> 00:25.240
Then I remembered that my whole rover runs off of a my fight connection and all of a sudden I went from not caring about

00:25.240 --> 00:29.780
TV at all to I got to have a way that I can like come down to the studio

00:29.780 --> 00:36.720
Sink media to some kind of device go back to the rover and play offline still with some streaming options if I want them

00:36.720 --> 00:38.880
Right, I keep and so here's the solution

00:38.880 --> 00:41.720
I don't want to use because this is what seems like the easy solution

00:42.000 --> 00:44.080
Take an iPad with the Plex app

00:44.080 --> 00:44.560
Yep

00:44.560 --> 00:46.200
Come down here to the studio

00:46.200 --> 00:50.280
sync to the Plex server to the iPad bring the iPad back to the rover and

00:50.600 --> 00:52.800
Watch like Plex on the iPad offline

00:53.520 --> 00:57.340
Mmm, but that's not very Linux II. No, there's got to be a way to do it

00:57.340 --> 01:01.840
Like and I'm so I'm I'm curious what could what could be like a decent?

01:01.840 --> 01:06.680
What are people's offline media solution where you have maybe like a collection of media somewhere?

01:06.680 --> 01:08.680
I have a quick question for you Chris. Yeah

01:08.840 --> 01:12.240
How do you have a defined way you'd like to be watching it in the rover?

01:12.240 --> 01:14.240
I mean, do you have a TV? Do you know?

01:14.480 --> 01:17.160
No, I don't I would for not to be on definitely not on the desktop

01:17.160 --> 01:22.080
Are you do you have a mobile a laptop with a decent-sized screen would be okay or a tablet would be okay

01:22.080 --> 01:25.960
Basically something that's decent enough to watch a TV on but it doesn't have to be that big

01:25.960 --> 01:27.960
So I thought maybe I could do like an MB

01:28.400 --> 01:33.040
server with maybe like a tablet app right or on a laptop or maybe like well

01:33.040 --> 01:35.360
Like I said Plex on a tablet could be an Android tablet, too

01:35.360 --> 01:38.160
But I just I hate Android tablets sure or our sink, you know

01:38.160 --> 01:41.360
I could just our sink some files over from time to time and use VLC, right?

01:41.360 --> 01:46.600
but I would really like something that has like played status and resume support for where I left off and maybe

01:46.920 --> 01:48.680
transcoding support for different devices

01:48.680 --> 01:54.280
So I don't really know what the solution is here because the ideal the ideal thing would be like, okay

01:54.280 --> 01:58.880
It's a Friday and I'm here at the studio. I'll sync up a couple of shows and then I'll go home for the weekend

01:58.880 --> 02:01.520
And I watch all my stuff and then I come back

02:01.960 --> 02:07.140
On Monday for Kota radio and I think but I watched we take some stuff off put some stuff on

02:07.720 --> 02:09.640
It would be really nice

02:09.640 --> 02:15.120
Wimpy do you have an idea because I see my you you said I know you know what it is. Tell me when we yeah

02:15.680 --> 02:17.240
okay, so

02:17.240 --> 02:20.160
What we have here what we have in the house here is

02:20.160 --> 02:24.320
a server running open media vault with

02:24.880 --> 02:29.880
Plex installed on that so all of the media is on there

02:29.960 --> 02:33.920
So consequently anyone in the house using any device

02:34.440 --> 02:39.320
can watch the film when our shortwave radio is down to

02:40.000 --> 02:46.200
You know stream it to your device with transcoding working and all the rest of it. So if you had a small Plex

02:46.200 --> 02:53.400
Server or you could do it then be as well. I suppose does anybody do transcoding for devices? Yeah

02:53.400 --> 02:57.600
Yeah, yeah, then you could use that as well and you you host it in

02:58.520 --> 03:03.360
The RV and then so and then and then just sort of over time

03:03.800 --> 03:09.960
Trickle content down to it and content add content to the server as and when you get the opportunity, you know

03:09.960 --> 03:12.360
So the way that we add content to this is we buy

03:12.360 --> 03:18.920
Blu-ray discs and I have a machine that I ripped the films off the Blu-ray into the media

03:18.920 --> 03:24.080
I mean, yeah, that's actually pretty good. I have seen just in that same vein if you're an MB supporter

03:24.080 --> 03:28.000
They have a folder sync. Yeah, and so you can transcode out you can target a specific

03:28.000 --> 03:32.120
Yes, and so you might be able to do that to an external hard drive and bring it in if you hadn't it at one

03:32.120 --> 03:36.720
There maybe too much work. I'm not sure it wouldn't have probably that probably wouldn't have the watch status

03:36.720 --> 03:37.520
I wonder about that

03:37.520 --> 03:44.120
That would go basically I would use MB to organize all the files and then use its folder sync plug-in right to manage

03:44.120 --> 03:47.020
I have not tried that but Popey you said you had an idea

03:48.600 --> 03:55.240
Yeah, I just posted a link in IRC it's a device which is a mobile wireless access point

03:55.640 --> 04:00.400
That has a USB port and an SD card slot and it's got a battery

04:00.680 --> 04:03.960
So it's designed to be a portable media server

04:03.960 --> 04:10.400
so you just stick all your media on a USB Drive plug it into that thing and then you can go anywhere carry this thing with

04:10.400 --> 04:17.000
You and it creates a wireless access point you connect to connect multiple devices to it and just stream media straight off it to any

04:17.000 --> 04:22.400
Device. Oh, wow. Nice. So basically probably uses what DLNA to to connect to it

04:22.400 --> 04:24.920
So anything that supports DLNA playback and stream off of it

04:25.160 --> 04:29.840
I'm not sure what protocol it uses but the good news is it is flashable. So you can actually stick anything

04:29.840 --> 04:35.320
You can put like Linux or open WRT or some other random stuff on it as well

04:35.440 --> 04:36.620
You can hack it

04:36.620 --> 04:41.640
but the fact that it's got a battery and it means you can go out and about and still carry on listening to content off of

04:41.640 --> 04:45.520
It or like watching media off of it when the power goes out Wow

04:45.520 --> 04:48.520
I mean this is so they even have a newer version. I

04:49.440 --> 04:55.200
How can this be? I've got the old one. It's like 30. It's like 30 bucks us. That seems entirely too reasonable

04:55.200 --> 04:59.520
Yeah, I mean, there's no there's no storage in it. So you've got to provide an SD card in there, right?

04:59.520 --> 05:04.000
But you can have an SD card of TV shows and SD card of movies and who doesn't have one laying around

05:04.800 --> 05:10.200
Interesting interesting that is actually pretty neat. I'm gonna put a link to that in the show notes. That's a pretty neat idea

05:10.720 --> 05:12.720
I wonder though if

05:14.040 --> 05:19.440
You know what to me what what I really would like is something that is kind of what wimpy was saying where I just have

05:19.440 --> 05:26.360
A rig in the rover that's that is receiving files through maybe like sync thing or something. Yeah, that's my idea

05:26.360 --> 05:30.800
You sink thing. Yeah, okay, but then here's the problem though at first of all

05:30.800 --> 05:35.600
It requires connectivity in the rover all the time. And the second thing is I'm still not sinking my watch data

05:35.600 --> 05:39.140
So do I do I just give up on that? I guess well, you could like deleted or something

05:39.140 --> 05:42.800
You don't necessarily have to I don't know you could find some other way put it in a separate folder

05:43.120 --> 05:45.000
Just use the file system

05:45.000 --> 05:51.880
Yeah, deal with more status connection all the time. No, does it only needs connection periodically, you know in order to sync synchronize?

05:51.880 --> 05:58.640
Yeah, it's like, you know, whenever you like pull up outside McDonald's get it to synchronize over there Wi-Fi or whatever

05:58.640 --> 06:01.400
I mean you can set it up in such a way that you had to be at home

06:01.400 --> 06:03.800
So it had to only sync when you were local at the studio

06:03.960 --> 06:07.400
Or you could do it like when you set up a VPN connection so it could be explicit

06:07.400 --> 06:10.480
So it's only sinking when you're on a connection that you think has enough bandwidth

06:11.160 --> 06:15.240
Well, it feels nice though. I mean what I was kind of fantasizing the reason why the

06:15.240 --> 06:22.680
The iPad or Android tablet running Plex is so fancy to me is because I just bring it with me one day

06:22.680 --> 06:24.840
And I just hit a button it just sucks down all the new stuff

06:24.840 --> 06:29.120
And then I walk away and it's got all the new stuff and no connection required at the rover at all

06:29.120 --> 06:31.800
I have a wild idea what what if you use something like

06:32.360 --> 06:36.440
ZFS or butter fs snapshots. Yeah, take snapshots of your MB installation

06:36.440 --> 06:42.840
Oh, hold on West send that right to an external or something and connect it up and run MB from that drive and then have it

06:42.840 --> 06:46.400
Rescan your library and then it would only show you things that you you had kept that is interesting

06:46.400 --> 06:50.640
I don't know. It's overly complicated. You'd have to set it a lot of stuff. I love it though. I love it

06:50.640 --> 06:51.760
I love it

06:51.760 --> 06:56.160
I know it uses a sequel like database to store a lot of configuration and probably the watch status too

06:56.160 --> 06:56.480
I don't know

06:56.480 --> 07:00.400
I think I have there's a lot that appeals me to a popes old device and also to wimpy solution

07:00.400 --> 07:02.400
Yes, the thing the one thing I like about

07:03.080 --> 07:08.720
Something simple is I guess I'm trying to I'm trying to punt for as long as possible on setting up a server in the rover

07:08.720 --> 07:11.560
At least I'd like to get through the end of winter

07:11.560 --> 07:17.360
I don't know, but we'll see maybe maybe maybe a NUC and a little hard external hard drive

07:17.360 --> 07:20.240
It's just I don't know. I don't know. It's a lot to set up

07:20.240 --> 07:25.960
Yeah, it is it is and I've already I've already set up two in two other places and I have a third on digital ocean

07:25.960 --> 07:30.080
Right now so it's like do I really want a for how much infrastructure? Do you want to be responsible?

07:30.080 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, I just uh, it's getting I'm getting tired of it

07:33.000 --> 07:37.720
I want something to move to a smaller house, but with more devices because it basically I don't watch media that often anymore

07:37.720 --> 07:42.600
But right. Yeah, it was and then of course I'm thinking to myself. Where is my dang?

07:43.720 --> 07:46.640
my dang purism laptop because I could just

07:47.200 --> 07:52.560
Do that right now. I could just as a 1080p display. I could watch some 1080p on there. I

07:54.080 --> 07:56.080
Got nothing

07:56.440 --> 08:01.560
Yeah, yeah, I agree I might just do VLC I might just do VLC and an NFS mount over the net

08:01.560 --> 08:06.840
I don't know. I could do that too. And to be honest, you know, both ambient plex have pretty good solutions here

08:06.840 --> 08:08.880
So I might just watch to see what they do too, right?

08:08.880 --> 08:14.400
I'm that MB that MB sync folder sync thing might be a nice go-between in the meantime, right?

08:14.720 --> 08:16.720
Interesting to try anyway, you'll have to let us know

08:17.240 --> 08:20.900
This is Linux unplugged episode 121 for December 1st

08:21.880 --> 08:23.880
2015

08:23.880 --> 08:26.880
You

08:33.960 --> 08:39.840
Welcome to Linux unplugged your weekly the next talk show that it wants its portability and its horsepower

08:40.040 --> 08:42.500
My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello Wes

08:42.500 --> 08:46.240
That might be a little hint to something we're gonna talk about later in the show today. Oh look at you Chris

08:46.240 --> 08:50.960
I know look at me teasing in fact coming up on today's episode of 121. We got a lot

08:50.960 --> 08:56.480
We're gonna start with a little look back over some recent things that developed including from the GIMP project a topic

08:56.480 --> 08:58.480
We touched on last week Fedora 24

08:58.640 --> 09:03.560
Has got something brand new that no other distro is doing and I'm gonna put it to the virtual lug

09:03.560 --> 09:06.800
Is this maybe something we should all consider setting up on our own Linux installations?

09:06.800 --> 09:12.680
We'll talk about that and then later on in the show. It's the tiny mini itsy bitsy PC revolution

09:12.680 --> 09:19.120
Whoa, in fact there have one right here in studio. We got it right here. It's called the Omega onion

09:19.120 --> 09:22.960
Yeah, and it is a modular stackable PC, but there's a lot

09:22.960 --> 09:28.640
You know we've also got that new Raspberry Pi micro mini thing tiny little computer that's done stuff floating could probably put Cody on

09:28.640 --> 09:31.200
Um oh, and then in the end of the show I

09:31.800 --> 09:39.120
Can't believe it Wes here. We are December 1st 2015 and Adobe has announced. They're killing flash really well

09:40.200 --> 09:42.520
Not more. Yeah, it's yes

09:42.520 --> 09:48.480
Yeah, don't believe the headlines, but I thought you know what we will tell you what's happening, and I thought why don't why?

09:48.480 --> 09:52.960
Don't we just chat about what we do as Linux users to avoid using flash whenever possible

09:52.960 --> 09:57.860
And I am on a flash anti crusade this week because it basically locked up my accession this week

09:58.120 --> 10:01.040
So Chris has got an agenda to well

10:01.040 --> 10:04.520
I'm gonna grind some gears to be honest with you and then towards the end

10:04.520 --> 10:06.120
Maybe even in the post show if we have some time

10:06.120 --> 10:11.440
I'm gonna ask the virtual lug what they're thankful for kind of as an homage to what we did on Sunday's

10:11.800 --> 10:15.040
Linux action show that's on a stuff West yeah, that's great

10:15.040 --> 10:20.480
I'm pretty sure what's a big show, so why don't we get started by bringing in our virtual lug time appropriate greetings mama room?

10:25.360 --> 10:26.880
So guys guys

10:26.880 --> 10:28.560
I don't know how many of you are gamers

10:28.560 --> 10:32.280
But I talk about steam games way too much so I want to just mention something really awesome

10:32.520 --> 10:35.680
When a total kickbutt open-source game has an update and it's a big update

10:36.120 --> 10:44.280
Warsaw 2.0 released with better graphics creative commons license game assets all that goodness with a 30 to 50 percent faster performance

10:44.280 --> 10:51.520
New heads-up display all kinds of weapon parameter tweaks, and it's that game that has that cool cell shaded effect

10:51.520 --> 10:54.960
Oh, yeah, yeah, this is a cool cool open-source game

10:54.960 --> 10:59.180
And I kind of left it off my list accidentally on Sunday

10:59.180 --> 11:02.720
And so today they have a brand new update West a brand new update

11:02.720 --> 11:06.120
And I already installed it this morning and played it a little bit. It's a lot of fun

11:06.120 --> 11:10.440
It looks like a lot of fun. We should set something up people to play it and it's a real fun window to land game

11:10.440 --> 11:14.040
It's really easy to get going and because it's open-source everybody can be on the same version

11:14.040 --> 11:20.800
No awesome CD key generators required or anything like that so Warsaw 2.0 release congrats to those guys

11:20.800 --> 11:22.800
I just want to give them a shout a shout out

11:22.840 --> 11:23.960
Because yeah

11:23.960 --> 11:31.240
Because we should have probably mentioned it on Sunday now something to follow up on from last week's episode 120 of Linux unplugged

11:31.520 --> 11:38.720
We talked about GIMP hitting 20 years old quite the milestone on a years old and now can't quite drink yet

11:38.720 --> 11:45.360
And it doesn't get a discount on rentals, but they do have some brand new features that they released

11:45.360 --> 11:49.080
Just after Linux unplugged came out like they heard our show and they're like boy those dicks

11:49.720 --> 11:55.580
Let's show let's show what let's let's show those guys those Linux unplugged bastards over Jupiter broadcasting

11:56.080 --> 12:00.240
So they came out with a new update and they've got some good stuff in there now

12:00.240 --> 12:03.880
Of course as I'm done to find the chat room points out GIMP can now drink in most

12:03.880 --> 12:10.320
most countries yeah Rod and are you still around and did you catch anything in this GIMP update that

12:10.680 --> 12:13.520
Caught your interest because I know you were kind of hard on GIMP last week

12:14.320 --> 12:19.000
Yeah, they've actually made some announcements that they're they're gonna be using

12:20.280 --> 12:22.120
GEGL

12:22.120 --> 12:27.240
Do non-destructive editing in the future they don't have that right now, but thanks to the GEGL

12:27.240 --> 12:32.000
They're also doing 16-bit and 32-bit projects, right so that's

12:32.000 --> 12:33.600
some

12:33.600 --> 12:38.440
Fundamental things that that was missing so they're I'm optimistic

12:39.120 --> 12:43.800
But very cautiously optimistic we call it GEGL. I think that's more fun

12:45.440 --> 12:47.440
Yeah, but

12:48.120 --> 12:50.120
No

12:50.640 --> 12:56.240
Yeah, I mean so the 32-bit thing's a big deal also huge improvements to open up PNG TIFF and PSD files

12:56.240 --> 13:02.120
Which if you think about people that are making the migrations, that's a big deal and and one of them, huh?

13:02.120 --> 13:06.920
The PSD thing is the PSA thing is overrated because you think they're saying that you can open up things

13:07.160 --> 13:13.200
That's true, but there are things that you can't open regardless of the they're better supporting the format

13:13.320 --> 13:17.680
But the majority of PSDs are gonna have features that are not going to be available

13:17.920 --> 13:23.400
So for example, if you try to open up a CMYK PSD just breaks. Yeah. Well, yeah

13:23.400 --> 13:27.680
Yeah, that makes sense and also some new canvas rotation tools that some people are said well, okay

13:27.680 --> 13:32.440
We've kind of needed that for a long time. I mean at the same so there's a it's it's it's sort of what we talked about

13:32.440 --> 13:37.600
Last week. It's really hard not to talk about the GIMP and talk about how it's not stacking up to the commercial alternatives

13:37.600 --> 13:42.160
And I kind of tried to make the case last week that really what we should be

13:42.560 --> 13:46.300
Stacking it up against is anything else in this class that is free, right?

13:46.640 --> 13:50.360
Because in this it's not that free is an excuse for not high-quality

13:50.360 --> 13:54.280
It's that free is an enablement for a certain class of humanity that cost

13:54.880 --> 13:56.880
Sometimes there's a huge barrier for

13:57.200 --> 14:03.640
Hello. Hi there. Hi there. So I mean I'm I I I wish GIMP was more competitive at the same time

14:03.640 --> 14:09.200
I'm really glad they've steadily improved the way they have in it. Yeah, I don't follow the development that closely but

14:09.720 --> 14:14.520
Potential it seems like there's a little bit more renewed interest, you know, they've got the new website design out

14:14.520 --> 14:18.520
I still think looks nice. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. They're pushing forward on some features. We'll see

14:18.520 --> 14:20.640
I think you know, obviously I'm continuing to watch

14:21.120 --> 14:26.880
I'm optimistic about it mainly because of a lot of the things that was really frustrating me that they didn't have

14:27.240 --> 14:29.760
They're implementing now and they're bringing in

14:30.320 --> 14:34.320
CMYK support they haven't officially given like a date when it's coming

14:34.320 --> 14:38.560
But they have announced that it's coming and they're bringing them plugins for that are

14:39.040 --> 14:45.020
Trying to get like layer styles and stuff like that, but just the fact that they are actually, you know

14:45.020 --> 14:49.100
You know telling people that they're even doing this is an improvement

14:49.340 --> 14:51.940
They're you know, printing out press releases and stuff

14:51.940 --> 14:57.860
they've never done before and like they've they've changed a lot of their direction, which I appreciate as

14:58.380 --> 15:01.300
someone who wants him to be a solution, but

15:02.020 --> 15:05.860
Based on the you know, 20 years of it not being remotely

15:06.620 --> 15:09.940
Relevant to me as a professional. I'm

15:10.660 --> 15:12.700
Cautious, but I hope I'm wrong

15:12.700 --> 15:17.540
All right, I'm gonna be it. It's actually going to be great. I'm gonna be that guy. I

15:18.420 --> 15:22.460
Hate that I have to be that guy, but just consider this is Chris putting on his devil's advocate pants

15:22.460 --> 15:25.460
It says devil's advocate right on the butt there. Thank you. Thank you. I

15:26.580 --> 15:32.300
Is is it really just a matter of too little too late and I the reason I don't mean because you know

15:32.300 --> 15:33.780
Photoshop's the thing because that's obvious

15:33.780 --> 15:40.820
I mean, I've been reading a lot of reviews about people that are now drawing on tablets like

15:40.820 --> 15:47.620
Odyssey Westra who joins us frequently right draws on a tablet and very very good drawings

15:48.140 --> 15:54.020
The Apple's iPad Pro just came out with their hundred dollar pencil and their thousand dollar tablet for drawing

15:54.220 --> 15:59.540
there are a lot of apps out there now that take the touchscreen and maybe like a

16:00.140 --> 16:04.580
Peripheral and you are now like reaching an entire different audience

16:04.580 --> 16:09.860
And and the reason why I wonder if this is kind of a little too little too little too late kind of thing for gimp

16:09.860 --> 16:13.100
Is the audience those types of devices are reaching is?

16:13.820 --> 16:21.860
The casual average everyday person the exact kind of person that gimp is perfect for only not all that appealing to and so I

16:21.860 --> 16:24.820
Look at this and I go about 20 years now and now we're at a point

16:25.300 --> 16:29.440
Where guys like poppy are trying to replace the desktop PC with an Ubuntu phone?

16:30.220 --> 16:32.460
I'm like are they're gonna get to 25 years and then

16:32.740 --> 16:38.700
That that usage that that that desktop paradigm is gonna be out of date and there's gonna be even less people using it than ever

16:38.700 --> 16:40.700
before I

16:42.460 --> 16:48.380
Don't know well, it's a as a professional I'm not looking at using a tablet except for a wacom tablet

16:48.380 --> 16:54.980
So though those are just perfectly great using on a desktop and you would use that with gimp or something to say if gimp had good

16:54.980 --> 16:56.460
enough feature set

16:56.460 --> 16:58.460
Yeah, I mean right now I use

16:58.660 --> 17:00.220
illustrator and Krita

17:00.220 --> 17:05.620
Right and but see you're looking at it more from a professional angle and that seems pretty legit and I don't think you could really ever

17:05.620 --> 17:06.620
replace

17:06.620 --> 17:11.700
Like the wacom tablet and the desktop level applications for any kind of serious work

17:11.900 --> 17:15.380
But if you want to sketch something out you want to just doodle a little bit

17:15.700 --> 17:18.900
This is almost too much stuff and it's too much complication

17:18.940 --> 17:24.660
But yet the very people it's appealing to you are people that maybe are not high-end professionals. Do you want am I making sense?

17:24.660 --> 17:31.540
Yeah, I wonder if there's a distinct categories to like in in at least in in America, you know first world countries

17:31.540 --> 17:32.540
I think I think you're right

17:32.540 --> 17:36.660
I think that people you know have enough means that if they want a nice drawing environment

17:36.660 --> 17:42.620
That's easy to use and doesn't have all the crazy features. They can get a nice tablet or something like that. I wonder about maybe

17:43.380 --> 17:49.820
The developing world, you know places where they have less access or they can't kind of expense this spend that money on a whim to get

17:49.820 --> 17:51.820
Just something for drawing, you know as a hobby

17:51.860 --> 17:55.460
Maybe maybe that's what you can have more of a place if you're drawing

17:56.060 --> 18:01.380
Not just like if you're creating design, right? It's more of Karita in Inkscape

18:01.380 --> 18:06.940
Yeah, yeah, if you're if you're doing web design game, maybe it's a better tool

18:06.940 --> 18:12.740
But yeah drawing I would push Kimpa side because I doesn't have the features that create a house, right?

18:12.740 --> 18:16.400
I think really I still free and open source line and speaking of Albert Odyssey Westra

18:16.660 --> 18:22.060
create I believe is what he uses to do his drawing so that and that that makes sense I was just kind of what I

18:22.060 --> 18:26.900
Was postulating was is if the average use case is perhaps becoming more and more niche for GIMP, right?

18:26.900 --> 18:29.420
It does kind of see it does seem that way but at the same time

18:29.420 --> 18:34.540
One more thing. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah, right the the the the introductory like the beginner

18:35.060 --> 18:41.780
Introduction to drawing is actually easier for a desktop because you can get a Wacom tablet for 50 bucks. Mm-hmm

18:42.540 --> 18:44.940
So you could actually get you know, use create

18:44.940 --> 18:52.420
I use a Wacom tablet and or even use something else and you'd be able to do a lot more for a lot less

18:52.700 --> 18:54.540
To just to get it started

18:54.540 --> 18:57.780
You know what else is kind of interesting for me from a technology standpoint

18:57.780 --> 18:59.780
And I'm probably nobody else really cares about this

19:00.500 --> 19:02.380
but GIMP is

19:02.380 --> 19:09.100
Obviously a showcase of what the GTK toolkit can do right and Corita in its own way if I believe is QT

19:09.100 --> 19:14.980
Right, so you have two completely different toolkits here that the two big toolkits being used to create two very high-end

19:15.540 --> 19:17.980
Art applications. Where does Inkscape fall in this?

19:19.140 --> 19:23.340
Is Inkscape GT GTK? I don't know. Yeah

19:23.340 --> 19:28.020
It is. Yeah, okay. It's just fascinating from a couple of different angles to watch these two applications

19:28.020 --> 19:32.820
Even though as somebody that has zero art skill that doesn't totally really ever apply to me

19:35.660 --> 19:38.540
Funniest thing about GIMP and the GTK toolkit is

19:39.340 --> 19:46.300
The fact that the newest version of GIMP has a 2.9 point X has like a much improved theming system

19:47.140 --> 19:49.140
Why can't they use it?

19:49.140 --> 19:54.820
Like they built a cool toolkit. They built a cool theming system yet GIMP is still hideous

19:57.260 --> 20:01.420
It's kind of weird that they build the fundamentals, but they don't have the ability to use what they build

20:02.580 --> 20:04.820
Yeah, that's unfortunate. Yeah, I mean

20:05.660 --> 20:09.220
Yeah, I guess I do agree. That is pretty it is it is there's a lot going on

20:11.020 --> 20:14.260
You can make that customization argument with almost anything

20:14.260 --> 20:18.740
Look at Gnome lots of theming potential there

20:18.740 --> 20:23.700
But really there's only about four strong themes out there that really look good

20:24.100 --> 20:29.300
Yeah, I had to fall of Gnome looks pretty good just by it by itself. All right, it's okay

20:29.980 --> 20:35.940
Well, it's when you compare it to things like XFCE that oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely

20:35.940 --> 20:37.940
I mean, it's it's a good design

20:38.220 --> 20:41.940
Even if it's not perfect, but it's a little okay

20:41.940 --> 20:47.900
Ed way to is a weird design but yeah, the shell itself is nice. Yeah, you put arc theme on there

20:47.900 --> 20:51.860
You're good to go. Yeah, you're good. Have you installed the arc theme? I have that's from the yeah

20:51.860 --> 20:54.940
That's that's pretty slick. That is a seriously great theme

20:54.940 --> 20:58.860
yeah, and then you just mix and match the icons as you feel at it and I'm telling you I

20:59.380 --> 21:02.820
My personal opinion is I don't think there's a better looking desktop

21:02.820 --> 21:05.860
If you match the icons you go all dark and you put the arc theme on there

21:05.860 --> 21:07.860
I think it's the best looking desktop on the planet

21:07.860 --> 21:15.260
So yeah, yeah gnomes are and why whatever is your yeah Unix point, right? I should you're right. Well, it's right here

21:15.260 --> 21:16.060
It's on all my rigs

21:16.060 --> 21:20.660
They've slowly over time what I what I what I found is kind of interesting is I just sort of landed on this in each

21:20.660 --> 21:24.980
Of my gnome installations too. It's not like it's not something I don't sit down and go. Oh god. It's all the arc theme, right?

21:24.980 --> 21:26.620
No, it just kind of happens

21:26.620 --> 21:31.940
Anyways, I mumble room any other thoughts before we move on from the GIMP topic or create or anything else wimpy

21:31.940 --> 21:34.460
I know there was you'd ping me at one point was there anything you wanted to add to the chat?

21:34.460 --> 21:42.100
I know I think you've covered it just that some creatures and better tool for freehand drawing. Yeah, then gimp gimp is a photo editor

21:42.100 --> 21:46.860
Yeah, I'm glad we made that point because I didn't want to yeah, I didn't want to walk away from that. I had something. Yeah

21:47.740 --> 21:49.740
I don't think it really

21:50.420 --> 21:54.940
replaces the tablet and everything because there are different use cases totally the

21:55.420 --> 22:01.020
Tablet is a console is not a console. It's a consumption advice device not a

22:01.020 --> 22:04.900
Production, I think that's starting to change though

22:05.380 --> 22:05.980
You know

22:05.980 --> 22:12.220
You look at Microsoft with their surface and you look at convergence device that are coming and you got iPad pros now with keyboards and pencils

22:12.420 --> 22:14.260
I guess

22:14.260 --> 22:21.020
Laptops that have touchscreens and stuff. Yeah, even like I've tried hooking up a keyboard with a tablet never

22:21.020 --> 22:23.260
It's just not the same as it really is. No, I do agree

22:23.260 --> 22:29.900
It's not there yet totally different feel but I wonder if it's there enough enough if it's there and for some people who do want

22:29.900 --> 22:31.340
To create, you know, they don't need a futz with anything

22:31.340 --> 22:33.580
They just want a canvas and enough to work or you know

22:33.580 --> 22:36.140
Like so my mom is a professional graphic artist, right?

22:36.140 --> 22:40.700
And so one of the things that I know she would do is you start with a sketch and you could do that on the tablet

22:40.700 --> 22:44.700
And then you move it into Photoshop where you get the actual work done would be how she would look at it

22:44.700 --> 22:49.740
I start with the outline on this nice little touchy device here that lets me draw maybe at the coffee shop

22:49.740 --> 22:54.020
You just got your tablet. Yeah, or actually I'm at the client meeting the clients talking to me

22:54.020 --> 22:55.220
Just do it right there in the meeting

22:55.220 --> 23:00.420
But then they can they can you know send that out in different formats and bring it into like Adobe Sketch is a thing

23:00.420 --> 23:02.420
Even on the tablets and yeah

23:02.540 --> 23:06.940
So yeah, it's interesting just to see that particular use case getting eaten up eaten up by that

23:06.940 --> 23:09.740
But yeah in the long term if you want to sit down and do any serious work

23:09.740 --> 23:13.900
I mean for her I maybe that's just because she's been doing it for so long now

23:13.900 --> 23:19.820
But she will never ever ever consider replacing her desktop with a tablet ever

23:19.820 --> 23:25.220
So yeah, but maybe for somebody heavens. Do you want to take us out on the last note here? Mm-hmm

23:26.100 --> 23:30.580
Yes, the one thing that I think for you know open so much software might

23:32.420 --> 23:34.140
Be a little bit

23:34.140 --> 23:37.980
The underdog is that the producers are creators of the software

23:38.540 --> 23:43.380
Do not need to force their consumers to buy their product

23:43.380 --> 23:48.900
So they might not be or have incentive to actually make it really good or at least worth money

23:48.900 --> 23:53.220
Or another way to say that is they don't have to they don't have to chase the shiny

23:54.060 --> 23:57.460
Yeah, even though a lot of people can get paid for doing gimp work

23:57.460 --> 24:01.860
They don't really need to you know, sell it do a lot of PR

24:02.500 --> 24:04.940
Yeah, I think that's not why that makes them

24:04.940 --> 24:10.060
I think it's the the the amount of money that they don't get money from it and they're not trying to sell it is

24:10.780 --> 24:15.020
Not necessarily a bad thing, but it does make their production slower

24:15.020 --> 24:21.760
So if they had more that they did like a Indiegogo or something where they could get money and pay more developers to do more

24:21.900 --> 24:27.300
Faster GIMP would be a much more relevant program, but because they take so long to do

24:28.260 --> 24:29.700
everything

24:29.700 --> 24:33.820
That's one of the reasons why it's just you know fall behind so much

24:34.180 --> 24:40.340
Even in the open source field because I mean if you if you're wanting to do basic editing, you don't really go to camp

24:40.340 --> 24:47.160
There's stuff like pinta, which is much smaller simpler much easier to use and if you're gonna do like really

24:47.620 --> 24:50.180
Extensive drawing you don't go to get by there you go to create it

24:50.180 --> 24:53.740
So I mean GIMP is even falling back in the open source field

24:54.260 --> 24:55.340
hmm

24:55.340 --> 24:59.580
Boy, there's more to shame. There's more to this conversation than I first thought. Yeah, definitely

24:59.580 --> 25:03.580
I'm curious to hear what the audience thinks listening because I feel like I feel like this is one of those conversations

25:03.580 --> 25:08.260
Or maybe somebody's listening and screaming at their car stereos are driving down the road or something. I don't know anything

25:08.260 --> 25:13.900
Yeah, which we don't that's fine Linux action show our reddit.com episode 121 if you would I'd like to hear your thoughts

25:14.500 --> 25:17.980
Because this is fascinating because GIMP to me is just such a great case study

25:18.220 --> 25:23.900
Such a good one for so many different highlights and you know, maybe some of the low points of open source. Mm-hmm

25:23.900 --> 25:30.540
Mm-hmm, you know speaking of highlights our first sponsor this week digital ocean use our promo code get ready for this right in your face

25:30.540 --> 25:38.100
Do unplugged one word lowercase $10 credit digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated offering most intuitive and easy way for you

25:38.100 --> 25:42.180
To get your own rig up on their kick-ass servers Linux freeBSD. It don't matter

25:42.180 --> 25:45.820
They got a great infrastructure all Linux rigs powering everything

25:46.380 --> 25:52.220
SSDs for all the disk IO KVM for the virtualizer 40 gigabit e-connections for their data centers

25:52.220 --> 25:54.540
It's rockin go check them out

25:54.540 --> 25:59.540
You can get started less than 55 seconds and pricing plans are only five dollars a month for 512 megabytes of RAM

25:59.780 --> 26:02.700
20 gigabyte SSD one CPU under terabyte of

26:02.700 --> 26:08.380
Of transfer terabyte terabyte 40 40 gigabit. I mean, that's great West

26:08.380 --> 26:11.300
Did you ever did you ever work on any kind of projects or stuff?

26:11.300 --> 26:18.000
Like five six seven eight years ago that where you had to get like a co-located server and like put an actual server in the rack

26:18.000 --> 26:20.200
It's a pain. It is huge pain

26:20.200 --> 26:20.460
Yeah

26:20.460 --> 26:25.500
And the cost is is nuts and and so when I say a terabyte of transfer in these reads

26:25.500 --> 26:30.240
I can't help but look I mean I can't help but think back to when a terabyte of transfer

26:30.240 --> 26:36.120
at the average transfer price was a thousand dollars just for a terabyte of transfer a

26:36.400 --> 26:40.760
Thousand dollars just for the transfer, right just for you can get that for five dollars

26:40.760 --> 26:45.460
It really blows me away and then the fact that the whole thing is like exactly the kind of infrastructure

26:45.460 --> 26:49.120
I would build if I could like just have an unlimited budget and have at it

26:49.120 --> 26:53.720
That's what exactly I would build and then like even if I could build like what I would I would do Linux

26:53.720 --> 26:55.560
I would do KVM. I would do SSDs

26:55.560 --> 26:57.760
I would do crazy great data centers and connections

26:57.760 --> 27:02.560
But the thing that I could never do which is really awesome is that interface. Oh

27:03.160 --> 27:06.960
Oh that interface is crazy great simple intuitive extremely powerful

27:07.520 --> 27:13.840
Somehow they managed to do it and and what's not only great about that is not only did they manage to get those three impossible

27:13.840 --> 27:20.680
Things actually accomplished, but they did it on an interface that manages virtual machines. Okay, that's crazy. That is crazy to my face

27:20.680 --> 27:23.440
That's new to the world. I think it's new to the world

27:23.440 --> 27:28.600
So use the promo code deal and plug to get in on that s and get it for two months absolutely free and also they have

27:28.600 --> 27:33.560
A great API to extend that all the way up into the rest of the world that really means there's a bunch of great apps

27:33.560 --> 27:37.280
So even if you don't know how to write nothing you can go take advantage some good stuff great tutorials

27:37.280 --> 27:38.800
They got fedora 24 up there now

27:38.800 --> 27:45.240
They got of course all your favorite Ubuntu's your Debian's your CentOS's and even that core OS and last but not least

27:45.800 --> 27:50.320
Free BSD. Oh my goodness free BSD is even up on that digital ocean now

27:50.320 --> 27:54.160
I don't know why you'd want to use that. I just tease. I love you guys, but go check it out

27:54.160 --> 27:57.000
Use the promo code do unplug support this show. It's one word

27:57.000 --> 28:03.520
It's lowercase, and it gives you a $10 credit isn't that something amazing you can support your favorite Linux talk show and try out

28:03.520 --> 28:05.520
Digital ocean two months for absolutely free

28:05.760 --> 28:12.900
Digital ocean comm use the promo code do unplug in a big. Thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring Linux unplugged Linux unplugged

28:13.280 --> 28:14.840
Thanks you guys

28:14.840 --> 28:21.280
Alright, so those crazy guys who you know we got folks in here that work on their own distributions

28:21.280 --> 28:24.560
We got folks in here from canonical. We got folks in here from Sousa

28:24.560 --> 28:26.880
We got folks in here from a gross time to time

28:26.880 --> 28:30.920
We got folks in here from all these different districts. You know we don't know this yeah

28:30.920 --> 28:33.680
Thank you know you you know where we don't have reoccurring folks from

28:34.440 --> 28:35.920
fedora

28:35.920 --> 28:39.160
So I'm just gonna speak for them, and if I get something wrong. It's their fault. Yep

28:39.160 --> 28:44.160
I'm just that I'm correct us you are an open invitation here, but I think this is kind of neat

28:44.160 --> 28:45.000
I think it's a neat idea

28:45.000 --> 28:50.600
And it's something I wanted to bounce past you and the virtual lug to see if maybe it's not something we all want to consider

28:50.600 --> 28:54.240
Doing on our own Linux rigs so fedora 24. It's that crazy distro

28:54.240 --> 28:56.240
That's coming out in the future in the year

28:56.280 --> 29:02.240
2000 and it's going to support Wayland and something else that I think is a really good idea especially somebody who's on a slower

29:02.240 --> 29:04.240
high latency internet connection a

29:06.120 --> 29:08.200
default local DNS server

29:08.200 --> 29:15.400
they say plain DNS is just plain insecure and therefore vulnerable from various attacks like cash poisoning a

29:15.400 --> 29:21.040
Client can never be sure that there is a no man-in-the-middle type scenario if they don't do DNSSEC validation locally

29:21.040 --> 29:26.840
We want to have the unbound server install and running on local hosts by default on fedora systems

29:26.840 --> 29:31.320
And also we're necessary have DNSSEC trigger installed so what?

29:32.320 --> 29:35.040
The fedora project is planning to do is

29:35.040 --> 29:39.680
include the unbound DNS server set up as a default local host res resolver and

29:40.080 --> 29:44.600
Then it'll go out to the rest of the internet if it can't find the name for something you're looking up and

29:45.160 --> 29:48.320
I wanted to start with us, and then I wanted to bounce it around the Mamba room

29:48.320 --> 29:52.520
I can think of in an enterprise how this could nest maybe actually be a bad thing, but

29:53.120 --> 29:57.920
Have you ever played with setting up local DNS on your LAN and have you ever noticed anything?

29:57.920 --> 30:01.000
And what are your thoughts on fedora just including it by default well?

30:01.000 --> 30:06.600
I think it's I think it's true because doesn't network manager already it uses DNS mask locally. I believe by default

30:07.160 --> 30:10.960
You might think that I think they have those good points. Okay. I think where this is different one

30:10.960 --> 30:16.200
They're using unbound yes who if they're specifically setting up DNSSEC support and yeah, all right

30:16.200 --> 30:20.440
So let's break that down in two parts, so let's start with why the local DNS. Why do you think?

30:20.440 --> 30:21.840
I mean, I think it's helpful

30:21.840 --> 30:26.920
I know like network manager wants to use it for things like split horizon DNS. This is one thing

30:26.920 --> 30:29.160
I hope fedora gets right like for me. It's important it works

30:29.160 --> 30:35.160
that I can have a set of DNS entries that are resolved over the VPN connection and then routed over the VPN absolutely right so

30:35.160 --> 30:40.160
If that doesn't work then that could be pain in our vice environments where you need to be referencing name servers that get updated

30:40.160 --> 30:44.760
You know at a set pace or not not that uncommon. Yeah, no definitely not

30:44.760 --> 30:49.640
But I think it does give you a lot of control it also lets you cache things locally which you know that's never bad

30:49.640 --> 30:55.040
You know I was thinking about from that angle the you know back in the rover the Wi-Fi connection right high latency connection

30:55.040 --> 30:59.680
And if I can make every time I go out to the web a little tiny bit faster

30:59.680 --> 31:04.240
That sounds appealing to me now. Can you touch a little bit on the DNSSEC thing so DNSSEC?

31:04.240 --> 31:07.840
So they're going to be they're going to unbound now, and they're going to be doing DNSSEC

31:07.840 --> 31:08.760
What do you think about that?

31:08.760 --> 31:13.200
Do you think it's maybe time for all distros to consider doing DNSSEC out of the box?

31:13.200 --> 31:16.600
I don't know if I would say I think it's I think it's good that fedora is exploring this

31:17.240 --> 31:23.280
You know it does seem like there are a lot of potential vulnerabilities with DNS setups without DNSSEC

31:23.280 --> 31:26.920
Maybe it doesn't go far enough. I don't know further discussion there is needed

31:26.920 --> 31:30.200
But I think fedora serves usually as a useful point where in Linux

31:30.200 --> 31:33.560
They kind of try something at a scale fully integrated into their environment

31:33.560 --> 31:37.040
And if it works other distros will adopt it if not you know we can kind of see it

31:37.040 --> 31:41.600
I'm excited to try Fedora 24 and see if it works. Yeah, that is actually a good point like we don't have to do it everywhere

31:41.600 --> 31:44.000
Let's let Fedora try it. I mean like in a year or six months

31:44.000 --> 31:48.600
Well, I think we'll see like how well does it work, but it does I mean I've only ever heard good things about unbound

31:48.600 --> 31:54.240
So I would imagine it works pretty well now look at BNX BNX NT in the chat room says an emphatic

31:54.800 --> 31:57.280
No on DNSSEC

31:57.280 --> 32:02.680
An emphatic no now. I don't anybody in the mumble room know why that might be because I I'm not a DNSSEC

32:02.680 --> 32:07.600
Yeah, no neither mine about that, but he linked us here says DNSSEC is unnecessary

32:07.600 --> 32:11.400
All secure crypto on the Internet assumes that the DNS lookup from names to IP addresses are insecure

32:11.760 --> 32:16.200
Securing those DNS lookups therefore enables no meaningful security because all the other stuff is

32:16.200 --> 32:21.520
Already thinks it's insecure. That's an interesting point right there actually. I like this from two standpoints

32:21.520 --> 32:27.200
I like it obviously from the performance standpoint, and I've been experimenting with DNSSEC myself for about a month

32:27.200 --> 32:30.680
Oh really yeah, and I I haven't really once I did it

32:30.680 --> 32:35.000
I didn't I actually forgot until today when I was like oh yeah, we're gonna talk about this today

32:35.000 --> 32:40.120
I've been using it for a month on my XPS, and I forgot I even had it. That's a good thing

32:40.120 --> 32:46.200
Yeah, so I haven't from an end-user standpoint. I feel like it. Just gives me a little more peace of mind mm-hmm

32:46.720 --> 32:49.640
Because I know that that stuff is not in here's I

32:50.160 --> 32:56.400
Don't mean to sound like I'm repeating myself, but I do not trust any wireless carrier any of all now right

32:56.400 --> 33:01.200
I mean how many of them have those super cookies right and so in the rover I have I have

33:01.720 --> 33:07.960
Right now. I have a couple of different connections and and been depending on which one strongest is the one I'll use and so I've got

33:07.960 --> 33:14.400
A unlimited my fight advice from Ting when you know it's you pay for what you use right that I'm feeling pretty comfortable

33:14.400 --> 33:19.040
with I really have no issues, but the one that has stronger signal where the rover is parked at is an AT&T

33:19.600 --> 33:22.440
Yeah, if I hotspot and that one. I'm pretty uncomfortable with

33:23.120 --> 33:26.800
You know they view super cookies in the past where they think they are yeah

33:26.800 --> 33:30.920
And and they yes they are and they inject it into HTTP traffic right now

33:30.920 --> 33:36.960
And so those kinds of things make me super uncomfortable because all of my internet is going to be

33:36.960 --> 33:43.800
All of my internet is going through that right now, and so I start looking at it's things like DNS sec or VPN tunnels

33:43.800 --> 33:48.240
Or you know HTTPS everywhere, and I start thinking if I could add these different layers

33:48.520 --> 33:50.520
What it really does is give me peace of mind

33:51.040 --> 33:54.280
And it I almost wonder if we won't get to a place

33:55.280 --> 34:01.560
Six five seven years from now where we go wow I can't believe we did so much stuff over the net unencrypted like it'll just

34:01.560 --> 34:06.120
become a commonplace for encryption for HTTPS and DNS sec and all these kinds of things because

34:06.120 --> 34:11.040
It's not even about the encryption. It's about the validation of the endpoint

34:11.240 --> 34:17.180
It's about validating who you're talking to is really who you intend to be talking to and I think that's the aspect of it

34:17.180 --> 34:21.480
That will take off over the next few years, and this is going to become obvious that what do you mean?

34:21.480 --> 34:25.680
It's what do you mean? It's not encrypted. They're just spewing plaintext to whoever wants it. Yeah, that's crazy

34:25.680 --> 34:30.060
Yeah, somebody could just be intercepting that how do you know you're actually talking to that person right? I think that might be

34:30.060 --> 34:36.660
Really sort of a cultural thing and that's why I'm a big fan of let's encrypt as well is because it kind of plays into

34:36.660 --> 34:41.460
That same thing and you know it allows some dude like me to have an own cloud server that you know has a let's encrypt

34:41.460 --> 34:44.260
Certificate have at it that your friends with your friends use it

34:44.260 --> 34:49.140
They won't yeah walk because there's a little red X in the corner exactly or if say I set up my own matter most yeah

34:49.140 --> 34:55.300
Server it'd be another nice thing for that a mumble room anybody have any thoughts on setting up local DNS pros and cons and if

34:55.300 --> 34:58.620
Anybody has done it anybody in the mumble room set up a local DNS server and using it right now

34:58.620 --> 35:01.780
Yes, and what do you think a good bad?

35:02.620 --> 35:03.860
I don't know

35:03.860 --> 35:06.940
It's not a big deal anymore because it's part of my deployment configuration

35:06.940 --> 35:10.940
So it just gets applied to all my machines, so you and you install a local DNS server on each machine

35:10.940 --> 35:13.940
You're not just doing everything your lamb now. Why is that like roaming machines?

35:14.540 --> 35:18.660
So it's nice to have the local DNS server when you're out on the go that kind of thing yeah, that's a good point

35:18.940 --> 35:22.520
Yeah, that's not a big deal to run it even on the machines that are already behind another level of cache

35:23.300 --> 35:28.020
Right and what are you using to do the local DNS DNS mask, okay?

35:28.020 --> 35:30.020
Just because it was simple and why not unbound oh

35:30.620 --> 35:34.640
Not unbound because I'm familiar with DNS mask yeah good reason yeah

35:34.640 --> 35:39.120
I was thinking I was thinking DNS mask seems like the go-to, but then when fedora said well

35:39.120 --> 35:40.380
We're gonna go unbound I went looked it up

35:40.380 --> 35:42.800
And it looks like it's really easy to set up and get going yeah

35:42.800 --> 35:46.740
I was thinking about maybe doing it looks pretty solid and I don't need the DHCP server from DNS mask

35:46.740 --> 35:49.740
So I might consider it it seems like that depends on how flexible it is

35:50.020 --> 35:56.100
Yeah, DNS mask has a lot of flexible settings to allow me to hit different DNS servers for different domains and that kind of stuff

35:56.100 --> 35:58.100
I don't know if unbound is all the same functionality

35:59.540 --> 36:02.740
We'll have to hear some report I kind of want to try it I do yeah

36:02.820 --> 36:04.620
Because I've been deploying DNS mask as well

36:04.620 --> 36:08.060
Yeah, that's just cuz that's what I write you how to use yeah, and that was always kind of the go-to

36:08.620 --> 36:14.660
So vert which I want to say vendetta online, but it's a vert in the window a vert in the vert

36:14.660 --> 36:21.700
It's a nudah very I knew that you there we go. I like it so you use it for VPN host resolving tell me about this

36:21.700 --> 36:27.300
Yeah, basically okay, if you tie in your own name servers

36:27.300 --> 36:31.040
You can resolve your individual VPN hosts for your token subnet

36:31.300 --> 36:35.100
So what I actually do is I set up a DHCP server

36:35.460 --> 36:40.900
Which links to my DHC my DNS servers by T SIG to set up okay?

36:41.340 --> 36:48.100
Mapping for my VPN server for VPN clients and when they connect to the VPN they can either automatically resolve each other's

36:48.460 --> 36:50.460
host naming on the VPN

36:50.460 --> 36:54.020
Because they get the information from the DNS server care others been punched

36:54.460 --> 36:58.020
It's it's a very easy way of doing it and and funny and funny enough

36:58.020 --> 37:01.620
Okay, this is exactly what Tink ended up doing for me as well really

37:02.740 --> 37:04.740
Into the VPN setup yeah

37:05.420 --> 37:10.900
Basically once you resolve one host secure on that yeah, it will resolve hosts for all the other things so Tink is something that

37:11.580 --> 37:13.580
my my oh

37:13.700 --> 37:17.620
God, I just want to make sure you were saying Tink and not ting for the audience listening. Yeah

37:17.620 --> 37:22.100
Yeah, so Tink is like a mesh vpn solution. Yeah, okay, and I was about to say the same thing

37:22.100 --> 37:23.460
You know I like the local DNS

37:23.460 --> 37:27.060
Yeah for that reason is that you can set up your own you can use your host file

37:27.060 --> 37:31.060
But if you have a local DNS, it's a little cleaner. Yeah, you're figuring everything in the same spot. Yeah

37:31.060 --> 37:33.060
Yeah, you can replicate that

37:33.060 --> 37:35.060
Yeah, using local host file

37:35.100 --> 37:38.900
Well, it just feels hacky. Yeah, all right and go ahead. Sorry vert. Did you want to finish?

37:41.220 --> 37:45.780
Well, no, I was just saying okay, that's you with Tinker right it makes it a little bit easier because because you're doing over a

37:45.780 --> 37:49.060
VPN anyway, you can now sync between each machine

37:49.060 --> 37:51.820
Okay, right the host files we need to connect to each other

37:51.900 --> 37:57.180
So you basically build up your own dark day if you like because only the host you're connecting to will know about all the other

37:57.180 --> 38:01.140
hosts that you're connecting to right right and of course DNS is

38:01.660 --> 38:03.920
There's several different DNS options for PFSense

38:04.860 --> 38:11.940
JB live 87 54 is pointing out that PFSense has unbound as an option for PFSense servers. So there you go

38:11.940 --> 38:16.040
Um, you know, I know that now that we've talked about this

38:16.040 --> 38:18.820
I wonder if maybe I might not

38:19.380 --> 38:23.580
Tonight go give this a little try at the rover and see how it goes. I'll report back

38:23.580 --> 38:28.180
Maybe well, you know what? Maybe if it goes really well, I might make a segment on the Linux action. Yeah, that sounds fun

38:28.180 --> 38:29.820
I'm watching that. Yeah, that'd be interesting

38:29.820 --> 38:35.660
So all right a mumble room any closing thoughts before we move on any other DNS experts or DNS?

38:35.660 --> 38:42.060
Experienced want to know go in once go in twice. All right. Very good. Very good. Good talk

38:42.060 --> 38:44.060
Thank you guys for the information and also

38:44.860 --> 38:47.860
You know what I should do is I will include a link

38:48.380 --> 38:53.860
Same they go down here to the segment at the bottom of the segment in the show notes where we talked about fedora 24

38:53.860 --> 38:56.580
I will include a link to the issues with DNS sex

38:56.580 --> 38:59.340
So if you guys heard us mention that and you're curious what those issues are

38:59.340 --> 39:03.100
I just added that link to the show notes so you can go and go read about that s

39:03.100 --> 39:07.060
Maybe you can poke Alan and you guys can do a follow-up. I wonder if Alan has any thoughts

39:07.060 --> 39:09.540
I bet he does you and I are on the same page my friend

39:09.540 --> 39:14.940
Hey, I don't know if you notice this West but we relaunched the last jacket for a kind of I think I want one

39:14.940 --> 39:16.940
I need one. You should definitely

39:17.860 --> 39:23.820
So it is back it is it is awesome and you can find them at teespring.com slash

39:24.260 --> 39:29.060
Last us or if you're across the pond and you don't want to have to pay exorbitant shipping amounts

39:29.060 --> 39:36.620
slash last EU and here's the real shenanigans you get in on that order right now because we're only running them until December 13th

39:36.620 --> 39:38.620
It's gonna ship in time for

39:38.620 --> 39:43.780
The holidays. Oh, yeah for your loved ones. Yeah, you know just put a lot of the best network

39:43.780 --> 39:46.700
Put a last jacket in every every single stocking

39:47.140 --> 39:50.300
But really we have multiple colors and you can go grab yourself a jacket

39:50.300 --> 39:52.300
These were maybe our most

39:52.340 --> 39:56.620
Favorited item that we sold last year. We only run them for a limited time and then they're all done

39:56.620 --> 40:00.180
So go to teespring.com is item last us or last

40:01.020 --> 40:06.060
You it is a collector's item and it keeps your tummy warm and depending on how you zip it up

40:06.060 --> 40:09.220
No, man boobs, which is really if you got man boobs. No, man, but cover your shame

40:10.820 --> 40:12.460
Exactly no judgments. No judgments

40:12.460 --> 40:20.140
We also we also have a link on the sidebar at Jupiter broadcasting.com teespring.com slash last us and last EU and the EU has better

40:20.140 --> 40:25.200
Color options so you could actually be in the US in order from the EU if you want to get like some crazy colors

40:25.200 --> 40:30.640
Yeah, they've got all the best stuff. Teespring got a good deal set up over there. Apparently they apparently over there

40:30.640 --> 40:34.120
They know how to print and make sure it's real good. I see. Yeah, that's the thing

40:34.120 --> 40:39.360
I want to tell you about something else. It's a thing. It's one of my favorite sponsors Linux Academy

40:39.360 --> 40:43.480
I think this is a great fit for you guys because it's a great resource for you to go learn more about the systems

40:43.480 --> 40:47.920
We all love what's great about Linux Academy is sort of what I think is great about Jupiter broadcasting

40:47.920 --> 40:49.920
That might be one of the reasons why I think they're a great sponsor

40:50.520 --> 40:52.920
They actually care about Linux and open source

40:52.920 --> 40:58.920
Turns out when you actually care about Linux and open source and then you make content about Linux and open source you do it better

40:58.920 --> 41:01.720
Than other people because you actually live and breathe this stuff

41:01.720 --> 41:06.240
You actually care about this and you follow it from day to day go to Linux Academy comm slash

41:06.480 --> 41:14.600
Unplugged Linux Academy comm slash unplugged to get our special discount and support this show. It's a really good deal Linux Academy freaking rocks

41:14.600 --> 41:17.840
They got seven plus distributions you get to choose from they got like almost

41:17.840 --> 41:23.100
2,000 self-paced courses with videos and high-quality contents you can downloads on the offline

41:23.480 --> 41:30.560
Everything's backed by a nice CDN with HTML 5 players. They have instructor help available for you whenever you need it

41:30.560 --> 41:36.580
Which is a really nice feature. They got labs. They spin up on-demand. They got the AWS courses for the Amazon stuff

41:37.080 --> 41:39.080
And the reason why I mentioned that is

41:39.280 --> 41:45.440
I kind of found myself one time having a client that all of a sudden was my responsibility and had

41:45.440 --> 41:48.640
AWS infrastructure primarily around s3 at the time, right?

41:48.640 --> 41:54.120
I did not really in that's not like Linux as we know it or anything like that

41:54.120 --> 41:58.320
It has its own unique works definitely does it definitely does now

41:58.320 --> 42:02.240
I've told this story before but I can't remember the exact number now because it was several years ago

42:02.240 --> 42:06.920
But when I was just sort of playing around on this three trying to figure out how to do things before I wouldn't charge them

42:06.920 --> 42:09.080
How to do it or even just said yeah, I know how to do that

42:09.080 --> 42:12.600
You know, I actually want to see if I could do it. I think I racked up like a $300 bill

42:12.600 --> 42:16.000
I need it was something around there. Yeah, it was ridiculous

42:16.000 --> 42:21.220
So what's really cool is regardless of what you know, you're learning Ruby. You're learning nginx or learning IP tables

42:21.220 --> 42:27.280
You're learning how to do basic development or maybe you're learning AWS. They'll spin up the lab servers for you on-demand

42:27.280 --> 42:31.940
They have a really great interface. You can SSH right in and rock that s they have scenario based labs

42:32.040 --> 42:36.200
Which is really nice because that gives you really good hands-on experience

42:36.200 --> 42:40.740
You'll work in their advanced live environments while completing these scenarios from beginning to end on live servers

42:40.740 --> 42:45.700
Isn't that nice break somebody else's stuff? They have real-time feedback, too

42:45.840 --> 42:51.680
They have great courses for the red hat certified courseware and they have instructor help available at any time

42:52.340 --> 42:54.940
Nice content always getting updated refreshed

42:55.540 --> 43:00.740
And keep track of your progress as you go along. They break things down into our lease. It is really cool

43:00.740 --> 43:02.140
They have an availability planner

43:02.140 --> 43:07.840
You can go into Linux Academy and say how much time you have availability and how much time you have available and they'll automatically

43:07.840 --> 43:12.020
Generate the courseware to match your time availability. I think that's really really cool

43:12.020 --> 43:13.780
Yeah, I mean that seems pretty unique

43:13.780 --> 43:16.740
Dude, like so flexible even in the holidays when things get busy

43:16.740 --> 43:22.520
You can find a way to like sort of schedule in like few hours a couple hours on Tuesday, you know

43:22.980 --> 43:25.580
Dude, you know do while you're listening to JB content

43:25.580 --> 43:29.980
I'm gonna listen to JB content for this hour while I have unplugged going on in the background. I'm gonna go do this

43:29.980 --> 43:35.040
Yeah, you know what? Why not? Yeah, you can do all the time or in the shower, you know, it's a thing

43:35.040 --> 43:41.880
It's a shower touch tablet in there open up your SSH session. You're good to go. Hey, oh, that's why you need a pencil

43:41.980 --> 43:45.280
So the other thing I think is really great is they upgraded the server exercise

43:45.280 --> 43:49.380
You can get your work evaluated while connected to a real server

43:49.740 --> 43:54.340
Their courses include exercises where you log into a lab server and perform specific tasks in Linux Academy

43:54.340 --> 44:00.100
Automatically grades your actions so you can see how well you did graded exercises are included in all Linux Academy memberships

44:00.100 --> 44:02.180
They have a great step technology stack

44:02.180 --> 44:09.540
Everything you'd want built around Linux including some of the simple things like our sink or IP tables or just basic Linux commands

44:09.540 --> 44:16.540
Like tar like seriously fundamentals all the way up the entire stack all the way up to the Red Hat stuff Android development Python Ruby

44:17.340 --> 44:19.980
PHP nginx Apache now I always go off on the list here

44:19.980 --> 44:25.980
But you guys know all of the big technologies out there that are popular Linux Academy probably knows even more than you do

44:25.980 --> 44:29.500
That's why they follow this stuff. They are following the heartbeat of open-source, you know

44:29.500 --> 44:33.380
Like they just see what people want. They're seeing what's popular and because they use it themselves

44:33.640 --> 44:38.700
You know what? They should take that and run with it. They are following the heartbeat of open-source Linux Academy

44:38.700 --> 44:42.100
West is just an idea guy. You got to run with it. Yep, but he's gonna give that to you

44:43.100 --> 44:46.180
We love you. So go to Linux Academy comm slash unplugged

44:46.180 --> 44:50.020
We ask you to go there because that supports the show lets him know you heard about it here and you can check out their

44:50.020 --> 44:51.140
services

44:51.140 --> 44:55.180
But really it gets you a phenomenal discount Linux Academy calm

44:55.180 --> 44:58.180
Slash unplug

44:58.700 --> 45:02.780
Okay, Wes, so you had an idea which I once once we started kicking it around

45:02.780 --> 45:03.440
I was like

45:03.440 --> 45:10.340
This is a great idea because there is a lot of stuff happening in this space and you know when

45:11.180 --> 45:13.180
When you first started kicking around this idea

45:13.700 --> 45:18.340
If I had a little more time, I was gonna go over to the Computer Chronicles website

45:19.060 --> 45:21.240
I was gonna get a clip because you know

45:21.240 --> 45:26.940
We used to call the computer back in the 80s what we now call PCs and laptops and desktop

45:26.940 --> 45:32.540
They called mini and micro PCs right because they weren't mainframes. Yes, you could fit them in, you know more than

45:34.180 --> 45:35.700
Yes, so

45:35.700 --> 45:42.900
Now here we are on the Linux unplugged show and we're once again about to talk about micro PCs or mini PCs only now

45:42.900 --> 45:46.740
We mean something that isn't like an Intel based high-end powerful desktop

45:46.740 --> 45:50.460
No way the history is repeating itself on the Linux unplugged show today

45:50.460 --> 45:56.260
and to start off the conversation we want to talk about something that's kind of been big news over the last few weeks and that's

45:56.260 --> 45:58.260
the Pi Zero and

45:59.100 --> 46:01.100
This video will introduce us to it

46:03.460 --> 46:09.120
These are two computers from our childhood so the BBC microcomputer I bought one of these in 1989 for 220 pounds

46:09.180 --> 46:11.320
This is a Commodore Amiga. I bought this in

46:12.340 --> 46:15.900
Christmas of 1992 for 199 pounds of leases and leads

46:15.900 --> 46:19.860
When I bought each of these machines, I had to basically just drain all the money

46:19.860 --> 46:22.460
I had I had to drain my bank account my piggy bank and you know

46:22.460 --> 46:25.480
All of my savings went into each of these machines at the time that I bought them

46:26.180 --> 46:31.940
When I was a kid the high cost of computers like these was a real barrier to me learning about

46:32.300 --> 46:35.620
computers and really what we've been trying to do with Raspberry Pi is to

46:35.900 --> 46:40.260
Make sure that cost is never going to be a barrier to anyone who's interested in getting involved in coding

46:40.260 --> 46:47.560
When we launched Raspberry Pi we took about a factor of five out of the out of the cost of a typical low-cost computer

46:47.820 --> 46:53.020
But we still meet people for whom you say tell us that cost is a barrier to entry for them

46:53.420 --> 46:58.180
So lately this year since the Raspberry Pi 2 effort wound down in February

46:58.260 --> 47:02.220
We've been we've been asking ourselves what we could do to maybe take a little bit more cost out

47:02.500 --> 47:05.940
And today we're launching a new product. This is Raspberry Pi Zero

47:05.940 --> 47:12.420
This is a full-fledged Raspberry Pi. We've got a 2835 here and half it says it's the same chip

47:12.420 --> 47:17.300
We used in Raspberry Pi 1 except up clocked a little bit. So it's about 40% faster. Got half a gig of RAM

47:18.260 --> 47:23.900
HDMI connector SD card USB to connect mouse and mouse and keyboard nice and the same pin out

47:23.900 --> 47:29.260
Although it's not populated the same GPIO pin out that we have on on modern Raspberry Pi's on the B

47:29.260 --> 47:31.260
Plus the A plus and the Pi 2

47:31.260 --> 47:36.540
I'm just going on sale today. We've made a few tens of thousands of these this is going on sale today from our distributors of

47:36.540 --> 47:38.020
five bucks, so

47:38.020 --> 47:40.020
Five you just can't believe that

47:40.300 --> 47:41.740
five

47:41.740 --> 47:43.740
US greenbacks

47:45.300 --> 47:46.740
Unbelievable

47:46.740 --> 47:53.700
Unbelievable West and I I just I look at this and I think holy crap. This is the future. We're living in now and

47:54.660 --> 47:58.700
I can't I just can't even wrap my head. They've already sold out. I believe I think they yeah

47:58.700 --> 48:04.700
Yeah from a lot of retailers. Yeah, which is just whoo. Wow, but they'll be back. So the show show. Yeah

48:04.700 --> 48:08.380
What's the magazine about what's the chair? I'm talking about the magazine. What's everybody talking about the man?

48:08.380 --> 48:14.660
Oh, this was awesome that basically but when they first announced they were gonna do five dollar things. They also said well the

48:15.180 --> 48:22.780
Pi mag magazine that was it's a community magazine and it's six dollars to purchase if you purchased one

48:22.780 --> 48:30.180
On the day or a couple days after it was the reply zero was attached directly to the magazine cover

48:30.460 --> 48:36.740
It's over like six bucks. I got a magazine and oh my gosh you you buy the make you so in the UK when it came

48:36.740 --> 48:37.540
out

48:37.540 --> 48:43.500
Like every news agent sold out of the the magazine straightaway because you know

48:43.500 --> 48:45.940
It's a free computer on the cover who wouldn't who wouldn't want that?

48:46.700 --> 48:51.100
But if you're a subscriber to the magazine you can you can still get it

48:51.100 --> 48:55.340
And also in the US where they're coming a little bit later in the month

48:55.380 --> 49:00.060
You can all wait you can get the mag pie magazine over there with the same rosebud pie on the cover

49:00.100 --> 49:06.240
What the ghost name some people have some people have joked that you you buy a pie zero and you get a free magazine

49:06.860 --> 49:08.860
Exactly. Yeah

49:09.220 --> 49:14.220
Remind everyone I care of my generation that back in the day of early day computing

49:14.220 --> 49:19.520
Okay, you used to get cassettes on the front of magazines free with them now you're getting computers

49:19.520 --> 49:21.300
Yeah, and I remember when I was a big deal

49:21.300 --> 49:21.620
Yeah

49:21.620 --> 49:26.380
When you got a like Linux format came with a CD with a Linux distro on there or something

49:26.660 --> 49:31.500
So yeah, the this $5 computer has a 1 gigahertz arm 11 processor

49:31.500 --> 49:39.300
Which was 40% faster than the first Raspberry Pi 512 megabytes of RAM a micro SD card slot a mini HDMI socket for 1080p output

49:39.300 --> 49:41.300
with 60 frames per second and

49:41.300 --> 49:43.460
Of course, it has the 40 pin GPIO header

49:43.460 --> 49:51.280
We love that and it has a unpopulated composite video header and it is 65 nanometers 65 meters

49:51.500 --> 49:58.620
Millimeters, sorry by 30 millimeters by 5 millimeters and it's not even if the course there's the chip it now the chip is sort

49:58.620 --> 50:02.260
Of been of course the chip wasn't exactly as cheap as they originally said it was going to be right

50:02.300 --> 50:06.940
But you also have things like we have right here in the studio. We have this Omega onion

50:07.540 --> 50:11.560
In the box Alan has one of these he's been talking about this too, you know

50:11.560 --> 50:15.700
I hadn't heard too much about it, but that's a shame because these seem really cool. Yeah, it was a Kickstarter

50:15.700 --> 50:21.340
I backed and how could I not back it after they had this crazy crazy crazy great Kickstarter video

50:21.460 --> 50:26.460
So I want to talk about the Raspberry Pi zero and also this Omega onion check out their Kickstarter video

50:34.460 --> 50:36.460
There are two worlds

50:36.460 --> 50:42.020
The real world and the digital and then there's the cat world

50:44.060 --> 50:46.420
Oh the lovely cat world

50:47.620 --> 50:54.340
The problem with the two worlds is that in order to connect objects in the real world with the digital world?

50:54.620 --> 51:00.340
You need to be a rocket scientist or some sort of physicist from the Manhattan Project

51:01.260 --> 51:03.460
Or one of those brains in a jar

51:04.060 --> 51:05.900
But not anymore

51:05.900 --> 51:07.900
meet onion

51:12.620 --> 51:17.420
For the past year we've been hard at work building something that's small

51:17.900 --> 51:22.340
Affordable and really easy to use so that we can merge the two worlds together

51:23.100 --> 51:28.460
We wanted to be like Tony Stark and be able to build whatever comes to our mind without

51:29.180 --> 51:33.820
Learning how to build these things and that is exactly why we created this

51:33.820 --> 51:35.260
the

51:35.260 --> 51:37.180
onion Omega

51:37.180 --> 51:39.180
Thanks Oliver

51:39.380 --> 51:44.220
It's a tiny computer with built-in Wi-Fi and it runs the Linux operating system

51:44.220 --> 51:44.380
Hey

51:44.380 --> 51:51.300
Oh, you know that little bad boy lets you create connected devices in environments that you're already familiar with using tools such as

51:51.700 --> 51:57.140
SSH get an NPM and it also allows you to write software in Python

51:57.140 --> 52:04.940
No dot J at PHP or whatever language you feel comfortable with node.js now have the power to build anything you can imagine

52:05.620 --> 52:07.620
such as smart home devices

52:09.980 --> 52:14.380
Security drones drone security spiders spider

52:17.060 --> 52:20.740
That's amazing I want it or even a cat feeder

52:20.740 --> 52:26.740
A cat feeder that realizes your cat is too fat and then makes it exercise

52:27.300 --> 52:30.500
Nice laser or if you don't want to build from scratch

52:30.820 --> 52:34.020
You can browse the onion app store for ready-made apps

52:34.340 --> 52:38.100
In fact, if you want to see what you can build on the Omega right now

52:38.620 --> 52:42.540
Click on the live demo below and start to experience the Omega in real time

52:42.540 --> 52:49.540
The Omega allows me to build things in languages that I'm that I already know and using things that I'm familiar with like callback functions

52:49.540 --> 52:53.420
And I actually built this light bulb in just 10 minutes and it's remote-controlled

52:53.420 --> 52:57.180
I really like working with the onion Omega. It was really easy to use

52:57.180 --> 53:02.780
I'm not a programmer or an engineer of any kind, but I went to the onion app store and I was able to build a lightbulb

53:02.780 --> 53:07.340
It was really easy to use. I'm not a programmer or an engineer of any kind

53:07.340 --> 53:13.740
But I went to the onion app store and I downloaded and customized an app that allows me to draw images from my Facebook newsfeed

53:13.740 --> 53:16.220
And put them into a digital photo. She's a high school teacher

53:21.100 --> 53:23.500
The Omega is almost ready for production

53:23.820 --> 53:28.940
We're so close to realizing our vision of making the Internet of Things accessible to everyone

53:29.420 --> 53:33.660
And we want you to be a part of our revolution and start inventing your own

53:33.660 --> 53:40.620
And we want you to be a part of our revolution and start inventing connected devices that will make our world a smarter place

53:41.580 --> 53:43.580
Right, Oliver?

53:45.020 --> 53:48.140
What happens when we connect the real world with the digital

53:49.960 --> 53:51.820
Awesomeness

53:51.820 --> 53:55.180
There you go, Wes. Are you ready to take part in the revolution? Do you want to unbox the onion?

53:55.260 --> 54:00.300
Yes, I do. Have at it there. Okay, so it comes in a very small box. It's very smooth

54:00.300 --> 54:04.860
It's a nice premium cardboard. The in the hand experience for the box is quite nice. I do agree

54:04.940 --> 54:08.940
Yeah, and uh, it's got like a puzzle piece. It does it kind of comes apart

54:08.940 --> 54:13.340
Yeah, because yeah, it has a actually very much a puzzle piece top. It's literally a puzzle piece, isn't it?

54:13.740 --> 54:19.500
It's kind of hard to get open and then three individual boxes. So there's the expansion dock right here. Yeah, very nice

54:19.580 --> 54:24.700
Oh, look at that. Yeah, so it comes and then here's the actual uh, here's the omega box. So that's the omega

54:24.780 --> 54:25.740
Yep, yep

54:25.740 --> 54:30.060
And so I got the mini dock and the expansion dock and that's where you can plug in different stuff

54:30.060 --> 54:35.020
so I guess we can here I will uh, I will turn on the uh, the webcam a

54:35.580 --> 54:40.540
A limited uh limited exclusive treat on the unplugged show here. I'm going to pull the omega out of the box right now

54:41.180 --> 54:44.960
Look at how cheese. It's even smaller than it looks in their kickstarter video. It's unbelievable

54:45.900 --> 54:47.900
It's smaller than the palm of my hand

54:48.460 --> 54:50.860
Wow, look at that. Look at tiny that is

54:51.500 --> 54:53.100
That is ridiculous

54:53.100 --> 54:56.380
That is ridiculous. And there's the expansion. Oh my gosh

54:56.380 --> 55:02.220
Gosh, this is a tiny tiny linux computer. Wow, wes. Oh, these docs are cool too. Look at this thing here

55:02.220 --> 55:05.740
I'll take that doc. Here you go. So this is the bigger. So there's two docs

55:05.740 --> 55:10.860
There's a mini dock and then there's the big boy expansion dock and that's this one here. This is the big boy mini expansion

55:11.500 --> 55:14.380
And uh, yeah, so you plug in

55:15.500 --> 55:16.860
the omega

55:16.860 --> 55:19.100
To the top of the expansion dock right here

55:19.180 --> 55:24.380
So it plugs into the top of the dock right here and now it has all of the functionality that the dock has

55:24.380 --> 55:26.380
Dang, yeah

55:26.460 --> 55:30.140
Which which in this case is a usb port and then another set of expansions which seem perfect

55:30.220 --> 55:34.060
If you're prototyping and you want to you want to use those things, but you're not ready to solder on headers, you know

55:34.460 --> 55:38.940
Isn't that something so you just snap it together? Wow alan was talking about this on the tech snap pre-show

55:39.580 --> 55:41.580
Uh, wow, there's micro hdmi

55:41.900 --> 55:42.780
Huh?

55:42.780 --> 55:43.580
Yeah

55:43.580 --> 55:47.980
So that's pretty much so there's your usb port for your input and there's your hdmi out right there

55:48.700 --> 55:50.300
And it has wi-fi on it

55:50.300 --> 55:55.820
Man, you could just duct tape that behind your tv and really go put mbi on this and my problems are solved

55:57.580 --> 55:59.580
So that really seems to flirt with the uh

56:00.540 --> 56:05.100
You know flirt with the border before we kind of had the arduino on one end of the spectrum and the raspberry pi on the other

56:05.100 --> 56:08.780
And you have the full linux experience or you have you're writing it in c++ yourself

56:09.180 --> 56:13.680
And this is like well, you can if you're familiar with linux, but you maybe you're not an expert in microcontrollers

56:14.140 --> 56:17.820
You can just deploy it right here and you're here one way you go. No kidding

56:17.820 --> 56:20.940
And ver you've had it you you've had a chance to play with it. What do you think?

56:25.260 --> 56:27.340
Yeah, it's a really sweet

56:27.980 --> 56:33.500
Tiny little pc it is and it is so easy to set up because basically when you power it on

56:33.660 --> 56:38.540
Although be careful because the power switch is very fragile on the docks. Anyway, yeah when you power it on

56:38.540 --> 56:41.100
Okay, it becomes its own self access point

56:41.900 --> 56:46.700
It does so basically you just scan the wi-fi network find the you know

56:46.700 --> 56:50.780
So omega whatever is uh access point as ssd

56:51.500 --> 56:52.620
Join it

56:52.620 --> 56:53.820
Go to the web

56:53.820 --> 56:58.220
Configure it set your passwords your ssh set your network set your other wi-fi networks

56:58.700 --> 57:05.980
And it will basically uh, just reboot if you're right into a proper pc on your network. It's fantastic. That is really awesome. It's running open

57:07.000 --> 57:08.220
Wrt

57:08.220 --> 57:10.780
Okay. Okay. Isn't that something isn't that something?

57:10.940 --> 57:15.340
Uh, I I think it's sort of astonishing because it's I have the specs in the in the show notes

57:15.340 --> 57:20.140
I just find it astonishing that it's it's getting to the point now where you know, I just backed some project on freaking kickstarter

57:20.300 --> 57:24.700
I believe alan said he was making uh, he was setting up instructions for freebsd as well on this game, right?

57:24.700 --> 57:27.180
Which is awesome. Yep. So yeah, it ships with open wrt

57:27.260 --> 57:31.260
It has a 400 megahertz processor 64 megabytes of ddr2 ram

57:31.740 --> 57:34.860
16 megabyte of flash got 802 11 pgn on it

57:35.420 --> 57:37.420
Has 184 gpio. Yeah, it's

57:37.900 --> 57:42.780
I love isn't interesting how they list node.js as a supported. Well, that's important. Yeah. Yeah

57:42.780 --> 57:47.980
Uh wimpy, I kind of wanted to pick your brain because I know you've hinted before on some pre and post shows that

57:48.380 --> 57:51.580
And I haven't gotten got I have quite not yet gotten the complete picture

57:51.580 --> 57:56.940
But the raspberry pi is starting to play a more and more important role for the ubuntu mate distro, isn't it?

57:58.620 --> 58:01.360
It's our most popular platform

58:03.180 --> 58:08.700
Wow, you mean you mean other than x86 or including x86 it's more popular than

58:08.700 --> 58:13.040
An x64 bit 32 bit x86 holy shit

58:13.680 --> 58:17.920
That's crazy. Wow. Oh my world has just been rocked. Are you kidding me?

58:18.640 --> 58:20.640
No, it's downloaded about

58:20.800 --> 58:24.480
1200 times a day the image for the party. That's awesome

58:25.360 --> 58:26.560
Wow

58:26.560 --> 58:29.920
That's serious. That is that is so what are your thoughts on that?

58:29.920 --> 58:37.520
Well, it means that in the last two releases of ubuntu mate. I've done the work for the pi version

58:38.000 --> 58:43.520
In the last month of the release right but for this release it's got even

58:45.600 --> 58:49.760
You know, it's being treated equally all the way through the development stage now

58:50.720 --> 58:53.760
I I feel like I need to take a minute

58:53.760 --> 58:56.480
Like I wasn't ready for that level of a bomb to be dropped

58:56.480 --> 59:01.600
I don't know why I didn't know that because I kind of feel like I should have known that but I did to me is

59:01.600 --> 59:07.840
Shocking to me actually, I've actually I've actually been paying attention to a lot of communities around raspberry pi and you know

59:07.840 --> 59:10.160
reddit or google plus in various different places and

59:10.760 --> 59:13.780
The majority of times people asked what to put on the pie

59:14.640 --> 59:19.120
No, raspbian is no longer even mentioned and went to the bunta mate is always the first choice

59:19.120 --> 59:21.480
I mean it makes it makes it does makes I mean it's way more

59:21.640 --> 59:25.760
Pleasant to use and the defaults and it looks pretty with me. That's a that's a big deal though

59:25.760 --> 59:30.520
I mean congratulations because that's a big deal and so when you look at these types of devices

59:30.880 --> 59:35.960
Are you starting to say? All right, this these aren't just sort of toys. These are going to become

59:37.760 --> 59:40.880
Possibly the next open PC now

59:40.880 --> 59:43.760
Hold on before I I don't want to make sure I'm framing this right

59:43.760 --> 59:50.700
but when I look at tablets and phones I get a little sad because they look locked down and glued together and I

59:50.700 --> 59:55.900
I remember a time when I was in high school and I scraped together parts for

59:55.980 --> 01:00:01.140
Months and months and months and built my first PC. I wouldn't picked out my own case and it was

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:05.560
It was it was a life moment for me and you learned a lot

01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:11.340
Ton of stuff and I read I read I mean it was really my first geek project that I really researched and all that kind

01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.100
Of stuff and now I look at this

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:18.820
Onion Omega here and I'm sitting here like Legos building a PC and I think geez I could give this to my kid and he

01:00:18.820 --> 01:00:23.260
Could play Minecraft on this and maybe not this one, but the Raspberry Pi zero

01:00:23.260 --> 01:00:26.420
I mean I I this is maybe getting to the point now where

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:35.740
It is actually going to be something that has some serious long-term legs as a serious desktop contender and one more thing wimpy before

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.740
I toss it back to you is I

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:40.040
in the late 90s

01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:47.220
had a conversation with a guy named Scott really great guy and his job his day job was to run an IBM mainframe and

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.860
he

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:50.700
looked down at

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:52.700
desktop PCs as toys

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:58.300
That couldn't do real work that didn't weren't powerful enough and he called he called the desktops

01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:05.260
Oh, you mean those Mattel inside PCs those Mattel inside because they were toys right and you know and I look at the Omega

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:07.180
And I go this is a cute Lego toy

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:12.980
But actually maybe I'm looking at it from Scott's perspective and when you when wimpy says he's getting over a thousand downloads a day

01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:17.620
I'm wondering are you looking at this and are these mini PCs these Raspberry Pis and these

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:23.260
Omegas and and bagel bone and all whatever are you looking at this and going this might actually be something that

01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:26.620
Gets wider adoption use than the traditional PC one day. I

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:34.580
Think so certainly if you look outside of the developed nations. I think this is going to be the print the arm based

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:42.500
Devices are going to be the principal computing platform. And if you're not doing stuff on arm, you'll be irrelevant

01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:45.700
Wow bad time to own Intel stock

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:51.620
Yep. No, I think that will that will be relevant. It'll be a different market and different use case

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:58.180
but I think that we're we've not seen the extent to which arm is going to be relevant for

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:02.520
For Linux adoption and in particular Linux as a learning platform

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:08.320
Kids and kitty you kind of point out. I mean this these kind of machines get the basic work done

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:14.840
And well that kind of solves a lot of people's problems. Don't isn't it doesn't it? Yeah, I was just thinking, you know

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:21.520
What do 90% of what you do on a computer consist of web browsing email?

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.360
Editing a text file that kind of thing maybe watching a YouTube video

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
The pie can handle all that

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.640
Yeah, and so and it's not even see I think what I used to brussel at is I used to feel like we were talking down

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.640
and I kind of

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:38.560
hmm, I

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.560
wonder if I still do feel that way so

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:48.680
Something that that Carl said a few times during our visit at system 76 is one of the things that they're basic

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.720
Market research keeps and market research being you know being in a business for ten years selling PCs

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:59.480
One of the things that they have really learned maybe even the hard way is you can always err on the side of giving people

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:04.960
More powerful computers like there's there's never going to be a day where people don't need more powerful systems

01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:10.000
And so I guess I kind of had that Scott like view where I looked at this and go well these these these

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.160
Little toy computers will never be powerful enough

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:17.440
But that is sort of looking at it in a in a perspective where there isn't

01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.440
Lots of different things that you can do

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:26.720
It's a perspective where there isn't lots of different cloud options when you need to spin up like a droplet to do something really powerful

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.800
Or throw it on Google engine or whatever the hell as you're I don't care

01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:33.960
There's a lot of different options there when you need really really really high-end compute

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:39.720
And there's a lot of options when you when you need really really a local something local really high-end

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.080
You can still have a desktop

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:47.120
But there are so many so many use cases where I've worked with people where their primary job is checking email

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.720
You know we're doing doing things on their corporate applications

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.600
Which are sometimes web applications sometimes not and they do all of these things that are really sort of

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:01.000
Low-end tasks, and it's not to be I'm not trying to be rude

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:08.280
I just like that's just all they use these particular quote-unquote tools for and so why what what what does it take then?

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:16.120
What does it take to make it from the hobbyist project to actually something that consumers could actually start start buying like why don't we have?

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:22.720
Why don't we have a Best Buy that has more ARM laptops and desktops on the shelves then they do x86 machines?

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:27.280
Why isn't Lenovo selling a an ARM an ARM laptop?

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:32.760
Why is an HP and Dell selling an ARM laptop that we're all buying and and and before we go there?

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:37.620
I also I want I'll have you answer that first quest, but before we go there you found this again

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:43.540
This is a perfect example of where the Raspberry Pi is really cool, but this is a straight-up hobbyist project

01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:47.040
I like it, and so I'm gonna point out to the audience so they can read more about it

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:50.760
But it's it's a great you it's great example of where the Raspberry Pi is being used today

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:54.120
And it's it's this is not even an uncanny valley issue

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:57.560
This is way far removed from what consumers want anyways

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:03.600
This is you can make it you can take a Raspberry Pi and a Wi-Fi dongle and basically turn it into like a remote

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:10.800
Airplay receiver or audio receiver, so you can use a couple of projects that reversed Apple's airplay

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.080
right

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:17.400
Protocol and actually stream to this instead of having to go get like a really expensive device if you have iOS devices in the house

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.880
And you want to stream audio you can do with this Raspberry Pi. Yep. It's pretty cool

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:25.440
I I think that it's because a lot of people don't know that it's an option

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:27.300
But if you show them that hey

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:34.120
There's this 35 another $50 option that you can utilize instead of spending a thousand dollars on a workstation

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:40.920
I think people would go for it if they knew what it was actually capable of I

01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:44.680
Don't agree. Do you agree? I don't it's a smart. It's a smart business

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.620
Here's why because this is what I'm this is what I'm saying is this what I'm asking you is

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.440
And Wes I'll let you have the first answer, and then we'll throw it to the moment room

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:59.080
Why why is nobody picking up on this? Why is Leno? So Lenovo today can take a

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:06.600
Intel spec motherboard an Intel CPU they can build a PC from parts that they assemble themselves in the housing

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:12.960
And then they ship why can't they take something like that Raspberry Pi or something just like it and build their own version?

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:18.520
Put it in a case with a great keyboard and ship it. Why is that not happening?

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.140
I'm not sure that they I mean I think you could do it

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:25.280
But I don't know if they see the opportunity in terms of operating systems

01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:29.400
I mean, I think that Android isn't there as a desktop operating system

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.120
Maybe if they had partnerships with like I mean

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:36.300
I think what we see is Chrome OS Android isn't there or is it that Google creeps people out well

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:41.060
Maybe both and I think like you know for the main people who are using desktop. They're comfortable with Windows

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.780
You know a little newer one

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:49.120
Maybe they can now that like Raspberry Pi 2 will run Windows Windows 10 right so there may be an avenue there

01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:54.000
But but I wonder if they don't see like something they can rebuild well hmm. What was that run?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.280
It's an incredibly stripped-down Windows 10. It's not really Windows 10. That's a good point

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:03.080
Wimpy you think there's like that one piece really that's holding it up

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.600
well, not that's holding up, but I think that

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:11.200
For example that the things that I run into most with the question and answers

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.900
For up into Marte on the Pi 2 is can I run flash on it?

01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:19.680
Which you can't right because there are no flash binaries for ARM Linux

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:22.560
Can I run wine on it?

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:27.820
No, or yeah, yes, you could kind of compile it in a certain way, and it runs really badly

01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:34.480
And you get those sorts of questions and people aren't aware that it is just because it runs Linux doesn't mean it runs

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.580
Everything that you're used to running on you know

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:44.400
Intel so don't call it a Linux. I mean right we're so used to Wintel Google got away with that by calling them Chromebooks

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:49.440
Yeah, exactly well and and and to some extent also

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:53.480
You know rolling their own version of flash to bridge bridge one of those yeah that too

01:07:53.480 --> 01:08:01.800
Yeah, but you know if you're Lenovo or Dell you've been selling to a traditional audience of x86 users

01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:07.700
Who will be expecting to use the same or similar software and when some of it's not available there?

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:12.480
Maybe that's some that's a tough call, but you know so they're they're selling

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:17.860
Chromebooks and some of those in the Far East are ARM based now

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:24.780
Yes, that's pointing out that the things that are not available are the evil proprietary things. Yeah, I know so

01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:30.420
Pretty so that's all as well. Yeah, well, and we were just discussing. You know this average

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:35.660
Just basic work type task type work where the computer is a tool

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:41.220
They might not care as much as much about some of these things in fact in a work environment

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:45.620
Not having flash is a security advantage and a work productivity advantage

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.620
Right like legitimately

01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:53.380
So I I guess I still I don't I don't feel like we have fully answered that question

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:55.380
I

01:08:55.380 --> 01:08:58.340
Don't know what it is exactly I think

01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:02.780
The problem is that we look at it different

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:08.020
we present it actually the wrong way because we presented as the

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.260
replacement for a PC right

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:16.140
Whereas we shouldn't be telling people that because it's well

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:20.500
It's not capable of everything you can do on your desktop like it is not

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:24.780
GIMP is not a replacement for photoshop. It is a separate line of tool that is available

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:30.020
Yes, but what you should show people is like

01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:36.140
this is a cool thing that you could use to browse Facebook with right or put up in your kitchen and

01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:42.140
Look at recipes with and all you need is a you know some screen and something to you know

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:48.140
a keyboard and a mouse and you have a your tiny computer in your kitchen, right and then you can

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:51.580
Show them that look this what you've considered

01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:57.660
To be just a recipe looking at device is also capable of those other things

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.980
Instead of showing them that this is a computer

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:08.780
That this is a computer that's not capable of all the other things that you are right using your computer

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:14.940
That's that's actually pretty good insight because that's why the smartphone has been so successful is because it was in as far as it

01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:18.060
Was replacing the dumb phone which was a not a high bar

01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:24.620
And so you could like Apple could launch their overpriced iPhone that didn't even have copy paste support for like two OS's

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:29.740
Because the bar wasn't that high and when you come in and you say I'm replacing the PC

01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:35.980
Well, guess what pretty high frickin bar pretty high for that makes sense. Have you seen what PC can do PC do what?

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:38.060
Yeah, right exactly

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:40.220
Damn it Wes screw you

01:10:40.940 --> 01:10:45.260
That is the worst advertising campaign ever, but it worked son of a gun

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:49.740
All right vert you want to talk about the future making everything a little bit smarter. Go ahead

01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:58.220
Yeah, well basically with this kind of dropping computing and more specifically sophisticated computing

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:02.940
It means these little devices like the pie zero or the Omega

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:11.180
Can now be turned into a general purpose kind of smart sensor or smart device that can be plugged into anything

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:14.780
Basically, you know displays well like this article

01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:18.500
This article that Wes found before the show is you know

01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:22.300
You take a simple speaker and now all of a sudden this is a quote-unquote

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:26.260
I mean if I was in the industry a smart speaker because it can receive Bluetooth or

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:32.180
Airplay or DLNA audio pulse also multicast as well or MPD

01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:35.700
Yeah, in fact, this is actually using pulse to send from your Linux box. I mean

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:43.660
A classic example is that it causes now I actually have a pie acting as a alarm clock

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.700
for my partially sighted father

01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:52.740
Because he can't necessarily see the display all the time and so he wants to be able to hear it

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:58.760
So it's a talking clock and we can now it's a talking clock tech to the Internet it can now read things like emails and how

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:02.300
Do other things that it wouldn't be able to do that sounds great or horrible?

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:06.220
Yeah, good point wimpy I

01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:09.060
also have noticed

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:13.740
Especially when it comes to a demographic that I am intimately familiar with my children

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:20.780
There is some essential use cases that the pie is totally capable of like things like YouTube or Minecraft

01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:24.180
And that is pretty a poor by a huge core audience. Wouldn't you think?

01:12:25.180 --> 01:12:30.740
Yes one it can do and one it can kind of do so when I've been going along to the pie jams

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.300
I've been

01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:38.460
Taking an Ubuntu mate set up and getting makers and other you know

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:42.020
Visitors to come and have a look and have a play and give me their feedback

01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:44.420
And it's interesting that when the kids go on it

01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:49.460
They basically want two things they want to be able to play Minecraft and they want to watch YouTube and if it doesn't do that

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:54.580
It's irrelevant. That's that's the end of a discussion and it has to be able to play Minecraft without

01:12:55.340 --> 01:13:00.460
Quote-unquote leg right and leg is frame drops. I guess I don't know exactly what leg is

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:04.460
But so there is there is a Minecraft version for the pie

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:09.940
It's the Minecraft pie edition, which is a bit like the pocket edition of Minecraft

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:16.300
Ah, but it comes with Python bindings so you can you know, you can program it and what have you?

01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:18.780
and YouTube

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:24.060
At the moment, we don't have the fully accelerated graphics driver for the for the chip

01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:26.060
That's on the Broadcom sock in the pie

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:27.860
so

01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:31.020
That's all software at the moment and that's a bit poor

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:36.340
But I've embedded a utility in Ubuntu mate where you can suck down

01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:44.020
You can visit YouTube within Firefox and pull the cut and paste the URL and then it will stream the URL into the IMX

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.020
Player which is the hardware

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:51.980
Assisted player so you get the full hardware assisted full screen playback streaming from YouTube ever

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:55.140
So actually you're kind of getting into my next segment

01:13:55.820 --> 01:14:02.220
Our next segment is is really some clever tricks to avoid having to use flash all together partly because arm

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:04.780
But also because of Adobe's announcement this week

01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:09.580
So pause right there wouldn't be and let's pick that back up because that's actually a perfect segue to our next segment

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.580
So I'll mention the perfect telco

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:16.780
Friends it actually exists because their business model is different ting is mobile that makes sense

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:19.820
Ting is an MV no of a couple of different networks

01:14:19.820 --> 01:14:23.420
So instead of like getting all involved in like digging the trenches

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:30.540
Installing the towers running the fiber fighting the local city council to make sure they can actually run a tower right there

01:14:30.540 --> 01:14:32.540
Which is an unbelievable fight?

01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:36.660
Contracting with the designers to design the tower and all and it's interesting as a contractor

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.940
I've worked at each stage of the process for the and watch telco

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:42.180
It's interesting when a telco comes into an area

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:45.940
It's both an amazing investment for the local businesses

01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:49.700
And it is it is just a nightmare for the telco

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:53.980
So it's an incredible investment for the local businesses when a telco wants to put a tower in

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:58.340
Because they're gonna have to trench and run fiber to that location and a lot of times

01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:01.940
They'll resell that fiber to all of the other local businesses in that area

01:15:01.940 --> 01:15:08.020
But can you imagine the administrative overhead just to manage that but at the same time like there's all of the local rules like you know

01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:10.300
Like oh for here. It's the PUD

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:14.820
It's our it's our public utilities that they have to like get approval from where the poles can be at all this kind of stuff

01:15:14.820 --> 01:15:21.020
Then they have to take it to an architecture firm to design the tower the tower then gets approved by the local city which then

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:25.380
Goes off to the state to get approved and then and it's all paying right in checks the whole way

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.760
Right sounds like a lot of work right in checks, right?

01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.820
So what Ting has done is they right on top of all of that?

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:33.220
So that's why they're able to invest in the customer

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:38.820
So the other guys have done the work there and now they need somebody to come along and actually get some customers on it

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:43.100
That's where Ting comes in. So it's six dollars a month for the line flat rate right there

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:45.820
And then it's just your usage on top of that. No contract

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:51.400
Nor the termination fee and because Ting isn't out there digging ditches. They're able to have

01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:57.140
Fanatical customer service they're able to have a great website and they're able to charge

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:02.060
Incredibly low rates and if you're just a like a little bit savvy with how you use things you can get by with

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:07.180
Unbelievable rates, so I've got three phones that I pay every single month for on Ting

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:13.900
The bill is like around 40 bucks a month 40 bucks a month for three phones smartphones. It's ridiculous

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:17.520
It's actually it makes sense and there's no contract. There's no early termination fee

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:22.260
They have a GSM and CDMA network you can take advantage of so if you know what that means

01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:26.180
then you're probably clever enough to figure out which one's better in your area and

01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:31.100
just go with that one and it also probably means you've got a device that's compatible with Ting and

01:16:31.100 --> 01:16:35.780
Ting has a brand new app you can get on the Android marketplace the Android Play Store

01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:40.920
To check to see if it's compatible with Ting to get all of the information. They made it easier than ever

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:45.980
They have the new brand new Ting compatibility checker. Whoo. Guess what? I didn't see this earlier

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:51.240
Kyra is here to tell us all about it too. Let's go check a phone to see if it's compatible with Ting

01:16:51.260 --> 01:16:54.720
This is the app you'll need. All right. I'm Kyra and this is the Ting download

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.720
The

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:05.800
Ting compatibility checker app for Android. Well checks your phone's compatibility with Ting. It doesn't do anything else

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:08.280
Yeah, it's beautifully simple if we do say so ourselves

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:14.800
It's also a very small download. It's intended to be used once and uninstalled at less than 1.5 megabytes

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:18.840
You won't have to worry about deleting other apps to make space for this one. Smart. Here's how it works

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:26.440
Install the app and open it up. Cha-cha-cha. Tap to check your phone. The app pulls your phone's unique serial number

01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:29.920
It's IMEI and runs it against the database of phones that'll work

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:34.200
It only takes a second. Once the process finishes, you'll find out right away

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.920
If your phone is compatible

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:42.480
You'll also get info on which network services it will support. As you'd expect the app is free and you can grab it from the Google

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:48.520
Play Store. The Ting compatibility checker is Android only. iPhone currently doesn't allow apps to pull specific phone info

01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:54.680
Huh, but you can always use the web-based compatibility checker at ting.com slash check on your desktop or mobile browser. All right

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.040
It's almost as simple

01:17:56.040 --> 01:17:58.040
Thanks for watching and we'll see you next time

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:03.840
Wow, did it just get easier than ever to switch to Ting? I think it did. Look at them. That's thinking

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.680
Well, and did I hear that they have their SIM cards on Amazon now?

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:10.760
They do Amazon Prime at that and you just pop them in a device check them out

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:16.800
So all you got to do is go to linux.ting.com to support this show and get yourself a discount. Go check them out

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:20.360
linux.ting.com and now it's easier than ever to bring an Android device

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.760
Interesting iPhone not

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.320
Letting you get access to that information

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.560
Hmm. I wonder which one protects your privacy

01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:33.080
Anyways linux.ting.com go get yourself a great device and then would you tweet me and tell me about how much you're saving

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:38.920
Cuz you're gonna want to tell somebody and share it with your bro. Chris will always listen. Just contact him 24-7

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:44.120
He doesn't mind especially when he's doing shit. Just call me directly. All right, so let's talk about Adobe Killing Flash

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.120
Well the name

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:53.360
Not really killing flash, but you know if you got yourself Creative Cloud heads up. They're gonna rename your application

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:57.960
So watch out everybody big change is coming down the pipe a new name a new name

01:18:58.620 --> 01:19:02.520
Really excited about that and they're gonna make an emphasis on HTML 5

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.720
9 binary output. How about that everybody?

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:10.680
You're really really excited now, aren't you? Are you are you amped up? If you're not amped up enough

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:16.720
Well, there's this French guy and this French guy. He's got a really really really shallow depth of field and he wants to tell you

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:19.200
All about it. Hello. My name is Michael shares

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:24.840
I'm a creative cloud evangelist based in Paris and a longtime interactive designer with the growth of HTML 5

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:31.240
Demand for animation formats that leverage web technologies has grown and the flash pro team has responded

01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:38.880
Adding first-class support for exporting animations to HTML 5 in order to clearly define the role of this application as the premier

01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:46.640
Animation tool for the web and beyond. I'm very excited to announce that flash professional is being renamed to adobe animate CC

01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:49.060
Adobe animate CC and

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:54.640
Adobe animate CC will be you know, can I just stop here? Did you notice how he says the word Adobe?

01:19:54.640 --> 01:20:00.080
I want to play that back just for a second and Adobe animate CC adobe adobe

01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:06.120
The only reason I mentioned that is last week you and I were trying to come up with how you say hat in French

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:10.280
Yes, and we got so much shit for how we tried to say hat in French

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:16.160
Well, how about an Adobe employee in France? They can't even pronounce the company. He works for you guys

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:22.280
You give me crap all the time. Well, what's up? This guy works for Adobe doesn't work there anymore. Not after that

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.320
I'm just saying like they're giving me a hard time because I can't say hat in French

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:28.560
Meanwhile, this dude works for Adobe and he calls it adobe, right?

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:34.960
But it's fine because he's French now Chris who speaks English isn't allowed to mispronounce anything, but this guy that's fine

01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.240
He's French. We don't care. He's French Chris

01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:40.440
It's not a big deal because he's French and he's in Paris and there was a terrorist attack

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.440
So don't give him a hard time because he calls it adobe. There's not a big deal

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:48.760
What are you talking about nouns that flash professional is being renamed to adobe animate CC?

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.720
Okay, now you can't on here. Can you add a beam?

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:56.640
And adobe animate CC will be available in early 2016

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:04.160
We are not just changing the name. We are adding significant new features for professional animators. Let me show you what we are working on

01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:09.640
You will be able to browse and license millions of illustrations photos and vector graphics

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:14.360
Adobe stock is directly integrated within the tool thanks to the power of creative sync

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:21.560
Same for creative cloud libraries. You can access colors vector shapes and brushes directly within animate CC and all right

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:22.240
So there you go

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:28.320
so this is they're gonna call it animate and they're gonna have animate CC for the application to use and the

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.840
Idea is adobe is gonna de-emphasize

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:32.520
de-emphasize

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:36.280
FLV and that kind of stuff and sort of re-emphasize

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:42.240
HTML 5 output but using Adobe tools to make that said HTML 5 output

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:44.200
I don't know what to think about this

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:51.280
So what I thought is let's just figure out how to stop using the flash plug-in all together and that's Chris's solution

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:55.360
So you really want to kill Adobe flash? I'm sorry adobe flash. This is how we do it

01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:56.720
This is how we do it

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:01.520
And so I wanted to give my couple of tips and I want to see maybe what you do to avoid using flash and we'll

01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:06.600
Toss it the bumble room. So I mentioned these on Sunday show but my two top tips to avoid using flash

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:14.280
First of all, don't install it second of all use live streamer to watch things that are in flash or if you want to watch

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:18.880
The JB live stream grab the RTMP or RTSP and throw that to MPV

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:25.320
That helps Alan get paid. Well and well you with live streamer. Well, I don't think we'll do the JB live stream

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:31.720
Okay, so live streamer will do like twitch and you stream you could watch the we do have a broadcast on you stream

01:22:31.720 --> 01:22:34.100
Not you stream TV or whatever you stream calm

01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:39.720
whatever the URL is slash channel slash Jupiter broadcasting and you could pipe that into live streamer and

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:45.400
Pipe that you could you could pull that into live streamer and it will it will work

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:50.120
But the the built-in embedded one on the jblive.tv page doesn't work with live streamer

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:53.240
But RTMP on RTSP work beautifully and MPV

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:57.760
So you just you know in the command line you type MPV and then you paste that link and it starts streaming

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:03.000
FFmpeg will record from those or HLS right as well right to a file HLS as well

01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:05.400
and then then of course

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.080
Something that I use all the time is

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:14.160
Minitube and YouTube DL which is a great way to pull video files off of YouTube without having to use flash

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:21.440
And then my go-to solution is instead of having flash installed system-wide if I have to have to have to use flash

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:27.720
I use chrome and chrome comes with flash built-in and I just keep it there in their little sandbox

01:23:27.720 --> 01:23:34.400
And that's where it stays and if a website requires flash like YouTube management tools, then I just use Chrome

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:37.600
What are you what? How do you avoid using flash when you need to you know?

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:42.080
I have to echo up pretty much everything you said I was just talking with my parents and they were kind of freaked out

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:44.880
Firefox is warning them about the vulnerabilities in flash and you know

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:49.280
They don't quite know what that means and I found myself just saying well if you haven't flash problems

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:53.200
You should probably just use Chrome and I haven't said that before but that's that's where we're at

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:56.660
I think is just you just use Chrome you use that for that page and you're done

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:00.140
Wendy you have a trick for getting HTML 5 playback on YouTube

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:07.480
Yeah, this is not so much about what you as a user can do but what you as a you know a content

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:15.840
Publisher can do so what if you embed YouTube clips in a website or social media and all the rest of it

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:18.720
If you add the HTML 5

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:25.720
Option to the embed URL it forces the clip to use the HTML 5 playback

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:28.280
Rather than flash by default. Oh

01:24:29.240 --> 01:24:35.800
That is great to know I will also I went through all my sites and you know added that to everything after the last round

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:41.240
Of you know flash vulnerabilities when nobody can access flash for about a week smart. I added that

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:42.760
That's beautiful

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:49.820
Some older versions of flash or or players that haven't been updated will save temporary files that if you want to watch the video

01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:54.440
But you don't want to use the flash interface it will download it to temp the temp folder, but it will delete them

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:59.720
Hmm, but it still has that file handle open. So the proc file system will show that to you

01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:01.840
So you can then you can copy it right out of it

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:06.200
So you still have to have flash installed for that. Yeah, but if you want to kind of archive clips off some websites

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.960
That maybe live streamer doesn't work. That's a nice trick

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:12.320
You can do it doesn't some don't work for that. But damn I am so do that's a nice way to pretty much

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.440
I'll have to find a link for that. Okay. Okay

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:14.960
Yeah

01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:19.580
There's actually a lot of stuff you can do with YouTube DL that are a lot more than people think they can

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:24.880
The name of it implies just YouTube sure there's about 200 different things that work. It's amazing

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:30.480
Yeah, so I don't even use live streamer because most of stuff I use YouTube DL works. So if you want to watch it

01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:36.480
Twitch.tv stream you just use YouTube DL with mpv or technically just use mpv and it works

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:41.600
Now when you say technically use mpv are you talking? Are you doing like how simple is it mpv?

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:44.640
And then it's just a twitch URL in there. What are you doing? Yeah, it's mpv

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:53.160
Really all you need is YouTube DL installed and then mpv detects YouTube DL and then parses it through perfectly fine

01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:55.440
You don't have to do it. Oh snaps. I am doing that

01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:57.520
I want to say I don't think it's in a lot of repos yet

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:03.040
And I was just asking wimpy about this in IRC as well, but it I see a release note from mpv saying that they support

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:07.760
The hardware decoding on Raspberry Pi 2. I haven't ever tried I think it might be in the arch arm repos

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:11.620
Maybe mumble room was more but that would be pretty pretty neat combination right there

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.860
normally when there's

01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:18.640
Pi compatibility for video playback you you can't just rebuild the source

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:23.920
Package from the Intel versions because you actually need to explicitly link it to

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.280
the OMX

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:31.840
Libraries for example. Yeah, so it usually requires a little bit of messing about with haven't looked at it yet

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:37.800
I was aware, but I haven't tried it. If you're talking about YouTube, there's a couple of utilities. There's also mini tube

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:44.400
which is a desktop client for Linux for browsing YouTube, which doesn't require flash and

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:52.280
There's another one called YouTube viewer and YouTube viewer is you know a desktop client for YouTube and behind the scenes

01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:56.160
it pulls everything down and streams it either via

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.360
mpv or

01:26:58.360 --> 01:27:02.400
Mplayer or something like that so it's got different back ends it can use to actually

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:08.400
View YouTube on the desktop, so that's another way to dodge flash right good a point good point

01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.380
Okay, now

01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:14.320
Kits and Kitty is pointing out the elephant in the room that I didn't realize until just now

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:16.920
but

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:23.420
There is a large use case for flash when it comes to porn Kitson, and you're mentioning that

01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:26.360
There is certain workarounds for that too, right?

01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.360
Yes

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:30.360
Apparently I have heard of that

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:37.100
DL works great on red tube. I mean I didn't actually think about it beforehand, but that's a little so

01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:40.400
Google's new service you're talking about

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:48.480
I mean it certainly is it is the young there is an uncomfortable truth and the that uncomfortable truth is

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:52.880
Linux makes for a fantastic porn platform you can quote me on that

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:56.120
But the reason is is on Windows you are

01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:03.440
legitimately constantly exposed to all kinds of different phishing attacks and scams and and malware that gets to drive by downloaded

01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:08.600
That is really not a problem on Linux or any internet browsers will click on anything

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:15.520
so and if you know if somebody should probably maybe there already is should make a live CD around this premise to be honest with you because

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.040
It comes with a sexy background

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:23.320
It is a showcase it is a showcase desktop environment because you can get all the codecs on there

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:28.360
You can get flash, and you don't have any of the vulnerabilities. I'm just saying someone should make the porn too

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:35.120
Someone should make one of those ads this one cool trick makes your porn browsing experience better

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:41.840
Yeah, you know you can sell some Linux on BuzzFeed just me or am I the only person that has noticed that?

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:46.320
Sex online is just as dangerous as sex in real life. Yeah

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:53.080
More so I think actually yeah one one trip trick for that is if you use a browser

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:56.600
User agent changer because a lot of porn sites want to support mobile

01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:00.800
Oh, and they have to then a lot of times use HTML 5 or oh interesting

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.160
So if you if you pretend you're like an Android device, or I usually get a link to some kind of MP4

01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:09.440
That's great for all kinds of sites. Yeah, I just did some I'll be I'll put I'll get this to you

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:14.800
So you put it in the show notes, but I found the supported sites list from YouTube DL. Oh, yeah, it's massive

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:19.180
No, I linked it. I linked it in yeah, I linked it in Sunday's Linux action show

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:22.360
There's a quite a few

01:29:22.760 --> 01:29:24.280
adult oriented

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.480
Mm-hmm

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:29.720
Solution I noticed that way only one I'm interested in is adult swim of course of course right

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:36.080
That's the only thought you care about and you know I just I guess I guess if we're being completely genuinely honest

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:38.000
That is a that is a legitimate use case for flash

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.360
Yeah, and it is something that keeps people using it

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:43.120
I guess which I hadn't considered until we started talking about this

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.500
But it's the elf in the room and there are solutions for that as well

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.920
Well, I think they are that industry is kind of you know

01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:54.160
They kind of pioneered that they had a lot of video content to deliver and flash at that time was the only thing that could

01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:59.600
Do it your tip about mobile is a good one though because I've read a couple of different articles on how high?

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:04.880
What a high percentage mobile traffic is for those types of sites. Yes, it's your board on the butt

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:12.080
I mean wow wow wow not me uh-huh yeah, no that's fine. That's no I guess zombies don't run Linux

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:16.880
So there you go there is plenty of ways flash can be dead today

01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:21.760
If you just take action friends, and we all all of us can make a difference

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:25.800
You can't go vote and make a difference just ask Adam ruins everything good show by the way

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.840
But you can make a difference by not running flash

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:33.840
you could also make a difference by going to Linux action show dot reddit comm and submitting stories topic ideas or

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:41.240
Open source projects you think we should know about also feedback for episode 121 over at Linux action show dot reddit comm

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:45.120
We've also got a live stream. I don't know if you knew about that over at JB live TV

01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:50.400
We do this show on Tuesdays probably only a couple of more this year like three Wow yeah

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:53.280
You better catch them be here live. Yeah, we've also got that mumble room

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:56.920
We love hanging out with our mumble room getting their live insights. We really mean it

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.640
It's our virtual lug and you can take part of that and share your thoughts

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:04.800
Just head over JB live TV go to Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar get a convert to your local time zone

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:11.240
That's Jupiter broadcasting comm slash calendar. Don't forget about that contact page while you're on our website and go check out previous episodes

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:16.760
We got a whole bunch avoid the family over the holidays. That's my personal recommendation hang out. You know talk about Linux

01:31:16.760 --> 01:31:21.960
That's way more fun. There you go. Hi everybody. Thanks so much to this week's episode of Linux unplugged. See you right back here next week

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.760
Oh

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:09.880
There we go we went there, but it was I think I just felt like you know what all of a sudden

01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:13.720
We should probably be honest. This is a genuine use case flash, so we did it. Yep. We happened

01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:17.480
We had to go there, so I wanted to take a couple of minutes here in the post show and

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:23.200
Just sort of invite the mumble room to jump in on open source projects. They're thankful for but let's do it

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:26.200
Let's do it like we're still doing in the show so that we wouldn't all talk over each other

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:29.920
So take me first in the chat room and with mum and then we'll go for there

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:34.120
But I wanted to just I know this is probably gonna come up, but there was so many projects

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.000
I could have been thankful for

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:42.640
Wes I I realized tink might be on your list. Yes, it definitely is so I wanted to play with that more

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.360
I think I definitely want to play is there any others that are on top of your mind for your list

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:52.360
Mmm. That's a good question. You think about it. I'll think about it alright, so vert you can go ahead and oh actually nope

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:56.100
Sorry wimpy was first wimpy go ahead. You have your project. You're thankful for

01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:03.700
Open SSH good one very good. I can't imagine life without it seriously versatile seriously

01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:10.380
Yeah, it is maybe one of the most useful open source projects for all of us like use just broad spectrum great one

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:12.400
great vert

01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:14.400
Do you want to mention own cloud?

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:18.840
Yeah, I mean that's really kind of changed my

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:24.040
Entire workflow now because I never really bought into the whole Google cloud services

01:33:24.720 --> 01:33:30.360
and so when own cloud came along I started sinking calendars and appointments and everything else between me and my family and

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:36.840
Yeah, it's just been a really great store in that sense, and I'm just glad for now good point all right

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:39.560
Don't forget JB titles calm. Let's pick our title

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.560
us hey citizen you're a sort of our resident Jack

01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:46.840
Showcase so I'm curious to hear what you're thankful for

01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:54.040
Well yeah, definitely thankful for Jack the audio connection kit that helps you more

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:58.160
Necessary for doing any professional audio on Linux mm-hmm

01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:04.240
Yeah, and it's something that is probably gonna be I'm gonna have to learn more about it in 2016 expect some

01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:10.160
I've been putting it off, but you know you hear hey citizen there, and I have some co-workers who are playing with it

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:15.160
It just it seems like a ton of fun. Yeah, that's like yeah, and also Lily pond tell me about that

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.760
Yeah, Lily pond is

01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.880
Another great app. I'm very thankful for it musical notation

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.520
It's kind of like the law tech of

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.400
music

01:34:27.400 --> 01:34:30.080
Okay, Lily pond. I will google that um

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:36.920
Kitson oh my god the most obvious one that I use for every single show all our hosts use it

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:38.920
And I didn't think of it kits and go ahead

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.440
Markdown yeah

01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:43.200
Yeah

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.880
Seriously markdown. You know what here's why markdown is great at the end of the day

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:50.680
I can just be fleet free flow like you know mr. Creative genius

01:34:50.680 --> 01:34:51.480
Just writing like a madman

01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:56.200
And I don't have to worry about like links like this is a big deal because I can just put I'll just put something in

01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:01.360
A bracket, and then I'll just do you know open parentheses closed parentheses, and I'll just keep typing and then 20 minutes later

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:05.620
I'll go back and get the URL and then I can cite so I know the references in my head

01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:09.660
But I just don't have the URL handy so I can keep writing and just quickly bang out stuff

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:14.880
You know format it a markdown and then put it out in consistent perfect HTML every single time

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.360
And there's tons of services that will just render that to what you want so many

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:26.640
I mean oh man markdown is a is really is really a good one, so yeah, so I like to go ahead

01:35:26.640 --> 01:35:28.640
Sorry, yeah, I like the interoperability

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:33.520
between markdown and all the applications that are out there for it and

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:40.480
That's actually what switched me over from using org mode because with org mode. It was just emacs. Oh

01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:47.400
Man rotten corpse you have virtual box. That's a good one to sit so cushy. I think I said

01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.160
encryption

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.160
Encryption software, that's a good one

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:56.480
So yeah, I think we should all thank the people who writes

01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:02.960
Encryption software that yeah makes it possible to for us to communicate

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.640
Yeah, safely and big picture. It's a big deal and

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:13.120
Yeah, and also the people who who come up with the ciphers and other

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:17.120
Like grip the graphic primitives and make them

01:36:18.120 --> 01:36:22.840
Public to my domain and right and share with everybody and yeah, that's a great point

01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:27.000
I I'll give will we should probably wrap up with these because this list could go on all day

01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:30.240
But I got to get a last one to poppy because ffmpeg is close to my heart

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:37.160
Yeah, I chose ffmpeg, but really I want to thank for grease bella the guy who started ffmpeg

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:40.360
Yeah, and also cue emu because both of them. Yeah

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:42.360
Because both of them. Yeah

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.320
Amazing. Yes of software and from you know from okay

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:53.320
They've got loads of contributions, but from one guy to start those two projects guys genius. Yeah, I agree. That's a good one

01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:58.120
Alright, so I'm gonna finish that. I'm trying to finish this beer. So if anybody else drinking with me today

01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:00.120
Well West is anybody else have a beer

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.360
Got to finish this tea

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:09.080
I too am drinking tea. I'm drinking bulletproof coffee. Okay. All right. All right. All right

01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:13.100
We got a bulletproof coffee drinker in there so now all of a sudden Chris isn't the only crazy guy

01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:18.320
We'll take that now. I'm not crazy. Are you are you putting MCT oil in that thing? What do you got going on over there? I?

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:26.160
Just got the coconut oil. Yeah. Yeah sure yeah, okay, but see here's the thing you can get you can get MCT oil

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:31.520
Which is an extract down of coconut oil which doesn't have any coconut flavor you still get all the benefits of coconut

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:35.040
Oh nice without the coconut flavor, so if you don't want to coconut up your coffee

01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:37.640
You putting butter in there

01:37:37.640 --> 01:37:42.160
Um, yeah a little bit. Yeah a little bit of butter. Yeah. Yeah, that is any you doing

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:46.880
Are you doing like a like a like are you doing that for breakfast? You doing like a fasting thing? What's going on over there?

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:53.160
No, I just I use it to keep me going it does doesn't it for a long time before having to have lunch

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:56.960
Yeah, not only does it not only does it help you keep going in between meals?

01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:04.000
But also, you know sometimes at least for me when the caffeine wears off especially coffee because it's like 120 milligrams of caffeine

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
I go into like

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:12.440
Starvation mode where I got to eat and I don't care what it takes or what it is or how long it's been in there

01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:14.440
I got it. Isn't that weird? Yeah

01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:19.400
Do you get like that sensation where your body just like really really really yeah, it's food

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:22.120
Yeah, and you when you do that how to describe it. It's really weird

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:28.440
When you do the bulletproof coffee you do not get that it is a more gradual ramp down

01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.920
Yeah, why does this sound like a recipe for diarrhea?

01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:38.120
Uh, well if caffeine makes you poo if coffee makes you poo then it will happen. Yeah

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:44.440
Gotta love the coffee poo, but I'm telling you what though this I don't I don't I don't do the official like bulletproof coffee

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:50.360
I just go get really good coffee and an immersion blender and I put MCT coconut oil in there and a little bit of butter and

01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:53.440
You know

01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.880
It I haven't done in a while, but it's when it's cold out

01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:59.760
You know and you can also like if you don't care about if you're not doing it for health reasons

01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.720
You can put a little chocolate syrup in there too now don't do that

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.080
But you could put a little chocolate syrup in there too, or a little go powder or a little liqueur

01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:14.520
Yeah, a little look actually they say I've heard that chocolate is actually really good for you. Well there you go antioxidants shit

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:18.840
That's health food then that's basically health it done done. Let's serve up. Maybe not so much no

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:26.040
The high fructose corn ruin this for us high fructose corn syrup is the number one ingredient. I think in that

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:32.320
Sweet Lou says coffee does make you crap you know when I went to system 76 part of their cyborg

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:38.520
Versus robot versus human lie detector test asked if they asked you if coffee makes you poop

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:43.920
So I think that was one of the things that made me more cyborg less robot because I do poop

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:58.160
oh, did
