1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
I know you know this already, I'm sure, but we used Ubuntu Mate 14.04 for our broadcast

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,160
station and it worked like a champ, it was great.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,240
I was grinning ear to ear when I heard that that's what you'd use, that was brilliant.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,640
It was perfect because it gave us enough of a...there are certain things we needed to

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,900
be able to do that are sort of like a traditional workflow, like for example I was syncing over

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,560
art assets and no one needed to be able to look at a bunch of files in Nautilus or whatever

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,800
the file manager is called, and open them up in Inkscape and modify them.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,680
So there was some need to have sort of a more traditional work desktop environment on the

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,640
broadcast machine but it doesn't need to be anything very high end because it really doesn't

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,640
do much more other than the broadcast, it's just when we sit down to use it.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,560
So it was perfect because the low resources meant that the rest of the resources went

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:58,780
to the broadcast and it was just perfect, it was exactly what we needed.

13
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:04,280
So I know that you've been using Ubuntu Mate for some production use and there's a podcast

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,440
that I'm now, I think I'm an officially a member of the team, I think that happened

15
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:16,280
last time or the time before, anyway but there's a podcast that I do with Popey and Laura and

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:23,560
Mark now and 50% of that is done with Ubuntu Mate and I know a couple of YouTubers that

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:31,160
are doing all of their stuff on Ubuntu Mate and I know of a radio station in the US that's

18
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,000
using Ubuntu Mate for their radio.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,240
So it's becoming quite popular as a broadcast platform and when I heard Noah and Alan talking

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,700
about their trials and tribulations with setting up that machine and sleep deprivation and

21
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:55,680
all the rest of it, it got me thinking maybe there's the opportunity to create an Ubuntu

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:05,720
Mate broadcaster alternative image which comes pre-packaged with the tools that a broadcaster

23
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,800
would want to use.

24
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:14,800
So things like Mumble and OBS and video editors and audio editors and I don't know what those

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,640
tools are but if you can speed up the deployment and have an out of the box, I mean there's

26
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:28,620
already Ubuntu Studio which does that by building on top of Zebuntu but yeah it got me thinking

27
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,800
maybe there's some collaboration potential on that.

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,120
Yeah and that is very, it is already a bit of an advantage we noticed because a lot of

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,120
times when we would set up a production machine then there is sort of setting up the, actually

30
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,520
installing the OS is sort of the fastest part of it because then you go to the vendors website,

31
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,320
you go get your login because you purchased the software and you have to login now and

32
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,300
then you get the download links and then you download it and then you generate the serial

33
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,920
number and of course you install it and then after you install it you restart and all that

34
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,800
good stuff and then you come back online and then you launch the application and then you

35
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,320
put the serial number in and then you activate the application and then you begin the setup

36
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,920
process right of course and that's assuming there wasn't any drivers you had to load for

37
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,000
the capture card which there always are.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,880
So all of these things are just completely eliminated when you do it under Linux.

39
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,840
It's already so much faster that we were just like blown away.

40
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,120
So I can only imagine like if it was even more streamlined and I know one thing we're

41
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,840
thinking about doing is an image but the primary challenge is that, this is one thing I've

42
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,680
always kind of worried about the nut to crack under Linux is there is a fine line to walk

43
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,680
where the system would get so stagnant that like OBS would be held back or OBS would be

44
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,480
held back for example because maybe we need a newer version of FFmpeg or something like

45
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
that.

46
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,960
So there's this line where I'm like okay today we can use a 14.04 installation.

47
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,600
I'm not so sure if next, in fact I would be shocked if next year at Linux Fest Northwest

48
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,920
we were still on Ubuntu 14.04.

49
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,640
I would bet that all the underlying technology since it's being developed so rapidly is going

50
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,760
to move forward and I would bet that it just it won't work for us.

51
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,440
I don't know what we'll be on but I bet it's not 14.04 next year.

52
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,520
Yeah quite possibly.

53
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:24,040
One of the things I've been looking at is the idea of software channels.

54
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:31,600
So there's lots and lots of PPAs out there but it's up to you to decide the quality of

55
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,920
those PPAs and if they're just delivering a single package that they want or if it's

56
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,800
everything under the sun you don't quite know what else you're going to drag in as a result

57
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,120
of adding them.

58
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,200
So I've had this idea of software channels with a UI where you can turn on like the FFmpeg

59
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,000
software channel or the mumble software channel and it's by application and instead of you

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,960
having to go and find the PPAs you just enable the applications that you're interested in

61
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,920
and it turns on sort of pre-vetted quality PPAs that deliver those packages so typically

62
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:15,760
the PPAs that are made by the developers rather than you know enthusiasts and hobbyists that

63
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,680
might have a PPA of just you know a load of stuff that they want on their machine.

64
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,680
That would be and of course that's how users think of it too is by the application.

65
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,160
Yeah exactly so you have an icon and you say enable mumble channel or enable FFmpeg channel

66
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,000
or VLC channel or LibreOffice 4.4 channel or whatever it might be.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
Yeah that's interesting and you know the other thing that's great about Linux is when we

68
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,680
decide okay well now it's time to add in the audio stream it's like okay well we'll just

69
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,360
go install DarkCast and it's just it is once all of the stuff gets in place it is so much

70
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:59,000
easier to do it under Linux once the software is ready.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,320
Welcome to Linux Unplugged your weekly Linux talk show that's still hungover from Linux

72
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,680
Fest Northwest 2015.

73
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,040
My name is Chris.

74
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
And my name is Matt.

75
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
Hey there Matt.

76
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,880
I swear I had two beers over the course of the entire Linux Fest Northwest and yet somehow

77
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
I feel hungover.

78
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,120
I felt hungover for a couple of days and then I realized it wasn't so much the Fest itself

79
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,000
it was like the six or seven days leading up to the Fest that crushed me because I actually

80
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,040
like Saturday night after Linux Fest I went to bed like at nine o'clock like oh yeah yeah

81
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
we went to the after-party.

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,360
The after-party wasn't so good but we went to the after-party and then I left after about

83
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,520
ten minutes and Iamacon shamed me in the chatroom for only having two beers.

84
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,600
It gets worse Iamacon.

85
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,860
After that I went back to the hotel room like around nine o'clock and I fell asleep after

86
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,480
watching Obama's White House Correspondence thing and the rest of the group went out and

87
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,880
had like played the Cards Against Humanity and where that was up to like one in the morning

88
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,400
and meanwhile I'm sleeping I'm saying even though I went to bed early I still didn't

89
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
get enough sleep.

90
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
I don't know what it is Matt.

91
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,720
So today today we're gonna cover some of the best interviews we got from the floor of Linux

92
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,440
Fest Northwest 2015.

93
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,560
If you watch the Linux action show you saw the interviews we got live as people stopped

94
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,760
by the booth during the show but Linux Fest Northwest went Saturday and Sunday and it's

95
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,120
something it's sort of a phenomenon that happens at these fest is the sessions let out and

96
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,040
man it is like a herd of people just they swarm the floor and it gets nuts and then

97
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:32,360
it kind of sessions fill back up and the floor kind of empties out and all of the cool people

98
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,820
that are sitting at the different booths all of a sudden have nothing to do and so they

99
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:40,000
stopped by our booths and they talked to us and so we sat down with Alan of course Alan

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,620
from TechSnap he's gonna give us an update on the state of ZFS on Linux and describe

101
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,160
how boot volumes work for us.

102
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,200
Also a guy from Intel who's working on getting the Intel Minnow board to be a premier Linux

103
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,640
device and he talks about why Linux is just the best platform for these Intel Minnow boards.

104
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,920
These are these boards that are designed to compete with like the ARM type boards.

105
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,980
It's really fascinating because it's what you get from an ARM board like a Raspberry

106
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:07,080
Pi but an x86 chip on there like a full-fledged Intel chip so he's gonna talk to us about

107
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,960
that and running Linux and then the guy who brought Netflix to Linux originally and got

108
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,440
the whole snowball rolling that eventually brought native playback joins us to talk about

109
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,920
all of that and wine's critical role in moving people over to Linux.

110
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,760
Plus towards the end of the show we might just have a clip that could land us in a bit

111
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,840
of legal trouble.

112
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,760
So it is a great show today and audio or video there's gonna be a little something for Irver

113
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,760
Bottom Matt.

114
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,680
So why don't we start getting into it before we go too far we got to bring in our awesome

115
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:46,400
mumble room so time appropriate greetings mumble room like a wave of yeah it's like

116
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,720
doing the wave a little bit all right guys well you guys are like our virtual Linux fest

117
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,640
every single week who needs to go anywhere we'll just talk to you guys that's not that's

118
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,440
not actually true at all that's not true no it's not true but it doesn't matter hey so

119
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,720
we have many things to cover but I had one story that just kind of slipped out between

120
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,500
Linux action show and this show that I wanted to give some coverage to because it's a pretty

121
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,680
good release and it's one I've been looking forward to for a little while now excuse me

122
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,040
I'm mr. sis I'm getting an echo back from your mic over there thank you sir all right

123
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,160
so it's a it's a it's a news release that I've been looking forward to for a while it's

124
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,420
plat it's KDE plasma 5 3 this is a big big deal this is a really big release of the plasma

125
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:31,760
desktop this is one where I think people might want to consider switching to plasma 5 if

126
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,840
you've been holding back and it adds a few new interesting features as well specifically

127
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,600
around enhanced power management and boy did these guys go for it and gals when they decided

128
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:45,440
to make this feature they've built in a lot of features from Intel's power top application

129
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,960
right into the KDE info GUI Center now Matt if you bring up the like the power management

130
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:57,120
section in K info center they will now integrate the power top readings right into the graphing

131
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,960
so you can see what applications are consuming the most power and it generates you an energy

132
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,840
consumption graph kind of like you see on Android it's really sick well this pisses

133
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,720
me off because now I want to use KDE again it just totally it's like come on guys stop

134
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,000
it stop innovating damn it I'm trying to like find a desktop and stick to it knock it off

135
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,640
I know I know hold on I just decided I'm a gnome guy don't do this to me right do this

136
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,560
oh wait there's more you know I don't know what this means exactly but also now screen

137
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,680
brightness changes are animated on most hardware I don't know what that means I don't know

138
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,780
how you animate a screen brightness change other than I'm glad it's animated I like that

139
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:41,960
I know yeah well that could go a couple different ways I mean were we talking about like doing

140
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,240
a Disney cartoon or are we talking about actually like a transition I don't know yeah that could

141
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,680
be interesting it's like an OpenGL fade or yeah or is it something completely different

142
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,200
so they completely revamped the Bluetooth management applet so it looks really good

143
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,040
and much clearer to connect to available Bluetooth devices and the touchpad configuration well

144
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,600
I don't know if I'd say it looks good I mean it's a touchpad configurator but boy is it

145
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,160
cray it'll even emulate little like areas for you to drag and click to test stuff and

146
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,080
set up action corners for like the top left top right bottom right bottom left of your

147
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:20,580
trackpad you can do tap and drag gestures you can set locked drags and tap detection

148
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,560
timers and all of these things that of course you'd only be able to do under KDE and I'm

149
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,680
not going to say it's the best UI to do it but at the same time I'm glad they're not

150
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,640
taking away some of the power toys so I'll take it that is now see this yeah this changes

151
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,680
everything improved widgets all along to new clipboard applet gain support for showing

152
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,240
barcodes which is kind of crazy but easy to transfer something from your clipboard to

153
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,840
your Android device the recent they now have a recent contacts and recent documents menu

154
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:48,800
that's been cleaned up the menu whole menu thing looks really that's just the whole thing

155
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,340
looks really good and the tech preview of plasma media center has been added to this

156
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,140
release it's a full it's they say it's fully stable but missing features so version one

157
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,900
will have more features but they say it's stable now wow yeah also a huge steps towards

158
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:08,120
supporting Wayland so boom shakalaka the plasma desktop keeps chugging right along I mean

159
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,760
like I go out of my way to dislike KDE and I'm having a really hard time right now because

160
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,200
it's like this is really compelling I mean and I'm not a fan so this is saying something

161
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,280
I'm not gonna I'm not gonna dig any I'm not gonna dig a hole any deeper but I'll just

162
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:27,480
say I'll just give you this I'm impressed yeah there you go hey so we've before before

163
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,640
we even started the show wimpy jumped on and wimpy wimpy asked me said so Chris what's

164
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,920
the latest with Angela switch to Linux how is it going and I thought I would open up

165
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,200
our update on Angela switch to Linux and her whole I switched to a yoga three by capturing

166
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,680
a special moment that happened on the live stream at Linux fest this weekend think penguin

167
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,280
was there and they were giving out stickers for you to place over the Windows key on your

168
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:57,320
keyboard and so we thought the proper way to Chris and Angela's new laptop was to get

169
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,300
rid of that Windows super key and put a tux penguin on this all open up the yoga update

170
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,360
segment with this clip okay to put that wind that that that tux sticker over the Windows

171
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:14,200
key or you can use that one if you want yeah there you go if you want to tux that that

172
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:25,120
Windows button all right the tension no it gets the sticker ready all right as I fold

173
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,720
the yoga screen back I get the power vested in me yeah by the canoe and the penguins and

174
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:40,280
the beard I now pronounce you no longer freedom hating garbage but instead freedom respecting

175
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:49,360
that's beautiful though it's so beautiful keyed give me now kissy yoga there we go ladies

176
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:56,040
and gentlemen it now has a tux somebody better kiss that computer then Noah kisses the computer

177
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:05,960
not a dry eye was a very emotional moment so now Angela has a Linux penguin on on the

178
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:13,080
button now okay so what did we end up doing so the MacBook sold thank goodness the MacBook

179
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:21,840
sold so the yoga is going to be paid for thank goodness now I I left the studio that night

180
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,440
after Linux unplugged and I said to Noah and I wish Noah's here so we could get an answer

181
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,400
and if anybody in the mumble room knows the answer it's mr. sis you might know the answer

182
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,680
I don't know but if anybody or blaster might know I left here thinking that we were gonna

183
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,040
put Ubuntu Mate 1404 we're gonna go LTS and then we sort of you know you know what we'll

184
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,480
do this we'll do LTS and we'll do gnome 314 we'll do the gnome PP because she likes gnome

185
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,360
and all right so we'll do that and one thing led up to another and I don't exactly know

186
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,840
exactly what transpired but I kid you not when I got back in here the next morning it

187
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:05,400
was running arch he was installing Ubuntu I literally have no idea quite what happened

188
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:15,440
why we switched from Ubuntu LTS with gnome PPA to arch but we did and so that's what

189
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,240
she has is an arch box with gnome 3.16 on it so far she's quite happy and everything

190
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,680
seems to be working mr. sis do you know why he didn't go with LTS were you in the room

191
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:30,720
when that decision was made yes I was I was there I was part of the decision I can't confess

192
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,880
to that however there is a non-disclosure agreement that was agreed to at the time so

193
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,680
all members would have to be around to then agree that we can't disclose that decision-making

194
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,680
process okay so before we can reveal the reason we have to bring Noah on the show and get

195
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:53,840
his consent and maybe Alan too since he was present and and Rekai okay okay I might have

196
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:59,560
to get consent from Rekai off air perhaps but why this is either way what I want to

197
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:07,120
focus on is that she actually she said something to me over dinner that made all of the work

198
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,280
worth it she said I think this is the time it's gonna stick because the difference and

199
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,040
I and I want to I want to reiterate and underscore this if you can afford to do it the difference

200
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,200
is she really likes that hardware she likes that laptop she feels like she got something

201
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,800
nice and it is something nice and it's set up just for her and you know we also went

202
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,080
through and cleaned up some of her old data and offline some of it and we just sort of

203
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,880
did some general hygiene stuff as well and I think overall she's missing a few things

204
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,280
and there's a there's a couple of threads going to the Linux action show subreddit like

205
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:42,800
she used a pixel mater which is sort of like a Photoshop alternative under OS 10 she doesn't

206
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,080
have anything quite equivalent to that she's looking at Corita and Inkscape not I don't

207
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,040
know if that's gonna do it for her not but there's threads going on and on about that

208
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:59,280
but so far it looks like it's actually gonna stick and I don't know I'm not I'm not like

209
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,840
totally like totally comfortable with the arch thing but I since we were gonna do before

210
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,180
and I was okay with it I'm okay with it now I'll stay on top of it for a little bit I

211
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:13,800
guess delegate my friend delegate I'm telling you oh we got to get that reason we got to

212
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:18,960
get that reason in here and find it out or you know or Linux Academy you know I mean

213
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,120
one of the other either way actually she was she was also I think this whole thing has

214
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,460
given her a boost of confidence because then she was kind of giving me a hard time teasing

215
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:31,920
me that she was gonna learn Python before I do so my wife's enrolling in Linux Academy

216
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:35,040
next month I mean it's happening yeah she's actually gonna learn the Linux basics I mean

217
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,920
you know I think I'm just gonna do it too and yeah it is it is you know actually this

218
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,720
would be I could just why don't I just take a moment right here and I'll just mention

219
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,720
Linux Academy that'd be a great spot to mention Linux Academy they're a sponsor of the Linux

220
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,480
unplugged program go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged that'll get you the unplugged

221
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,200
discount that's linuxacademy.com slash unplugged go check them out they have been sponsoring

222
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:01,000
us for a while now but I feel like every time we come on the show we have something new

223
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,460
to talk about and that's pretty exciting if you think about the rapid amount of innovation

224
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:11,080
and development work that is required to make that happen wow that I have right here let's

225
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,840
see check out I have printed off some of the stuff they've done recently it's so much stuff

226
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,720
that I actually decided I'm just gonna print it so that way I can just go through some

227
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,680
of it with you from time to time and read it that it's I really really respect what

228
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,720
these guys are doing so let me tell you a little about Linux Academy they're different

229
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,120
than all the other online educational resources it's created by people that are truly passionate

230
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,220
about Linux and they really care about open source they got together with their friends

231
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,040
that are education education educators and developers and they've created the Linux Academy

232
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:44,100
platform they built it from scratch and it is custom-built for us when you go there you

233
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:47,780
recognize it is created by people that truly get this kind of thing and the reason why

234
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:51,120
I want to emphasize that is because I think that really closes the gap that makes the

235
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,600
big difference that's the difference from all of the other large websites that cover

236
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,160
all of the other areas that don't truly love Linux they don't cover it right they don't

237
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,560
care they don't closely watch the trends and see where things are going they don't know

238
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,960
that there's many distributions you might want to choose from Linux Academy does they

239
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,400
have seven plus Linux distributions you get to choose from that automatically adjust the

240
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,920
course where that automatically adjust the virtual machine that spins up on-demand it

241
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,800
comes with the machines as you need them they have scenario based labs at Linux Academy

242
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,120
in addition to all the other regular labs they have for servers and things like that

243
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,120
they'll do specific deep dives into scenarios we receive access to scenario based training

244
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,640
to put you in the middle of a task common to everyday environments you'll work in advanced

245
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,960
lab environments while completing those scenarios from beginning to end on their live servers

246
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,460
as a member of Linux Academy also have abilities to ask their instructors they have live streams

247
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,880
where you can ask the instructors questions and they've introduced this new feature just

248
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,500
recently called nuggets which is a deep dive into a single topic not necessarily part of

249
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,360
an overall part of a training course but like everyday tasks that you just need to know

250
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,120
that if you know these little nuggets better and better you get things done faster and

251
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,120
faster and I've taken some of these and learned you know there's a better way to do this that

252
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,000
I've always done it and it's a little bit of humble pie from time to time but I'm always

253
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,200
very very very grateful that I've learned a new way to do something or improved a way

254
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,080
of doing something I've done for a long time Linux Academy also recently announced they're

255
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:15,120
going to start up an open source grant they're going to be giving away five thousand dollars

256
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,060
to a qualifying open source project now to qualify you have to be an open source project

257
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:23,040
now they're going to have their founders club members vote on which projects get the funding

258
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,200
but it's pretty awesome it's a way it's another way they're going to give back to the open

259
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,440
source community so they had their big content push bunch of new content has hit Linux Academy

260
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,280
the Red Hat certified services administrator the art I chat room you tell me our HCSA it's

261
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,900
going to be released it was actually just released a couple of days ago 50 new video

262
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,840
nuggets you know those new nuggets I was telling you about 50 of them just hit the site how

266
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,200
if you want to learn things like Ruby or OpenStack PHP Amazon Web Services Android development

challenge yourself that's what I use it for Linux Academy comm slash unplugged it's a

272
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,120
great resource and a big thanks to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux unplugged program

273
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,040
and like you know like Matt said there's always a great opportunity to go in there for all

274
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,080
kinds of folks I don't get a chance to really give you a picture of all the types of content

275
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,400
that are available but if you go check it out there really is courseware for everybody

276
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,120
it's starting sort of at the absolute beginner level like like maybe Matt's wife would be

277
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,960
all the way up to you know the really hardcore stuff that's super advanced and putting you

278
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,280
on the very edge of the things like Docker and and really just everything that I was

279
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,960
looking at some of the recently added stuff here engine X and the limp stack introduction

280
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,960
to Ruby on Linux Linux essential certification course for just all the different certifications

281
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,820
right there new 20 new AWS CSA additions were just put on here get in GitLab from start

282
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:16,200
to finish deploy and manage open stack on Ubuntu it just it's just these are just recent

283
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,640
ones that's just really good stuff Linux Academy comm slash unplugged thanks like you said there's

284
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,500
something there for everyone and I love the fact that they're able to take you by the

285
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,960
hand at the very very beginning and you know you can know literally nothing about Linux

286
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,360
at all and they can take you from that point all the way up to where you're ready to be

287
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,400
certified and something you're wanting to get into it's really cool and there's for

288
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,760
folks like me who've been in it for a long time but just want to kind of just keep tipping

289
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,780
our toes and keeping keeping ourselves up to date exactly it's really useful and speaking

290
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:47,680
of keeping our toes in the waters I've been experimenting with different file systems

291
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,640
under Linux for a while the one I really haven't spent a lot of time with because just doesn't

292
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,000
feel like it's time yet but maybe it maybe this clip is going to change my mind is ZFS

293
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,380
or as our buddy Alan says ZFS and Alan gave a talk at Linux Fest Northwest about open

294
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,800
ZFS and he talked about a lot of things and one of the things that seemed to grab the

295
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,880
crowd's attention was this feature called boot volumes and it goes into some detail

296
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,460
about how it works and how maybe we could see it under Linux and how maybe in the future

297
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,680
it could be integrated with docker so a lot of things that could be coming to Linux and

298
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:24,000
ZFS so Alan is our first take from Linux Fest Northwest did did you go into much much detail

299
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,120
on boot environments because that seems like in a particular area that would be of interest

300
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,960
to Linux users yeah they're all like we want that yeah so one of the things we do with

301
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,720
that is so instead of actually take snapshots that's pretty normal but you can also clone

302
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,120
them which basically makes them a new file system that's writeable not for our default

303
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,480
file system we don't we don't have snapshots no no yeah so yeah but there people are familiar

304
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,880
with what snapshots are you mean better file systems that have snapshots yeah yeah okay

305
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,080
but but people are familiar that there's such a thing yeah like even if even if it's actually

306
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,680
coming from even if our file system doesn't have it right or specifically you know you're

307
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,840
using virtualization and it can kind of pretend right yeah sometimes I get to play like extended

308
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,560
for as snapshots with like virtual box yeah and I'm like oh this is what a file system

309
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,240
feels like yeah a little bit just a little bit and so you basically with a clone it allows

310
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,520
you to like fork a file system kind of like you for open source right yeah so you have

311
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,200
the common blocks only take up space once even though you're using them twice and then

312
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,760
the differences in the difference yeah and then you have the differences take up the

313
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,680
space and so with that what you can do is if you have forks of what your system looked

314
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,800
like from different times you we push that into the grub menu and when you start up the

315
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,000
system what publishes it to the grub menu just a utility that Chris Moore wrote oh okay

316
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,320
so it just loops over the ZFS data set and reads that and then it figures out what menu

317
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,320
entries to make based on and then when you boot up the system you may like well I can

318
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:47,800
have the system that like the latest version I run it it's okay or I just installed an

319
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,040
update and it broke everything yeah let me just select the other one in the menu one

320
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:57,360
from before yeah and he set it up so it automatically makes one for you when you start a package

321
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,360
upgrade because I always forget that's a good idea and then oh look you know this latest

322
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,120
package upgrade left me in dependency hell some app I depend on doesn't work now yeah

323
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,720
well hey I can just reboot and give me what my machine looked like 10 minutes ago or and

324
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,440
the best part about it is with ZFS you create basically an infinite number of partitions

325
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,960
you can create many many partitions but they all share one pool of free space right because

326
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,920
usually the the only reason we don't create a separate partition for like every directory

327
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,960
on our systems is that you have to set how much space each partition gets and you lock

328
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:33,600
yourself in yeah your free space gets broken up all over the place and it's useless yeah

329
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,000
well with all the free space coming from one big pool now you can create as many as you

330
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,760
want and so when you're setting up these snapshots and stuff when you're rolling back you can

331
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:48,320
say roll back only the system but leave my home directory alone oh all the documents

332
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,780
I updated but the files and can I can I once again repeat that extended for is not good

333
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,960
enough and I just say once again repeat that every time you've tried another file system

334
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,840
it totally blows your system away and I've run extended for for the last like seven years

335
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,240
never had a problem working for you know I don't have snapshots my system doesn't crash

336
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:13,200
so we'll go with that honestly on my development laptop I actually have boot environments

337
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,120
are created on purpose where I'm actually have three different versions of the operating

338
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,960
system that I can boot from yeah that's cool too but sharing more of the data rather than

339
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,840
if I did it like a multi boot type setup right yeah like they're all sharing the same installed

340
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,000
apps and stuff because they're sharing their package database because it's compatible but

341
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,400
the one thing that makes this a little easier on BSD is the separation between the operating

342
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,160
system and your applications yeah previously forces all applications you install from the

343
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:45,760
package repo to be rooted in user local whatever right so even your config files so you know

344
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,120
yeah the config files user local Etsy is user local Etsy yeah so when you upgrade the operating

345
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:54,920
system and it changes some default stuff right changes an etc right so you can your snapshot

346
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:59,840
can have that separate and yeah you can see which last etc is just the OS setting exactly

347
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,080
and so when you're upgrading and and if you roll that back yeah you didn't lose the change

348
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,480
you made yeah in your server application or whatever yeah you know and Linux sometimes

349
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,680
like apps that run with the user level privileges they'll write their config to the home directory

350
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,720
so you can accomplish that a bit yeah but like yeah overall package settings and like

351
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,000
you know for your for your applications you install from like the AUR and things like

352
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
that yeah they get mixed in with the slash Etsy yeah so having that separation makes

353
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,040
things a little bit easier to kind of with finding control decide exactly what you're

354
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,360
going to roll back and what you're not yeah and that that's the the other big advantage

355
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,800
with that over other types of snapshots and roll backs is that you can roll back part

356
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,520
of the system but not all of it so that you know you don't lose the file you're the stuff

357
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,760
you're doing well and yeah so with that what PCB SD is taken to doing is actually basically

358
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,360
forking the file system setting up in a jail and installing all the updates and stuff in

359
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,000
the background while you're working on your live system and then when you reboot you just

360
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
reboot in a newer version of the system but all you're in this all your other stuff is

361
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,960
happening and and so you can be doing your package upgrade in the background while still

362
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,960
running applications without having a problem because that was a problem I used to have

363
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,040
is like while I was installing the update you know it's downloading a button it's going

364
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,760
to do stuff well I want to be using the browser but how do you use the browser well the dependencies

365
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,120
are being upgraded yeah it's like oh the browser can't launch because the dependency is a newer

366
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:26,760
version now yeah and so yeah having that happen in a separate one and then just switching

367
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:32,640
out underneath right it's kind of like a puppy Linux and having the overlay yeah yeah overlay

368
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,760
so it the way I look at it and and really I mean people as much as it's fun to joke

369
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,160
about it really people should be thanking you for trying things like butter FS and then

370
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,520
letting it crash on you twice because then we all know where you know what the state

371
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,800
of I mean really you're doing everyone a favor by by actually I'm not serious but then but

372
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:56,800
you add to that in building upon that then we look at this idea that if if I would rather

373
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,200
see Linux get to a point where Linux does everything well and we can all that stuff

374
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,520
sounds really great and fancy and cool but I'm thankful for for a reliable usable file

375
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,680
system like exe for that I have and I can fall back on that that I don't lose any data

376
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:15,840
on and if and when Linux can adopt those things I think it'll be really cool there is there

377
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,600
is ZFS on Linux it's a project from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories right and

378
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,240
while they're a little bit behind BSD and a Lumos mostly because they started much later

379
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,160
and they have a lot of catching up to do but their latest release I think is 0.6 up for

380
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:36,800
it has the biggest improvements like the compression stuff and it's it's quite stable and people

381
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,440
are using it and they're quite happy with it I'm waiting for a checkbox in the installer

382
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,040
that I can just check and says yes at a fast ironically Debian might be the first yeah

383
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:51,960
that'd be really cool yeah there's a I forget the name of the project but there's one that's

384
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,840
looking at Docker and ZFS put together and being able to do interesting things there

385
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:02,040
is some interesting things you could do there now a lot of you probably out in the audience

386
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,160
might have already tried ZFS into Linux or some of you might be doing it now wimpy didn't

387
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,680
you say on the pre-show that you recently set up a NAS with ZFS just this afternoon

388
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:17,480
oh wow that is recent and is I assume Linux based right it is it's open media vault 1.0

389
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:24,520
which is Debbie and Weezy based oh yes and that has a plug-in that adds ZFS support there's

390
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:31,040
a storage back end with the management utilities to support it as well so the OS is what extended

391
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:38,680
for and then the data volumes are ZFS that's right so I've got a next for OS drive and

392
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:48,520
then four drives in ZFS pool and how's the management UI for it I'm something of a newbie

393
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:54,000
with ZFS so I don't know how comprehensive it is but I was able to set up what I wanted

394
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:03,840
to do so from a new to ZFS point of view it does what I need and I don't know if it's

395
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,720
going to be stable or not or if it'll work or if it'll fall in a heap but it's an experiment

396
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,880
to try it out do you do you recall is it a pretty current version of ZFS that they're

397
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:24,160
using it's compatible with the feature flags that are in free nas 9.2 so I don't know what

398
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:32,540
changed in ZFS between free nas 9.2 and 9.3 right but if you but you can find free nas

399
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:38,760
yeah yeah you can find a feature flag system works is that would be that'd be true across

400
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:44,800
any any system that has ZFS with those feature flags it wouldn't just be free nas yeah so

401
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:53,120
I know that you can import a Z pull that's from free nas 9.2 into this open media vault

402
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,880
system but I don't think you can import a Z pull from free nas 9.3 because the required

403
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:08,360
feature flags aren't in open ZFS in this Linux implementation yet any initial impressions

404
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:14,120
on performance well I haven't done it for the performance so this is this is going to

405
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:21,180
be my Plex server I've really done it to help prevent bit rot and gray holing so your requirements

406
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:26,960
are stream the HD file fast enough yes just fast enough to get downstairs to the TV yeah

407
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,040
that makes sense I'm still curious though for some reason like I like to know I don't

408
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,720
know I just kind of want to get a sense of what the performance would be like under Linux

409
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,920
yeah well I'm gonna go ahead I will compare that I've got two systems that are identical

410
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:46,400
ones so they're running the same OS they've got the same hardware same drives runs running

411
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:54,840
on LVM with XFS over the top and this one's now got ZFS and I will do some sort of finger

412
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,160
in the air kind of benchmarks but performance isn't my main requirement it's really yeah

413
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,920
about date data quality is really what it's about and that totally that totally does make

414
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,100
sense and that's I mean that's why we use it on our NAS here Kitson is it I don't think

415
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,160
it's it is fair to say that ZFS has no more legal concerns necessarily where do you get

416
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:22,520
that well the Debian team seemed to have analyzed it and if it is good enough for Debian shouldn't

417
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:27,800
it be good enough for open Susie or fedora I'm wondering how how how did they come to

418
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:32,680
this conclusion so it appears to me that they got a consultation from either the free software

419
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:38,880
conservancy or the I'm not actually I don't remember actually who they got their cons

420
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,960
I remember talking about the story now but I'm trying to remember who they got the details

421
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:49,340
on but if I recall it essentially sounds like Debian as a project might be able to license

422
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:54,840
it or something is kind of what I was gathering not so much that the legal status has changed

423
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,680
yeah here it is I'm pulling up the article on Phronix right now as we talk about it here

424
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,520
it is he says Neil McGovern he was he's elected as a Debian project leader and as the former

425
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,120
project leader was stepping out he posted his final remarks and his formal formal project

426
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,640
leader was Lucas his final management he said we received legal advice from the software

427
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,700
freedom law center there it is the software freedom law center about the inclusion of

428
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,600
lib DVD CSS so that's the DVD decryption stuff because oh we're all clamping at the bit for

429
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:25,560
that still and our champ what is that what is that chomping at the bit or and then of

430
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,600
course ZFS and Debian which should unblock the situation of both cases and enables to

431
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:36,080
ship them in Debian soon we've received legal advice about the inclusion they say that's

432
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:42,000
pretty ambiguous I don't know what the hell that means well I think at some basic level

433
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,200
it indicates that rather than just looking at it strictly from an engineering point of

434
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,400
view or a software point of view they actually got a hold of someone that has studied law

435
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,680
and at some some inherent level and has actually looked at it from can you know what is the

436
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,760
likelihood of a successful lawsuit on this that's that's what exactly what it sounds

437
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,640
like to me and it sounds like it's a copyright aggregation agreement with the software freedom

438
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,360
Conservancy that's where I got software freedom Conservancy from the Debian project and the

439
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,040
software freedom Conservancy have now now have an agreement that enables Debian contributors

440
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,640
to assign copyright of their works to the Conservancy a couple of the DDs already expressed

441
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,040
interest in some time ago and if you're interested to please get in contact blah blah blah so

442
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,080
that's one thing that came in and I have no idea if that has any relation now to the ZFS

443
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,640
but it sounds like to me man I think it sounds like to you Debian seeked out some legal advice

444
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,000
specifically for the project themselves and got the legal advice that they could include

445
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,800
ZFS not ZFS was legal for Linux to use license wise across the board right I think that's

446
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,600
exactly it yeah yeah Darrell did you know did you have something you want to add about

447
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,960
the license yeah just looking at the perspective that the GPL still complies with the BSD license

448
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,360
there's no technical reason to like legally speaking that is by in violation of the BSD

449
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,920
license in that case so the common scenario in warring is mostly related to shipping by

450
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,680
default with it and also how to make GPL not contaminate the BSD code so to do that you

451
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,200
kind of have to make an exception while releasing the software on your GPL license so I'm guessing

452
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:24,320
that these that you just mentioned and this is me guessing is the assigning to this institution

453
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:31,720
allows that institution to make that grant right ability to ship with that code without

454
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:36,640
GPL contaminating that code if that makes sense that does make sense it's well it makes

455
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,760
as much sense as I think it's gonna make sense to me which is good enough so and then I know

456
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,400
a lot of you out there they're listening right now are smashing your heads against the keyboard

457
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,200
saying guys guys guys oh yeah right ZFS is not BSD license yes I know I know a lot of

458
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,040
you out there smashing against the keyboard saying guys I've been using ZFS on Linux for

459
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,560
years Jed for example which we'll have an interview in one of our shows soon is using

460
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,600
in large-scale production well I'll talk more about Jed in a little bit right ZFS was created

461
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:11,160
by son it's a the CD DL or whatever the hell that is I know you're using it so I'd like

462
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,880
to hear it but if you could do a post for me so that way we could get a discussion going

463
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,100
on the Linux action show subreddit that would be extremely valuable if you've got a really

464
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,260
awesome setup I wouldn't mind I could I mean I know this is asking for a lot but like a

465
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,320
diagram or something like that you could post it over there just so we could take a look

466
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:32,040
at it it's Linux action show dot reddit calm I'd like to talk more about it just because

467
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,640
it's something that we're gonna have to tackle here in production I think it's something

468
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,480
we're gonna have to face at JP so basically it's a necessity it's about to come about

469
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,300
you're gonna have to basically do what I feel like I feel like I have just a little bit

470
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,980
of time to before I have to tackle it so I'd like to really I just like to give what people

471
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,280
have to say yeah oh and this would allow you to benefit from other people's experiences

472
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,480
their successes and their failures hey we've got a we've got a lot more coming up including

473
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,640
the Intel middleboard guy which is a fascinating conversation but first I want to tell you

474
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:05,480
about our second sponsor and that's Ting go over to Linux dot ting dot com why Linux

475
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,000
dot ting dot com well I mean what are you gonna put Windows dot ting dot com in your

476
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,680
browser I don't why would you ask me a silly question like that oh no I Linux dot ting

477
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,780
dot com it supports this show and it's gonna get you twenty five dollars off your first

478
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,320
device and if you already have a ting compatible device and you probably do well then they'll

479
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,720
give you twenty five dollars in service card that paid for more than my first month my

480
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:31,200
first month of what ting what is ting oh well I'm glad you asked ting is truly finally mobile

481
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,720
that makes sense and nobody can beat them people others have tried there you got people

482
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,600
to think they're the uncare here and as long as you wear a pink shirt and a leather jacket

483
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,840
that's all you need to sell phones apparently and then other people think that they can

484
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:46,120
just roll into the wireless industry but yet still fail to understand that people don't

485
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:51,940
want to have to pay per device I got too many devices see if you keep making all these cool

486
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,640
things I'm gonna buy them like tablets and watches and phones and multiple phones I got

487
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,800
too many phones and I'm not gonna pay for data and a contract for every single stinking

488
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,720
device I'm not crazy so I switched to ting I go to Linux dot ting dot com no contract

489
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,840
no early termination fee yeah no contract you only pay for what you use it's a flat

490
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,960
six dollars for the line six bucks so I've got three phones I pay six dollars no that

491
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,920
crazy SOP he's got like five or six phones on there you know and if you're a small business

492
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,720
you've got more than ten lines it's seriously a no-brainer because it's only six dollars

493
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,640
and then you just pay for your usage well I'm on Wi-Fi all the time so no bigs I hardly

494
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,260
have any data usage and I hardly have any minutes used up so for three lines I'm paying

495
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:36,560
like forty dollars a month it's absolutely outrageous they just take your minutes your

496
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,020
messages and your megabytes they add them up and that's what you pay and then it's really

497
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,080
as simple as that if you have any questions you ever get stuck you call one eight five

498
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,680
five ting FTW and a real human being answers the phone I've never needed to do that though

499
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,200
why because their dashboard freakin rocks nobody has anything on the ting dashboard

500
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,240
you can do everything you need including disabling devices transferring devices activating a

501
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:04,240
device setting up alerts all these kinds of features it's really nice because if you don't

502
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,960
need a device for a little bit you can just turn it off that's really great like if you

503
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,280
go get one of those my fi access points if you don't need it for a little bit just turn

504
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,040
it off and you can do it right there in the ting dashboard go to linux.ting.com you get

505
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,840
a $25 discount if you have a GSM or CDMA compatible device that works on ting because they take

506
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,560
both now they'll give you a $25 service credit and that's pretty awesome because that paid

507
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,520
for more than my first month and I got a couple of devices you might want to check out they've

508
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,820
have a whole range but I just picked a couple out here first one is this I just I can't

509
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,800
believe they're gonna I figure this is gonna go fast but if you go to linux.ting.com you

510
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:47,960
can get an unlocked Moto G for $91 ooh that's that's an amazing Android phone it's like

511
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:53,160
one of the it's I think it's running that Android 4.4 later and it's a well-built phone

512
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:59,200
people really like the Moto G it's very well reviewed $91 no contract pay for what you

513
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,200
use that's you own that right there that's not the contract price that $91 is you own

514
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,840
it that's just a crazy outrageous great deal you can also get the ting GSM SIM card and

515
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:12,680
put it anything that takes a GSM SIM for $9 and then it's just $6 after that I'll go check

516
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,520
out all the great devices they got everything from a $47 feature phone all the way up to

517
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,580
the Nexus 6 they got it all and on their blog they also have tips like saving battery and

518
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:28,900
Android 5.0 very very helpful well I'll tell you when it comes to saving battery stuff

519
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,700
anytime I can get tips on that means I have an opportunity not to deal with that I mean

520
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:38,840
that's a beautiful thing all right go over to linux.ting.com check them out and if you

521
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,120
have any questions give them a call 1-855-TING-FTW I've been using them for I'm going over like

522
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,760
I'm thinking like two years about two years and two months in two years and three months

523
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,880
in or so so I'm about $2,200 in on my total savings by switching to Ting yeah $2,200 so

524
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,640
go check out much you would save click that savings calculator linux.ting.com click that

525
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:03,800
savings calculator thank you very much Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged all right guys

526
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:10,360
so I want to get into this Intel Minnow interview it's very interesting because I think we get

527
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:15,780
very excited because the Raspberry Pi is very affordable we get very excited because there's

528
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:19,480
a lot going on in that space with ARM processors there's a lot of different boards to choose

529
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:27,200
from it's not just the Raspberry Pi I'm gonna admit though the comfort of x86 is appealing

530
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,080
to me in this space if I could get that same form factor and that same power savings but

531
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:36,240
run my x86 stuff that appeals to me so when John sat down from Intel to talk about the

532
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,080
Minnow board I was excited to see what they have and what he thought the reason was that

533
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,000
not a lot of people are talking about them compared to all of the other ARM based projects

534
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,840
out there and so we have John here and John you said you're at the Minnow board project

535
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:56,880
yeah I'm with the Minnow board project Minnow board's an open hardware platform that's being

536
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,760
jointly done between Intel and some industry partners to kind of put an Intel face into

537
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,560
the embedded world we've got I mean if you look at the embedded world and everything

538
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:14,040
it's dominated by ARM and you know from the Intel perspective we don't exactly make it

539
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,920
easy to work with us I mean if you're gonna buy like a million chips from us we help you

540
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,800
out all over the place but we don't really have or we haven't had a lot of really good

541
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,000
open hardware platforms that people can just kind of pick up with and tinker and thus was

542
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,520
born the Minnow board project so one of the things that I really know I really liked was

543
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:36,200
I was at LinuxCon two years ago and you guys had a Minnow board demo and they gave everyone

544
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,800
a Minnow board and let us actually set the whole thing like unbox it play with it and

545
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,280
we got to make LEDs flash and here's the thing is it sad that like this is the difference

546
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,680
between between and I'm gonna go there I'm gonna say the difference between a traditional

547
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,520
Mac users and traditional Linux users and that is that that most most people that that

548
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,320
that appeal to that Apple ecosystem want just something handed to them into work and I got

549
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,480
this Minnow board and I was like blown away I'm like I could hook this up to my freaking

550
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,240
garage door SSH into my garage door when I get home yeah like that makes no sense to

551
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:10,320
most Mac users because they would say well that that's silly why would you just not want

552
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,840
to push the button and then the garage door will open I'm like but it's much cooler to

553
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,820
do it over SSH and that's something that you guys you know you guys really nailed and that

554
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,520
that was hands down my favorite exhibit that year nice yeah actually we're giving away

555
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,960
I we gave some of these away at ELC but we're giving them away here we've got these little

556
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:32,400
proto boards called the tadpole and they they've just got a little RGB LED on them that you

557
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,160
know on the Minnow board if you hook it up it just you know you can twiddle an RGB LED

558
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:41,060
from GPIO and that's really cool yeah and so we're giving those away here and we're

559
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:46,880
just we're trying to make the embedded world a little more approachable I mean we can run

560
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,280
stock Linux distributions on the Minnow board yeah so I mean what's the price range on the

561
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,560
Minnow board is that is how competitive are they there so we're a little bit more expensive

562
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:59,320
we're a hundred and forty nine dollars for a dual core with two gigs of RAM dual core

563
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:07,880
x86 x64 bit x86 and you're also getting Intel HD graphics gigabit Ethernet USB 3.0 yeah

564
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:13,600
I mean we've got we've got a lot of the same kind of low-speed IO that similar boards in

565
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,960
the market have yeah but what we're really bringing to the table on top of just the x86

566
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,720
story is we've got all the high-speed IO that you would expect yeah from our kind I could

567
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,080
actually use that in a production environment with that kind of like I mean gigabit Ethernet

568
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,560
for me has always just sort of been the biggest pain point on a lot of these boards because

569
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,120
we're doing such with such large data sets and things like that that the hundred megabit

570
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:39,080
limitation is a killer for us oh yeah and the fact that x86 being x86 based means I

571
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:42,240
can take advantage of all of the tools we're already using in-house that are built for

572
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,380
x86 oh yeah no I mean I'm fundamentally running the exact same operating system on my laptop

573
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:54,640
as I am on an embedded platform now I mean admittedly that's not the way most people

574
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:59,440
think of as an embedded platform but as CPUs are getting bigger and more powerful in the

575
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,400
embedded space these really are becoming the PCs that were around you know yeah even five

576
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:10,160
years ago yeah yeah it's kind of remarkable and I think of like computers for our kids

577
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,480
now and things like that and giving them something they can tinker with something that's a little

578
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,840
lower cost but also still very capable so that way they have a good experience and systems

579
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,880
like this are perfect they really fit into that and as computers are becoming more sealed

580
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:26,340
up and more consumer grade it's so nice to see this this area sort of opening up again

581
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:30,920
for people that might want to start learning and tinkering again oh yeah well I mean you

582
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:35,520
nailed it when you said that you know PCs and everything are getting more sealed up

583
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:41,200
you don't have access to even a you know simple GPIO on your laptop there's no room for it

584
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,760
I mean the best you're getting is USB right which don't get me wrong USB is fantastic

585
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:51,080
but just making an LED blink from an operating system or even from you know just a controller

586
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,680
so cool yeah yeah it feels like the operating system sitting right on top of the hardware

587
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,360
it's just right there now what am I you said you're giving some of these minnow boards

588
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,680
away we're not giving the minnow boards away here we're giving the tadpole which is tadpole

589
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,320
which is just like I said it's a just a like an RGB LED and it's very small proto space

590
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,880
actually if you go out to minnowboard.org there's a link on the front talking about

591
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,480
the tadpole it'll take you to our wiki and it's got the build instructions right there

592
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,320
and you can see the finished item so what do you think about this trend I'm seeing like

593
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,840
everybody a lot of ARM compute sticks they're like you know the entire computer on an HDMI

594
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,520
stick I see and I think I saw something from Intel in this regard but this seems to be

595
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:32,320
an area that's really really just taking off what do you think about these in comparison

596
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,160
to sort of the more traditional boards and stuff like that so the the the compute stick

597
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:42,120
kind of things I mean you're probably talking about the the I'm gonna forget its name but

598
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:47,640
Intel just yeah really or it is releasing one and right there's been some press about

599
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:53,520
it in the last couple of days right and the really great at least the article that I was

600
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,700
reading last night they really hit the nail on the head with that one which was it's great

601
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:03,320
for just giving you an intermediate step to just plug into your TV it's a little bit more

602
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,120
powerful than what you'd expect out of you know like a Chromecast or something else that

603
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:13,480
you would plug in but it's not quite a full PC so it's just another sealed up sort of

604
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,680
consumer device that maybe has its purpose but it's not it's sort of limited in its full

605
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,480
scope yep yeah well so if people want to learn more about this kind of stuff would be like

606
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,560
some good resources they could go check out if they're watching at home or something so

607
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,960
for the middle board go to minnowboard.org there's a link right at the top for our wiki

608
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,400
and that's got all of our tech specs for the small board computers in general I mean they're

609
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,600
all over the place just do a quick Google search and yeah if I could remember the name

610
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:46,040
of the little Intel stick but I know I talked about it like a week or a week or so ago on

611
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,080
the news and it's a pretty neat little device and the one that ships with Linux would look

612
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:54,120
pretty good yeah I could see it likely working even as a receptionist computer hooked up

613
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:57,920
to a monitor or you know somebody that just needs a basic web browser hooked up to just

614
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,120
an LCD screen and a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse in their home yep and that's kind of

615
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,360
exciting yeah so I but I find more of the board stuff more fascinating for my for my

616
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,840
you know tinkering kind of nature yeah no I mean you're definitely not going to tinker

617
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:13,240
with you know some of these things that are just plugging in the HDMI ports and I might

618
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,440
watch a YouTube video on it but that's probably about it well thanks for stopping by it was

619
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,280
great chat with you and so do you are you a free agent roaming or do you guys have a

620
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:24,620
booth no we've got a booth here and I've got a talk this afternoon where I'm gonna network

621
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:30,980
boot a computer over the Internet awesome really so I'm over there well I open that

622
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:36,960
connection is gonna work I was gonna say I am taunting the demo gods on that one let

623
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:43,080
me let me just let me assure you this is the week to try something crazy at the last possible

624
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:50,480
moment and it will succeed so far yeah I was gonna say it's been lucky yeah it's been well

625
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:57,280
see it's network booting a computer off of a server in California will be I've done it

626
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,400
to England before and that one did not go well oh really it's always trickier when you

627
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:07,000
had a conference too yeah conference Internet is always special that's and of course with

628
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,760
my laptop I've like I had to bring my USB ether after gotta be wired oh yeah that seems

629
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:20,080
to solve a lot of yeah no I'll be a VM on stage yeah over Wi-Fi tomorrow we've got a

630
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,720
talk on the middle board as an open hardware platform cool I'm really glad to hear that

631
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,920
you guys are pushing that area so it's really cool to hear you're talking about it and getting

632
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,840
the word out because I think there's a little late to the game I don't like the games right

633
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:38,120
word but at least in terms of knowledge share it seems you know and so I think it's pretty

634
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,760
compelling especially for Linux users because it's just slam it right on there and you're

635
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,520
good to go and you know full-fledged Linux box yep well thank you sir no thank you chatting

636
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,400
with you good luck and have good luck with talking enjoy the rest of no thank you I wonder

637
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,560
if anybody in the Mamba room has any experience with any of these Intel mini boards I know

638
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:59,800
Noah picked one up is anybody the Mamba room experience with any of these like x86 small

639
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,360
boards from Intel that look like they might be interesting the only place I've seen it

640
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:08,480
was in conferences maybe I should get one and see what they can do might be kind of

641
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,560
fun yeah could be kind of a fun toy to play with and it could be who knows who knows what

642
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:20,560
we could discover all right well we've got an interview with the guy who who was sort

643
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:26,720
of core at getting the that variant of wine that made it possible to get Netflix to play

644
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:30,720
under Linux you remember before we got the HTML 5 playback under Linux there was that

645
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,920
stopgap where you could do like this funky way to get a Silverlight environment and do

646
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,880
all this stuff and get like the next the Netflix desktop PPA and remember all this Matt pipe

647
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,520
lighter pipe pipe there's several there were several iterations of it and it turns out

648
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:50,720
that behind the scenes it was pretty heated what was going on and it turns out also that

649
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:58,160
Silverlight is a huge piece of garbage and that one of the reasons that we got HTML 5

650
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,160
native streaming of Netflix is because the project that was getting this to work was

651
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:08,280
discovering fundamental flaws in Silverlight that they believe Microsoft never wanted to

652
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,480
see the day of light so I'll play that interview now so tell me where Netflix was a couple

653
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:20,000
years ago and how you felt about it well so a couple years ago we didn't have Netflix

654
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:26,120
at all on Linux except through VMs and yeah it's very true the one of the big problems

655
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:32,440
with that of course is the performance issues and for me actually at the time I was doing

656
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,560
a little bit of playing around with it but the thing that really drove me to trying to

657
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:41,440
get Netflix working on Linux was that I was really pissed off at the administration at

658
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,680
my university I was trying to get my PhD at the time and I just needed a break so that

659
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:55,600
I wouldn't want to murder them and so I just kind of sat down for a week and started trying

660
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:02,120
to diagnose how Silverlight worked and was just kind of poking around at the things that

661
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:06,920
it did on on the system and discovering all sorts of really crazy stuff that they did

662
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:16,480
that I probably shouldn't talk about because yeah it would tell you how to get the raw

663
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,940
video data right that doesn't surprise me and wouldn't that be a heyday yeah so for

664
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:25,160
obvious reasons I was not trying to get the raw video data from the Netflix feeds I was

665
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,800
trying to get it to work properly on Linux so that I could give the community something

666
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,560
and not have Microsoft breathing down everyone's throats and want somebody's head right exactly

667
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:41,940
so the thing that was really challenging with that is that they've put a lot of stuff into

668
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:47,260
it to try and detect anything that you could possibly be doing I bet to see what it's up

669
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:51,040
to and so there's all sorts of things that it's doing in the background that actually

670
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:55,140
have nothing to do with the video feed really like it's just trying to like figure out like

671
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,600
like whether or not you're trying to interfere with it so there's some things example something

672
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:04,200
I check for well so like one of the things that it does is that it has in the background

673
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:09,280
the debug helper running and part of that is for reporting problems that happen with

674
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,480
the software okay but part of it is that if that process dies which happens when you try

675
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:21,520
to attach a debugger then the rest of it shuts down and so even if you didn't start it running

676
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,920
a debugger if you attach one later then it knows and says oh you know it's time for me

677
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:33,120
to say goodbye to you going on here I'm not even gonna risk it yeah exactly and so you

678
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,920
know who knows how Microsoft actually debugs their own software in that case but I'm sure

679
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,200
that they have some sort of maybe they don't that would explain a few things it would it

680
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,320
would explain a few things especially some of the weird video acceleration stuff that

681
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:49,080
yeah that Silverlight does it it uses some really old API's and and one of the things

682
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:56,720
is just crazy to me is that the the key that they use for all the drivers is a 1024 bit

683
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:02,760
key so like so not the driver key the driver key is better but the master key they used

684
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,880
to sign all of the drivers is like a really ridiculously small so what would be the point

685
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,960
of that like well they made the key in like the 2000s yeah and they never updated it

686
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,400
and it's actually the same key that they're using for OPM now so the the cop the old system

687
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,040
uses the same key now for OPM because it needs to be backwards compatible right and so like

688
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:30,280
hmm it wouldn't really take all of that much time on a supercomputer figure out there's

689
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:37,400
a whole bunch of them to be honest but like it's it's kind of ridiculous like some of

690
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:44,200
the so you may be aware that we actually kind of created a project for staging wine changes

691
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,120
as a result of some of that work that I wasn't sure if it was there as a result but I noticed

692
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:53,600
it kind of happened yeah so that was before he goes on into the to the wine stuff I thought

693
00:55:53,600 --> 00:56:00,840
it was his comment there he's basically saying look there is this crazy soft spot right here

694
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:05,160
in Silverlight that you could take advantage of if you if you knew where to poke if you

695
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:11,880
rented oh I don't know some GPUs on a server somewhere and on up an Amazon you might be

696
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,920
able to start working on this you might be able to crack it he I think I think that guy

697
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,360
knows some major secrets and if it turns out EB in the chat room was playing Call of Duty

698
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:26,440
with him that night didn't even know and that guy's wife kicked EB's butt in Call of Duty

699
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,760
so he's a hell of a Call of Duty player apparently as well I want to get into he gets into how

700
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:35,000
they've made how they sort of changed the wine project and how eventually it sort of

701
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:40,720
cascaded into Netflix getting a native HTML5 playback and the changes that needed to make

702
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,440
to the HTML5 spec before we do that though I'll mention a DigitalOcean our last sponsor

703
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,080
of this week's show DigitalOcean is really making the show possible I tell you what not

704
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:54,000
only from their support by supporting Linux Unplugged and by you for us out there by using

705
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,080
our promo codes but the technology now just to synchronize these edits that I made all

706
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:05,100
happening now under Linux all being synced through own cloud droplets that are powered

707
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:10,720
up on DigitalOcean it's so slick to have the complete workflow from beginning to end for

708
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:15,440
this entire Linux Fest all done under Linux these interviews that you're playing that

709
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,740
I'm playing back right now that you're watching these are edited well I should back up so

710
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:23,720
first they're recorded on a Linux rig then they're synced up to a DigitalOcean droplet

711
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:28,440
for offline storage we had a hundred megabit upload at Linux Fest Northwest they rocked

712
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,320
us with a great connection and so we were able to send footage up to our droplet in

713
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:37,760
near real time store it off-site which is brilliant because we're shipping that rig

714
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,560
back to Grand Forks North Dakota so Noah could continue to work on it so we wanted to get

715
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,620
all the footage off it and safe immediately we took advantage of that hundred megabit

716
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:48,540
connection and of course our DigitalOcean droplets rocking fast so we sent all the footage

717
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:52,600
up to the DigitalOcean droplet almost as it was done we just delayed a little bit because

718
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,080
we weren't in any rush and we didn't need to consume a ton of bandwidth it goes up there

719
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:01,840
it then sinks back down to my primary workstation here at the studio that runs Arch I've got

720
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,000
Lightworks and Avid Mux ready to go on that thing I bring all of that footage in I had

721
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,360
to remux all of the footage into a new container which don't worry what that means but I was

722
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,920
able to do that very quickly because it was already sitting on my file system when I sat

723
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,640
down I saved the final encoded versions to another folder in own cloud which then sunk

724
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:22,160
to my bonobo and I'm playing them back here I never once had to sneak in at any files

725
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:26,440
I never lost any data it was always backed up to my DigitalOcean droplet and the entire

726
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:31,560
workflow all happened using open source free software and DigitalOcean was the back-end

727
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:35,720
engine that makes it all possible and when you go over to DigitalOcean and you use our

728
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:41,280
promo code DOUNPLUGS you'll get a $10 credit go see what you can do for free for two months

729
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,940
with a $5 rig I'm doing this with a $5 rig seriously it's amazing what you can do up

730
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:51,100
at DigitalOcean they're a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive

and easy way for you to spin up your own cloud server you can get started in less than 55

732
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:00,520
seconds and the pricing is nuts it starts at only $5 a month it'll get you 512 megabytes

733
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:05,600
of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD one CPU and a terabyte of transfer and that's a great thing because

734
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,760
that means I'm never worrying about this all of these data all these huge files are moving

735
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,800
around we're not going to break a terabyte with this stuff because we're recording them

736
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:19,240
in a very high resolution very high bitrate x264 file they're large but they're not that

737
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,080
large and I never have to worry about it with that terabyte of transfer it's so nice to

738
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,880
have that peace of mind and for $5 a month it's totally nuts and if you use the promo

739
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,800
code DOUNPLUGS then you get the $10 credit oh my gosh for two months and you get it for

740
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,500
free I mean it's a great deal it's super powerful it could probably really fundamentally

741
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,420
change the way you work it's changed and improved the way I work I feel like digital ocean is

742
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,200
my data center infrastructure on demand they have data centers in New York San Francisco

743
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:49,820
Singapore Amsterdam Germany and London and their interface is so impressive I love that

744
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:53,760
aspect of it because it doesn't mean we waste a lot of time tinkering with stuff we get

745
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,280
in we set it up we're done and it's very intuitive so I know anyone on the team can manage it

746
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:03,180
no problem and the best part is they have an API that lets me take it even further if

747
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,800
we ever want to automate some of this stuff and I hear from people in the audience that

748
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,720
do it all the time and there's tons of great apps created by the community to take advantage

749
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:16,120
of that API that control panel is really the icing on top of the entire stack it all starts

750
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:20,640
with Linux and KVM virtualization which is a great virtualizer I think KVM is the best

751
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:25,160
they use SSD so that way you get super high IO that's awesome because then they have it

752
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,700
connected to tier one bandwidth at the best data centers in the world and the entire package

753
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:34,560
is then managed with this then they have some of the best communities on tutorials on the

754
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:39,720
internet between arch and digital ocean like some of the best documentation on the internet

755
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:45,320
is being created it's really good stuff go over to digital ocean dot com use the promo

756
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,920
code do unplugged that keeps digital that keeps Linux unplugged on the on the air because

757
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,360
it tells digital ocean hey I heard about it on Linux unplugged so you get the $10 credit

758
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,760
which means you don't have to have a credit card to try out digital ocean and you support

759
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:02,560
this show you keep us going when you use the promo code do unplugged go try them out if

760
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,480
from anything from developing an application to your back end infrastructure digital ocean

761
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:11,840
can handle it trust me I've done it digital ocean dot com you guys no matter what load

762
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:17,520
I put it under have never disappointed me digital ocean do unplugged alright so let's

763
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:21,280
go back to our interview and I want to hear a little bit more about how these changes

764
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,760
impacted the wine project kind of a result of that stuff and that some of those changes

765
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,200
weren't something that AJ wanted to bring into main wine and so what we said is okay

766
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,320
well what if we set up this thing where we can kind of make these things better so that

767
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:41,020
then eventually they can be included and part of that exploration we started going around

768
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:44,960
and trying to ask the driver manufacturers okay is there something that you can do for

769
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,520
us that then we can support some of these more advanced features in Silverlight and

770
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:56,800
integrate that into the driver right and the answers to that were very interesting mostly

771
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,520
in the form of like no comment things but we got somebody off of the record to tell

772
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:06,160
us oh well there's actually an agreement you sign when you create these drivers that Microsoft

773
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:12,720
signs off on that you will not make it work on other operating systems what yeah so apparently

774
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,520
so like the reason that you can't have the HD video through even what we've done and

775
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:22,600
that's all shrouded in NDAs I'm sure right yeah is that we can't make the cop work on

776
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:27,520
Linux because we can't access the part of the driver we would need to access to do that

777
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:34,680
legally and so we would have to give you a substitute of what the driver has to do which

778
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:42,040
involves you having a driver key which you can actually get a hold of if you try but

779
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,760
then it becomes you know kind of like the issue with DVDs and that kind of thing like

780
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:50,720
then you're distributing one of these numbers that's supposedly a special number yeah special

781
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,440
legal privileges yeah and so there's like all of this stuff around that and you know

782
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,000
a lot of the people that are on our farms like oh well we just want to be able to watch

783
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,240
our HD videos it's like no I'm sorry we have the stuff we just can't give it to you like

784
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:09,100
if we did then Microsoft would kill us yeah yeah that's a really interesting thing to

785
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:13,120
sort of pull the rug or pull the carpet or carpet what is it the curtain pull the curtain

786
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:18,040
back and realize there's there's a lot going on here that you never even realize as somebody

787
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:20,880
that just sits back and watches the Netflix thing to think you always think it's these

788
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,960
technical hurdles or things like that and it's like no here's the exact spot and if

789
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:27,840
we could just get access to that but there's this legal barrier that prevents it that seems

790
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:33,260
like that's only gonna stick for so long until eventually somebody somewhere decides they're

791
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:36,160
not scared by that well so one of the things with that and actually one of the reasons

792
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:41,880
we haven't put a lot of effort into that recently is that the inclusion of the HTML 5 stuff

793
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:46,320
in Chrome that allows you to watch it in Chrome and the DRM stuff extensions or whatever one

794
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:49,160
of the things that we kind of heard through the grapevine is that the reason that that

795
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:53,640
exists is that we got things working through Silverlight and they know that there's problems

796
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:57,160
with Silverlight and so they wanted to take the pressure off they wanted to take the pressure

797
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,740
off that somebody might go in and it's like all things right like it solves a few other

798
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:07,320
problems for them as well so it's like that you can't deny the timing of it all oh yeah

799
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:11,860
it does seem like it lines up yeah so that was one of the things we you know we're poking

800
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:15,880
around some of our driver friends and being like it does this have something to do with

801
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:20,120
us and they're like yes this has something to do with you like whoa somebody noticed

802
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:23,680
they're paying attention yeah did you have that moment like oh they are watching well

803
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:30,760
I mean we've always tried to be very careful with the information that we give out we want

804
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:35,800
it to be something that like they don't shut down so yeah like you're always from the onset

805
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,280
kind of aware that they're probably gonna find out right yeah because I mean it's a

806
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:45,560
big deal for them and for the movie industry if that system were to break yes and so it

807
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,920
was something that we were always very cognizant of it kind of seems like they got lucky then

808
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,360
in a way because I think they got lucky that somebody was even cognizant of it because

809
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:59,520
other people would have just been focused more on the free the movies yeah and they

810
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:02,840
would have gotten in trouble it wouldn't have worked long term and it probably wouldn't

811
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:08,140
have sort of encouraged the kind of larger scale change that brought the you know more

812
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:12,520
native playback using HTML5 extensions I mean if that if the group had gone about if your

813
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,680
group had gone about if you've gone about the wrong way it could have blown it well

814
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:20,440
yeah and that that was really a big concern initially was that even though we had done

815
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:24,080
all the right things it's still a question of yeah like even doing all the right things

816
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:28,720
yeah you can still get in big trouble right and so you know one of the things you know

817
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,520
now that I have a PhD it's actually a little bit harder because you know it's like I'm

818
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:39,040
a researcher like I I can disclose all sorts of stuff and that's amazing yeah and so but

819
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:43,240
you know what when you do that what you want is for the community to have that that capability

820
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,680
and not for them to take it away because at any time they could just change the system

821
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:50,880
and take it away and and that's not what you want them to do right yeah because then it

822
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:55,520
kind of means you only bought yourself time really right yeah and then they catch up yeah

823
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,440
and so what's the point but I mean now that you know kind of Silverlight is headed out

824
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,400
the door and you know it's pretty much only used in Europe now for for that kind of stuff

825
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,840
yeah like apparently the Amazon service still uses it in Europe even though like they have

826
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:12,840
HTML5 here in the US and I know some sports events still use it but yeah I mean even Microsoft

827
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:17,560
themselves seem to be pulling back from Silverlight yeah so but like I was actually on a plane

828
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,160
the other day and they use Silverlight for the video streaming and I was like you know

829
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:25,000
I wonder if I can get it to run on my laptop and it's like oh sure enough yeah really yeah

830
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:32,160
I think it was on Southwest really and how did you get it well I mean I just downloaded

831
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:38,320
the oh the whole Silverlight file yeah oh so it's their web interface yeah so and so

832
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:42,320
I was able to watch you know the movies on the plane because yeah the Silverlight was

833
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:46,560
working properly at least as far as you know I can tell that's so funny but yeah I think

834
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:51,000
I think they they Microsoft made a bold bet and they tried to make they wanted to make

835
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,960
I think they wanted to make Silverlight an entire runtime environment oh yeah they definitely

836
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,320
did yeah it was and it's really clear in the way that it's architected that yeah it was

837
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,560
going to be their dot net for the internet right and it just you know the world did not

838
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:08,280
want another plug-in based thing no they were moved past it well and all the security issues

839
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:12,200
involved with it I think people were kind of done with it because Microsoft wasn't you

840
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:15,480
know they weren't in the same position they are now and it wasn't it was like oh it's

841
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:19,400
a it's a flash competitor it's Microsoft version they're trying to come in and they just people

842
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:23,520
were not receptive to it so it was a big like that that whole thing that seems like you

843
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,800
know over the history of our show watching all that Netflix stuff unravel just getting

844
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:31,000
to the point where yes it is now possible to get Netflix working yeah it's a huge it

845
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:35,960
was it was a huge step forward yeah you know it's like that and Steam are the like almost

846
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:39,800
in the entire history of Linux are like the two biggest desktop yeah right that if two

847
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,280
of that just hit and it's like wow I can't believe I'm doing this on Linux yeah it still

848
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,840
blows me away when I start Netflix or start Steam yeah and then I still have moments where

849
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:53,040
I'm like wow and then of course there is the there is of course April 24th which was the

850
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:59,840
first day that you know we live streamed from using the OBS software and a last-minute built

851
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:05,320
Linux rig yes that has not crashed once I might add that is very impressive it's believe

852
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:10,320
me when I tell you that this was a last-minute job that like the 11 people talk about the

853
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:16,280
11th hour no we're we are at the 11th hour in the 59th minute like I mean like it is

854
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:22,760
it is we woke up we woke up I came to the studio he hadn't even seen the box which to

855
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:27,460
some degree actually implies a certain amount of trust on your on your end because he came

856
01:08:27,460 --> 01:08:33,720
in he went to bed the night before just assuming that that he was like well I trust you guys

857
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:37,080
I'm sure you'll give me a solution in the morning and to it to my credit we and and

858
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:41,280
Al's credit we had it done and so he walked in and like I was about ready to pack it up

859
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:48,200
and he's like well um could I see it work oh yeah yeah yeah we could do that I suppose

860
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:51,520
so we do that and we I showed him for like 30 seconds and then from that we packed up

861
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:56,280
and that that is essentially what made the decision so it was not it was not it's something

862
01:08:56,280 --> 01:09:00,080
we want to do for a long time yeah right yeah I mean you you're constantly doing that right

863
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:03,360
you're constantly looking you're saying this is what I need to do what projects are out

864
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:08,240
there and we've said it's closed for a long time yeah but you know not fully there exactly

865
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:11,800
yeah yeah really it's kind of a hacked together solution but and the other thing too that

866
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:16,040
I think sometimes gets lost is people think oh Chris isn't aware of OBS Chris is aware

867
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:21,400
no Chris is fully aware of OBS Chris has installed OBS and tried OBS and realized that it was

868
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:25,880
quite there yet and I looked at the publish date for OBS was two days ago so if we had

869
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:30,760
tried it one day earlier it probably wouldn't have worked wow yeah well one of the things

870
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:35,400
that I've seen with a lot of people is that usually for an individual there's one thing

871
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:40,640
yeah there's really just one thing they tell me about it yeah and it's different for everybody

872
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,840
everybody's got their one thing a lot of people with Netflix and sometimes it sometimes it's

873
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,840
this crazy it's this crazy like side thing it's some program you haven't even heard of

874
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,280
but they cannot live without it right and then that makes it all the more difficult

875
01:09:52,280 --> 01:09:55,600
because like for instance I had there was a girl that we are switching to Linux she

876
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:00,720
was she was a college student and she used the what was the Microsoft Zune the Microsoft

877
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:06,400
Zune and they had a media manager for specifically for the zoo which I had never used and to

878
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,000
date I have never met another person that has ever used it right so I don't think it's

879
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,440
real popular I think that iTunes by far and above has the advantage yet she liked the

880
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:19,040
way the Zune thing works and then Microsoft in traditional Microsoft fashion had all of

881
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,720
their stupid WMAs that were all protected that wouldn't convert and play on Linux right

882
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:26,960
and it was just it just it just made my job that all the harder yeah that's actually one

883
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,680
of the things that I think that the wine project is really important I know a lot of community

884
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:36,280
members feel differently about that but man for people that just their one thing is some

885
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:40,720
piece of commercial software that's only available for Windows like that is the only way that

886
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:45,680
we're ever going to get those people to switch yeah yeah and there's it's so great for legacy

887
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:50,220
applications that would never ever be ported there's applications that we use in media

888
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:53,520
production it's like we just need this one program we can do the whole thing under Linux

889
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,360
and and thankfully thanks to wine we're able to do it so I love it is extremely complicated

890
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:04,040
some of them are 3d capture of the desktop compress it to an h.264 signal transmitted

891
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,700
over the network to a receiver and we're doing that under wine you know here's where I come

892
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:11,400
down and what I come down and unlike this I am glad wine exists I like the fact that

893
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:15,200
wine exists I'm even more happy that certain things run better under wine than than under

894
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:21,240
Windows itself but I am saddened that we have to have it I am saddened that that people

895
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:24,560
will only write applications for Windows and thus we need a translation layer to get that

896
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,560
to Linux but I agree that you know that in in in the other thing is when you're moving

897
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,880
people to Linux if you try to just rip the rug out and put a new rug down you're going

898
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:36,360
to fail you have to baby step people into it and part of that processes and this is

899
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:40,440
why I kind of separate from from a lot of a lot of the free and open source guys is

900
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:44,980
let's get everyone on Linux first then we can worry about free open source and then

901
01:11:44,980 --> 01:11:49,480
we can worry about true Libra software but when we try to go from this extreme from proprietary

902
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:53,800
just everything works and it's being controlled from a company all the way to a niche of a

903
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:58,840
niche of a niche of a niche of a niche the experience is so poor and so drastic and in

904
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:05,120
a short amount of time I think it causes problems mm-hmm yeah so I definitely agree I mean I've

905
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,840
seen before a lot of times where people like oh well you know I want my Visual Studio tools

906
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:14,480
and it's like I mean we have Eclipse Eclipse does a lot of the similar stuff but if you've

907
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:19,600
become familiar with the Visual Studio workflow then yeah I mean you're asking for people

908
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:25,000
to make a multiple disruptive steps at the same time yeah yeah that's exactly right multiple

909
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:30,800
disruptive stuff I'm stealing that so I thought that was a fascinating chat with that guy

910
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:37,440
and I never really thought about how closely they had to walk that legal line and if they

911
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:41,880
had blown that whole wine and Netflix thing we might not have ever gotten in the native

912
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:47,480
playback that we have now which for better for worse I guess but yeah that was pretty

913
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:51,240
tight line I guess never really appreciated that well definitely seems like they walked

914
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:55,040
not only a tight line but they were able to do so with restraint and finesse and still

915
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:58,400
get the result that everybody wanted because that's really tough when you're dealing with

916
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:04,580
all that kind of legalese yeah yeah and I agree per the chat rooms request we can fire

917
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:11,640
off a single shot of it is negative in the freedom dimension we can or how about a special

918
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:16,480
we'll do this a value is negative how about that there you go negative there you go chat

919
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:21,760
room based on your request mumble room did you guys anybody you want to throw out that

920
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,520
the one app that finally had to come over before they could switch to Linux on their

921
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:29,920
desktop I thought that was an interesting comment they made where sometimes wine enables

922
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:36,280
that one application and I remember for me it was outlook back in the day oh really yeah

923
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:40,500
I was able to you know because evolution wasn't cutting it for me and I had to have exchange

924
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:46,240
integration for my job so it was outlook oh z3rq7 in the chat room says an MMO yeah that's

925
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:51,300
not surprising which one do you want to say z3 was it wow you know I still use wine to

926
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:57,080
play stow today from time to time so wine wine wine I think has helped a lot of us switch

927
01:13:57,080 --> 01:14:04,320
to Linux with me I wanted to yeah go ahead with me yeah my my last Windows computer was

928
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:10,640
finally ousted when I could run the utilities to configure the scaler and the amplifier

929
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:19,540
in the home cinema at home using using those tools under wine and USB to serial port adapter

930
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:24,000
in order to configure that stuff and that was when I finally kicked the last remaining

931
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:30,520
Windows computer into touch yeah it wow is the threes yeah yeah you know it's funny wimpy

932
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,640
there are things like there are little things like that like like I had a little device

933
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,360
that I required Windows to do firmware updates for a while when I finally got rid of that

934
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:42,000
device and I was like I don't need that anymore it's just slowly check things off the list

935
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,840
and it was all years ago now so we have a show on the Jupiter broadcasting network called

936
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,440
women's tech radio and one of the hosts on there should her name is Paige and she sat

937
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,760
down quite a bit on the live stream had a lot of really interesting stuff she works

938
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:59,640
heavily in open source development she talked a lot about doing angel development for small

939
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,280
projects that need angel development of angel funding although angel development she talked

940
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:07,300
about all of those things but her and Noah I grabbed a little bit from a conversation

941
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,400
on the stream that her Noah had that I thought was particularly interesting because I've

942
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:16,360
never really thought about it being a white male I never really had to but Paige mentions

943
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:20,360
and Noah kind of talks about it they're both coming from a minority standpoint about how

944
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:27,320
a minority has a bigger chance to make a huge impact in open source than they do when dealing

945
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:30,840
with commercial software development and they talk a little bit about that and it's it's

946
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:36,480
pretty powerful stuff by that stuff but the nice thing about open source is it doesn't

947
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:40,520
necessarily have to be a core member of the group that can do something like that if if

948
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,720
if just one person is bothered by it hey listen that's the great thing they can just open

949
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:48,000
it up they can go edit that stuff and they can push those changes and then they can be

950
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,440
accepted right yeah exactly it's one of the things that is so powerful about open source

951
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:56,120
is it has that community component and you know I've been doing kind of some sound bites

952
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:00,800
here at the conference and it's the most common thing that people are saying like oh I'm into

953
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:05,200
Linux and open source even as a woman because of the community and I think that's a great

954
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:09,520
point that you know not to throw stones but like trying to get involved as a woman in

955
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:14,720
the.NET community was painful like they're just it's very much an older crowd it's a

956
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:18,960
lot of dudes and those and it's very much that that culture of what I know is what I'm

957
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:24,080
worth so they don't want to share and never mind share with a girl like it really is it's

958
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,480
it's unfortunate that it's still there and I'm not saying that all.NET developers like

959
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:32,320
this right but it's the experience you had yeah and that's perfectly valid at the same

960
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:35,900
time like going to a Linux users group they're like you're here you're awesome we don't care

961
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:41,600
who you are that's funny you say that because statistically proprietary software actually

962
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,640
has a better track record of having acceptance of male-female split I don't remember the

963
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,160
numbers off the top of my head but it was something it's open source is notoriously

964
01:16:50,160 --> 01:16:53,920
low for that it is actually it probably does yeah and so and that's something I think we

965
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:58,960
need to work on I think it's because the proprietary software is the more traditional path and

966
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:04,320
I disagree I mean I just I guess I disagree why that is I disagree because I think what

967
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:09,920
it is is that there is a groundwork laid for proprietary vendors so for example they have

968
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:13,680
a code of conduct they have human resources to enforce that stuff and when somebody goes

969
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:17,840
on on the mailing list and says what I need is a such-and-such to do such-and-such while

970
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,000
I'm coding and that would make me code faster and that goes out to a mailing list and offends

971
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,560
a bunch of women they get fired well you but they don't get fired because it's open source

972
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:29,720
not open source but in the enterprise so that's my I think that plays a that's I think plays

973
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:33,560
the biggest role per personal opinion I think that that definitely influences it but like

974
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:40,000
so how would you explain the idea that Ruby Ruby on Rails is there women women who code

975
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,680
in Ruby on Rails is about four percent like developers who identify as women who code

976
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:49,920
in Rails is four percent sure open source but it's also proprietary and I think that

977
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:55,200
part of that answer is that the numbers for women in computer science are still decent

978
01:17:55,200 --> 01:18:00,480
they're not great they are growing sure but so like proprietary software is the path that

979
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,800
you come out of a comp sci degree you generally go into proprietary software you don't usually

980
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:09,880
go into an open source career or into a web dev career like a web dev is more the non-traditional

981
01:18:09,880 --> 01:18:14,760
path my path you know I have a degree in theater like technical theater design it's clearly

982
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:19,640
not a comp sci degree but my non-traditional path wound me up in web dev which is where

983
01:18:19,640 --> 01:18:24,640
a lot of people end up because it's kind of that crafting side of body it's interesting

984
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:28,240
you say that because a lot of the people that I knew that originally went to school for

985
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:35,600
graphic design are now much more sought after for doing design for doing application development

986
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,400
they want those people they want those people with the keen eye and the people like me that

987
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:43,480
were that you know kind of from the old school open it up and do everything and G at it we're

988
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:47,160
not so desired anymore we actually had a an interview about this recently they call those

989
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:51,880
people unicorns you know they're designers who can also be developers yeah yeah we had

990
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:56,400
an interview on that in yeah I was just looking you actually it's been a little while it was

991
01:18:56,400 --> 01:19:01,520
episode 15 unicorns don't exist that was one yeah yeah hey while you have that site pulled

992
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:06,760
up maybe Paige can tell us where so if somebody was interested in women's tech radio what

993
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:09,760
time what day how does that work what does the schedule look like for that comes out

994
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:15,800
Wednesday mornings over Jupiter broadcasting.com all right yeah and it's hosted by Paige and

995
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:20,140
Angela and I was just looking Paige you you actually the interview you were the interviewee

996
01:19:20,140 --> 01:19:24,900
in episode 22 if people want to know more about Paige yeah that's actually the I'm long

997
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:29,640
winded shocker that's a good that's a good problem to have if you're gonna do a podcast

998
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:33,960
it does seem to be so you guys actually just got kind of the back end of my story and the

999
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:37,520
interview is the front end of my story yeah exactly yeah and then 23 just came out this

1000
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,920
week network is your net worth and then which I'm feeling this week episode 21 the importance

1001
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:46,520
of meetups yeah yeah yeah man what a great week for that yeah I would have to say if

1002
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:50,500
there's one thing that we have had as a consistent thing across all of our interviews it's how

1003
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:54,080
important it is to get out there and meet people yeah I know right yeah I noticed that

1004
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:58,760
too it's hard but you know yeah especially as a nerd if you're an introvert yeah and

1005
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:02,360
you can really easily convince yourself that Twitter and Google Plus and Hangouts and Skype

1006
01:20:02,360 --> 01:20:06,600
solve that problem for you yeah and you can kind of just live in that for a while so I

1007
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:12,440
promise I won't judge you for the answer to this question you run medics I do when it's

1008
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:16,840
useful okay yeah I have a I have a question for you too Paige what technology gets you

1009
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:22,120
the most excited right now awesome for me it's I would agree with one of our interviews

1010
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:27,200
from today renewable energy oh yeah yeah I'm all about it about the Tesla home battery

1011
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:32,660
you know I have not I'm a little behind we just had a big project at work so they just

1012
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:37,800
announced it for Earth Day yeah so I love solar specifically I think it's phenomenal

1013
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:43,240
the idea that if we could cover what is something like 15% of the US in solar panels we could

1014
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:48,600
more than exceed our energy needs and that's with current solar technology yeah wow so

1015
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:52,760
I check out page on women's tech radio they come out on Wednesday mornings and they got

1016
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:58,440
some great interviews with some open source developers at Linux fest Northwest this year

1017
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:03,240
they they had some portable recording gear and it makes it a little easier when you don't

1018
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:07,140
have a camera so they're able to go around and find people at the booth and interview

1019
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:11,800
them but it was really good talk with Paige on the live stream if for those of you got

1020
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:16,840
to see the whole thing well Linux fest was really great this year Matt don't you think

1021
01:21:16,840 --> 01:21:20,880
it was maybe the best Festa yet it seems like it's it's always hard to equate it because

1022
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:26,200
it's like every year is better than the last but this year definitely felt really really

1023
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:31,400
explosive in a good way and I think a biggest piece of that is we didn't seem to have any

1024
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:36,160
Mac equipment at the table that was like a thing I kept looking around like well there's

1025
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:39,440
I know there's a Mac here somewhere actually not very very much Mac equipment at the whole

1026
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:45,080
there wasn't but yeah but it was really cool and it seemed like a huge crowd yeah it seemed

1027
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:49,040
like a it seemed like a ton of people showed up which is lots of swag which was really

1028
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:54,160
awesome and now we look forward to the next events I know coming up the guys are going

1029
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:59,240
to be itself we're also going to be at OSCON and I'm working on BSD can which isn't locked

1030
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:05,400
in yet sit on my passport yet but I'm working on so those are upcoming events self and BSD

1031
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:11,880
can and OSCON and OSCON I think is in July or something like that in Portland sounds

1032
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:15,880
right yeah I know it's in Portland yeah that'll be a that's a nice one because I'm just gonna

1033
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:20,040
take the train down there possibly or go down with the family and stay on the coast and

1034
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:24,160
then drive into town so that'll be good stuff it's really cool to see everybody in person

1035
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:27,920
and if you'd like to go to a future meetup meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting is where

1036
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:32,420
we're going to schedule those including non like really big things like Michael Dominic

1037
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:36,200
from Kota radio is going to go to a Microsoft event in New York in a little bit and he'll

1038
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:39,880
probably have a meetup there and schedule it at the meetup page that's a lot of fun

1039
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:44,040
and we brought a few people back to the studio after Linux fest and we had a barbecue here

1040
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:51,920
Albert and his brother brought in some burgers and we had dogs and we had chicken skewers

1041
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:59,600
and and we all celebrated by everybody queued up YouTube videos on the Chromecast the blaster

1042
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:06,040
box was fun yeah and so we just watched those all night and I think they kept going till

1043
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,680
oh I don't know I don't remember what time you left Matt but they kept going for quite

1044
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:13,360
a while after that oh did they really yeah I think I left I left not too long after so

1045
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:16,560
I could I could see them going well into the night yeah well you know because everybody

1046
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:21,320
was just like couch locked and nobody wanted to get up even when it was time to get food

1047
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:25,560
people didn't really want to get up everybody was exhausted it was very little sleep but

1048
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:30,520
boy I tell you what it really makes me think I think we have the best crew in the world

1049
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:35,400
like it was unbelievable the stuff we pulled off he had you know unbelievable obstacles

1050

1054
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:59,200

1055
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:03,240
behind the scenes guys the folks that you you know you see them in the video clips walking

1056

in the back you don't really hear from them and I can I can think of three off the top

01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:13,360
of my head that just I mean it you know everybody yeah it was awesome yeah and so it was great

1058

okay I have one more clip that I want to play from Linux Fest Northwest but I feel like

1076
01:25:52,700 --> 01:25:58,820
if I put it in the post show then I'm abstained from any legal ramifications and and I don't

1077
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:04,060
believe I actually now Matt you you may get implicated in this video but I don't believe

1078
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:10,060
I'm implicated in this video but but Matt and I had no knowledge of this we had this

1079
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:13,740
this we can both say this was not premeditated but I'm not like pole dancing or nothing

1080
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:20,740
right you know what happened the last few years at Linux Fest Northwest our booth has

1081
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:27,500
come under attack now broadcasting does not start a war Jupiter broadcasting would never

1082
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:35,060
start a war but Jupiter broadcasting will finish a war and every year every year nerf

1083
01:26:35,060 --> 01:26:40,220
guns are brought to our booth while we are live on the air and we are assaulted we are

1084
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:46,460
assaulted and this year this year we struck back this year this year we brought guns to

1085
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:52,580
a knife fight and I play you the clip as it was captured on the live stream and I gotta

1086
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:58,220
hand it to you Matt you are two for two last year you had the money shot and this year

1087
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:04,860
you have the money shot again man you're two for two you gotta watch this now this is something

1088
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:10,220
that happened for those of you who have not watched our coverage before so you know we

1089
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:14,060
got a little we got we got a little problem here we have to have a serious conversation

1090
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:18,900
your Jupiter broadcasting booth is about to become under attack tell me how it's gonna

1091
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,460
become under attack there is an aggressive sect of Linux users present at Linux Fest

1092
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:28,720
Northwest they are armed with nerf weapons and they attack us and you better arm yourself

1093
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:32,980
Noah and get your camera ready because all they have to say now under the table there

1094
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:38,540
I may or may not be handing Noah arms Matt may have may or may not have passed I was

1095
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:42,620
putting them down both ways I was like we're dancing let's get her on as I'm talking on

1096
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:47,380
camera I'm opening them but I have to be sly because they're monitoring our feeds before

1097
01:27:47,380 --> 01:27:57,380
they attack it is it may be dawn Noah we are being armed as we speak this is this is troubling

1098
01:27:57,380 --> 01:28:03,980
and for insurance purposes I would ask that you all make your own local recording so now

1099
01:28:03,980 --> 01:28:11,460
you can Jed walks by okay no you go go Noah go what am I doing oh you're oh oh all right

1100
01:28:11,460 --> 01:28:15,820
all right all right okay all right okay so you're giving us a gun now what I didn't know

1101
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:21,100
at this time but if you watch the video playback closely Jed is implanting his children strategically

1102
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:28,940
in the crowd yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no Alan Jude

1103
01:28:28,940 --> 01:28:34,420
member of the Jupiter broadcasting crew host of tech snap and BSD now wearing a Jupiter

1104
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:41,580
broadcasting shirt note Alan you're not even in the camera shot first shot fired by Alan

1105
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:55,220
Jude now Jed that was mine okay now we sit there we take it for a minute right now the

1106
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:59,940
silly string goes crazy mr. system blaster nailed and then there goes Matt Matt breaks

1107
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:18,260
out the silly string nails kid nails kids kid again and then Matt nails my silly string

1108
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:22,780
actually had a broken nozzle so when I initially sprayed it it sprayed everywhere so I had

1109
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:26,260
to like reposition it before I could get to my shot and I wanted to make sure it counted

1110
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:29,780
and then Matt and then Matt's going in for the kill and this is me I'm calling Matt out

1111
01:29:29,780 --> 01:29:53,180
we have spilled enough blood right now this is going for it oh my gosh liability liability

1112
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:57,180
I did not I did not ask well if you look at where all the silly string has come and gone

1113
01:29:57,180 --> 01:30:02,940
none of it points back to us kick the silly string out get it out of here get rid of the

1114
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:07,860
evidence get rid of the evidence can you believe Alan turned on us I cannot believe that now

1115
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:10,900
one thing I want to also point out that's really really important is the man that was

1116
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:15,660
on the ground really early on Albert was out there with a broom yeah he was wasn't he was

1117
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:20,980
out there sweeping that stuff up yeah you know I mean I think I think because Albert

1118
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:24,660
did that prevented us from getting any trouble because we got right up on the cleanup crew

1119
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:30,260
and that was good yeah the red shirt walked by you know I gave him kind of a original

1120
01:30:30,260 --> 01:30:51,380
serious death look and you know he kept walking and we you know it was all good
