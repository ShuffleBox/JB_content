00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 72 for December 23rd, 2014.

00:30.000 --> 00:42.040
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's already tracking Santa's

00:42.040 --> 00:43.040
sleigh.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.600
My name is Chris and we have something kind of special for you this week.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.600
It's a little different.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.080
It's a first for a lot of our shows on the network.

00:50.080 --> 00:54.400
This week we're playing some of the audience's favorite moments as submitted by you.

00:54.400 --> 00:58.840
So if it's a train wreck, I'm officially transferring all blame to those of you, no I'm kidding.

00:58.840 --> 01:02.760
No, actually it's gone through some of our favorite moments and to be honest, on the

01:02.760 --> 01:05.760
Linux Unplugged show, it's just the way it goes you guys.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.000
Some of those, they're rants.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.660
A lot of great rants though, at least I happen to think so.

01:10.660 --> 01:14.600
And they inspired a lot of, I think, really good reflection and discussion.

01:14.600 --> 01:18.040
That's what I think Linux Unplugged oftentimes is all about.

01:18.040 --> 01:21.620
And so this week we're going to go in and look at some of those moments and other moments

01:21.620 --> 01:23.120
that you submitted into the show.

01:23.120 --> 01:27.100
In fact, it's, there's a lot, it's dense, there's a lot to get into.

01:27.100 --> 01:31.880
So in fact, so that way I don't have to interrupt, I will be joining you from time to time, moments

01:31.880 --> 01:32.880
throughout the show.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.820
Chris will come in and spend a holiday moment with you.

01:35.820 --> 01:38.960
But to kind of clear the air, get us ready for it, I think I'm going to thank our first

01:38.960 --> 01:40.120
sponsor this week.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.900
You guys know them, you guys love them.

01:41.900 --> 01:44.580
That's the amazing folks over at Ting.

01:44.580 --> 01:46.600
Go to linux.ting.com.

01:46.600 --> 01:51.320
That's going to get you not only a $25 discount off your first Ting device, but a little feather

01:51.320 --> 01:55.360
in your cap for supporting the Linux Unplugged show, linux.ting.com.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.200
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.400
Ting is my mobile service provider.

01:59.400 --> 02:03.360
And as I sit here and take a holiday sip from a holiday beverage and reflect on the things

02:03.360 --> 02:07.160
that I do feel very thankful for, Ting is one of them.

02:07.160 --> 02:10.380
I'm coming in now on two years of Ting service.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.440
You can get started by going to linux.ting.com.

02:12.440 --> 02:14.000
No more contract.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.360
No more termination fee.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.360
No more scams.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.960
No more getting you to pay for data that you may or may not use, or a certain amount of

02:19.960 --> 02:22.240
text messages you may or may not use.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.820
Just pay for what you actually end up using.

02:24.820 --> 02:25.820
That's how Ting works.

02:25.820 --> 02:28.560
Ting takes your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

02:28.560 --> 02:31.360
They add them all up at the end of the month, whatever buckets you fall into, that's all

02:31.360 --> 02:32.360
you got to pay.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.620
You want to turn on hotspot, you want to tether that, then just pay for the data.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.540
You don't have to be in some sort of special plan.

02:37.540 --> 02:40.680
And Ting has no hold customer service.

02:40.680 --> 02:41.680
I don't need it.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.920
To be honest, I've never had to call them.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.980
I take advantage of their incredible dashboard.

02:46.980 --> 02:50.920
But if I have friends and family, I absolutely let them know, you know what, you can call

02:50.920 --> 02:53.480
Ting and they'll answer your tough questions.

02:53.480 --> 02:58.080
They hire the Android geeks, give them the ability to solve your problem, give them the

02:58.080 --> 03:02.080
authority to resolve any kind of account issue, and then they have them answer the phone when

03:02.080 --> 03:03.080
it rings.

03:03.080 --> 03:04.080
I know.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.080
It's a crazy concept.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.080
Linux.Ting.com.

03:06.080 --> 03:09.840
They have that powerful online control panel where you can take control of your account,

03:09.840 --> 03:11.720
turn things on and off as you need them.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.380
It's really impressive.

03:13.380 --> 03:17.920
And one of the things you may have heard about is Ting is expanding into GSM next year.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.300
They're going to have CDMA and GSM coverage.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.960
And they posted up a video where they talked to one of their executives about that.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.600
So I'm going to play it for you.

03:24.600 --> 03:31.600
Dean asks, I've been happy since my switch to Ting a year ago.

03:31.600 --> 03:35.520
Any chance that Ting will offer GSM service besides CDMA?

03:35.520 --> 03:43.120
I'm sure you've seen by now that we are actually offering GSM service in addition to Sprint.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.800
There are two great things that that gives us.

03:45.800 --> 03:52.560
First, it gives people access to a wider variety of phones that they may already own or get

03:52.560 --> 03:54.520
in the secondary market.

03:54.520 --> 03:59.900
Second, probably a little more specifically, it does now mean that you can go down to the

03:59.900 --> 04:09.320
Apple store, buy an unlocked iPhone, new iPhone 6, 6 Plus, grab a SIM from us, pop it in and

04:09.320 --> 04:10.440
use Ting.

04:10.440 --> 04:16.400
And for a lot of people, that's been a real limitation.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.280
You know, I do think it's worth noting that this is and not or.

04:21.280 --> 04:26.000
And we're thrilled to be able to offer multiple networks.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.680
Linux.ting.com, mobile didn't make sense.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.560
Thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

04:32.560 --> 04:36.240
They're also getting into fiber internet to change up landlines.

04:36.240 --> 04:37.240
Love Ting.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.640
And I think you should go check them out.

04:38.640 --> 04:39.640
Start saving right now.

04:39.640 --> 04:45.800
And they have a special $100 and 50 bones credit if you have to cancel a line that has an early

04:45.800 --> 04:47.360
termination on it.

04:47.360 --> 04:49.880
No more ETS with Ting, linux.ting.com.

04:49.880 --> 04:52.800
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show.

04:52.800 --> 04:56.520
Well, SystemD sure came up a lot this year, didn't it?

04:56.520 --> 04:59.600
And there was a lot of different discussions on the Linux Unplugged show, but we figured

04:59.600 --> 05:02.900
we've got to touch on it once officially to market for 2014.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.920
So this is one of the highest submitted discussions around SystemD.

05:05.920 --> 05:06.920
Enjoy.

05:06.920 --> 05:11.960
Did you guys see the roll up your sleeves, we may need to fork Debian site.

05:11.960 --> 05:12.960
Did you guys catch this?

05:12.960 --> 05:13.960
Oh boy.

05:13.960 --> 05:17.680
And I'll just read the first paragraph here.

05:17.680 --> 05:22.200
We are veteran, which is bolded by the way, veteran Unix admins, and we are concerned

05:22.200 --> 05:27.640
about what's happening to GNU slash Linux Debian edition, and they're considering forking

05:27.640 --> 05:28.640
the project.

05:28.640 --> 05:32.080
I want to stop right here.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.080
I think that's a great idea.

05:33.080 --> 05:34.480
I think fork it.

05:34.480 --> 05:40.920
Like instead of delaying the progress of the distribution or the direction, fork it and

05:40.920 --> 05:41.920
go your own way.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.600
That actually seems like the right approach to take, especially if you're never going

05:44.600 --> 05:49.800
to be satisfied with the SystemD version of Debian.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.520
That seems like a pretty reasonable response, and I hope they do.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.400
I think the competition would be good.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.560
The thing that I can't get past, and it seems like a lot of other people have picked up

05:58.560 --> 06:01.960
on it, is the language used there.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.400
Veteran Unix admins and bolded.

06:04.400 --> 06:07.800
What that does is sort of projects old farts, and I'm not trying to be derogatory, I'm just

06:07.800 --> 06:12.880
saying like from a messaging standpoint, people are saying that makes you sound like a bunch

06:12.880 --> 06:15.240
of old farts, and then people sort of write it off.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.240
What do they care?

06:16.240 --> 06:18.200
A bunch of stick in the muds.

06:18.200 --> 06:22.880
And it immediately makes people not take it very seriously.

06:22.880 --> 06:26.920
Well looking at it from my perspective, I think it's a combination of quote-unquote

06:26.920 --> 06:31.840
old farts as well as people that are of the mind that if it isn't broke, why fix it, at

06:31.840 --> 06:32.840
least from their perspective.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.800
And so you might have an inner mixture of individuals in that space.

06:35.800 --> 06:39.960
Wimpy, do you think they're just crazy?

06:39.960 --> 06:45.480
Well they're exercising their right to free speech and all power to their elbow and everything,

06:45.480 --> 06:49.440
and if they want to have a go at forking Debbie in, then I think everyone should just stand

06:49.440 --> 06:55.360
back and let them get on with it and let themselves burn themselves out trying.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.240
Let's just take those two words together.

06:58.240 --> 07:01.800
Fork Debbie in, okay?

07:01.800 --> 07:03.240
Forking is hard.

07:03.240 --> 07:10.640
I have first-hand experience of forking really small projects in the comparison with Debbie

07:10.640 --> 07:11.640
in.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.840
So they want to fork Debbie in.

07:14.840 --> 07:20.400
Just think about all of the infrastructure that's involved there and all of the platforms

07:20.400 --> 07:21.400
and everything.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.880
It's just crazy nonsense.

07:23.880 --> 07:31.200
And Ian Jackson's obviously got an opinion about this, and he posted his thing to the

07:31.200 --> 07:38.200
mailing list to suggest that this was evaluated one last time, very expressly stating he didn't

07:38.200 --> 07:43.520
want to turn this into a system D versus whatever in its system debate.

07:43.520 --> 07:47.680
And then the internet explodes with system D inferno again.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.000
This is so disappointing.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.840
It's just laughable.

07:51.840 --> 07:59.160
And if they want to fork Debbie in, yeah, go on, do that thing.

07:59.160 --> 08:00.160
I'm all for it.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.600
I'm going to watch that gleefully from afar.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.160
Yeah, I would be pretty skeptical myself.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.960
And Valt, you think, no, no, don't fork.

08:08.960 --> 08:09.960
Don't do that.

08:09.960 --> 08:13.440
We need more resources as it is, not less people working on the same stuff.

08:13.440 --> 08:20.120
Well, that's obviously my actual practical point is, no, don't fork it.

08:20.120 --> 08:23.680
Find a way to accommodate multiple-init systems in Debbie in.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.680
I'm starting to change now.

08:24.680 --> 08:28.800
But if you want to fork Debbie in, yeah, go on, do it.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.960
But they're never going to be interested in being involved with the project in that state,

08:31.960 --> 08:33.220
then they should just fork it.

08:33.220 --> 08:37.560
You're not really losing resources because if they weren't going to cooperate anyways,

08:37.560 --> 08:38.560
you're not losing them.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.560
They're already lost.

08:39.560 --> 08:40.560
So let them go off and do their own thing.

08:40.560 --> 08:45.000
Well, no, the thing is, is that, no, well, yeah, okay, if they want to fork Debbie in,

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
fork Debbie in.

08:46.000 --> 08:53.480
But there's system BSD, there's useless D, there are shims around system D. If they were

08:53.480 --> 08:59.480
really serious about coming up with an alternative, they would be looking at those projects in

08:59.480 --> 09:03.720
terms of developing them and supporting them within the Debbie in community rather than

09:03.720 --> 09:07.080
saying we're going to fork Debbie in, which is frankly insane.

09:07.080 --> 09:14.800
Well, yeah, you're talking the biggest distribution there is, the mother of most of our distributions.

09:14.800 --> 09:15.800
Yeah.

09:15.800 --> 09:16.800
Yeah.

09:16.800 --> 09:20.920
That's a huge undertaking if you're even thinking about that.

09:20.920 --> 09:26.920
Would you do a complete fork or would it be more like sort of a clone of straight up Debbie

09:26.920 --> 09:31.000
in where you're just constantly swapping out the system D parts for something else?

09:31.000 --> 09:34.920
Well, one thing that comes to mind that I want to point out here is that now, last time

09:34.920 --> 09:39.840
I checked, most computers with blogging platforms attached don't have breathalyzers ready.

09:39.840 --> 09:47.240
So it's entirely possible they were fit-shaped and they got on and yeah, Debbie, baby, baby.

09:47.240 --> 09:51.160
No, I'll tell you, I'll tell you who's a little S-faced.

09:51.160 --> 09:52.160
How about this one?

09:52.160 --> 09:53.960
How about this one?

09:53.960 --> 09:54.960
Fork fedora.org.

09:54.960 --> 09:55.960
Shall we fork fedora?

09:55.960 --> 09:56.960
Oh, that's brilliant.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.200
And then here's the next one.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.200
Not really.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.640
It's doing great.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.640
Maybe we're not veteran enough.

10:04.640 --> 10:05.640
That's great.

10:05.640 --> 10:06.640
That's really good.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.640
That is fantastic.

10:07.640 --> 10:08.640
That's the best response.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.520
They sound like they're really housed.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.520
You know what?

10:11.520 --> 10:12.520
Yeah.

10:12.520 --> 10:13.520
Yeah.

10:13.520 --> 10:14.520
They're really housed, right?

10:14.520 --> 10:15.520
I would like to buy a beer for those guys.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.520
I've already verified this is a factual thing.

10:16.520 --> 10:17.520
Yeah.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.520
No, Matt did prove that.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.760
He did actually later up on G+.

10:20.760 --> 10:23.560
All of my 10 people on the whole internet, but still we exist.

10:23.560 --> 10:24.560
Yeah.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.120
That actually is getting housed as a term.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.200
It's like got a ridiculous origin though or something.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.200
I don't remember.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.200
Yeah.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.200
It's abbreviated from, you know, the other word.

10:33.200 --> 10:38.880
So, okay.

10:38.880 --> 10:42.960
But this fork business, like shall we fork fedora, time to fork Debian.

10:42.960 --> 10:43.960
I've never.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.640
Well, actually we have.

10:45.640 --> 10:50.560
The only time I think we've ever seen the Linux community this riled up and just unable

10:50.560 --> 10:56.560
to just move forward for a long time was like the Microsoft Novell deal where you had boycott

10:56.560 --> 11:02.040
Novell prop up and you had all this stuff and there was such decisive lines and it went

11:02.040 --> 11:07.160
on for like two years, but really not, I mean, you know, it was, it was not as bad for two

11:07.160 --> 11:08.520
years, but it really went on for a while.

11:08.520 --> 11:12.280
And this is like, we haven't had a good old classic drama like this since then.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.320
It's like the good old days again.

11:14.320 --> 11:19.920
Oh, I remember the old Novell thing and I'm sitting there going thinking, that's great.

11:19.920 --> 11:23.920
I'm going to go watch TV now cause I'm just like, this is going to be a week long thing

11:23.920 --> 11:25.440
and people are going to blow it over.

11:25.440 --> 11:26.440
Yeah.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.440
That still cracks me up.

11:27.440 --> 11:28.440
Just all right.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.440
Wimpy.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.440
Go ahead.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.440
Ask the questions on everybody's mind.

11:31.440 --> 11:39.520
Well, I'm putting myself out there again as the, as the bloke that says, you know, system

11:39.520 --> 11:41.320
D is really quite good.

11:41.320 --> 11:47.640
But I, I often wonder reading what some of the people say about system D and also listening

11:47.640 --> 11:54.040
to other podcasts and what they have to say about system D and I'm left with the impression

11:54.040 --> 11:56.920
of you've never actually used it.

11:56.920 --> 12:01.200
Not only have you never actually used it, you've never actually sat down and written

12:01.200 --> 12:02.760
a unit file.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.600
You're not a package maintainer.

12:04.600 --> 12:09.600
You haven't had to deal with init scripts and you haven't seen the benefits of migrating

12:09.600 --> 12:15.480
a package from an init script to system D and, and the many other benefits of system

12:15.480 --> 12:20.400
D. Now I can appreciate that people are very, very firm in their opinion that they like

12:20.400 --> 12:27.080
the way things are and there's a place for that, but I think a lot of the speculation

12:27.080 --> 12:34.400
and commentary about system D is being had by people who simply do not know what they're

12:34.400 --> 12:35.400
talking about.

12:35.400 --> 12:39.920
So I'm not suggesting necessarily that fork Debian falls into this camp.

12:39.920 --> 12:47.900
They would claim to be seasoned Linux administrators and Debian veterans quite.

12:47.900 --> 12:51.080
So maybe they do know what they're talking about and they have legitimate reasons as

12:51.080 --> 12:54.680
to why they feel system D is not going to suit them.

12:54.680 --> 13:00.040
But there are some podcasts where I've heard them debating the various init systems and

13:00.040 --> 13:05.080
talking about the pros and cons and then admitting partway through their, you know, slagging

13:05.080 --> 13:09.940
off of system D, they've never used it and you just think, well, how are you qualified

13:09.940 --> 13:12.120
to have an opinion?

13:12.120 --> 13:17.080
So my stance on the system D discussion, I think if you look over the history of this

13:17.080 --> 13:22.120
show has an arc where I'm pretty neutral, don't give a crap, and then I become pretty

13:22.120 --> 13:23.120
pro system D.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.920
And then I get to a point where I was a little belligerent to people who didn't, who didn't

13:26.920 --> 13:30.680
seem to think going forward with system D was a good idea because the reason I've, I

13:30.680 --> 13:33.080
don't know if belligerence is the right word, but I'll just label it that.

13:33.080 --> 13:40.440
The reason why I felt that way is because as a sys admin of like 14, 15 years, there

13:40.440 --> 13:46.720
are literally things that I see in system D that I think if I had that when I was managing

13:46.720 --> 13:50.760
servers, I would have hated my job so much less.

13:50.760 --> 13:56.000
Like it's not just small stuff that I see in system D. Some of the things that system

13:56.000 --> 14:02.040
D brings as a whole, I see as fundamentally necessary for Linux to remain competitive

14:02.040 --> 14:03.280
at scale.

14:03.280 --> 14:08.680
Like without those things and with and without those things, FreeBSD could easily eat our

14:08.680 --> 14:14.120
lunch really because essentially we're, we're, we're just as capable and, but system D offers

14:14.120 --> 14:19.040
so many things and the problem is you really don't know how important they are until you've

14:19.040 --> 14:24.460
deployed Linux at scale or you have a, a, you know, a very network demanding thing or

14:24.460 --> 14:29.640
you have something that has to be as absolutely minimal as possible and support socket activation

14:29.640 --> 14:32.080
or you need something that's integrated with namespaces.

14:32.080 --> 14:37.120
All these things that are edge cases, but together matter so much and may, and are so

14:37.120 --> 14:42.000
important to keeping Linux competitive, not just on the server, but also in mobile.

14:42.000 --> 14:45.920
That when you, when you come, when you argue against system D, what you have to realize

14:45.920 --> 14:50.920
is you have to really come with something that's extremely compelling because what you

14:50.920 --> 14:56.160
are arguing for is essentially removing what I, in, in my personal opinion, and I'm not

14:56.160 --> 14:59.480
saying it's right, but in my personal opinion are fundamentally critical features to keep

14:59.480 --> 15:01.380
Linux competitive.

15:01.380 --> 15:05.240
So if you're going to say no system D, you've got to have an answer for those problems.

15:05.240 --> 15:08.840
And yeah, I don't think you and I can have a debate about this because I think we're

15:08.840 --> 15:13.960
clearly on the same side of the fence and we've got, we've got our personal opinions.

15:13.960 --> 15:17.220
It sounds like the largely similar reasons.

15:17.220 --> 15:20.840
So really what we need is somebody to step up and tell us why we're wrong.

15:20.840 --> 15:27.000
And I, I, I think part of is some of the more vocal people debating this are not the same

15:27.000 --> 15:28.660
people who are as impacted by it.

15:28.660 --> 15:32.000
Like I think there's a group of people that care a lot, but they're just not as vocal

15:32.000 --> 15:34.160
about debating it.

15:34.160 --> 15:39.680
I think I'm trying to, cause I get emails that seem really well reasoned, but I, even

15:39.680 --> 15:42.060
then I've still not been convinced.

15:42.060 --> 15:46.280
The biggest things that convinced me that it might be a problem are always the what

15:46.280 --> 15:47.720
if scenarios.

15:47.720 --> 15:51.840
And I think, yeah, if that happens, we could have a problem, but that's not a today problem.

15:51.840 --> 15:52.840
That's a what if problem.

15:52.840 --> 15:53.840
Quite.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.840
Quite.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.240
Anyways, so how do we get talking about, oh yeah, the forks.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.240
Yeah.

15:58.240 --> 16:02.520
The system D conversation once again has been stirred back up by these project forks.

16:02.520 --> 16:06.600
And you know what's interesting is you check the Linux forums like r slash Linux and just

16:06.600 --> 16:10.680
general discussion forums and people are constantly still asking about it.

16:10.680 --> 16:14.740
It is genuinely a topic that even though it seems like we've talked about it ad nauseum,

16:14.740 --> 16:17.160
people still seem to care about.

16:17.160 --> 16:21.560
I guess that's sort of the fun of being a Linux user is you get to care about such nitty

16:21.560 --> 16:27.480
gritty things like your display compositor and system D and all that stuff.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.680
So I guess that's why we do it.

16:29.680 --> 16:32.960
And that concludes the system D portion of this show.

16:32.960 --> 16:37.880
However, something does tell me we'll probably still be talking about system D in 2015.

16:37.880 --> 16:42.920
I can't help myself and it's obviously a huge area of interest for the Linux community.

16:42.920 --> 16:47.720
2015 is going to be a big year for system D. 2015 is also going to be a big year for

16:47.720 --> 16:50.400
our sponsor, DigitalOcean, and I mean that.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.840
They have some very impressive stuff in the works that you guys are going to find out

16:53.840 --> 16:55.200
about very soon.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.300
Head over to digitalocean.com right now.

16:57.300 --> 16:58.300
Check them out.

16:58.300 --> 16:59.680
Give them a ding for that.

16:59.680 --> 17:04.680

17:04.680 --> 17:05.680
UNPLUGGEDDECEMBER.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.240
Remember, that's our promo code of domination.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.400
UNPLUGGEDDECEMBER when you check out.

17:09.400 --> 17:13.000
That'll give you a $10 credit and you'll see why you want that, but first, let me back

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
up a bit.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.400
I feel perhaps I have gone too fast for you.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.840
I want to slow down and treat it right and tell you about DigitalOcean, a simple cloud

17:19.840 --> 17:23.640
hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin

17:23.640 --> 17:30.480
up a cloud server up in the cloud, my friends, with root access and unbelievable speeds.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.640
And speaking of speeds, you can actually get the cloud server created in less than a minute

17:33.640 --> 17:36.800
and pricing plans start at only $5 per month.

17:36.800 --> 17:37.800
Remember that promo code?

17:37.800 --> 17:40.680
The promo code of domination.

17:40.680 --> 17:41.680
UNPLUGGEDDECEMBER.

17:41.680 --> 17:42.680
Remember that?

17:42.680 --> 17:43.680
Well, that's going to get you a $10 credit.

17:43.680 --> 17:47.800
Well, I just said it's $5 for one of their rigs, 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte

17:47.800 --> 17:51.040
SSD, one CPU, and a freaking terabyte of transfer, my friends.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.040
A terabyte.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.280
That's a lot of Christmas movies.

17:54.280 --> 17:55.280
Or something else.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.280
I don't know.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.280
I don't judge.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.280
Honey badger over here.

17:58.280 --> 18:02.040
What's great is DigitalOcean has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore,

18:02.040 --> 18:03.040
Amsterdam, and London.

18:03.040 --> 18:06.660
So you're going to get a data center somewhere that makes you look like a boss, or you could

18:06.660 --> 18:09.160
diversify your regionalness with that.

18:09.160 --> 18:10.680
I think it's pretty great.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.640
But really, what's great is that interface.

18:13.640 --> 18:17.240
DigitalOcean has the most intuitive control panel for managing something like this.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.080
I wouldn't have thought it could be done.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.480
It really is great.

18:20.480 --> 18:25.320
And power users can replicate the control panel, the functionality, on a much, much

18:25.320 --> 18:29.800
larger scale with DigitalOcean's straightforward API that I'm told is gorgeous.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.840
And I've recently been checking out some of the applications that take advantage of that

18:32.840 --> 18:33.840
API.

18:33.840 --> 18:34.840
Like Swimmer.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.720
Yeah, it's called Swimmer.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.080
A full featured open source Android client for DigitalOcean.

18:40.080 --> 18:41.080
Look at this thing.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.080
It's open source.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.280
It's up on GitHub right now.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.480
You can check it out.

18:44.480 --> 18:47.300
And this allows you to manage your DigitalOcean droplets.

18:47.300 --> 18:51.880
You can SSH into the droplet, reboot, power cycle, shut down, resize the droplet, snapshot

18:51.880 --> 18:57.920
it, rebuild it, turn backups on, create a droplet from your phone.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.060
Amazing.

18:59.060 --> 19:01.440
Look at all the options you have with this thing.

19:01.440 --> 19:05.240
This is what's so cool about DigitalOcean's API, and because it's so great, developers

19:05.240 --> 19:06.600
are excited to use it.

19:06.600 --> 19:09.160
And now you can go take advantage of something like this, like an open source Android app

19:09.160 --> 19:10.640
so you can even trust it.

19:10.640 --> 19:12.800
That's so awesome.

19:12.800 --> 19:17.840
DigitalOcean.com, and use our promo code UNPLUG DECEMBER, the promo code of domination, to

19:17.840 --> 19:19.560
get a $10 credit when you check out.

19:19.560 --> 19:21.080
Try out that $5 rig.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.560
Go deploy GitLab.

19:23.560 --> 19:27.160
Go deploy Ruby on Rails, WordPress, Ghost with one click.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.320
Man, that is so slick.

19:29.320 --> 19:30.320
I really think that's it.

19:30.320 --> 19:31.840
It's such an impressive setup.

19:31.840 --> 19:35.000
And the one click installation, you combine that with the spin of time, and you can really

19:35.000 --> 19:37.040
get hauling fast.

19:37.040 --> 19:40.160
DigitalOcean.com, Unplug December when you check out.

19:40.160 --> 19:43.880
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.240
You guys, I'm looking forward to 2015.

19:46.240 --> 19:47.240
I know you guys have something.

19:47.240 --> 19:48.240
I can't even say.

19:48.240 --> 19:52.120
I can't even say, but let's just say I know some things, and I'm really impressed with

19:52.120 --> 19:53.120
what I know.

19:53.120 --> 19:56.160
Up next, though, is an interview with a talks developer.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.240
This was sent in by quite a bit of you.

19:58.240 --> 20:01.800
Encrypted messaging space is something I'm following really closely myself.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.680
I find it to be a fascinating field with a lot of cool things happening right now, but

20:05.680 --> 20:10.520
not one that I've really zoned in on as my go-to messaging platform.

20:10.520 --> 20:14.800
So when we had this chance to interview a talks developer, I was really interested in

20:14.800 --> 20:15.800
what they had to say.

20:15.800 --> 20:16.800
I hope you will be, too.

20:16.800 --> 20:17.800
Enjoy.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.560
So I want to welcome two developers from the talks project onto the show.

20:21.560 --> 20:26.220
Joining us on Mumble right now, we have STQ and I run Gentoo.

20:26.220 --> 20:31.160
So I know talks started up as sort of a discussion thread, and I'm told I think it started on

20:31.160 --> 20:32.640
4chan.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.640
And now here we are.

20:33.640 --> 20:35.000
We're what, seven, eight months down the road?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.960
It's become a very active project.

20:36.960 --> 20:41.800
So where is it at from where it started versus where it's at today?

20:41.800 --> 20:49.280
Well, talks started as, well, I actually, I had this idea, this very basic idea, and

20:49.280 --> 21:00.680
then, well, I was on a thread, on a G, that was speaking about how Skype is, well, privacy

21:00.680 --> 21:01.680
issues with Skype.

21:01.680 --> 21:09.080
So, well, I had just, well, I just decided, okay, hey, let's, I was actually a bit maybe

21:09.080 --> 21:17.880
drunk at the moment or something, and I said, okay, let's make a Skype replacement.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.520
So that's how it started.

21:20.520 --> 21:26.680
And then, well, I was very impressed by the positive response from everyone.

21:26.680 --> 21:35.200
So I said, okay, let's start writing code, let's start planning stuff, and that's how

21:35.200 --> 21:36.200
talks started.

21:36.200 --> 21:40.400
So it started kind of as a crazy idea that maybe after you thought about it for a little

21:40.400 --> 21:42.560
bit realized, this could be a good idea.

21:42.560 --> 21:47.040
Have you worked on this kind of stuff before or something like this before?

21:47.040 --> 21:52.440
Well, I played around with some BitTorrent DHT.

21:52.440 --> 22:03.080
I did a couple of scripts to, like, I once made a script to find out which, to try to

22:03.080 --> 22:11.560
track everything on the BitTorrent DHT, but, well, there were some little bandwidth issues.

22:11.560 --> 22:20.760
I would have needed a big server and something, so the idea kind of died, but that gave me

22:20.760 --> 22:29.480
a bit of experience on, like, how peer-to-peer software works and everything, so that's how

22:29.480 --> 22:30.480
...

22:30.480 --> 22:31.480
Yeah.

22:31.480 --> 22:35.160
Well, can you tell me a little bit about, and I guess it's actually pronounced salt,

22:35.160 --> 22:40.460
but the networking and cryptography library that talks is sitting on primarily.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.920
Is this the big piece of functionality here?

22:43.920 --> 22:45.560
What does this component play?

22:45.560 --> 22:47.040
What role does that play?

22:47.040 --> 22:53.480
Well, that's the... Seriously, I like that crypto.

22:53.480 --> 22:56.160
I love that crypto library.

22:56.160 --> 23:00.560
It's very simple to use and everything, and it's very secure.

23:00.560 --> 23:08.640
I don't think talks would have worked without it since, well, when talks started, we didn't

23:08.640 --> 23:15.200
know what crypto library would use.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.200
Right.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.360
That seems like a huge choice to make, right?

23:18.360 --> 23:24.840
Yeah, but then someone suggested it in a thread, and then I looked at it, and I just saw this

23:24.840 --> 23:25.840
is perfect.

23:25.840 --> 23:28.360
It's simple to use.

23:28.360 --> 23:30.200
It's fast.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.400
It's very secure.

23:31.400 --> 23:40.760
It protects against all types of timing attacks, et cetera, so we picked that, and I started

23:40.760 --> 23:49.040
reading a lot, okay, so how do I implement this correctly in talks without screwing up

23:49.040 --> 23:50.040
things?

23:50.040 --> 23:51.040
Right.

23:51.040 --> 23:54.440
That was my question, because I've heard that I think also the Telegram Messenger program

23:54.440 --> 23:59.000
uses the salt library, but I guess they maybe... I don't know the details, but I guess

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
they've implemented it incorrectly.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.840
Have you looked at that situation and tried to kind of balance what they did wrong and

24:05.840 --> 24:08.440
adjust accordingly for talks?

24:08.440 --> 24:11.600
Telegram, they don't use the salt library.

24:11.600 --> 24:16.400
They use their custom crypto implementation.

24:16.400 --> 24:21.040
If they would have used the salt library, their crypto would have been fine.

24:21.040 --> 24:23.760
Nobody would be complaining about it.

24:23.760 --> 24:24.760
Right.

24:24.760 --> 24:25.760
Gotcha.

24:25.760 --> 24:29.600
So something that seemed kind of like a big deal, you guys got accepted, the talks project

24:29.600 --> 24:33.160
got accepted into the Google Summer of Code, but you know a lot of people have asked is

24:33.160 --> 24:35.940
that going to influence the project in any way?

24:35.940 --> 24:37.560
What about their independence?

24:37.560 --> 24:41.440
What are your thoughts on the Summer of Code and what it means for that aspect of the project?

24:41.440 --> 24:44.360
I'll go ahead and answer this.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.360
Sure.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.400
Well, I think with Google Summer of Code, we're really going to be able to finish a

24:49.400 --> 24:54.400
lot of things that we wouldn't have the time to do that due to our prior commitments we

24:54.400 --> 24:55.880
would never be able to do.

24:55.880 --> 25:00.920
We would be able to have people who have different skill sets in areas we might not have.

25:00.920 --> 25:03.360
It would be able to help out that way.

25:03.360 --> 25:04.360
Okay.

25:04.360 --> 25:09.520
So what about this criticism that people have said, oh, well, this is a bad sign.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.400
This is about influence.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.400
What do you think of that?

25:12.400 --> 25:16.880
Has there been communications from Google about suggestions or anything like that?

25:16.880 --> 25:19.360
No, they don't do anything like that.

25:19.360 --> 25:23.640
They exist purely to foster the development of open source projects.

25:23.640 --> 25:29.880
No secret influences, no link to this secret library, nothing like that.

25:29.880 --> 25:34.760
No insert go to fail line here.

25:34.760 --> 25:38.520
That's good considering that there's a lot of hopes riding on a secure messenger and

25:38.520 --> 25:42.520
I got to tell you guys, this is a pretty contested space right now.

25:42.520 --> 25:48.520
So I think people are looking for a lot of things to pull out to kind of criticize on.

25:48.520 --> 25:54.880
And to that end, I don't really know if there is something to be worried about here, but

25:54.880 --> 25:58.940
a lot of people have criticized that they started as a threat on 4chan.

25:58.940 --> 26:01.920
Have you guys dealt with growing pains as a result of that?

26:01.920 --> 26:09.240
Well, we didn't start like that, but as we developed, we got people with skill sets from

26:09.240 --> 26:13.480
Reddit and all these areas and sort of nurtured.

26:13.480 --> 26:16.360
That's exactly, I mean, so when I, I mean, not to interrupt, I'm sorry, but when I, when

26:16.360 --> 26:19.580
I, so I've seen this question, it was sent into our show a few times and to me it just

26:19.580 --> 26:23.000
seems like these are locations that technical people hang out.

26:23.000 --> 26:29.520
True, so 4chan specifically, that little area is a lot of trolling.

26:29.520 --> 26:36.440
I think it was pure luck that the people who we have now, that all the skills matched up

26:36.440 --> 26:37.440
just perfectly.

26:37.440 --> 26:38.440
Yeah, yeah.

26:38.440 --> 26:43.440
Well, I, and I, and I know, I know it's something that's on people's radar and it maybe seems

26:43.440 --> 26:45.000
like one of those things down the road.

26:45.000 --> 26:49.360
It probably, it, it probably won't be as big of a factor, but what are any other growing

26:49.360 --> 26:52.560
pains you guys are seeing as the project is becoming more aware?

26:52.560 --> 26:56.000
People are becoming more aware of it?

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
Not really.

26:57.000 --> 27:06.800
Well, there's always a bit of issues, but we can, we, we've dealt with them and it's

27:06.800 --> 27:07.800
good.

27:07.800 --> 27:08.800
Well, okay.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.720
So now that's the big picture stuff.

27:10.720 --> 27:15.040
I want to talk a little bit about maybe features and stuff that talks is hoping to support

27:15.040 --> 27:16.520
down the road.

27:16.520 --> 27:22.320
What are your plans for, three, there's three major things I've seen requests from the audience.

27:22.320 --> 27:24.320
Uh, conference call setups.

27:24.320 --> 27:27.560
You guys have any plans to do things like group calls and things like that down the

27:27.560 --> 27:28.560
road?

27:28.560 --> 27:29.560
Yes.

27:29.560 --> 27:30.920
Okay, good.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.480
What about multiple presence?

27:32.480 --> 27:37.200
As in I can be logged in on a, on, on multiple computers and the message goes to all locations

27:37.200 --> 27:42.720
or maybe I'm on my, I'm on my Android phone and I'm also on my laptop and I want my messages

27:42.720 --> 27:44.200
and calls to go to both locations.

27:44.200 --> 27:47.400
Is that possible with the security model you're using now?

27:47.400 --> 27:51.400
You know, we haven't worked out something like that just yet.

27:51.400 --> 27:56.800
We're still working on a lot of our group chats, how we can do audio and video, how

27:56.800 --> 28:01.960
we can do things like that, but when the time comes, I know we'll be able to reach that

28:01.960 --> 28:02.960
area.

28:02.960 --> 28:10.440
Yeah, it's a, it's possible, but, uh, it's a later after, after we've done the TCP stuff,

28:10.440 --> 28:15.080
after we've done the, the group chats and the work and yeah.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.440
Is that how you're focusing right now?

28:16.440 --> 28:19.880
It seems like the talks clients that I've tried are all text chat based to get that

28:19.880 --> 28:24.160
working and then as the plan to then to get the next set of functionality working and

28:24.160 --> 28:25.160
then the next.

28:25.160 --> 28:32.280
Yeah, it's a, it's how, uh, well, I think it's the best way to develop software to do,

28:32.280 --> 28:38.600
make a feature, test it correctly, add another, add another and, uh, that's a.

28:38.600 --> 28:43.200
So what's on your immediate list and then what's on your sort of, after I get this next

28:43.200 --> 28:46.800
immediate problem solved, after I get this thing that's bugging me fixed, I really want

28:46.800 --> 28:48.300
to start working on.

28:48.300 --> 28:49.920
So what are those two things?

28:49.920 --> 28:56.040
Well, we have first the, the thing that I want to finish first, well, that I'm working

28:56.040 --> 29:06.320
on right now is, uh, the TCP, uh, TCP stuff so that, uh, I want to add a TCP relay functionality

29:06.320 --> 29:15.920
to talks, uh, nodes so that, uh, people that are behind bad knots and, uh, can, uh, can

29:15.920 --> 29:21.680
also use talks currently talks on the works people with that can a whole bunch through

29:21.680 --> 29:22.680
their knots.

29:22.680 --> 29:23.680
Okay.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.680
But that's not everyone.

29:24.680 --> 29:25.680
Yeah.

29:25.680 --> 29:30.880
Some people are behind enterprise knots, some symmetric knots that are weird and on and

29:30.880 --> 29:39.720
block certain, uh, like, yeah, they only have a maximum number of UDP connections that can,

29:39.720 --> 29:46.760
well, that can be a problem because well, tax needs to connect to a bunch of people

29:46.760 --> 29:47.760
for discovery.

29:47.760 --> 29:48.760
Yeah.

29:48.760 --> 29:49.760
Yeah.

29:49.760 --> 29:50.760
So, okay.

29:50.760 --> 29:55.760
I look at this and I think if talks was really successful, I, if, if you could truly create

29:55.760 --> 30:02.520
a Skype replacement that was secure, you would have a system that would be used by, by journalists,

30:02.520 --> 30:07.000
by dissidents, by the paranoid and by cheaters.

30:07.000 --> 30:13.480
And, uh, it would be this, these groups of people would fundamentally rely on this technology

30:13.480 --> 30:17.360
to be absolutely iron clad solid.

30:17.360 --> 30:22.160
Have you considered code audits and, and maybe you add a certain like quote unquote official

30:22.160 --> 30:26.800
release point saying we're going to audit the code, have a third party look at the code?

30:26.800 --> 30:32.920
Well, yes, of course, but we want to wait till a lot of our major features are done.

30:32.920 --> 30:37.800
And talking about what you mentioned earlier, we're designing talks to be something that

30:37.800 --> 30:42.520
everyone can use someone talking, someone somewhere.

30:42.520 --> 30:46.440
I have no idea what I'm saying right now, but long story short, we want to design something

30:46.440 --> 30:51.240
that's so fast, so easy, so smooth that people would use it instead of Skype.

30:51.240 --> 30:57.560
I mean, we're not going to truly accomplish our goal unless everyone's using this, unless

30:57.560 --> 31:01.800
there's nothing that can be spied on, nothing that can be new.

31:01.800 --> 31:07.360
Maybe it's not a selling point for end users, but we want to give it to everyone.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.000
That's an interesting way to put it.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.680
I mean, it's definitely is.

31:11.680 --> 31:15.080
It's definitely for some, but yeah, you're right for the general user, it's not really,

31:15.080 --> 31:16.080
it's not really a big deal.

31:16.080 --> 31:19.800
Uh, you know, the only really other question I had sent in from the audience that was kind

31:19.800 --> 31:24.080
of kicking around is, uh, how do you guys plan to make money and are you going to take

31:24.080 --> 31:25.080
donations?

31:25.080 --> 31:33.040
No, we might take donations and so Gentoo's been talking about it a bit, but right now

31:33.040 --> 31:38.120
all of our expenses, our build systems, everything comes out of my own pocket and I haven't really

31:38.120 --> 31:39.200
been taking anything in.

31:39.200 --> 31:42.800
Well, you're a good man, SDQ.

31:42.800 --> 31:48.640
So have you considered like a donation system or like a Kickstarter system or something

31:48.640 --> 31:49.640
like that?

31:49.640 --> 31:51.960
Um, can you repeat the question?

31:51.960 --> 31:52.960
I couldn't hear you.

31:52.960 --> 31:53.960
Are you thinking about, are you guys?

31:53.960 --> 31:57.560
Cause the reason I'm asking is we had a few people send in like long play wrote in and

31:57.560 --> 32:01.400
asked if, uh, you guys would, he wants to send you money, but he couldn't find a way

32:01.400 --> 32:02.400
to donate.

32:02.400 --> 32:06.320
Are you considering doing a donation model?

32:06.320 --> 32:15.440
We might put a donation button on the website because the reason I didn't want donations

32:15.440 --> 32:23.800
to, well, us accepting donations at the beginning is, well, what if, uh, we just started and

32:23.800 --> 32:28.360
then everything fails and well, people are going to be angry and everything.

32:28.360 --> 32:31.760
But well, we've, uh, we've gone a long way from there.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.880
So we might, uh, yeah, that's good.

32:34.880 --> 32:35.880
It's good.

32:35.880 --> 32:36.880
Yeah.

32:36.880 --> 32:37.880
Yeah.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.480
You want to make sure you got something that, uh, you can, you can show for before you ask

32:39.480 --> 32:40.560
people to start taking money.

32:40.560 --> 32:44.160
Well, also I'll open it up to the mumble room and see if there's any questions that the

32:44.160 --> 32:45.160
group has.

32:45.160 --> 32:48.000
Um, and you guys, if you do just ping me in the chat room with any questions you have

32:48.000 --> 32:51.040
for the folks and we'll, we'll get through those.

32:51.040 --> 32:55.160
In the chat room, I'm also checking your questions as, as we go, but, uh, guys, I want to thank

32:55.160 --> 32:56.760
you for coming on Linux Unplugged.

32:56.760 --> 33:00.120
As this project I'm going to be watching, you know, I'm, I'm still really interested

33:00.120 --> 33:02.800
in picking the mobile messenger of the future.

33:02.800 --> 33:08.000
And right now the Jupiter Broadcasting Network really kind of uses Skype a lot for our shows

33:08.000 --> 33:12.700
because at the end of the day, it seems to be the, the sort of the best combination of

33:12.700 --> 33:17.960
deployment and ease of use and actual video and audio quality simultaneously.

33:17.960 --> 33:20.060
I'm really excited about the talks project.

33:20.060 --> 33:24.560
We talked about it a little bit this last Sunday on the Linux Action Show and I demoed

33:24.560 --> 33:26.580
a couple of different apps you can use for it.

33:26.580 --> 33:31.920
It's early days right now, uh, but, uh, I, I, I want to encourage you guys to keep going

33:31.920 --> 33:35.000
at it, keep working at it because this is a space that people are going to be more and

33:35.000 --> 33:37.560
more interested over the, uh, the next couple of years.

33:37.560 --> 33:42.800
Crossroads asks, uh, how does this compare to other chat programs, e.g. BT Chat or Tor

33:42.800 --> 33:43.800
Chat?

33:43.800 --> 33:44.800
And actually that's a great question.

33:44.800 --> 33:48.000
Have you guys seen the announcement of Tor Chat and what are your thoughts on that versus

33:48.000 --> 33:49.000
talks?

33:49.000 --> 34:01.520
Well, Tor Chat is, uh, they're going more on the anonymous, uh, well, they want to make

34:01.520 --> 34:07.080
an anonymous chat, but, uh, talks is, uh, isn't anonymous.

34:07.080 --> 34:13.400
You connect directly to the people you're speaking to because, uh, we want performance

34:13.400 --> 34:21.920
because, well, streaming, uh, high resolution video through Tor is, well, doesn't really

34:21.920 --> 34:22.920
work well.

34:22.920 --> 34:23.920
That's true, right?

34:23.920 --> 34:24.920
Yeah.

34:24.920 --> 34:25.920
That's a great point.

34:25.920 --> 34:26.920
Yeah.

34:26.920 --> 34:27.920
I hadn't thought about the video aspect of it.

34:27.920 --> 34:28.920
And to reiterate further.

34:28.920 --> 34:29.920
Yeah.

34:29.920 --> 34:30.920
Go ahead.

34:30.920 --> 34:38.920
I mean, we're trying to design something that everyone can use, not just the paranoid.

34:38.920 --> 34:43.040
Well, and, and to that end, is that why, I mean, I'm seeing a lot of, a lot of different

34:43.040 --> 34:44.040
talks clients.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.720
There's not like one official talks client.

34:46.720 --> 34:50.520
I guess it would be conceivable that you could have chat programs like Pidgin out there and

34:50.520 --> 34:54.080
others that support talks and Tor Chat at the same time.

34:54.080 --> 34:55.080
Right?

34:55.080 --> 34:56.080
Yeah.

34:56.080 --> 34:59.720
Pidgin for a, there's a talks plugin in development already.

34:59.720 --> 35:05.600
So it, uh, it already supports talks, but very good.

35:05.600 --> 35:06.920
That's very interesting you guys.

35:06.920 --> 35:10.400
And, uh, I'm glad you're working on this to tell you the truth because, uh, one of my

35:10.400 --> 35:16.320
predictions for, uh, the, the, uh, the Linux action show for 2014 was that there'd be an

35:16.320 --> 35:18.020
explosion in secure messaging.

35:18.020 --> 35:21.900
So you guys are right now confirming my prediction.

35:21.900 --> 35:23.000
So that's awesome for me.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.000
Most definitely.

35:24.000 --> 35:25.000
Yeah.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
I know, right?

35:26.000 --> 35:30.720
Uh, so you guys, I know, I know you guys probably are not big fans of giving out timelines,

35:30.720 --> 35:35.120
but do you have a general big picture timeline or roadmap of when features will roll out

35:35.120 --> 35:37.360
or be available?

35:37.360 --> 35:42.920
I can tell you the, well, the order at which we're going to roll them out, but timelines

35:42.920 --> 35:44.840
are a bit, uh, I'll take that.

35:44.840 --> 35:47.720
I'll take order of you that you want to roll things out for sure.

35:47.720 --> 35:51.880
Well, first of all, we're gonna roll out the TCP relays.

35:51.880 --> 35:57.600
Then after that, we're going to work, uh, on, uh, fixing our group chats and making

35:57.600 --> 36:01.120
audio video work in group chats.

36:01.120 --> 36:06.640
And well, that's the two main, that should take a while because they're, they're two

36:06.640 --> 36:12.600
very big, uh, features that they're going to need lots of testing and everything.

36:12.600 --> 36:19.480
And after that, we're going to concentrate on, well, whatever, uh, well, maybe optimizing

36:19.480 --> 36:28.880
code or, uh, trying to implement other features like offline messaging and like how someone

36:28.880 --> 36:37.000
who wants to be logged in at two computers that we might, uh, might work on that.

36:37.000 --> 36:41.120
It depends on what we feel people want the most.

36:41.120 --> 36:42.120
What they're asking for.

36:42.120 --> 36:43.120
Yeah.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.120
Well, let me ask you this.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.760
What if somebody, Daredevilin is making a great question, making a great point in our

36:46.760 --> 36:47.760
chat room.

36:47.760 --> 36:52.280
What if, what if you, uh, were, uh, you wake up one day, you go to slash dot or tech meme

36:52.280 --> 36:57.840
or Reddit or whatever, and you see a top headline, new secure messenger launched available

36:57.840 --> 37:01.520
on Android, iOS, and the desktop, um, it's, it's awesome.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.520
It's rock solid.

37:02.520 --> 37:03.520
And you dig through it.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.720
And when you see they're charging, they're charging for the app and then you'd read through

37:06.720 --> 37:09.740
the details and you realize, holy crap, they're using talks.

37:09.740 --> 37:14.080
How do you feel about people creating clients or potentially business models on top of a

37:14.080 --> 37:16.200
system that you're building today?

37:16.200 --> 37:25.200
Well, the core is licensed under the GPL v3, so they can't take the code and not give the

37:25.200 --> 37:26.440
source back.

37:26.440 --> 37:31.880
So well, if someone does take it and improves their source and if they make money, I don't

37:31.880 --> 37:35.520
care if they, because they're improving the software.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.560
So Daredevilin, I didn't realize you were in here.

37:37.560 --> 37:38.560
Go ahead.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.520
And did you have more you wanted to add to that?

37:40.520 --> 37:41.520
Daredevilin?

37:41.520 --> 37:42.520
No.

37:42.520 --> 37:43.520
Sorry.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.520
I'm here.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.520
Can you hear me?

37:45.520 --> 37:46.520
Yeah.

37:46.520 --> 37:47.520
Yeah.

37:47.520 --> 37:53.800
So what happened is, uh, the reason I got this question is because, uh, I was wondering

37:53.800 --> 37:59.160
more, uh, I know it's GPL and people are contributing back, but there's kind of business models

37:59.160 --> 38:04.360
that could involve, for example, a company making their own nodes in a way that, um,

38:04.360 --> 38:06.760
will allow them to mimic users.

38:06.760 --> 38:11.000
And I mean, it depends of course on the intrinsic of the project, but then goes to something

38:11.000 --> 38:15.600
that is something a little bit deviated from original thoughts plans.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.800
And it goes like uses talk source code.

38:18.800 --> 38:24.080
It uses all like a Bitcoin's Litecoin, that kind of thing.

38:24.080 --> 38:25.080
Yeah.

38:25.080 --> 38:26.080
Kind of, sorta.

38:26.080 --> 38:34.240
So it will be with some differences that will make more a company driven perspective and

38:34.240 --> 38:38.480
not actually providing the users direct access.

38:38.480 --> 38:44.080
So what are the measures in place for you to incentivize people to just come to your

38:44.080 --> 38:49.440
project instead of just working, doing something crazy that goes completely out of town?

38:49.440 --> 38:56.400
Well, if, if a company does something like that, well, end users actually use the software

38:56.400 --> 38:57.480
from that company.

38:57.480 --> 39:00.040
That means you're doing something good.

39:00.040 --> 39:01.320
So that's a win for you.

39:01.320 --> 39:02.320
Wow.

39:02.320 --> 39:09.080
You can always take the code out and put it in our, in our project.

39:09.080 --> 39:14.400
So Josh, go ahead.

39:14.400 --> 39:15.400
That's a good point.

39:15.400 --> 39:16.400
It's like, okay.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.400
Oh, okay.

39:17.400 --> 39:18.400
I mean, that's an interesting way to think about it.

39:18.400 --> 39:19.400
Yeah.

39:19.400 --> 39:24.320
Like OpenBSD makes FSH and they give it away for people to do whatever they want.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.320
Right.

39:25.320 --> 39:26.320
Great point.

39:26.320 --> 39:28.720
I mean, that's, that's an interesting way to kind of frame that Josh, you had a kind

39:28.720 --> 39:31.320
of a question more about funding, right?

39:31.320 --> 39:34.040
Yes, I did.

39:34.040 --> 39:39.560
So you guys talked about maybe monetizing or accepting donations in the future.

39:39.560 --> 39:44.600
So what is your opinion on allowing, you know, people to back certain features with something

39:44.600 --> 39:49.300
like Bounty Source and allow you guys to get paid to like implement certain features like

39:49.300 --> 39:58.120
group chats and maybe help speed the process along or provide some sort of monetary incentive?

39:58.120 --> 40:03.040
You know, I think something like that really hurts people's trust that something doesn't

40:03.040 --> 40:04.040
need a timeline.

40:04.040 --> 40:09.520
If something looks good, looks like it's easy to do, but it doesn't come up and it ends

40:09.520 --> 40:12.320
up taking a lot longer than it should or something.

40:12.320 --> 40:13.320
People get disappointed.

40:13.320 --> 40:14.320
Hmm.

40:14.320 --> 40:22.240
Well, the main issue is that implementing something is relatively easy.

40:22.240 --> 40:28.640
Implementing something that's bug free and works perfectly, that's, that's hard.

40:28.640 --> 40:32.280
So well, that's, that's, that's an interesting point.

40:32.280 --> 40:37.880
Yeah, you know, yeah, I, it is, so it's something to consider I think because it's really fascinating

40:37.880 --> 40:43.560
to really, it truly tells you what, what people's priorities are when they assign a dollar value

40:43.560 --> 40:49.000
to it in a way that is so much more tangible than, than emails and bug requests and all

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
these things.

40:50.000 --> 40:53.160
When people are actually willing to put money down for something, then you really know it's,

40:53.160 --> 40:55.660
it's literally of a value to them.

40:55.660 --> 40:58.800
So I, but I do understand you don't want to overset expectations and you guys seem to

40:58.800 --> 41:01.760
be, you know, walking that line pretty closely.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.880
I'm going to take a quick break right here and when we get back, I want to talk a little

41:04.880 --> 41:09.960
bit about maybe your thoughts on the future of mobile for talks, but first I hope you'll

41:09.960 --> 41:14.840
have some time this holiday to visit linuxacademy.com slash unplug so you can take advantage of

41:14.840 --> 41:19.280
our special 33% unplug discount, which is an incredible deal.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.440
Linuxacademy.com slash unplug.

41:21.440 --> 41:23.400
Go check them out right now.

41:23.400 --> 41:24.720
There's never been a better time.

41:24.720 --> 41:29.000
Step-by-step video courses, downloadable comprehensive study guides, bring them offline with you.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.840
This is reading material, but also audio and video material.

41:32.840 --> 41:34.720
You can plug it into your podcast player.

41:34.720 --> 41:37.080
You can learn from the presenters.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.820
They've got great audio setups.

41:38.820 --> 41:41.560
They're genuinely passionate about the topics.

41:41.560 --> 41:44.760
That's what makes them such great educators and you can sit there and absorb it as you

41:44.760 --> 41:49.520
travel as you're in the shower, like spooky sprite comes with your own server too.

41:49.520 --> 41:53.240
So when the courseware requires it, they automatically spin up a server for you on the backend and

41:53.240 --> 41:57.360
all of this, you get to choose from seven plus Linux distributions and have that courseware

41:57.360 --> 42:01.440
and the VMs automatically adjust to match the distribution you've chosen.

42:01.440 --> 42:04.920
You can keep track of your progress as you go and quiz yourself and Linux Academy has

42:04.920 --> 42:07.320
rolled out courses recently on Docker.

42:07.320 --> 42:11.640
Great opportunity to go learn Docker, Vagrant and Puppet and I'm talking about stuff that

42:11.640 --> 42:18.120
takes you from beginner, absolute beginner to professional, ready to be certified.

42:18.120 --> 42:22.080
One of their students recently took the AWS course and I got an email about this.

42:22.080 --> 42:26.320
After the AWS course, he got a certification and he actually went and got a job at Amazon.

42:26.320 --> 42:27.320
It's amazing.

42:27.320 --> 42:30.000
They have a community there that helps kind of bump you.

42:30.000 --> 42:33.600
When you're having sort of a down moment and you're having a hard time motivating, that's

42:33.600 --> 42:38.920
just enough to just give you a little bump to keep you going and the management system

42:38.920 --> 42:43.620
you have when you log into your Linux Academy dashboard is really, really great.

42:43.620 --> 42:46.760
They have something called learning plans too where you can say, okay Linux Academy,

42:46.760 --> 42:52.140
I got this much time this week and then Linux Academy will generate courseware for you based

42:52.140 --> 42:56.600
on your availability, custom tailored to you and it can send you email reminders about

42:56.600 --> 42:57.600
quizzes and stuff.

42:57.600 --> 43:02.840
I mean it's a really good way to adapt the program to you to match your ebb and flows

43:02.840 --> 43:03.840
of availability.

43:03.840 --> 43:04.840
It's life.

43:04.840 --> 43:09.120
We all have it and you can get started by going to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

43:09.120 --> 43:13.320
Also a lot of great new DevOps content has been flooding into Linux Academy as well as

43:13.320 --> 43:17.080
live streams so check it out, linuxacademy.com.

43:17.080 --> 43:20.720
We've also got some development stuff for Android, Python, PHP.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.820
If OpenStack is something you've heard a lot about but you don't really have your head

43:23.820 --> 43:29.320
wrapped around it, great OpenStack courses, great, great OpenStack courses.

43:29.320 --> 43:32.740
Some of the best in the industry really right there and in fact some of the biggest companies

43:32.740 --> 43:37.120
in the industry are working with Linux Academy because their courseware is so great.

43:37.120 --> 43:41.640
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

43:41.640 --> 43:43.200
the unplugged program.

43:43.200 --> 43:48.320
Okay, well before Ubuntu 14.10's release there was a lot of talk about how boring of a release

43:48.320 --> 43:49.320
it might be.

43:49.320 --> 43:54.680
I made an offhand comment in the news one episode and man oh man did I get a lot of

43:54.680 --> 43:55.680
response.

43:55.680 --> 44:02.040
Popeye was one of the blokes who felt perhaps my comment needed to be responded to so he

44:02.040 --> 44:04.560
and I had a nice chat about that.

44:04.560 --> 44:09.920
Alright, so I want to move into the topic that was sparked after Sunday's coverage of

44:09.920 --> 44:15.840
Ubuntu 14.10 and before we get into that, so in the Linux Action Show subreddit and

44:15.840 --> 44:21.640
in the email there are a lot of people that apparently decided that I am very biased against

44:21.640 --> 44:25.920
Ubuntu and one of the reasons decided was that I skipped over talking Unity's touch

44:25.920 --> 44:27.680
support when we were talking about GNOME 3.14.

44:27.680 --> 44:31.400
I just want to clear the ground right now, just quickly mention that was not me sliding

44:31.400 --> 44:35.800
Unity at all, that was just me focusing on GNOME 3.14 because we were covering GNOME

44:35.800 --> 44:36.800
3.14.

44:36.800 --> 44:40.320
We were not covering what Unity can do, we were covering what GNOME can do so I just

44:40.320 --> 44:41.320
didn't mention it.

44:41.320 --> 44:44.840
It doesn't mean I was intentionally because I don't like it leaving it out, it was because

44:44.840 --> 44:49.280
I was talking about GNOME and what GNOME was adding and what Wayland was adding.

44:49.280 --> 44:55.360
But there is more contention over our coverage of Ubuntu 14.10 itself.

44:55.360 --> 44:58.800
It's probably, you know what Matt, people hate crickets I think is what it is, people

44:58.800 --> 44:59.800
just hate crickets.

44:59.800 --> 45:00.800
I think it is, yeah.

45:00.800 --> 45:03.280
I think the crickets may have been something that kind of set folks off, I don't know it's

45:03.280 --> 45:04.280
funny.

45:04.280 --> 45:05.280
Yeah, it's just too much I think.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.280
Should have been a bomb going off.

45:06.280 --> 45:08.600
People love that, people love explosions.

45:08.600 --> 45:16.040
A lot of it boils down to a misunderstanding of, I think a lot of people attributed it

45:16.040 --> 45:21.600
to arch fanboyism on my part and that I was such an arch fanboy that I was putting Ubuntu

45:21.600 --> 45:23.480
down because of it.

45:23.480 --> 45:26.480
And I think a lot of it was probably coming from people who haven't watched the shows

45:26.480 --> 45:34.200
for a long time because I think people, sometimes what happens is people see that I am pro something.

45:34.200 --> 45:38.640
I was very pro Ubuntu, very pro Unity, the desktop for a long time, I still think it's

45:38.640 --> 45:40.520
a good desktop.

45:40.520 --> 45:47.760
And so because I was pro something for a long time, it is to them illogical that I would

45:47.760 --> 45:50.320
now say something that is not pro.

45:50.320 --> 45:54.200
Because once you like something, you're supposed to like it forever.

45:54.200 --> 45:58.960
But I think people who watch me know that my opinions change over time based on results

45:58.960 --> 46:00.120
and the way things go.

46:00.120 --> 46:01.600
I'll give you a great example.

46:01.600 --> 46:06.360
I think you could go back in time and you could clearly see episodes where I was slamming

46:06.360 --> 46:11.160
on Fedora, pretty handily slamming on Fedora for maybe the entire review.

46:11.160 --> 46:17.760
Now my position on Fedora has changed quite a bit as they sort of are addressing some

46:17.760 --> 46:18.760
of these problems.

46:18.760 --> 46:23.940
I would say I still approach Fedora with some depredation and some level of skepticism,

46:23.940 --> 46:26.600
but I am impressed with the changes they're making.

46:26.600 --> 46:28.320
I'm impressed with their project leader.

46:28.320 --> 46:32.720
Obviously we've had him on the show twice in a few weeks, and in the times of course

46:32.720 --> 46:35.440
the second time wasn't really about Fedora.

46:35.440 --> 46:38.780
So it was funny because in that very episode of people saying, well Chris is such an Arch

46:38.780 --> 46:42.360
fanboy, they were completely negating the fact that we had like a 25 minute interview

46:42.360 --> 46:45.060
with the lead of the project, of the Fedora project.

46:45.060 --> 46:52.560
My point is, it's not a bias towards Arch that influences my reporting on Ubuntu.

46:52.560 --> 46:56.020
I don't have any distribution bias at all.

46:56.020 --> 46:57.020
That would be ridiculous.

46:57.020 --> 47:03.120
The reason I go with Arch is because it does everything I need it to do, and it doesn't

47:03.120 --> 47:04.480
feel like a distribution.

47:04.480 --> 47:09.380
It doesn't have politics, it doesn't have councils, it doesn't have advisory boards.

47:09.380 --> 47:14.600
It just is, and you don't have to worry about the politics and the people.

47:14.600 --> 47:17.300
It feels just like a meta layer on top of Linux.

47:17.300 --> 47:18.760
That's why I like Arch.

47:18.760 --> 47:22.200
I could just as easily switch to Fedora next when they've got that rolling.

47:22.200 --> 47:25.360
I could see that happening in the next year or so.

47:25.360 --> 47:28.640
I don't have allegiance to any one particular distribution.

47:28.640 --> 47:33.680
I do have a bias though, and that bias is a bias towards winning.

47:33.680 --> 47:35.500
People who are doing it right.

47:35.500 --> 47:37.300
People who are producing results.

47:37.300 --> 47:40.640
People who are coming through on what they say they will do.

47:40.640 --> 47:45.620
And as a company, any project, doesn't have to be Ubuntu, as any project slides in one

47:45.620 --> 47:50.500
direction or the other, my coverage of that project will reflect that slide.

47:50.500 --> 47:54.520
So if they say, now I'm sorry Poby, but let's just say there were supposed to be two phones

47:54.520 --> 47:55.520
already in the marketplace.

47:55.520 --> 47:57.880
Let's just say Mir was already supposed to ship.

47:57.880 --> 48:02.000
Let's say that Ubuntu 14.10 is the most boring Linux desktop release we've ever seen from

48:02.000 --> 48:04.400
the most important distro maker out there.

48:04.400 --> 48:09.280
Let's accept all of these things as genuine facts, unfortunate facts, but let's just accept

48:09.280 --> 48:10.280
those things.

48:10.280 --> 48:15.000
Me reporting on that does not mean I have an Ubuntu agenda where I want to tear Ubuntu

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
down.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.760
It's me reporting on the state of Ubuntu, one of the more important distributions in

48:20.760 --> 48:21.760
the market.

48:21.760 --> 48:26.480
It's not coming from an arch influence, it's coming from following these things and maybe

48:26.480 --> 48:27.960
a little disappointment.

48:27.960 --> 48:29.760
Does that make sense?

48:29.760 --> 48:32.160
Matt can you fill in, am I missing any gaps here?

48:32.160 --> 48:33.440
I think you pretty much hit it.

48:33.440 --> 48:37.640
I mean, it's basically different, it really boils down to different strokes for different

48:37.640 --> 48:38.640
folks.

48:38.640 --> 48:39.960
I think it's just where it is at the end of the day.

48:39.960 --> 48:44.700
And for you, you have a specific set of expectations that one distro or another may or may not

48:44.700 --> 48:45.700
be meeting.

48:45.700 --> 48:47.800
And that could of course change over time.

48:47.800 --> 48:53.840
I think what I'm trying to get to is it feels like the conversation, I don't know if poisoned

48:53.840 --> 49:01.400
is the right word or derailed, but this latching on to, oh well, he's just saying that because

49:01.400 --> 49:02.720
he's a fan boy.

49:02.720 --> 49:06.600
Or Chris is too biased by Arch to cover it.

49:06.600 --> 49:12.560
Just me saying that out loud sounds ridiculous and childish.

49:12.560 --> 49:16.820
The concept that I would have some sort of allegiance to some Linux distribution that

49:16.820 --> 49:20.200
would influence my coverage of it is ridiculous.

49:20.200 --> 49:24.560
What I will do is identify a Linux distribution that does something interesting, and if they're

49:24.560 --> 49:29.420
doing that something better than everybody else is, I might suggest those other distributions

49:29.420 --> 49:34.320
try to adopt some of those things, but that doesn't make them invalid.

49:34.320 --> 49:36.240
I've used every distribution out there.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.840
I also don't report much on Mandriva, do I?

49:38.840 --> 49:43.120
That doesn't mean I have an anti-Mandriva bias, it just means they're not really moving

49:43.120 --> 49:46.220
the needle much these days, so they don't really work their way up into the coverage

49:46.220 --> 49:47.220
very often.

49:47.220 --> 49:51.880
Well, and I think it's also worth mentioning, and someone will undoubtedly point out, okay,

49:51.880 --> 49:56.400
then why does it appear that we quote-unquote rip on Ubuntu but not on Mandriva?

49:56.400 --> 50:01.160
And my response to that would be simply because we have a set of expectations for this particular

50:01.160 --> 50:04.940
distro, one that we've had a lot of great experiences with, and we just simply want

50:04.940 --> 50:07.080
to see certain things addressed, and that's not happening.

50:07.080 --> 50:08.800
I'm speaking for myself.

50:08.800 --> 50:14.120
Ubuntu's relevance in the marketplace makes it more likely to receive criticism, and it

50:14.120 --> 50:17.800
also makes it more likely to receive praise and hype, and I mean, there's two sides to

50:17.800 --> 50:18.800
that coin.

50:18.800 --> 50:19.800
Absolutely.

50:19.800 --> 50:20.800
Higher expectations.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.960
And so, like in the chat room's pointing out, why do we dog on Mir and not Weyland?

50:22.960 --> 50:25.080
Well, actually, I don't really think we dog on Mir.

50:25.080 --> 50:26.720
In fact, if you trace the-

50:26.720 --> 50:27.720
We didn't mention Mir in the last-

50:27.720 --> 50:32.280
Well, no, but if you trace the history of our show back, when Mir was announced, we

50:32.280 --> 50:36.360
were some of the biggest offenders of, hey, let him try it, give him space and let him

50:36.360 --> 50:40.160
do something, and we took so much shit for that.

50:40.160 --> 50:41.160
Like Matt and I-

50:41.160 --> 50:42.160
I dressed up in a monkey suit.

50:42.160 --> 50:43.160
I mean, come on, you know?

50:43.160 --> 50:44.160
Exactly.

50:44.160 --> 50:45.160
I brought the monkey suit to-

50:45.160 --> 50:49.360
Like, we were there saying, let him give him a shot, and the thing is, it's not that we

50:49.360 --> 50:52.760
don't want them to still have a shot, it's just the fundamental fact is, we're still

50:52.760 --> 50:53.760
waiting.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.040
That was a long time ago.

50:55.040 --> 50:56.200
That's fine.

50:56.200 --> 51:01.160
These things take time, but results, at the end of the day, are what we have to report

51:01.160 --> 51:02.160
on.

51:02.160 --> 51:03.840
That's what we have here to talk about.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.560
That's what the discussion is about.

51:05.560 --> 51:06.560
That's the reality.

51:06.560 --> 51:12.300
And so, when OMG Ubuntu is in bold and italic, saying there's no new features, not even a

51:12.300 --> 51:16.240
new wallpaper, what is the Linux action show supposed to say?

51:16.240 --> 51:19.440
What dick am I supposed to suck to make all of you happy?

51:19.440 --> 51:21.880
Because there's no dick I can find.

51:21.880 --> 51:24.480
Holy shit.

51:24.480 --> 51:25.480
Pretty much.

51:25.480 --> 51:26.480
Right?

51:26.480 --> 51:27.480
I mean, seriously.

51:27.480 --> 51:28.480
Yeah.

51:28.480 --> 51:29.480
I mean, I-

51:29.480 --> 51:33.940
So, we are working right now on a different approach to our Ubuntu reviews.

51:33.940 --> 51:38.120
That I think, it was producer Eric's idea, and I think it's a really solid idea that

51:38.120 --> 51:41.920
will make our Ubuntu 14.10 reviews extremely interesting.

51:41.920 --> 51:46.760
But it is requiring a completely reformulation of the way we approach a Linux distribution,

51:46.760 --> 51:49.240
because we have to find something to talk about, to talk about.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.840
Otherwise, we just wouldn't review it.

51:50.840 --> 51:52.960
And that doesn't seem like a good option either.

51:52.960 --> 51:57.800
I have covered this distribution for a long time, and I've never been at a point where

51:57.800 --> 52:01.020
I've literally had no idea what to say.

52:01.020 --> 52:02.020
Other than bad things.

52:02.020 --> 52:05.560
So, I'm working, so we're working on a new formula to come up, give the respins some

52:05.560 --> 52:08.640
attention and really kind of have a nice comprehensive look at it.

52:08.640 --> 52:12.240
But I'm pretty happy with where we're going with it, but it's required a total adjustment

52:12.240 --> 52:15.520
of our approach, because of the situation we now find ourselves in.

52:15.520 --> 52:20.320
And I feel like, you know, there's a lot of energy being put in by our community.

52:20.320 --> 52:24.880
There's about five threads in the Linux Action Show subreddit right now, if you count threads

52:24.880 --> 52:27.000
that have also devolved into this topic.

52:27.000 --> 52:31.320
So there's two or three primary threads, and one or two that have devolved into this topic.

52:31.320 --> 52:36.120
Currently live in the Linux Action Show subreddit, claiming that we are so far off base with

52:36.120 --> 52:41.040
Ubuntu 14.10, because of our biases and et cetera, et cetera.

52:41.040 --> 52:42.740
There's no way for me to tell you this.

52:42.740 --> 52:44.520
There's no anti-ubuntu agenda here.

52:44.520 --> 52:46.360
There's no arch bias here.

52:46.360 --> 52:48.480
There is a bias towards winning.

52:48.480 --> 52:53.120
There is some Linux elitism, because we've been Linux users for a very long time, and

52:53.120 --> 52:55.920
we start to know when something smells like shit, and we start to know when something's

52:55.920 --> 52:57.840
winning, and we call it like it is.

52:57.840 --> 53:00.040
I will grant you those things.

53:00.040 --> 53:05.680
Bias towards winning and an elitism that isn't arch elitism, it's just a Linux user elitism.

53:05.680 --> 53:09.680
It's just there, because honestly, after you see enough of this crap, you start to tell

53:09.680 --> 53:11.200
people to get off your lawn.

53:11.200 --> 53:14.600
It's not a function of being against Ubuntu.

53:14.600 --> 53:17.000
It's just calling a spade a spade, or whatever the saying is.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
I don't even know.

53:18.000 --> 53:21.320
It's just that's where we're at right now.

53:21.320 --> 53:25.040
I want to address this, because I'm seeing there's a lot of energy being put into this.

53:25.040 --> 53:27.200
So here's a great, and there's some great posts.

53:27.200 --> 53:33.440
I mean, a lot of thought is being put into this stuff, but it's kind of misguided in

53:33.440 --> 53:41.840
the sense that the trouble is we will continue to say if something's bad, I believe it is

53:41.840 --> 53:44.560
our responsibility if something isn't going right.

53:44.560 --> 53:48.760
We cannot sit here on this show that is the number one watched Linux media.

53:48.760 --> 53:52.980
I cannot sit on that show and say something is great when it's not great.

53:52.980 --> 53:57.560
It is our responsibility in any way we can to help these things move along in the right

53:57.560 --> 53:58.560
direction.

53:58.560 --> 54:02.620
If that's just our voice that's just echoing the thought of some users, that's fine.

54:02.620 --> 54:06.280
If other projects watch this stuff and go, hmm, maybe we should rethink this.

54:06.280 --> 54:07.280
That's great.

54:07.280 --> 54:10.960
It doesn't really matter, but we have to be genuine to what we believe, and you have to

54:10.960 --> 54:17.320
understand that it's not about us going after Shuttleworth, or making Popey cry, or anything

54:17.320 --> 54:22.260
like that, because at the end of the day, if you watch the show long enough, you will

54:22.260 --> 54:26.520
know that if they start producing results, if in 2015 we start seeing several great phone

54:26.520 --> 54:32.040
models come out, and it's kind of great, and down the road, Unity 8's got its bugs worked

54:32.040 --> 54:34.400
out, and it's great.

54:34.400 --> 54:37.520
We will be beyond elated to cover that on the show.

54:37.520 --> 54:41.240
I love covering stuff that rocks under Linux.

54:41.240 --> 54:44.500
That's why the word action is in the Linux action show.

54:44.500 --> 54:49.560
We like covering the stuff that kicks the most ass every single week in Linux and open

54:49.560 --> 54:50.560
source.

54:50.560 --> 54:53.120
I will be the happiest person.

54:53.120 --> 54:54.120
Trust me.

54:54.120 --> 54:58.260
Nobody will be happier than Chris, because it'll be great content for the Linux action

54:58.260 --> 55:00.860
show when they have something that we all love.

55:00.860 --> 55:01.860
Go ahead, Popey.

55:01.860 --> 55:03.600
You might as well go.

55:03.600 --> 55:08.600
So, there's a few things I didn't know about your review, because I was away at a conference

55:08.600 --> 55:14.120
over the weekend, and then someone pointed it out to me, and so I watched it a bit earlier

55:14.120 --> 55:15.120
on.

55:15.120 --> 55:16.920
And there's a few things that struck me.

55:16.920 --> 55:22.880
One was that you kind of missed the fact that we've been saying all through this release

55:22.880 --> 55:25.280
that the focus is on phone.

55:25.280 --> 55:27.280
We've said it over and over again.

55:27.280 --> 55:28.280
Oh, yeah.

55:28.280 --> 55:29.280
It's not lost on me.

55:29.280 --> 55:30.280
Not lost on me.

55:30.280 --> 55:32.160
It's pretty apparent.

55:32.160 --> 55:33.440
Right.

55:33.440 --> 55:38.920
But you've waited until beta release before you decide to review it and then say it sucks

55:38.920 --> 55:43.320
because of what we've been saying all along, which is that we're not focused on the desktop.

55:43.320 --> 55:50.600
This is specifically why I aired those concerns when we were talking about the beta release,

55:50.600 --> 55:53.760
because I want to put all that out on the table, and I don't want it to influence the

55:53.760 --> 55:54.760
review.

55:54.760 --> 55:55.760
It's out there now.

55:55.760 --> 55:56.760
Now it's not going to be part of the review.

55:56.760 --> 56:02.400
What I was essentially doing was taking that and extracting that bit of what would have

56:02.400 --> 56:04.840
been in the review and putting it in that news bit.

56:04.840 --> 56:09.440
And now when the review comes, that's not a review.

56:09.440 --> 56:12.640
Us covering something, and I'm picking on you about this because we get this all the

56:12.640 --> 56:13.640
time.

56:13.640 --> 56:19.560
Us covering a news item is not us reviewing something in the show, and it's a common misconception.

56:19.560 --> 56:24.680
You specifically said that we make a big song and dance about it, which we didn't.

56:24.680 --> 56:29.720
We've mailed a mailing list saying the beta is out, OMG posted an article about it.

56:29.720 --> 56:32.080
That doesn't mean we've made a song and dance about 1410.

56:32.080 --> 56:35.040
We haven't made a song and dance about 1410 because we're not focused on it.

56:35.040 --> 56:38.520
No, I think Matt's point there was that there used to be a song and dance.

56:38.520 --> 56:42.720
No, you specifically said about there being a song and dance.

56:42.720 --> 56:49.060
Anyway, that was one thing was why bring it up when we keep saying this is not a big release.

56:49.060 --> 56:54.880
It's not the first big release that's not had major stuff in it.

56:54.880 --> 56:58.720
Because it's more unusual for the in-between LTSs to be so boring.

56:58.720 --> 57:04.400
It's more often the LTS is about the refinement and the polish, and then the big experimentation

57:04.400 --> 57:05.800
happens in the.10 release.

57:05.800 --> 57:06.800
And that's always the one that's-

57:06.800 --> 57:07.800
Well, not really.

57:07.800 --> 57:08.800
610 didn't change much.

57:08.800 --> 57:11.880
1210 didn't change a lot, but 1210 had the shopping lens, so everybody had something

57:11.880 --> 57:12.880
to talk about.

57:12.880 --> 57:13.880
Right.

57:13.880 --> 57:17.320
Well, I think a lot of interesting things happened in the 10 releases, and shopping

57:17.320 --> 57:19.040
lens is obviously the big one.

57:19.040 --> 57:26.520
But those were both post-LTS releases, and they didn't have tremendously huge game-changing

57:26.520 --> 57:27.520
things in them.

57:27.520 --> 57:28.520
Are you going back to 610?

57:28.520 --> 57:29.520
I mean, that's-

57:29.520 --> 57:33.120
Well, that was the first one that came to mind, because the ones in the middle and the

57:33.120 --> 57:37.680
ones after that had Unity, and obviously that's a massive thing for people to talk about.

57:37.680 --> 57:38.680
Yeah, exactly.

57:38.680 --> 57:39.680
Go ahead.

57:39.680 --> 57:41.080
So the other thing is, it's not just Ubuntu.

57:41.080 --> 57:47.120
Not a lot has changed in Ubuntu, but then there's Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Studio,

57:47.120 --> 57:48.120
Myth20, Ubuntu Studio.

57:48.120 --> 57:49.120
I agree.

57:49.120 --> 57:50.120
That's where the interesting stuff is happening.

57:50.120 --> 57:51.120
It's just one distro.

57:51.120 --> 57:52.120
It's one flavor of the distro.

57:52.120 --> 57:53.120
Right.

57:53.120 --> 57:54.120
Well, oh, now they're just one flavors.

57:54.120 --> 57:58.000
Now, when that's the only place where the innovation is happening, now Ubuntu is just

57:58.000 --> 57:59.080
one of the many flavors.

57:59.080 --> 58:00.080
But of course, when all the innovation is happening-

58:00.080 --> 58:01.360
It's always been one of the many flavors.

58:01.360 --> 58:02.360
Now, of course.

58:02.360 --> 58:03.360
Of course, it's always, yeah.

58:03.360 --> 58:05.620
They're just, yeah, it's just one of, it's the main dog.

58:05.620 --> 58:08.600
And the point is, is all the innovation, all the excitement is happening in all of the

58:08.600 --> 58:12.080
other flavors, which, you know, worked great for a lot of-

58:12.080 --> 58:14.440
I wouldn't say there was a lot of excitement going on in any of the others either.

58:14.440 --> 58:15.440
Oh, ouch.

58:15.440 --> 58:16.440
To be honest.

58:16.440 --> 58:18.760
I haven't landed here, dude.

58:18.760 --> 58:19.760
Look at the Mate.

58:19.760 --> 58:21.960
Kubuntu's got Plasma 5 preview, dude.

58:21.960 --> 58:22.960
That's great.

58:22.960 --> 58:23.960
That's huge.

58:23.960 --> 58:28.040
That's not in the archive for the release.

58:28.040 --> 58:29.920
That's a preview ISO, isn't it?

58:29.920 --> 58:33.440
In the same way that Unity 8 Next is a preview ISO.

58:33.440 --> 58:35.760
Also the Mate project isn't officially an Ubuntu flavor.

58:35.760 --> 58:37.240
It seems like there's a common thread here.

58:37.240 --> 58:39.320
Which is one that I didn't list.

58:39.320 --> 58:40.320
My point is-

58:40.320 --> 58:41.320
Specifically because it's not an official release.

58:41.320 --> 58:44.360
So you don't think it's a problem that all of the interesting things are happening in

58:44.360 --> 58:46.640
all of the distros based off you?

58:46.640 --> 58:47.640
I didn't say that.

58:47.640 --> 58:53.400
I said there are other distros, there are other flavors of Ubuntu, and there are interesting

58:53.400 --> 58:54.400
things going on there.

58:54.400 --> 58:55.400
You only focused on Ubuntu.

58:55.400 --> 58:57.680
You didn't mention any of the others.

58:57.680 --> 58:58.680
Because what I was talking-

58:58.680 --> 58:59.940
That's the point I was making.

58:59.940 --> 59:03.020
Those others were going to- again, this wasn't a full review.

59:03.020 --> 59:05.240
This is an announcement of the Ubuntu 14.10 beta.

59:05.240 --> 59:06.240
Right.

59:06.240 --> 59:10.680
Well, in fact, Ubuntu doesn't participate in the alphas and betas as much as all the

59:10.680 --> 59:11.680
others do.

59:11.680 --> 59:14.560
So it would be more interesting to talk about all the others on this particular release.

59:14.560 --> 59:17.680
Oh, I like how you're telling- okay, oh, okay, right.

59:17.680 --> 59:18.680
So Popeye, you don't-

59:18.680 --> 59:23.200
No, is that not fair to say that these guys are all participating and building up to a

59:23.200 --> 59:24.840
beta release, so it would be good to talk about them?

59:24.840 --> 59:26.840
You don't see the justification you're doing here?

59:26.840 --> 59:31.400
You don't see the deferment that's happening by saying, well, yeah, of course, nothing's

59:31.400 --> 59:32.400
happening in Ubuntu.

59:32.400 --> 59:34.160
But don't pay attention to main Ubuntu.

59:34.160 --> 59:36.040
Don't pay attention to the most important distribution.

59:36.040 --> 59:38.960
Don't pay attention to the one that has all the people officially working for Canonical

59:38.960 --> 59:39.960
on.

59:39.960 --> 59:41.540
Pay attention to all the ones based off of us.

59:41.540 --> 59:43.200
Pay attention to these guys over here.

59:43.200 --> 59:44.200
This is a total change.

59:44.200 --> 59:48.280
No, I'm just saying that these others are just as important as Ubuntu, and, you know,

59:48.280 --> 59:49.280
we-

59:49.280 --> 59:50.280
That's not true at all.

59:50.280 --> 59:51.280
We provide support.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.280
That's not true at all.

59:52.280 --> 59:53.280
And you know that's not true at all.

59:53.280 --> 59:54.280
No, that is not true.

59:54.280 --> 59:57.000
They are very important, but they are not as important as Ubuntu.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.480
I don't believe that they're not as important as Ubuntu at all.

59:59.480 --> 01:00:00.480
Oh, come on.

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.480
Come on.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.560
No, I don't.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:09.240
We have an archive that has a variety of desktops, and more than there are flavors, you know,

01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:12.360
there's lots of other desktops in the archive that are important.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:18.200
In fact, Marte is now in the archive as well, and they're all important, but none of them

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.200
are-

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.200
I love all my children.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.200
Exactly.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:28.220
I know years ago, KDE felt themselves as the blue-headed stepchild, and that was frustrating

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:32.360
because we put a lot of work into all of them.

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.360
I'm just going to put that out there.

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.600
I'm not a fan.

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.400
So I think-

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.400
You're entitled to your opinion.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.400
Of course.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.400
I just think-

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.400
But it's not an opinion.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.680
I mean, yes, my opinion that it is- where the opinion comes in is in my disappointment,

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.600
but the fact of the matter is there really is nothing to talk about.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.600
Right.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.600
Okay.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:56.280
But you could argue that that's the same thing with every LTS.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.840
This isn't an LTS release.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:01.520
No, they're the same package with every time there's something that they release right

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.360
after an LTS, it always happens.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.800
It's just more refinement to the LTS.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:06.800
Not always.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:07.800
No, that's kind of my point.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.560
The 10.10, 12.10, 14.10, it's the same.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:14.440
You just listed all the ones where they rolled out major changes to the Unity Dash, including

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:15.920
search and privacy features.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.440
The ones you just named where there was massive changes.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:22.760
No, the 10.10 was known too.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:28.160
12.10 was slight changes with the adding search, adding Amazon search to it.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:29.160
That's not a slight change.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.160
That's not a slight change.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:31.480
That's a huge change.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.520
As far as functionality, it's the same.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.520
I mean, it's basically...

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:35.520
All right.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.520
I don't want to argue version numbers.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.200
You add Amazon search to the dashboard, that's a big change.

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.200
There's a lot to talk about.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:44.320
When you're an LTS, just being an LTS, that's something to talk about.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.320
Okay?

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.600
You guys...

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.640
We're getting down into the weeds of what versions of Ubuntu have what features.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.840
The important part is, what I want to walk you from is, A, that wasn't a review, okay?

01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:59.040
We're going to do something different for the actual review where we'll take a look

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.460
at the spin.

01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:05.200
So don't consider that like our final opinion on Ubuntu 14.10.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:10.560
However, we are at an interesting point in Ubuntu's history right now.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.920
We're kind of in the thick of it, and we are documenting what happens while they are making

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:18.080
this huge, huge, huge transition.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.520
This is what happens right now.

01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.880
We don't know, and we're not casting what's going to happen.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.040
We're not projecting what's going to happen, but what we do know is right now, what we

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:31.440
get, so what we will get in the long run is potentially a competitive mobile operating

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.120
system that has some great features that could tie in really nicely with desktops and offer

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.280
power Linux users a great experience.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.680
But what we have today is not a great experience for Linux power users today, and that's what

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.680
we're documenting.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:43.680
The fact that we...

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:49.360
Just because we released 12.10 doesn't make 12.04 instantly, sorry, doesn't make 14.04

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.360
instantly obsolete.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.360
Right.

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:55.480
Actually, I think that's the interesting thing about 14.10 is, in a lot of ways, it doesn't

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.800
change 14.04's relevance at all.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:02.120
You add a few PPAs to 14.04, you don't even have to change anything, right?

01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.120
Right.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:11.080
And we do hardware enablement kernels and XOR back ports to the LTS release, so yeah.

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:19.000
You could consider 14.10 to be not exciting, not that much going on, so fine.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.360
That's happened in the past.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:25.520
We're focused on other stuff, and we'll come back to desktop next release.

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:31.200
I kind of feel like, I mean, so why am I getting beat up on for saying that?

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.440
I don't know.

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:37.480
I was quite surprised myself that people reacted so badly.

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.520
My only point was that you only focused on Ubuntu and didn't focus on the others.

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.840
Well, and that was a little slight of hand because I plan to focus more on the respins

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:48.360
later and I figured I'd get that criticism out of the way so that way it wasn't in the

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:49.360
review.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:51.040
It's me pre-setting up the review.

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:57.560
It's me kind of, so some of this was formatting for the show, for the arc of the story here.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.480
I didn't talk about Unity's multi-touch support because we had just talked about that and

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.120
I was talking about Gnome, so people took that as me sliding Unity.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:08.480
And then when we got to the Ubuntu 14.10 discussion, I didn't really talk about the remixes and

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.620
the reflavors because that's what we're going to focus on in the review because what the

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:13.240
hell else can we focus on?

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.260
And I don't want to just spend the whole review criticizing all of the mistakes and retrashing

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:19.880
the software center like we often do.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:21.760
So we got it out right there in the news segment.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.760
Now it's done.

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:27.880
Now it's sort of like, it's setting up the narrative for the review, setting up the expectations,

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.320
setting up the state of things, and then-

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.600
I tell you what, I'm really looking forward to this review.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.600
This sounds awesome.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.600
And then we deliver.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.600
Well, we'll see.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.600
I mean, maybe not.

01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.600
We'll see.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:43.280
But you know, so I guess people kind of jump down like our throats a lot lately whenever

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:45.520
we kind of bring up the topic of Ubuntu.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:50.660
And it sort of feels like there's an expectation that we really should only talk about the

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:52.200
good stuff.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.840
And I could agree there could be more good stuff we talk about.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.480
Yeah, but we get grief for that too though.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.480
Yeah, exactly.

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:02.180
Well, that was the thing is like we used to get a ton of grief about that.

01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:04.040
But this week it was particularly strong.

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.640
So I don't know if we've helped.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:11.840
I don't know if we've made any sense in any of this, but I definitely want to tamp down.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:18.000
I find it personally insulting to be called an arch fanboy because it implies that I am

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.680
so simple-minded that my preference for one distribution over another would somehow like

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:28.680
infect how I think about everything in my life when really-

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.680
There was one other thing.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.680
Oh, yeah.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:31.680
Go on.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.160
I forgot to mention the gnome release schedule, meaning that we don't have the latest and

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.560
greatest gnome in our races anymore.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:38.560
Yeah, okay.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.560
That's a good one.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:44.800
Yeah, that's kind of sad and it's a bit frustrating that we can't sync those things up.

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:49.720
It would be nice if we could, but our six months releases have been like that for 10

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720
years.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:54.720
And when we had gnome as a desktop, I think we made exceptions and would pull it in at

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720
the last minute.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:59.400
But now gnome isn't our default desktop.

01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:06.400
So should we bust a gut to get gnome in there for the final release when it isn't even our

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.520
default desktop?

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.520
I agree.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:12.920
And the fact that there is a pretty good PPA system in place where you can grab it.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:16.160
The reason why, and I don't think I said this in the show, but the reason why I would love

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:20.240
to see it just as a personal preference is, A, it would definitely make Ubuntu feel much

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:22.800
more like a contender for me to use as my daily driver.

01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:25.160
But there's Ubuntu gnome edition.

01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:29.720
But also it just kind of seems like maybe while Unity isn't seeing a lot of stuff, why

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:33.720
we're just going just small bug fixes here and there, wouldn't it be really cool if there

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:39.680
was a very fresh, being worked on desktop, available to me to choose from, and that would

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.680
be gnome 3.14.

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:45.480
And to be honest with you, I honestly think a lot of Linux users are going to install

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:49.280
Fedora 21 because it'll be one of the first distros that does gnome 3.14 out of the box

01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:52.440
and they will install it just for that reason alone.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:57.280
And so it would just be a nice feather in the Ubuntu 14.10's cap if it could be like

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:00.600
a great way to get gnome 3.14 right out of the box.

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.200
That's why I kind of brought it up because I think that would be a great combo while Unity's

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.320
kind of on the shelf.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:07.640
But I understand release schedules and whatnot.

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:08.640
That's just how it goes.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.040
And the PPAs solve that.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.040
That's fine.

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:17.720
Jaron mentions maybe it's not what we're talking, but maybe it's how it's brought up.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:21.920
I think maybe that's potentially true, but at the end of the day, you have to understand

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.360
that we have to provide some level of entertainment too.

01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:26.280
So there has to be something to engage people.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:30.520
There has to be something that makes people really feel passionate and want to engage

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:35.680
with us because sometimes if you just keep it really dry and boring, people get bored

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:36.720
and they tune out.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.720
So sometimes if it's presented in a certain way that you find offensive, consider that

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.440
maybe it's being presented in a certain way to grab attention.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:47.720
Well, for the love of God, people, stop being so friggin' sensitive.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:49.740
I mean, that's my big thing.

01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.920
First and foremost, I recommend Ubuntu to everybody.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.920
I do.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.520
And I rip on them hard because I have high expectations.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:58.640
Everyone I know that recently switched to Linux is using Ubuntu and I will continue

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.120
to do so because it's a good distro.

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:04.920
I will also continue to rip on it because I care.

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.800
I'll throw this in for you, Chris.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:13.000
Today I installed Fedora 21, Fedora 20, and Antegros.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.720
What possessed you to do such a thing?

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:16.720
You'll find out later.

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:17.720
Oh, okay.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:18.720
Oh, Mr. Relic.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:24.800
So I just, I don't know, I don't know if we're going to ever resolve this because it's such

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.800
a fundamental.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.860
I understand, you know, you guys are really passionate about some of these projects.

01:08:28.860 --> 01:08:32.680
Some of you don't just contribute, you know, your voice, but you also contribute your time

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.040
and your code.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:38.600
And I don't want to discourage anybody from volunteering on any open source project they're

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.600
into.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:46.800
And I hope you will maybe consider, just stick with us for a little bit and consider that

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:51.900
our opinions are not, I think it's a benefit to be somebody who constantly reevaluates

01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:54.080
the way they think about things and their opinions of things.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.320
And you can see over time those will transition.

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:00.640
There's a lot of things over the history of the Linux action show where we came down pretty

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:01.640
hard on something.

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:07.120
And as they were, as those things were addressed, our, I mean, Gnome is another one.

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.120
Gnome 3.

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:09.120
Oh yeah.

01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:10.120
Right?

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.640
I mean, and the reason was is at first Gnome 3 was no good.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.640
It just was no good.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.080
And it has gotten a lot better.

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:19.160
And now our tone, our coverage of Gnome has changed to reflect that.

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.460
It's just kind of natural if you think about it.

01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:22.460
It's not that weird.

01:09:22.460 --> 01:09:25.920
It just, it doesn't, it's just kind of, it's not a fanboy thing.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.480
It's just action speak louder than words.

01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:29.200
I'm teasing it off a lot, Wimpy.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.320
What process are we about to go through right now?

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:32.320
Right.

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:33.320
Okay.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.120
So everyone probably knows that's listening to this, that Ubuntu MATE 14.10 was released

01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:43.880
a couple of weeks ago and we've been preparing an Ubuntu MATE 14.04 release and I'm actually

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.280
ready to go through the keystrokes to release it live now.

01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:52.280
So we're going to release the latest version, which is based on 14.04 right here on air.

01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:53.280
That's right.

01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:54.280
Let's do it.

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.280
Right here on air.

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:56.280
Okay.

01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:02.280
So I've got my terminator sessions open and I've logged into my two digital ocean build

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.280
servers.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.880
This is where I prepare the ISO images.

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.160
I've already prepared the images and I'm going to run the release scripts and the release

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:16.000
scripts build the WebC torrents, actually make the ISOs from the squash FS, add the

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:23.120
assets from the official Ubuntu CD releases, and then I'll sync them to my distribution

01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:24.120
servers.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.080
So let's do that now.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.080
So off we go.

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.240
Right.

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:31.840
So that's the power of digital ocean.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:37.120
That's just shunted six gigabytes of data.

01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:38.120
Really?

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.120
Wow.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:46.760
We'll now just edit the release flag on the article.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:52.440
Now we'll run the deploy script.

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:53.440
This is so exciting.

01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:54.440
I know, right?

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.440
I know.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.920
This is actually the geekiest thing I think we've ever done on the show and I love it.

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:02.600
So the deploy script basically takes all the markdown that the site is generated from and

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:04.560
turns it into HTML.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.560
So that's done.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:17.160
So now I go to my CDN and I prefetch all of those images into the CDN and that's done.

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:25.080
And now I purge the blog index from my cloud flaring and that just makes sure that the

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:31.200
updates go through and I think we're done.

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.040
So you just witnessed an operating system being released live.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:37.320
So you pushed the whole website and everything in that.

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.320
Yeah.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.320
There you go.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.880
So if you go to Ubuntu mate.org slash blog, the article that you'll see now is the release

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.880
notes on the article.

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:51.440
So if you go to Ubuntu mate.org slash download, yes, that should redirect I think because

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.200
there's two bits in there.

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.200
You know what, Wimpy?

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.200
You just earned yourself...

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.200
Very nice, sir.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.200
Very nice.

01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.200
Thank you very much.

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.200
Thank you very much.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:07.840
Let's stop talking about the future for a second and let's talk about something I think

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:12.480
most desktop Linux users who bounce around desktop environments have experienced.

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:17.360
You ever seen this problem where you got an application and it has a little system tray

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:25.160
icon and maybe that particular developer decided, I don't want to implement the app indicator

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.160
support for Ubuntu.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.640
So when you're in Ubuntu's Unity desktop, you don't get an icon up in the right hand

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:30.640
corner.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.760
But when you're in KDE, you do get the icon and know maybe it's hit and miss.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.240
You've seen this kind of thing, right?

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.240
Oh, absolutely.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.240
Absolutely.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.840
And it's something I've definitely experienced, but it also colors based on the level of difficulty

01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.040
which direction I'm going to go through.

01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.040
Sure.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:50.200
Because I've certainly had that experience both in Unity and KDE, less in Gnome.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.280
But yeah, it's certainly happened.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.280
Sure.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:56.960
And see, I feel like I've had more success in like almost all of the little tray icons

01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:58.200
show up in KDE.

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:02.360
It's totally hit and miss in Unity and Gnome's gotten a lot better about it, but it's still

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:03.760
hit and miss in Gnome.

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:09.360
And this itty bitty tiny bit of fragmentation was introduced when a couple of different

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.480
desktops decided to implement or really one desktop decided to implement app indicators

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.440
differently than the other desktops.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:19.160
And even today, years later, we still get that wrong.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.640
And let's be clear for what it is.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:23.640
It looks like amateur hour.

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.040
It looks pathetic.

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:29.920
It's something that the Mac OS or Chrome OS or Windows would never get wrong and does

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.320
not ever get wrong.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:33.000
It looks ridiculous.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.260
And I think we have to be clear when we're having this conversation that this type of

01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:42.960
little itty bitty fragmentation has much wider ramifications than how people appreciate and

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.160
experience a desktop.

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:47.560
And this as I'm going to use this example because it's something we can all relate to

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:50.360
and then we're going to look at the larger ramifications of the fragmentation at the

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:51.360
display server level.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.280
But what I want us all to think about as we are moving forward in this conversation is

01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:00.560
look at the future directory of Linux of desktop Linux, quote unquote, desktop Linux competition,

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.760
because it's not Windows.

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.000
It might be Windows today.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.080
It might be Windows for the next few years.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.080
But five, 10 years down the road on the high end, it's Mac OS 10.

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:11.720
On the low end, it's Chrome OS and Android.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:17.200
And those desktops would never be caught dead with that kind of amateur hour implementation.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.600
That was not going to happen.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.680
And that is our competition.

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.840
If you look at the forward directory of the trajectory of the desktop market, that's who

01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:24.960
we're competing against.

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:31.120
And those platforms, specifically Android, Chrome OS and Mac OS 10 already have a worldwide

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:35.160
distribution system with massive amounts of momentum behind them.

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.600
They have stores in almost every country around the world.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:39.840
You can order online.

01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.680
They have a brand image around them.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.360
And that's what future Linux is going to be competing with.

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.360
That's what we're competing with.

01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.460
And we are not even bringing our A game.

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:50.920
We're not even we're not even doing a very good job with our current setup.

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:55.520
And now we're about to introduce fragmentation at the core level of the desktop that we have

01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:01.800
A, never had fragmentation before, and B, are fundamentally under resourced to properly

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:03.160
develop it as it is.

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:08.880
The X team already split to have one team work on X11 and one team work on Wayland.

01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:10.020
Well think about this.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:14.120
What if Ubuntu in some parallel universe had decided to go with Wayland?

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:17.280
That would mean millions of more users banging on Wayland.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:21.760
That would mean more bug fixes, more refinement at a higher pace to Wayland, making that core

01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:25.840
part of the Linux desktop experience more refined, more tested, more performant.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:28.940
All of these things that matter, especially as game developers are moving over to Linux.

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:30.740
But instead, we are splitting our resource.

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:31.740
We are splitting our attention.

01:15:31.740 --> 01:15:32.960
We are splitting our testing.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.440
We're splitting our development time.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.040
And at the same time, we're introducing all kinds of fragmentation that developers are

01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:39.300
going to have to account for.

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.160
Because here's how humans work, right?

01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:42.340
You're going to have your distribution.

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:43.540
You're going to develop on that.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:46.720
It's either going to be a Wayland based distribution or a Mir based distribution.

01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:49.840
And whatever it is, that's the one you're going to properly test on because that's the

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.800
one you use, and that's the one that the features are going to work correctly on.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:57.680
When I go to the next track in Clementine, whichever distro display server the Clementine

01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:02.680
developer is using for, that's the one I need to use if I want the next track onscreen notification.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.640
And that's even more amateur hour.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:09.160
We are introducing a level of fragmentation at the core of Linux that will mean that applications

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.920
are even more hit and miss now in what they feature.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:13.700
Does this application have a screenshot button?

01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:14.700
Maybe it does.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:15.700
Maybe it doesn't.

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:16.700
It depends on what desktop you're on.

01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:17.700
Do you get an onscreen display?

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:18.700
Maybe you do.

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:19.700
Maybe you don't.

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:20.700
Maybe you don't care.

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:23.200
Because if you only want to use Unity for the rest of your life, then Mir is going to

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.200
work great for you.

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:27.120
But if you ever want to use Ubuntu with another distribution, well you better learn how to

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.400
install Wayland.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:32.480
You better figure out, this is going to be an explosion in blog posts on how to load

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:34.500
Wayland on Ubuntu desktops.

01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:38.480
Because everybody out there that wants to use anything but Unity ever is going to need

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:41.280
to learn how to install Wayland on their Ubuntu machine.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:43.060
And that's another reason why you should care.

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:44.520
The reasons stack up.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:49.760
And this, these very issues, these fundamental issues are exactly the kind of thing that

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.760
affect users.

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.220
So why I might not care if it's Mir or Wayland, I sure as hell care if my application doesn't

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:55.220
work correctly.

01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.000
I sure as hell care if I have to spend an hour figuring out how to install Wayland on

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.400
my Ubuntu install so that way I can try out Gnome 3 whatever.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.280
It does absolutely affect users.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.600
It fundamentally affects users.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:10.800
I think it also slows down adoption in a very serious way.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:11.800
Big time.

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.880
Yeah, and that's the piece that I see the biggest.

01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:17.320
Because at the end of the day, granted, I fall back to my old, the market will sort

01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.600
it out and it will.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.520
But we shouldn't have to sort it out in the first place.

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:24.960
I mean, that's the big piece of it right there is that we're spending unneeded time sorting

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.600
this out when it shouldn't have been an issue in the first place at all.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.600
Right.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.600
And it's going to get sorted, but it's going to be like a 10 year process.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.760
Developers are always like, oh, Linux is too fragmented.

01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.080
I don't know what I should target.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:38.200
This just changes the equation even more.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:42.440
You look at how 3D games capture the mouse pointer.

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:46.640
That's going to be different between desktops or display environments.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.660
Game developers are going to have to think about this kind of stuff.

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.860
And the other thing is, you know, from my old contracting background, and Aaron touches

01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.680
on this in his post and I thought it was really well done.

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:58.580
He says, think about it from an IT support perspective, right?

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:04.060
You already get people like, I had several clients that had Linux on the desktop.

01:18:04.060 --> 01:18:08.240
And you know, the problems would always arise if one person was on one distro and another

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.720
person was another distro.

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.180
One person would have something work.

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:12.320
Another person wouldn't.

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.400
And then it would be, oh, well, you need the build utils.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.060
Well, what's that called on Fedora?

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:17.060
What's that called on Ubuntu?

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:21.560
I mean, it's already the diversity that we have there, while in some ways it strengthens

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:25.720
and empowers Linux, it also from a support standpoint is already too complicated.

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.760
Well, that's what's just going to happen when the display server changes.

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:33.560
Currently, as Aaron writes, guides and manuals covering Linux can assume that Xorg is running

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.880
and other troubleshooting tips with that assumption can be in place.

01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:41.400
This is also one reason why the Linux world is standardizing on system D is such a good

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:42.400
thing.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:46.120
Support will become easier when we don't have to ask, are you using system with system

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.320
5 in it, system 7 in it, system D, Upstart?

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.800
You just have to start troubleshooting at that level.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.440
Multiple display systems will produce a similar result.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:58.660
In commercial settings, this also translates to more cost, particularly to companies who

01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:02.300
provide professional IT support for companies running desktop systems.

01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:03.560
Does this matter to users?

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:08.480
Well, it means less clear documentation, more difficult support for Linux and higher commercial

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.480
support costs.

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.280
So yes, I would argue that matters to users.

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:17.320
And man, did that resonate with me because I have been, I have watched Linux go from

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:21.800
the ha ha ha joke when I recommend it to, yeah, let's implement Linux, right?

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:26.120
And I have been advocating the deployment of Linux in businesses for years and I was

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.320
already feeling the pushback from like my doctor clients all wanted Macs and all my

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:32.000
doctors wanted to get Macs.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:37.560
And I really, it is, you know, as soon as that support argument is brought up, my arguments

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:41.760
are clearly deflated because how do you compete with Apple stores everywhere?

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:45.580
How do you compete with a, you know, a warranty in writing and a system that's honestly less

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:46.580
of a moving target?

01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:48.480
It's really hard for me to fight against that.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:49.480
Yep.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:53.120
It's a unified experience that I don't, even if we go system D, we go Wayland, we go the

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:54.120
whole thing.

01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:56.000
We still don't have a unified experience.

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.840
We don't at any level.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:01.900
And it's happening at a time where we could be coalescing around Wayland.

01:20:01.900 --> 01:20:04.000
We could be coalescing around system D, right?

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.240
And these are major coalitions that could be happening.

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:08.240
And he says, go ahead.

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:13.240
I was going to say, if they get those two and they get the packaging figured out, you

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:14.240
know, Bob's your uncle.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.240
You're good.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:18.080
Those three things together would do wonders.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.440
Aaron points out, you know, this matters to display systems.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.280
One thing free software does not have is enough of its graphic developers.

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:27.360
With Xorg, there were exactly one place you could contribute to if you wanted to push

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:31.160
forward the display stack on a free software operating system, such as Linux.

01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:34.740
Then Mir came along and introduced a split in the developer community, which means fewer

01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:39.960
human resources applied to a topic that really needs every single pair of hands we have.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.480
Instead of one system that as good as we can make it, we'll end up with a slower development

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:47.620
of two systems with the risk of more of them being less than great.

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:51.640
And I think this part could be argued because you could say good competition spurs good

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.640
innovation.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:58.520
But at the same time, if you're familiar with the core X development, you know how bad that

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:02.920
situation is and how much we do need all hands on deck for that kind of thing.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:06.200
And you know, Aaron points out this is obviously no minor task.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:12.040
Mir was originally promised to be the display system of choice and desktop Ubuntu in 2013-10.

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:16.600
Then it was pushed back to 2014-04, and now it's pushed out to 2016-04.

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:20.520
This is not a trivial sort of project, and making it harder by limiting human resources

01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:22.400
available is unwise.

01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:26.960
And I think what we fall back on too often, and I think something we can chant, there's

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:29.760
a couple of things we chant a lot in the Linux community.

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:33.640
Well, yeah, maybe KDE isn't making you happy, but you know what, it's great because you

01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.640
got choice.

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:38.200
Well, that choice is not all that great if none of the choices are awesome.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.720
So but you know, Saigo says he's hopeful.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:42.360
He says, I do hold out hope.

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.720
The free software community is speaking with a singular voice, and that voice is saying

01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.560
after X, it's Wayland.

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:50.940
Wayland itself is still being worked on and has reached a level of maturity that allows

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.560
real world use.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:56.400
Several of the major desktop products are well on their way of supporting it as a first

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:00.160
class option, including Plasma by KDE, Gnome Shell, and Enlightenment.

01:22:00.160 --> 01:22:03.440
All the major toolkits upstream have support for Wayland today, and Wayland has the broadest

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:06.840
driver support next only to X itself.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:07.840
So that's a good point to be made.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:08.840
So he's a little hopeful.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:11.360
And he goes on to say, the Mir team keeps bringing up these topics, although so does

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.360
the KDE team.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.440
What's up?

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:16.680
But he says maybe they need to defend their position, so does the KDE team.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:23.040
I can emphasize with how, how they, how, how, I don't want to repeat what he's saying here,

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:26.040
but what he says is, I can emphasize that they are working on something they truly believe

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.680
in, and they're being told it's the wrong thing to do.

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:32.480
He says, I feel it is their right to develop Mir at their heart's content, and I cheer

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:33.480
their moxie.

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:37.880
Similarly, it is our right as developers and users to choose what to support and what not

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:38.880
to.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.200
Such decision making is aided by having an accurate and complete information, and it's

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.200
with that goal in mind that I wrote the post above.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:48.400
I thought this was a great post, because I think what we are entering into is an era

01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:52.800
of unprecedented fragmentation in the graphical space for Linux.

01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:57.160
And I want to, and I, and I, I want to reel it back in here, because I'm pretty upset

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:02.160
about this, the more I think about this, because what I see this potentially as, is I see this

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:07.680
as, I don't want to use the words I'm thinking of, but the,

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:11.440
Is this a politically correct version, maybe?

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:19.720
Well, it is, it is hobbling desktop applications in order to push forward the Ubuntu agenda.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:25.960
I don't believe we can, we have already seen Unity itself introduce a level of fragmentation

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:29.880
that is below commercial desktops, that would be intolerable for commercial desktops.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:34.000
We have already seen that frag, we've already seen the play out of that.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:39.400
So when you introduce some fundamental stuff at the, at the display server level, you either

01:23:39.400 --> 01:23:41.520
have two options as a developer.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:46.200
You try to target both main display servers, and one of those targets is probably not going

01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:49.940
to be as optimal as the other, or you simply ignore one altogether.

01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:53.520
In either scenario, users lose.

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:57.480
So if you don't care about what display server you're using, then you probably ought to stop

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.600
using Linux, because at the, at the end of the day, this is going to fundamentally change

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.520
how the application landscape looks on Linux.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:08.280
And even if it is just one application has an on-screen display on one display server

01:24:08.280 --> 01:24:13.440
and doesn't on the other, that is enough to have me upset, because that is unacceptable.

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:14.800
It is not good enough.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:18.520
And I want the most kick-ass display server possible.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.440
We have the most kick-ass kernel possible.

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:23.000
How about we get the rest of the stack as kick-ass as we can?

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.360
And to sabotage a display server like this for one company's personal gain in a mobile

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:31.340
market that is not likely to be tremendously successful anyways, feels awfully selfish

01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:32.340
to me right now.

01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:36.940
Well, you know, I honestly, and I think even Valve will be included in this, I don't think

01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:40.400
anyone's going to give a ripping rat's butt about Mir one way or the other going forward.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.400
I really don't.

01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:46.320
I think just from the backyard developer guy who's doing this in his boxer shorts down

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:49.560
to the multi-billion dollar corporation, I don't, I think they're going to look at

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:53.120
this fundamentally and be like, you know, honestly, uh, I'm going to go whichever

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:57.460
way the community is going, whichever way the draw, uh, you know, the video card vendors

01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:01.320
are going, whichever way direction they're headed, basically it's a numbers game.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:05.360
And so I think this potentially, I'm hoping I'm right on this, that this could work itself

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:06.680
out fairly early on.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:10.360
I'm hoping the more I think about it, the more I think that it's a, you know, look,

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.640
I mean, it's definitely early days.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:16.680
And I think something I wanted to kind of kick around to the mumble room is maybe abstraction

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:17.680
can solve it.

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:22.000
Cause we're all looking at this with today's set of problems and today's set of tools to

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000
solve this problem.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Sure.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:27.280
And I think also, you know, uh, something that Martin and Aaron were trying to make

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.260
the pushes is developers are users too.

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:33.680
And in fact, I think developers make up a good user base of Linux, right?

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:36.840
I think that's probably who a lot of the develop users are, are developers.

01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.920
So by impacting developers, you are impacting the users of Linux.

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:41.000
And I think you're going to, that's it.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.120
That's a segment that's going to continue to outgrow any other segment of Linux usage.

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:48.760
But I don't, anybody in the mumble room want to take a first shot at this?

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.920
Is this a, is this a problem that future Chris and Matt aren't even going to have to worry

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:52.920
about?

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:54.640
Can I ask you a question, Chris?

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.240
Go for it, puppy.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:05.000
What's the single most used display server on Linux right now, as in, in most, in most

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000
deployments?

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000
Xorg?

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
No.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.080
Surface Flinger on Android in way more deployments than anything else.

01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:15.080
Wayland, Mir, or Xorg?

01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.080
Hmm.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.080
Good trick question, Popey.

01:26:17.080 --> 01:26:18.080
That was a good one.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:24.960
Surface Flinger is the display server on Android.

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:30.720
Nobody seems to have told them that they can't have their own internal project for a display

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:34.840
server, which is used on millions of devices.

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:35.840
But the difference there...

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.880
Why do we get, why do we get that flag?

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.360
But isn't the difference there, those are, but that's a, that's sort of, in a sense,

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.120
a whole cloth creation, right?

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:48.560
Where it's a whole new ecosystem with a whole new set of apps that are designed for that

01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:49.560
system.

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:50.560
But on the Linux side...

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:51.560
Just like Ubuntu 5.

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.560
Yeah, exactly.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.920
Well, if anything, the most biggest problem is it's a whole different paradigm compared

01:26:55.920 --> 01:27:00.560
to our legacy or at least what everything else has ever been.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:03.720
I mean, I think Popey makes a good point, but I think that, I think the, the subtle

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:08.760
difference is that you only have to target Surface Flinger on Android.

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:09.760
All right.

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.840
So when you're making your Android apps, it's not really something that even has to be a

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:12.840
consideration, but on...

01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:13.840
No, you don't.

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.840
You don't.

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:18.320
Because the stack, that's abstracted away from you in exactly the same way that Robert

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:23.040
and Robert Carr have both blogged about that stuff is abstracted away from you by the toolkit.

01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:27.400
You would disagree then with the assertion that Cygo and Martin are making that it's

01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:29.640
not quite as abstract as everyone would like.

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:34.680
No, I'm suggesting that there are certain edge cases where you need to know about the

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:37.120
underlying fundamental bits and pieces.

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:43.000
And yeah, a screenshot tool is a real easy shooting fish in a barrel, you know, one to

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:48.080
pick because it obviously needs interaction with the display server.

01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:53.100
But there are way more applications out there than there are screenshot tools.

01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:56.860
And there are way more developers out there developing tools with toolkits, which will

01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:02.040
just work on these display servers and won't have this problem.

01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:06.280
So you say the canonical has the amount of influence and power that Google has when it

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:10.920
comes to the mobile marketplace is just a little bit of a excessive state.

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:12.440
Did I say that?

01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:17.160
When it comes to comparing surface slinger to mirror a little bit.

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:18.720
No, you didn't.

01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.840
All I'm suggesting is that it's not actually important.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:28.480
All I'm suggesting is that it's entirely possible for someone to come up with a display server

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:34.680
on Linux which isn't Wayland and isn't X and for them to deploy that to a large number

01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:40.320
of handsets around the world and it work and for application developers to do their work

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:44.640
on top of that and not really care that it's surface fling underneath and not Xorg or Wayland

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:45.640
or whatever.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:50.840
So I think the fundamental disagreement I see here is one side thinks that it's really

01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:55.760
not going to be that big of a ramifications for developers or application functionality

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:58.920
and another side seems to disagree with that position.

01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:05.560
The surface area of mobile is also far smaller in a way that it's very specific.

01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:12.040
Its kernel is predefined other than the Cyanogen mods or whatever personally built mods that

01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:13.040
Android has.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.360
Otherwise the desktop is very, very different.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:20.000
There's a lot more ambiguity.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.520
And it's a lot harder to do which is one of the reasons why Mir hasn't landed in the desktop.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:29.880
It's kind of the point you mentioned that if it comes down to here's a toolkit you can

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:34.400
use to build your app and it would guarantee it'll work, that works but that's not a model

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:36.840
that Linux is typically gone with before.

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:41.760
I think their argument is no toolkit is actually that comprehensive.

01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:46.840
There's bugs or there's just gaps in what it's capable of providing that eventually

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.640
in a special case of Unity pretty much only.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:55.640
I think their argument is eventually you have to close a few gaps and when you do that you

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.600
got to write directly to the display server, you can't write to the toolkit.

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:05.440
And I think the concept of a perfect toolkit is sort of like a dream but I don't think

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:08.720
we've ever in the history of computing achieved the perfect toolkit.

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:15.080
No, and I agree there are going to be holes in every toolkit and there are bits that we're

01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:19.480
going to have to do at the plumbing layer and components that we're going to have to

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.320
provide that won't be provided by Qt.

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:28.360
We know that and we're building those as we go and yes it's a bit of a learning exercise

01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:36.520
for us as well but I don't think the criticism is necessary.

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:41.160
I don't think it's as warranted as some might think.

01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:45.720
In some ways it feels like okay, right, we've got them to switch to system D, right, what's

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:46.720
next?

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:47.720
Oh yes, me.

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:48.720
Let's have a go at them about that.

01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:52.760
Let's see if we can get them to change that one now.

01:30:52.760 --> 01:30:59.200
I guess what I'm worried about is I'm worried that wishful thinking is influencing that

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:03.920
thinking because in an ideal world I think that's too ideal and I think the history of

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:09.040
specifically desktop Linux shows us that things are very fluid and things are never quite

01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:14.320
as great as we want them to be and the idealism usually gives away a little bit of pragmatism

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:20.080
and I think at the end of the day there's a lot of bets on things kind of coming together

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:23.960
at the right time to make all of this work.

01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:31.240
I think Ubuntu's time is coming to an end soon because I mean they've been alienating

01:31:31.240 --> 01:31:38.840
and alienating the user base so much over the years with Unity, with Mirror, with...

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:45.840
Yeah I don't know about that, I hear that a lot Riley, but the thing is you can't discount

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:50.120
the massive cloud deployment that Ubuntu has which will naturally push a lot of developers

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.840
and sysadmins to want to run Ubuntu.

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:57.680
I mean they're doing really great there and I think also, I think let's look at it from

01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:59.320
an alternate perspective.

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:05.920
What if we fast forward three years down the road or 2016 or whatever it is where we have

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:10.520
like this great Qt based desktop which I think a lot of us think Qt has a strong future ahead

01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:11.520
of it.

01:32:11.520 --> 01:32:16.040
You know maybe this is a little bit further down the road but it's sitting on top of SystemD.

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:18.200
The only piece that has a lot of questions is how is...

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:24.240
I think what people are really worried about is the fragmentation being introduced at such

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.240
a critical layer.

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:29.040
I mean we can all argue about package names and how they're different between all distributions

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:32.800
or the locations of certain libraries and how they can be different or where the config

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.360
goes can be different.

01:32:34.360 --> 01:32:40.680
But we as a user base and as developers have never had to worry about that display layer.

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:46.600
I mean yes it's gotten old and its time has come to be replaced but at the same time it

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:52.240
has been at least a consistent thing not just across Linux but also across Linux and the

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:53.240
BSDs.

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:57.720
It is a consistent aspect for software development when you're targeting these systems that is

01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:59.920
now no longer going to be consistent.

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:06.500
And I think you cannot undersell that except for that other platform that you keep forgetting

01:33:06.500 --> 01:33:09.800
about that has more deployments than all of those.

01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:14.960
Well I mean there is a reality to that but I'm very focused on the actual desktop aspect

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:19.160
of Linux and maybe you know down the road I mean we're already seeing more and more

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:21.280
laptops that are shipping with Android.

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:25.800
I just recently saw a post for a full-fledged desktop with a keyboard, mouse and monitor

01:33:25.800 --> 01:33:27.840
running Android.

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:31.960
So I mean you know it could be a fair point that again we don't know what the future has

01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:36.800
ahead of us but right now I'm really focused on you know making my desktop version of Linux

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:43.160
better than ever and I'm really worried that if we cock this up and if we get this wrong

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:49.320
at this critical time with new types of companies getting on board and making great products

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.740
but also all of the desktop environments are getting to the point now where they're so

01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:58.000
good that it's these little things that bug us like the indicators and all this kind of

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:03.840
stuff we're really getting to a good point and if we kind of screw this up I just Android

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.280
and Chrome OS and and the Mac are gonna eat us alive.

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:09.280
It's been a lot of fun having the spirited conversations.

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:12.520
I think one of the things I love about Popeyes is always willing to have a great spirited

01:34:12.520 --> 01:34:16.040
conversation and then we have a laugh at the end of it.

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:18.720
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:23.200
Linux Unplugged for me over 2014 has changed a bit and I really like where it's gone.

01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:26.880
It's become a place to openly talk about issues that we as Linux users experience.

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:30.080
It's a place for Linux users to talk about this stuff.

01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:34.640
It's one part talk show maybe one part counseling a little bit and also we get those surprisingly

01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:38.920
great insights from our Mumble Room and that's always been and having great guests just randomly

01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:39.920
show up.

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:42.280
Join us for a live show sometime won't you our Mumble Room is always open we just got

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:47.440
to check your mic and you can submit topics to our subreddit linuxactionshow.reddit.com.

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.600
We'll see you back here on the 30th for some of our virtual Lugs 2015 predictions.

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.840
You can be part of that should be a great episode.

01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:54.840
Thanks so much everybody.

01:34:54.840 --> 01:35:23.440
We'll see you right here next Tuesday.
