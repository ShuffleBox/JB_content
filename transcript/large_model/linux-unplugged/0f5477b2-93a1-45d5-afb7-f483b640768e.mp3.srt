1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
I wanted a good keyboard and there weren't any out there. I figured, well, how hard could this be?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,960
And then we built the best keyboard we possibly could. It's not what you'd expect from a keyboard,

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,080
but people love it. Creating a keyboard is kind of a weird thing. It's been an obsession.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:24,560
All right, Wes, can you master the keyboardio that runs Linux in a beautiful hardware body?

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,120
It is the keyboardio, a mechanical switch keyboard, custom sculpted keycaps. It's a dream to type on

6
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:38,080
and it sells for $329. Wes Payne has it here in studio hooked up USB-C to his laptop.

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,840
It has Arduino boards inside. Wes Payne, can you light the keyboardio on fire? What do you think,

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,640
sir? Well, it's either going to look beautiful or turn into a brick. One way or the other,

9
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,960
a lot of fun. We'll do it live on this week's episode of Linux Unplugged. Keyboardio,

10
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,120
the only keyboard where you can install plugins that make it look like your keyboard is on fire.

11
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:13,840
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 279 for December 11th, 2018.

12
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:29,600
Oh, welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's making its list and checking

13
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,120
it twice. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hello, Wes. I'm very excited about today's show.

14
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,480
Not only because you're lighting your keyboard on fire, you maniac, but we're going to share

15
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:46,640
a WireGuard success story this week. We implemented that brand new Linux VPN in production

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,280
here at Jupiter Broadcasting, and it kicked butt. Yeah, Chris doesn't hate it. I mean,

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,480
that's how you know. It was really great. And man, is it fast. We'll tell you about our

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:03,440
WireGuard success story. But first, we're going to start out with a big batch of community news,

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,000
a little check in on the Ubuntu 1904 development cycle. I'm running it here today in the studio,

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,920
and a potential fix for that crazy CPU system D dominating issue I talked about last week that

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,240
was wrecking my box. And then we'll finally introduce the name of our automation system

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,720
that you voted on. You did it. Not our fault. Can't blame us for this one. We're innocent.

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,760
We totally. And then we'll wrap up the show if time allows, you know, because time. Actually,

24
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,320
it's Joe really. If Joe allows, he does. He gets mad. But if Joe allows and time permits,

25
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,560
we have not one, but two fantastic fricking picks this week that are really great. And one of them

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,320
that just might bring me back to Reddit. But before we go any further, we got to bring in

27
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:59,280
that virtual log time appropriate. Greetings. Mumble room. Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hello, Mr. Badger,

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,480
MiniMech, Sean, and the silent drifter. It's good to see you. And we have a whole bunch up

29
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,280
in quiet listening to Wes. How are you doing? You feeling all right? You good? You didn't get sick?

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,200
Yeah, no, I don't. I think I'm I think I've recovered any any, you know, amount of I was

31
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,120
pretty tired. We got back. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, definitely crashed. But after that,

32
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,880
I was exhausted. I was convinced I was gonna get sick. Wes and I just got back from the Linux

33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,480
Academy holiday party. And we're now we're like who raw full of team spirit. Really, you know,

34
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,040
they do these things. And I'm like role my team building exercises. I will admit to being

35
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,360
conditioned from some of my past employers to have a very similar attitude. But the game shows

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,680
that were hosted by Tom Hazlett were pretty good. And one of the final questions it was like a

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,280
family feud. I was wondering if you're going to mention that. How can I not? You have to Yeah,

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,960
I'm still going. I am still upset about this. This was like Friday morning. This happened. And

39
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,680
now it's Tuesday of the next week. And I'm still upset. So it's family feud style name Linux

40
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,880
distributions, right. And so like if you surveyed Google or the or people or whatever the scenario

41
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,880
was, these were the top 10 Linux distributions, the top five Linux distributions. And so you know,

42
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,560
first group first table shouts out Ubuntu, you know, because it's their turn,

43
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,120
that family Ubuntu goes up, boom, number one on the board, of course, of course, right.

44
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:22,000
So then they shout out another distribution. I can't remember what it was. And wasn't on the

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,800
board. So you know, they so they so they lose switches to our table, the other family. And

46
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,800
at this point, like it's it's a process of elimination. And it's down to us and them.

47
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,480
And I'm all in. And I'm like, this is my domain. I know what the popular distros are. This is what

48
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,600
you were hired for. Right. So he turns to me, you know, Mr. Fisher, what's your answer? I say, Tom,

49
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,960
Linux Mint, right? Because that's a huge lots of desktop users use. I mean, we don't talk about it

50
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,160
a ton because we don't use it. But lots of lots of new users to Linux use Linux Mint. Ubuntu made

51
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:59,920
sense. Linux Mint. Not on the list. Not on the list. You know what was on the top five list?

52
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,720
Manjaro. Not Linux Mint, but Manjaro. How can I not be sore about that? How can I not be sore

53
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,680
about that? I tell you what. Now, apparently this was sourced from like Google rankings.

54
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,480
So maybe there's some something there. I'm using Manjaro right now. You are not helping at all.

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,200
You know what it is, is that with KDE, though. So it's all fine. I'm just saying, like, would

56
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,000
anybody in this Mumble Room disagree with the statement that Mint is way larger than Manjaro?

57
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,720
No, no, no. Right. I mean, I mean, it's a great distribution. Actually met a Mint user in the

58
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,280
in real life, though. I will disagree. Oh, just for the sake of disagree.

59
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,240
And there's Dar. Dar's made it to the Mumble Room. I'll say this, though. Great fun. There's a lot

60
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,360
of really smart people. We're going to start figuring out how to get some of them on the shows

61
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,480
because these people really think about this stuff a lot. You you made some friends. You were out.

62
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,400
You were really, you know, Westpain. Westpain is a gentleman socializer. I'll tell you,

63
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,480
shucking and jiving out there. Well, I mean, it was nice, right? There's a especially at a company

64
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,640
where most people work remotely. This is this is a great opportunity to get to meet some people.

65
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,080
And yeah, everyone's nice. And they just want to they want to help people learn cool new stuff.

66
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,360
My biggest regret really is that we didn't bring Joe out. Like we're on the fence. We're like,

67
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,040
it's not enough time. We should have given we should have known more. It was just it just

68
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,360
didn't work out this time. But so we'll have to treat him well. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We'll treat him

69
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,480
well. All right. Well, while Wes is hacking away. Do you have you? Are you actually doing your input

70
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,160
over the keyboardio right now? I started to and then it was very, very slow. It's an unusual

71
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,960
way. It's not QWERTY. It's not. No, no. I think I could get used to it with time. But yeah,

72
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,840
for the sake of you know, we have a small amount of time that Joe as we said, I'm cheating a bit.

73
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,040
Okay. All right. Well, we'll check in with you later on the show and see how it's going.

74
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,440
So we had a tweet come in to me and the Ubuntu podcast from crimbus. He says Yo,

75
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,520
at Chris last, I'm tired of depending on our internet to play movies for the kiddo.

76
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,400
I was trying to rip some DVDs tonight using VLC and acid rip in hopes to run them off of a home

77
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:06,720
server. But either the video ends up glitchy AF, as he says, or there's no audio any suggestions.

78
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,000
Now, I gave him a quick rundown of the tools I use, like make MKV and handbrake. Oh, yeah,

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,200
those are both great. If you want full quality make MKV, bring it in via Blu Ray and just put it

80
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,600
you just drop all of the different video files and languages you don't need. And you end up with

81
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,120
a largest file, but it's the exact encoding right off the disk. So it's as good as it's going to be

82
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,200
on the disk. If you need it smaller from there. So like in crimbuses case here, he's making it for

83
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,480
the kiddos, kiddos, you know, they don't care if it's 720p versus 1080p or 4k, you could put it in

84
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,360
720p and upscale it and they're going to be okay. And so you could run it through handbrake, you

85
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,720
know, get yourself a nice small file. Yeah, it adds up if you have a lot of those, you know,

86
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,560
so that was the tools part. But then that the big question is how do you serve this up to the kiddos?

87
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,360
And my answer from when he tweeted this to what I'm going to say now has dramatically changed

88
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,400
in the last week. Thanks to the people over at MB, I was gonna be really derogatory. I'll just

89
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,720
say the people over at MB, who are shattering our dreams of an open source Plex competitor

90
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,920
this week by announcing that they're shifting to a closed source core with open source components,

91
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,960
which is the exact model Plex uses. Actually, in fact, it may be now at this point Plex has

92
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,600
more open source code in it than MB does, depending on where they fall on this whole thing,

93
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,560
where it all falls down. And MB is sort of botching the communication. In their release,

94
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,240
there's some implications that make you read between the lines. And then when people ask for

95
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,320
clarification on GitHub, the project came out and explained in further detail what was going on.

96
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,080
It does seem like communication has been one of those things that the community has not always

97
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,440
been happy with for a couple of years in this project. This is a big shame because this was,

98
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,840
I think, its biggest feature for our community was the fact that it was open source. You could

99
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,880
use it without having to have an MB cloud account if you wanted to. I have it running on a droplet

100
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,200
for ages now and here at the studio, and I like it so much. I didn't want them to change anything.

101
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,680
I became a premium subscriber just to support them. I wanted them to stick around. I did the

102
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,520
same exact thing. The real shame. And it was nice too, right? Because, I mean, it was open source.

103
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,320
It was easy to package. I have like an Arc system that's running it, and it was just

104
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,880
like, install MB and away you go. And it feels like this is still kind of developing,

105
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,040
so we don't have all the details yet. So I don't want to raise the full panic flag.

106
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,480
I want to give them time to communicate better what's going on.

107
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,480
It couldn't have come at a worse time either. The whole Plex community over the last couple

108
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,280
of months on Reddit has been getting slowly more and more toxic. Go figure. It's Reddit, right? But

109
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:50,640
the Plex clients and UIs have been going through all sorts of crazy... My uncle is in Vancouver,

110
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,120
and he streams from my Plex server all the time. And they updated his Roku this week,

111
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,200
and he's been texting me all week. He's 70, right? He's been texting me all week. How do I use this

112
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,560
new version of Plex? I'm like, I don't know. I don't have a Roku. I can't help. And so now he's

113
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,240
stuck. And so thanks, Plex, for that. So I think there's a lot of people in a similar situation

114
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:20,080
looking for a decent alternative. And MB is, was, it, but now, I don't know.

115
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,400
Yeah. Drifter, have you run into this with your Roku?

116
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,280
Oh, absolutely. And it's really obnoxious too, because not only did they not really tell you

117
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,360
about it, it just kind of all of a sudden you went to go use it, and it was completely different.

118
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,280
Oh, yeah. It's good stuff. That's exactly what you want on the TV when you watch a show.

119
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,880
That's exactly what you want on the TV when you want to just sit down, turn it on, and chill out.

120
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,040
It's so frustrating. Yeah. I think the problem with Plex is they've been taking their eye off

121
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,600
the ball a little bit, and they're trying to focus, ironically for me to say this, but they're trying

122
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,400
to focus on web media, like podcasts and stuff. And while I'm kind of like, cool, another platform

123
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,800
to distribute our shows on, that's good as the content creator, but like the viewer of me is

124
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,360
like, no. I just want this to work really well. I have a whole bunch of offline media I want to

125
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,680
watch. I've got a USB drive plugged into this machine, and I just want you to index it really

126
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,120
well and keep track of what I've watched and make it possible for me to watch it on my

127
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,200
portable devices. Yeah. And I think in the past, MB has benefited. It had great integration with

128
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,520
Kodi, which I use a lot, and that works very well. So I think there's been some of that spirit,

129
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,800
right? It's open. You can kind of hack on it as you need to. You can make this sort of rich

130
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,560
ecosystem around it. I don't know. I kind of worry about that now too. Yeah. So I use the

131
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:35,760
NVIDIA Shield, which I know you do too, Chris. Love it. And the Plex Android client has gotten

132
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,240
slowly less and less. You just want to click on something and it just should just work first time

133
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:47,680
every time. And it tries to transcode everything. So to fix that, I have gone into Kodi and installed

134
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,800
Plex for Kodi. And now everything plays direct play first time every time. So along the same lines

135
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:01,760
as Wes really, like Kodi, thank God, is the answer. Yeah. That's exactly how I use it now too, because

136
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,320
a lot of times when I'm in the RV, I'm connected via a MiFi. And if it's going out to the Plex

137
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,520
cloud to even broker the connection over my LAN, which sometimes even I'm trying to play over my

138
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,240
LAN, it wants to broker a connection over the internet. Kodi solves that problem every single

139
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,960
damn time. So whatever we land on here in this conversation, keep that in the back of your mind.

140
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:31,200
Kodi is a great tool for that. So we had a little look around. And Wes, you found a couple of things.

141
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,400
First of all, let's just start with the one-to-one replacement. Jellyfin has been announced,

142
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,400
which is a fork of MB, right? Are you laughing at my pronunciation of it?

143
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,000
No, I was just enjoying it.

144
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,240
How would you say it?

145
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,080
I'm not arguing.

146
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,080
Jelfin? Would you say gel? No, because it's got a... No, jellyfin.

147
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,120
I think jellyfin.

148
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,760
Jellyfin.

149
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,600
Yeah, okay. You're just smirking over there.

150
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,760
I'm just enjoying it. You said it so well.

151
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,280
Thank you. Well, I tried it. If I'm going to mispronounce it, I'm going to try to mispronounce

152
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,040
it with some level of confidence, just so that way it doesn't make people like... It's not

153
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,640
distracting, right? Because if I sit here and I torture myself over it, that's distracting,

154
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,840
like this conversation is. They forked it right at the point before all this happened.

155
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:17,360
And did you note in here too that they talk about they're rebasing some of it on.NET Core as well.

156
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,400
Hey, that's kind of neat.

157
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,320
Isn't that fascinating? So jellyfin is a fork of MB. The MB crew basically said,

158
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,080
good luck with that. That was essentially their response to it. So I don't see what that means.

159
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:34,960
How many people will move over? Will there be a new community over at jellyfin?

160
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,080
Maybe, maybe.

161
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:44,560
All we need to do is these fork guys to actually set up a subscription model. We subscribe there

162
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,000
and we let them see who actually had the good luck.

163
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,400
Yeah. Yeah, possibly. Yeah. But Wes, you also found this StreamServer.org. Is that what it is?

164
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:02,640
Is that what the URL StreamServer.org or Streama, Streama, Streama Server.org, which is a really

165
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:09,920
kind of low, low feature. I like it. It's an MVP. Yeah. It's like a minimum viable

166
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:17,040
streaming system, but it is in fact, a video library organizer and streamer that apparently

167
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,120
also has a Google Play app. I did also notice one feature, which I have not tried, although I did.

168
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,920
It was pretty easy to get running. I have not been able to make it run in a way that we could

169
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,400
actually use it, but it is just a war file that you can execute if you have Java. So that's easy.

170
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,600
It says here, live sync watching. Watch with your loved ones remotely with sync for play,

171
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,160
pause and scrubbing. And if that is true, that's money. Game changer. That's something that Wes

172
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,840
and I have been trying to figure out because when I'm traveling, I have to stop watching

173
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,120
Star Trek Deep Space Nine. And I've been marathoning Deep Space Nine. Nothing makes

174
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,560
it grumpy with that, you know, when you don't get your nine. And now season five is taken forever,

175
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,120
right? So if we could do this, that would be huge. That'd be huge. All right. You got to get that.

176
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,400
We got to get, you got to try that, Wes. That'd be great. And I know you want to try to solve

177
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,560
the same thing. So Streama is the one that may also be an alternative if Kodi doesn't work for

178
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,280
you. I don't know about that though. So what, so it's a, it's a Java app is what it is. It's all Java.

179
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:18,960
It's all Java. I mean, I guess that's fine. Yeah, no, I guess that's fine. No, I know. I know.

180
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:24,080
I know. That's true. It's just, I don't know. I don't know why it just gives me pause. I shouldn't,

181
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,120
right? I'm bad. I shouldn't. It shouldn't. It's probably makes it even easier to run it on any

182
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,440
Linux distro and stuff like that. So I guess in a lot of ways it's, it's pretty good. All right. Well,

183
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,200
so I, a little, a little sneaky fact here, even though I already told you, I've been running

184
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,080
Ubuntu 1904 all day here on our production system just to give it a go off of a live,

185
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,200
off of a live USB 3. And I thought maybe we'd do a little disco-dingo roundup.

186
00:15:47,200 --> 00:16:11,920
So disco-dingo is set to be released on February 12th, I think. No, it's a feature freeze. Feature

187
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,080
freeze is February 21st, 2019. And the UI freeze, March 4th, 2019. And the kernel freeze, April 1st.

188
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:23,360
Wow. That is a lot of specific dates. This is an article that Joey wrote for OMG Ubuntu.

189
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,800
And the release date is April 18th, 2019. That's right. April 18th. Look forward to it.

190
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,560
I'm thrilled, Wes. I'm thrilled. So this is kind of fun to just sort of take a look at where it's

191
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,000
at right now. If all goes to plan, it'll be shipping GNOME 3.32, Linux kernel 5.0 possibly

192
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,240
if it's ready, if it's ready. And a bunch of other little performance tweaks to GNOME. Well,

193
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,640
I actually shouldn't say little. In fact, there's some pretty significant performance tweaks to

194
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:59,840
GNOME Shell in 1904. In fact, enough that's kind of got me a little tempted to give this a go once

195
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,520
it's released. Not that Plasma's still been doing great, but if they shook out a lot of the performance

196
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,560
fixes, Wes. The call of GNOME. I can see it in your eyes. Well, you've gone mad. The area where

197
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:15,600
they're doing extensive work right now is in multi-monitor performance and management. And

198
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,240
that is an area in which I am struggling right now, now that I've got that dock with three monitors.

199
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,280
You're in a new world. It's a new multi-monitor world. Who would have thought that's what would

200
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:30,720
bring you back to GNOME? Not me. Not me. No. Is there anything that jumps out at you about the...

201
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,880
So this is a Phronix article here that talks about some of the performance fixes. Is there

202
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,360
any in particular in this roundup that Michael's done here that jump out at you? Okay, well,

203
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,640
they are working on showing pending kernel live patches via the update manager user interface.

204
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
That would be nice. Yeah, because right now you don't get to see that at all. No, and live

205
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,240
patches are kind of a nice feature that you might not get or at least as well integrated on some

206
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,960
other distros. Yeah, I use it on these two systems. Really? On these two on the desk here. Yeah,

207
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,120
that's nice, I think. Of course, you know, there's like latest packages and all the other goodies.

208
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,440
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, except for Nautilus. Except for Nautilus. I have been following their Trello,

209
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:15,200
which is public, turns out, for Ubuntu 19.04. And this is where I started to get an idea of the

210
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,640
level of fixes that are coming into GNOME Shell. I'm not positive all of this is going to be

211
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,120
upstream. I mean, they're submitting it upstream. You never know what's actually going to take you,

212
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,560
right? Yeah, exactly. I'm not sure it's getting accepted. Important question. How much of these

213
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:41,360
fixes that are being pushed for are advent of IBM acquisition? Oh, no, I think a lot of this has been

214
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,320
in place since Canonical switched to GNOME, because the couple of the individuals, I've met

215
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,640
them at an Ubuntu rally. And while I mean, this was, was this April of last year? Was that April?

216
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,400
That was April of last year. Yep. Where they were talking about how they were going to start working

217
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:04,720
on fixing performance issues upstream in GNOME. And that they did a lot of that recently, but 19.04

218
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,200
seems when I read through their Trello, it seems like it's a huge list of them. And it just makes

219
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:15,040
me wonder if maybe it's going to be time to give GNOME another go and if maybe the Ubuntu spin of

220
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:20,240
GNOME might be a particular performed or performance. I don't know. It's just worth trying,

221
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,160
I think. Well, I mean, and we were coming into our own, right? I mean, it's not that long that

222
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,520
they switched back to GNOME in the first place. So now we're kind of seeing some of the we've

223
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,800
lived here for a while. What do we got to fix? So I've been trying it here. It pretty much right

224
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:38,080
now looks like 1810 theme wise and look wise. It's got the you know, more updated apps. It's got the

225
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,760
new GNOME shell, including that new GNOME to do list manager, which we were playing around with on

226
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,680
the pre show stream. Yeah, it looks nice. Yeah, it is nice. And you know what it is very quick,

227
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,720
even for running off a USB three thumb drive. It's very quick. It's very, very quick. So it's got that

228
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,080
new fresh feel. So you have to know what you're doing the show here today. No problem. Yeah. Yeah.

229
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,800
The only thing I don't have is our highlights for the for the shows. But I suppose I can probably

230
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,400
figure that out. But yeah, it's not bad. And the GNOME UI itself. I like some of the tweaks,

231
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,320
canonicals done. I really like their doc. And I don't use it a lot, you know, because I'm a

232
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,480
plasma user. So I haven't used their their version of GNOME. It's pretty much since they've launched

233
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,480
it. I was pretty much when I switched to plasma. But it's not bad. It's actually a pretty damn good

234
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,120
implementation. And you combine it with the new GNOME three settings the screen, you know,

235
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,720
that's been around for a while. And it's just I like it. It feels kind of simple. Yeah, simple.

236
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,040
Yeah, it's simple and polished. And the Thunderbolt three support now is also extra

237
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,360
appreciated more than ever, more than ever. West. So yeah, I give it I give it the old

238
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,600
thumbs up here on the Linux unplugged review. I'd say they're in a right in the right direction

239
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,160
stability wise. It's been I've just been running it for the day. So I can't make like a firm like

240
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:52,880
Oh, yeah, it's it's the most stable release ever. But I'm legitimately in the past I did have no

241
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,000
shell crash on me at this point. Like it didn't take more than an eight hour workday to have

242
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,560
no shell crash on me. And I've made it that far. So that's that's pretty good. That is pretty good.

243
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:09,120
I'm looking forward to the disco dingo. Gotta play twice, you know, because it's so great.

244
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,800
It's the first thing I thought of when they made amazing. Isn't that great? It is great.

245
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:18,080
But canonical is also making some news this week in the enterprise space. It is KubeCon.

246
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,520
KubeCon North America is going on just down the street from us this week. And canonical

247
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,520
is making some noise really before the event has even opened its doors. And they've been

248
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,840
working in the Kubernetes space since 2014. But this year, I think they're really trying to say

249
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,520
this is our offering. Yeah, that is right. One of those things that got people talking was

250
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,600
MicroK8s. What? Yeah, MicroKris. Is this already a known thing? A MicroK8? Or is this something

251
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,600
they've made up? As far as you know? Well, it's a new project. It's there. It's there. There's

252
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,600
already, you know, there's already attempts like Minikube to get a system running just for

253
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,360
development. You don't want to play with it on one box. I asked you to set up that Kubernetes

254
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,280
cluster weeks ago and you still haven't finished tying all the string together. That is true. That

255
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,560
is true. Well, now you with the snap install MicroK8s, that job would be done for you. Oh,

256
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,240
I see. So it's like a full, complete, ready to go out of the box or out of the snap.

257
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,520
Kubernetes environment. Yeah, full featured. Includes automatic updates, well-defined

258
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,720
security capabilities, and some of Canonical's open source add-on services such as a container

259
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,080
registry, storage pass through and native GPGPU enablement for hardware acceleration and machine

260
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,680
learning workflows. Yeah, you've got those GPGs. You've got those GPUs. Too many Gs. If you need

261
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:40,320
to compute those GPGs on those GPUs, then you're set. Oh yeah, in the cloud. And with this now,

262
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,960
like you can see the game they're playing is they're wrapping it up with that Ubuntu

263
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,120
Advantage support as well. So now they're making this an offering for their enterprises and Ubuntu

264
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,760
Advantage subscription. So if you need Canonical support and taking care of managing all of this.

265
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,800
And yeah, a big thing about that, too, is that you can get that support for clusters you've built

266
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,320
with Kube admin. And so if you already built your own cluster and then you want Canonical's help

267
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,240
managing it, you don't have to have it all set up customized by them to get started with that. So

268
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,960
that's a big selling point. That's what a hungry company does. Hungry in a good way. We know this

269
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,960
will be painful. Probably you've done some things wrong that we would have never done, but we want

270
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,880
your business and we want to help. Yeah, and that is a way Canonical, isn't that a great example of

271
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,760
how Canonical can be competitive in a way that IBM can't? IBM will, I mean, they'll come in and

272
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,840
charge you to fix it. But what IBM wants is you do it to the standard, right? That's what Red Hat

273
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,120
wants, too, is you do it to the standard. And if you could deviate from the standard, it may not be

274
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,200
a supported configuration. And what Canonical is implicitly saying here is we'll bail you out and

275
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,880
that that cluster F that you've built will manage it for you and fix it up. And that's a that's a

276
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,640
hungry play. And I like it. Yeah, they were also talking about some new partnerships with people

277
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,720
like Dell EMC and Supermicro. So those are both big names in big server business. So, you know,

278
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,920
they are really trying to get their name out there in that space, which has been kind of

279
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,240
dominated by Red Hat, at least in like the Kubernetes area. Yeah, it has. I kind of found

280
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,880
out I found a really interesting tidbit. Do you know why it's called K8s? You probably do. I only

281
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,720
found out the other day. It's because they took eight letters out of the middle of Kubernetes.

282
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,440
Okay, that's what it is. I could have sworn that when we were, we did an episode for TechSnap,

283
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,880
I did a ton of research. And I think I've unlearned a lot of the things I learned for that

284
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,600
episode, because that was in there. That's funny. That's good. I don't think also, it's no small

285
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,680
achievement here that you can now get a, as they call it a micro Kubernetes setup, with a snap

286
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:39,200
install command. That's that is, it's a pretty good showcase of what snaps can offer in the

287
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,200
enterprise is you can take this really complicated system, and you can boil it down to a single snap

288
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,000
command. Oh, and by the way, it's also going to get updated. Yeah, right. And you can go poke,

289
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,840
you know, go poke at it, see what's in there, go take a look at the at the YAML file, see how it's

290
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,720
put together, play with it yourself. Well, it'll be interesting to see how that plays out. I think

291
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,160
that's a space they can be pretty competitive in. And just kind of anecdotally today, I think it

292
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,400
was Badger that mentioned when he got in here that DigitalOcean has taken their Kubernetes support out

293
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,400
of beta and made it like an official thing. So you could have Ubuntu boxes on premises,

294
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,800
you could have Ubuntu boxes on different cloud providers, and you're managing all from one

295
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,840
Kubernetes system, like, not to sound too much like you six weeks ago, before you got bought out

296
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:27,840
but I span up a Kubernetes cluster on DO in maybe three minutes. That's pretty nice. And you only

297
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,360
pay for the app nodes, you don't pay for the workers or anything. So it's kind of like the

298
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,640
GKS or the EKS model, ECS model, sorry. Rumor on the street has it you can still get $100 credit

299
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,840
if you go to do.co slash L and L. That's the rumor. I don't know. I don't know if that's

300
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,520
true or not. But if you still want to try out Kubernetes, if you want to go try out, you know

301
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,840
what? Because the thing is, we're both still users. Were you not using DigitalOcean this weekend?

302
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,160
True. This weekend, I spent up a high CPU drop last night. Oh, last night. That's when it was.

303
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,320
Yeah. Yeah. A high CPU drop. What were you doing? Video encoding? Video encoding, weren't you?

304
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,520
You're doing something with video. High CPU? No, math? You're doing something with math.

305
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,000
You're doing mathy stuff? He's a math nerd, guys. He doesn't talk about it much on air,

306
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,040
but Wes is a math nerd. Oh, you don't want to say. You want to tell me off air. Oh,

307
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,920
okay. Oh, I like that even better. All right. Well, this next story is rather interesting.

308
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:22,720
Wouldn't this be a cool feature to come to the x86 side of the house? But for right now,

309
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,840
and probably forever, this is a feature coming to the ARM side of Linux, and it's a pretty cool one.

310
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,360
It's energy aware scheduling for the mainline Linux kernel to better handle systems with

311
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,800
asymmetric CPU topologies. Energy aware scheduling is designed to take into account information from

312
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,920
the ARM energy model framework. So you can make better scheduling decisions based upon the topology

313
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,840
of the CPU cores, and the performance and power characteristics, right? Because you might have

314
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,120
this this sort of ARM board that's put together with all kinds of different components. And that

315
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,880
can vary widely depending on is this for a smart fridge, right? Or is it for your Nvidia shield

316
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,600
device? Those are usually different. Yeah, that's nice. And the work for supporting energy aware

317
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,920
scheduling in the mainline kernel has been in the works for months. And you're not going to be

318
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:11,440
surprised when you learn that Google's Android kernel team has already been supporting this

319
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,160
technology in their core. This, you know, getting this in the mainline means one less thing that's

320
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,320
in the that's in the Android kernel only. So that's kind of nice. Yeah. And if you look at

321
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,640
some of the patchwork, the churn of all the work going on here, it's starting to settle down.

322
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,280
Hopefully, that means it won't be much longer till we say it's in the mainline and energy aware

323
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,640
scheduler sounds pretty neat, pretty, pretty neat. I think that'd be a good a good addition.

324
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,360
You go down the road a few years, some of us might be rocking some Linux arm laptop of some form,

325
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,880
and you can have just fantastic battery life or something like that. That could be really cool.

326
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,200
Unless system D, you dev is eating 100% of your CPU, then your battery life is going to be

327
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,760
horrible regardless of your CPU architecture. And that's what was happening to me last week

328
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:01,360
talked about it on the show. Short version is after I got this Thunderbolt three doc with a GPU,

329
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:08,640
and I installed the NVIDIA drivers and then disconnected my system and booted it without

330
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:15,360
the doc connected system to you dev went crazy eating up 100% of one of my cores constantly

331
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,840
trying to find the NVIDIA adapter connect and authorize it and initialize the driver.

332
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,360
And then when that would fail because the hardware didn't exist because the doc was disconnected,

333
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:29,120
it would freak out and use 100% of my CPU. And I discovered I could stop and start you dev manually

334
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,920
manually and essentially solve this but I have to do it per boot when I'm not connected.

335
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,360
Oh, that's pretty annoying.

336
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,680
Yeah, it's not great. It's not great. But Mike wrote in with a system to you dev fix.

337
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,720
And what's he doing here with what's he essentially accomplished with this?

338
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,200
I mean, he's basically doing what you were doing on a offhand manner,

339
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,280
making it happen for you at boot time. So you install the new service. And then all

340
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:58,240
that service is doing is stopping all the various you dev things and the sockets that they listen on

341
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,080
starting it back up. And then the rest of this his article is telling you just how to get that

342
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,200
all enabled so that every time you boot up, that'll happen automatically.

343
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,600
That's not a bad worker. So it's a workaround.

344
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,240
I mean, it's a hack. Yeah, it's unfortunate that we have to you know, that these that

345
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,680
you'd have won't figure it out.

346
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:20,320
But what I liked about it is I don't have to I don't have to uninstall the NVIDIA driver.

347
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,960
But my question would be what happens when I am connected to the doc?

348
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,720
Don't I want that process to work?

349
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,520
Well, you are restarting it. So I say you should do some research and find out.

350
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,920
And report back to us here next week.

351
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,840
Fair enough. Fair enough. Fair enough. I will. I will. I'll try to figure that out.

352
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,880
All right. Well, before we get in to more like our WireGuard success story,

353
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,560
I'm very excited about WireGuard now. We've been talking about it in the theory sense for a while.

354
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,640
And this travel week was our opportunity to actually put it in production and it freaking worked.

355
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,840
But a little housekeeping before we go any further in the show.

356
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,280
A couple of things we need to let you know about.

357
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,800
This is your chance, Wes, to get some progress on that keyboardio.

358
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,440
First of all, if you want to get a hold of us Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact,

359
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,400
please go there.

360
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,600
Sign us in your app pics. I'm going to try to do more of those in every episode.

361
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,280
And I've got my own feeds, of course.

362
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,240
But if there is a command line app that you've been loving.

363
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,800
Oh, we can't say that. That's command line nervous.

364
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,560
If there is a command line app that you find to be quite swell.

365
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,680
Something you're fond of, you think about at night when you're falling asleep.

366
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,200
That's a whole other thing, Wes.

367
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,920
But maybe Linux Unplugged dot com slash contact.

368
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,280
Also, just kind of fun little heads up.

369
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:39,440
Wes and I at the end of this week are heading to System 76 to tour their factory in Denver,

370
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,880
Colorado and sniff out the Thelio hardware and just get a sense for what kind of scale

371
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,640
of an operation they got over there.

372
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,760
So I'm really looking forward to that.

373
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,200
I know. Exciting.

374
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,400
Wes and I, after just getting to hang out in Texas, are going to get to go hang out in Denver.

375
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,880
They are flying us out there as well as a bunch of other media.

376
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,280
And they're doing a tour.

377
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:04,720
And I think I've been talking to them about this for three months now about doing this

378
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,960
and just trying to really.

379
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,280
I mean, I've been a bit skeptical and they know that.

380
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,320
And that's actually kind of what I respect about them willing to do this is I've been

381
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,080
pretty skeptical about Papa Wes.

382
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,600
I mean, I'm still reserving judgment.

383
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,920
I want to give it like three to bake.

384
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,640
Yeah, exactly.

385
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,080
I want to give it like three or so years to really fully realize.

386
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,480
But, you know, I've been pretty skeptical about Papa Wes.

387
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,280
I'm kind of skeptical about a small operation opening up a U.S. manufacturing plant in Denver.

388
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:39,600
I mean, we're not talking like we're not talking Arizona or West Texas where land where they

389
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,200
basically are paying you to take the land.

390
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,400
We're talking about Denver.

391
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,040
Right.

392
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,160
So I just been I've been a little skeptical.

393
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,360
And so I've been and I feel like they're so important to the Linux community.

394
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:54,000
There was a conversation at Linux Academy, like we want to add another Linux hardware

395
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,320
vendor.

396
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,960
Who should we add?

397
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,760
And the first name that came into the list was System 76.

398
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,760
And I want to be able to say with confidence, you do it.

399
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,560
So this is hopefully what we're going to find out.

400
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,240
So we're going there at the end of the week.

401
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,680
They're going to give us the tour and then we'll be back next week and we'll report what

402
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,000
we found.

403
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,240
I think nonetheless, we're going to have a great time.

404
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,040
I know that's going to happen.

405
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,080
I know we're going to have a great time.

406
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,440
So System 76 props to them for being willing to bring a critic out there at times.

407
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,480
I try to, you know, I just try to be honest because you guys also know I've been a 10

408
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:22,960
year customer.

409
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,080
Well, more than that now.

410
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,880
So still got three System 76 rigs.

411
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,040
Yeah.

412
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,360
I mean, right.

413
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,760
I think that's probably an important perspective of.

414
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,320
Yeah.

415
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,160
We're concerned to tell you guys about it.

416
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,720
But also, yeah, we want to we want to buy some of these rigs.

417
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,520
Yeah, exactly.

418
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:35,760
Yeah.

419
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,720
So that should be good.

420
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,800
We'll have a report next week when we get back.

421
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,600
And we also have the results of our automation naming system.

422
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,360
We've been building a system behind the scenes.

423
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,520
We talked about it over the last few episodes.

424
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,760
I don't know actually when, but it's been we have talked about over a few episodes.

425
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,000
And it's it's pretty fun because it's not only solving some problems here at Jupiter

426
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,040
Broadcasting, but it's given us an opportunity to think about releasing our own open source

427
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,440
project.

428
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,440
And that has been the most fun.

429
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,120
And when I was all said and done, that is our goal is to release something that other

430
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:15,120
podcasters can utilize to automate production, increase quality and accuracy, and maybe even

431
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,000
eventually a lot more.

432
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,600
I don't want to commit yet, but we have some really great long term plans.

433
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,720
And so we asked you guys, what should we name this tool?

434
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,160
This is a tool that we're going to be running all of our shows through, that it'll be like

435
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,720
a verb.

436
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,840
You know, make sure you run it through X, Y, Z because it's got to get posted today.

437
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,000
Or did that go through X, Y, Z?

438
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,640
And we asked you guys, we put it all out there and we had a bunch of really great suggestions.

439
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,440
We got a decent sample size, even for not plugging it too much, 272 votes.

440
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,160
Nice.

441
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,960
I'll take it.

442
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,680
You'd be surprised.

443
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
That actually does end up being decently representative.

444
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,640
Doesn't seem like it would be for the tens of thousands of downloads.

445
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,280
But it actually, experience tells me it does.

446
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,280
So one of the submissions with 8% of the votes was Jupiter Podcaster.

447
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,920
That's not bad.

448
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,360
J Publish was another popular one, also at 8%.

449
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,400
Jupiter Caster, 11% of the votes.

450
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:09,200
Pod Pusher, which is very close to what Wimpy and Popey have, came in at 11% of the votes.

451
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,920
But the number two suggestion, which is pretty good, which you could, you know, if you're

452
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,480
thinking about this as an open source project, this might be the better name of the, of,

453
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,200
but, but it's not the one that the people decided.

454
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:22,480
But I like it.

455
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,600
It's called Autopod.

456
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,280
It's not bad.

457
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,240
Autopod.

458
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,800
It almost sounds like a podcast app on a phone though.

459
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,960
You know, like a cloud box symbol.

460
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,200
Yeah.

461
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,000
Yeah.

462
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,280
Running through Autopod.

463
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:40,000
Sounds to me, one of those, sorry, Tasker, Alto Tools, the guy names everything literally

464
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,040
Alto something.

465
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,440
Yeah.

466
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,080
True, right?

467
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,280
There's that danger.

468
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,000
Yeah.

469
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,320
Yeah.

470
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,160
So that was, that was, that was, that was there though.

471
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:48,800
That was number two.

472
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,200
But with 26%, 72 votes, 26% of the vote.

473
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,760
And I think we swung it.

474
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,880
I'm going to, I'll, I'll, I'll own that, but it's Casta Blasta.

475
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:09,600
Casta Blasta, which is a callback to the very first podcast that myself, Brian and John ever

476
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
did before we even formed a network.

477
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,200
We did a show called Casta Blasta together, which was really where we learned how to record

478
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,440
our audio edit and all of that stuff.

479
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,320
Just starting out.

480
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:18,800
Yeah.

481
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,960
And when we launched Linux action show and Radio Revolver and other shows, Casta Blasta

482
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,880
was still on the air at that time.

483
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,240
So it ran for many years of our origin.

484
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,560
So I think it's kind of fun now that we are fitting part of Linux Academy and we've gone

485
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,280
through all of these evolutions over the years and we're building a system that is really

486
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,840
kind of a serious professional system, right?

487
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:45,840
There's some, there's some, I dunno, there's something sweet about calling it Casta Blast,

488
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,640
which is when we were so raw and amateur and, and ingested beginning and saying really stupid

489
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,400
stuff into microphones that today you could not say into a microphone, you know, you would

490
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:59,200
not say those things and we said those things and it was just some other things.

491
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,240
Yeah, it was good stuff.

492
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,320
It was, it was really good.

493
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,560
And so I think it's sort of fitting and it's like, you're blasting it out there too.

494
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,480
So we're going to call it Casta Blasta.

495
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,080
Thank you everyone who did vote and look for more about the Casta Blasta project very soon.

496
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:18,000
We have, we've taken a page from Microsoft's book where they like, they call the surface

497
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,840
three different things now, you know?

498
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,920
So we're, I guess that's the hip thing to do.

499
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,640
You sound a bit like Mark Wahlberg saying that Casta Blaster.

500
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,680
Casta Blasta.

501
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,240
Yeah, yeah.

502
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,040
Casta Blasta.

503
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,440
That's how he used to say it is Casta Blasta.

504
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,960
You put it through the blaster.

505
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,320
And then last bit of housekeeping before we move on with the show is Linux Fest Northwest

506
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,000
last but absolutely not least, April 26th through the 28th, 2019 at the Bellingham Technical

507
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,720
College.

508
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,120
If you're international or you're around the States, you fly into SeaTac, you can get

509
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,400
shuttles up there.

510
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,840
There are carpools that are forming and Bellingham is beautiful.

511
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,360
The Pacific Northwest is gorgeous.

512
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,160
And the Technical College is one of the better campuses I've ever attended an event on.

513
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,360
Been to a few of these now.

514
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,120
And the great thing about the Technical College is that it's that same place every single

515
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,600
year.

516
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,400
And this is the 20th year of Linux Fest Northwest.

517
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,080
So it's a well oiled machine.

518
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,120
They figured out all the issues you run into the first or second time you're there.

519
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,800
We know where our booth is.

520
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,440
You know where our booth is at.

521
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,160
I know right where it is.

522
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,040
You know right where it's at.

523
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,840
And that's just anyone else who's been there in the past however many years.

524
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,640
It's so nice.

525
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,600
And you know what rooms to go to and you know where the food's going to be at.

526
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,120
And because of that, the lug that puts on the plug that puts this on the Bellingham

527
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,200
Linux Users Group that puts this on can focus on all of the other stuff.

528
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,240
You know, the content, the talks, the great organizations they have.

529
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,120
That's so huge.

530
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,800
And this is their 20th year.

531
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,120
They're doing a theme past, present and future.

532
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,320
We're going to be there.

533
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
Joe's flying in.

534
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,160
We're going to try to bring as much of the crew in as we can.

535
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,960
We've got to remember to talk to System76 about doing a party.

536
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,920
Oh, yes.

537
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,600
I'm going to be bringing Lady Joops.

538
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,080
Parking her in the parking lot doing barbecue grilling.

539
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,120
Not barbecuing.

540
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,920
Sorry, Noah.

541
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,600
Grilling for everybody.

542
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,200
If you'll let me put my meat in your mouth, you can come there and eat my meat.

543
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,880
Well, I'm in.

544
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,280
All right.

545
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:05,760
Very good.

546
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,320
Very good.

547
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,440
So LinuxFestNorthwest.org if you want to check that out and if you're interested in going.

548
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,960
I just say this because I still need to submit talks.

549
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,600
I bet you do too.

550
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,040
We both need to submit our talks.

551
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,920
I'm thinking about doing a talk about Castablasta.

552
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,640
So who can end Castablasta separately possibly or we could do a combo talk.

553
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,600
So we should talk about that.

554
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,400
Yeah, let's talk about that.

555
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,480
And then audio reading on Linux.

556
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,080
You could definitely teach us a thing or two.

557
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,280
Oh, we totally could do.

558
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,800
We could do our Jack segment.

559
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,600
Yeah, that'd be fun.

560
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,480
Why not?

561
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,200
Oh, man.

562
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,320
Because, you know, there's people there.

563
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,480
I already know there's going to be people like how to podcast on Linux.

564
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,920
There's always like two presenters that do that.

565
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,040
And I'm always like, oh, son.

566
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,040
Oh, child.

567
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,360
You know, like I'm always like, oh, yes.

568
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,080
How are you doing?

569
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,160
And I don't mean to be demeaning, but it's always like, no, that's no, no, that's not

570
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,640
going to work.

571
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,160
So we can have a good Q&A session to be so much fun.

572
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:00,720
Anyways, what I'm getting at is I'm hoping that if we can get enough talks together,

573
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,000
including from somebody that you guys haven't heard of yet and from the people that you

574
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,720
know about on air, maybe we could have a whole dedicated room at Linux Fest Northwest.

575
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,480
That's just the Jupiter broadcasting room.

576
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,760
So that'd be really cool.

577
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,080
Just another reason that this is the this is the year to go.

578
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,160
If you've been thinking about giving talks all day, having a booth, live streaming, doing

579
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,560
a live Linux action news, baby barbecue.

580
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,160
And I mean, it's it's our big get together.

581
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,760
I know it's a big ask to travel that far, but if you can make it and the side benefit

582
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,960
is, you know, even if you end up paying Linux Fest Northwest, which you won't, you won't

583
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,120
know.

584
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:31,680
Bellingham's great.

585
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,960
The Pacific Northwest is lovely.

586
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,760
So just, you know, you can go on a surprise little summer vacation.

587
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,720
Yeah, early summer.

588
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:36,960
Yeah.

589
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,080
Yeah.

590
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,240
You know, and come see everybody.

591
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,600
That's always part of the fun is like there's a whole bunch of people there that love talking

592
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,800
about what you're interested in.

593
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,160
And that's just really rewarding.

594
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,400
Anyways, that's all the housekeeping for this week.

595
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,480
So let's move on to our WireGuard in production success story.

596
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,080
So we set up here at the studio on my workstation.

597
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,480
I thought, well, just let's give it a go.

598
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,160
It was one of those projects are like, I'll just I'll just see how hard this is and how

599
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,360
far I can get.

600
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,840
And then I got all the way and I'm like, oh, well, now I've just put this in production

601
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,560
on my workstation.

602
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,040
Oops, but I'll circle back to that.

603
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,400
So WireGuard is a VPN that is built.

604
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,760
Well, is it mainline now?

605
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,960
It is mainline now, right?

606
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,760
In the Linux kernel.

607
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,600
It is now mainline, I believe, in the Linux kernel.

608
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,280
I don't know if it's in kernel 4.15 because you need a DKMS.

609
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,520
You have to build a DKMS module to actually get it to work in 1804.

610
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,680
But I set it up on an 1804 workstation.

611
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,520
There's PPAs available and it just builds super quick and it's installed immediately.

612
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:37,200
And what you essentially get is the ability to start a new virtual interface.

613
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,080
In a sense, it looks like another network interface on your Linux box and you interact

614
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,160
with it like you would any other interface.

615
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,920
You can assign an IP address.

616
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,560
You can use IP tables to route traffic.

617
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,520
It is like you have another network card in your box.

618
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,240
You create it with IP link and then make a new one and just say, type WireGuard.

619
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,520
Yeah, and then it's up to the kernel to figure out what to do with traffic that's sent and

620
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,960
received to this new interface.

621
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,800
And that's where WireGuard comes in.

622
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,760
And it's so great for somebody like me because I know how to work with network interfaces

623
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,520
and IP tables and all of that.

624
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,120
So within minutes, I had it up and installed.

625
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:18,160
And then it was like, OK, well, now that I have an interface, I need to route traffic.

626
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,440
So I'm going to set up some IP tables rules to route that traffic.

627
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,400
And it was just obvious.

628
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,160
It was just obvious what the next step was.

629
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,840
That wasn't the hardest part at all for you.

630
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,040
No, no, really.

631
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,520
No, it wasn't.

632
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,600
The hardest part was modifying our Microtech router OS firewall.

633
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,280
That's where I got it.

634
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,920
Go figure.

635
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,520
But no, what I expected to be the hard part was the fact that because I'm apparently a

636
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,720
masochist, I wanted to connect to the WireGuard VPN running on my Ubuntu box from an iPad.

637
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,120
No, well, no, of course you do.

638
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,400
I know.

639
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,360
iOS.

640
00:41:53,360 --> 00:42:00,560
Now, I'll tell you why is so we have the Behringer X32 mixer and it's got a Linux power.

641
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,600
Yeah, it runs Linux.

642
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,280
Our mixer runs Linux.

643
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,440
And it's got a really awesome set of remote control capabilities, so much so that even

644
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,200
the dials and sliders on this mixer are motorized.

645
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:20,400
So if in software I pull down on a pot line, which is what these are called, the actual

646
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:27,840
physical slider in the studio moves and they have a touch app for the iPad that happens

647
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,920
to fit the exact amount of channels that we use on the screen.

648
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,600
With real time levels, individual channel control, and if I slide or mute or do anything

649
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,560
on that iPad, it's physically represented in studio.

650
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,280
Oh yeah, it's wild.

651
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,320
It just moves.

652
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,160
Which is great because when you're here sitting in the seat that I normally sit in and you're

653
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:50,800
sitting in front of the mixer and I'm in Texas, you can actually see me moving sliders.

654
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,000
And you can see me moving though.

655
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,320
Yes.

656
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,960
Both ways.

657
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,400
It's so, so great.

658
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,440
Really nice.

659
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,640
So this is why I wanted to be able to do a WireGuard VPN from the iPad so I could have

660
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,400
touch control of our mixer when I'm remote and I could see everybody's levels.

661
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,760
The mumble room, Wes's, mine, remote hosts, everything.

662
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,400
But iOS is a son of a bitch.

663
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,920
You can't just go to the app store and install a WireGuard app.

664
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:14,960
That's not a thing.

665
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,480
That's not how it, that's not how.

666
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,080
What do you think this is, Android?

667
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:18,320
Yeah.

668
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,200
We get a sideload.

669
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,040
You can go screw yourself if you want a sideload.

670
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,960
So the way you have to do it is you have to join the test flight beta for WireGuard.

671
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,280
And there's only a limited amount of slots, but I will have a link in the show notes if

672
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,480
this is something you're interested in.

673
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,200
Get in early.

674
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,520
LinuxUnplugged.com slash 279.

675
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:45,120
They have been granted a networking stack privilege extension by Apple, where they're

676
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,320
able to do a network level VPN connection.

677
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,560
So it is a true kernel level VPN from the iOS device to my WireGuard system.

678
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:00,240
And the traffic is then routed to my WireGuard box and I'm able to, my iPad is essentially

679
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,120
on the LAN and it's, I am completely capable of controlling the X32 mixer.

680
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,720
It's just amazing.

681
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,680
It was, I mean, it was really slick when we were playing with it in the studio because

682
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,600
you just, I mean, we just hit like, you tap a button, you tap a button, start it up.

683
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:14,080
Yeah.

684
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,680
And then it's live and it was latency.

685
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,960
It's so fast too.

686
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,280
Yeah.

687
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,000
It's so fast.

688
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,600
Like the connection is instant and then you wouldn't even know you're going over.

689
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:25,360
There's like, for what I've done, I've seen very little penalty for the VPN overhead.

690
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,120
It's, it's pretty amazing.

691
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:32,320
And I think the entire thing took a 30 minute investment.

692
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,200
You know, I asked you, I had to ask you a couple of things because you had done it before.

693
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,960
So I bounced a couple of ideas off of you when I was, what was I, what was I, oh, it

694
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,560
was the remote connection stuff I was troubleshooting.

695
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,060
Yeah.

696
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:47,360
And once we got that solved with Wes's help, it was just, boom, done.

697
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,160
Wes got router OS into submission and we were good.

698
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,400
There's, there's areas of improvement.

699
00:44:52,400 --> 00:45:00,720
I think, I would like to explore using it for persistent connections between say the

700
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,840
studio in Texas or the studio in Texas and the RV, like maybe a way to like do sort of

701
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,160
like kind of, oh, not a mesh, but almost like a tink style VPN, I don't know.

702
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:10,660
Yeah.

703
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:14,960
But like do like a WireGuard connection from the RV to the system in Texas and from the

704
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,800
system in Texas to the studio and from the studio to RV and you know, like do a complete

705
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,880
I don't know, that's something for the future I want to play with.

706
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:26,560
Also, another thing that should probably happen is I should probably move it off of my work

707
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,600
station in my office.

708
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,160
Maybe pick something a little more permanent.

709
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:30,660
Yeah.

710
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,280
I was like, but where?

711
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,960
Like I could throw it up in a VM on the free NAS box possibly.

712
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,000
Yeah, that could work.

713
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,560
We also have that dedicated KVM system running CentOS, but it's really old.

714
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,080
It's like when Bitcoin was first released old, that's how old it is.

715
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:44,720
That's how I measure it.

716
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:45,220
Okay.

717
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,720
Well, maybe the workstations looking better.

718
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:51,120
Maybe the workstations looking better and better, but I really and you had it, you were

719
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,240
playing with it off of a droplet.

720
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:52,960
Oh, yeah, it works great.

721
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,480
The connection establishes so damn fast that I literally do a ping every time just to make

722
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
sure it's working because I'm like, how can I connect that fast?

723
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,880
Like I have to like go ping the other machine on the other end just to make sure no way

724
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,440
it's possible.

725
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,040
I was really impressed.

726
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:09,200
Yeah.

727
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,880
I mean, that's one of the nice features about it, right?

728
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,600
Is the way it doesn't have this kind of older style, really complicated, persistent connection

729
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:19,200
to do. It's smart enough to just pick up when you when you've got a new one and it picks

730
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,880
up and realizes, oh, hey, you're talking to me.

731
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,840
The public key matches my are you in my allowed IP set?

732
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,560
Yes.

733
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:24,960
All right.

734
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,360
There you go.

735
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,160
Connection made.

736
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:26,660
Yeah.

737
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:34,000
So if you feel like this, I guess it doesn't even there's so many uses for VPNs these days.

738
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,720
I wouldn't even I wouldn't even like put it in any particular box.

739
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,960
But what was the was it Nord VPN that did a commercial?

740
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,320
I think there's several now, but yeah.

741
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:44,880
Okay.

742
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,880
So it is something WireGuard is something that the commercial VPN providers are starting

743
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,440
to introduce.

744
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,840
So you could play with it that way, too, if you just wanted to mess around with the client

745
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:52,640
side of it.

746
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,760
But I got to say WireGuard, the WireGuard hype is real and it's pretty great.

747
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,400
And it's pretty easy to get running on a current released version of a Linux distro.

748
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,440
You don't have to wait for it to to show up baked into the kernel.

749
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,640
It's super simple.

750
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,200
How did you guys find that compared to Tink VPN to set up?

751
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:16,000
Um, it's a it's both simpler and slightly more complicated.

752
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,320
There's a couple things to do in terms of like exchanging keys that it's closer to SSH

753
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,880
and Tink is I guess Tink is about the same.

754
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,320
Does Tink have any GUI front end to set it up?

755
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,240
There might be there might be some I have not used.

756
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,600
Because that scenario WireGuard.

757
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:34,080
I mean, if there was like a network manager front end to WireGuard, that would be really

758
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:34,400
great.

759
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,840
I guess I'd have to say it's simpler because it has similar stuff around some of the key

760
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,520
management, WireGuard.

761
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,200
But then you don't have to use the actual, you know, there's no program to run.

762
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,440
You just install the module and then create the interface.

763
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,400
That is really nice.

764
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,360
It's system level.

765
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,160
It's just baked in.

766
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:53,040
You don't get Tink's magic of, you know, magically making a national connecting peers and all

767
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,520
that stuff.

768
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,160
But it's kind of so in that sense, it's a little more complicated, or it's a lower level

769
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,720
primitive that you could build more elaborate networks with.

770
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,920
I wonder if there could be a like a hosted key sharing system like could keybase, for

771
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,720
example, could could keybase could you add could they could there be like a front end

772
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,560
of WireGuard key exchanging that would make that a little easier because it's got these

773
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,320
it's I like this key system.

774
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,160
I think that's a good way to do it.

775
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,560
But exchanging keys is it's going to be like over email or chat.

776
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,880
And those are vulnerable channels of communication.

777
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,160
So it would be nice if there was like a key base dot IO kind of way to would actually

778
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,280
call fault work.

779
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,400
Maybe I don't know.

780
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,480
I don't know, maybe, maybe I haven't.

781
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,440
That's a good question.

782
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:37,840
That's sick.

783
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,520
That's that would be interesting.

784
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,840
Either way, very happy with WireGuard.

785
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:46,800
I'm yeah, I mean, I have a Tink system set up now that all part of it is a backbone from

786
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,080
my parents networks, my home network that I use like so I can get in and troubleshoot

787
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,560
stuff for them.

788
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,160
What do you think you're gonna replace that with WireGuard?

789
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:52,960
I think so.

790
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,280
Really?

791
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:53,920
No, why?

792
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:54,880
Why not stick with Tink?

793
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:58,000
You know, I wanted to do some maintenance in that system anyway.

794
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,160
And while I've been enjoying Tink, I just don't have that.

795
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,840
I don't have a big enough mesh where I really need that sort of, you know, Tink is great

796
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,840
for creating like one whole new overlay network that you want on top of everything.

797
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,720
But I have more security domains than I want.

798
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,480
You know, I don't want one big one, it turns out.

799
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:17,840
And yeah, I think WireGuard will be a very low maintenance backbone VPN connection.

800
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,200
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.

801
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,040
Which to be fair, Tink has to I don't ever have to fuss with it.

802
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,080
And it does just work.

803
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,720
But I also see myself using WireGuard more often.

804
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:28,480
So should I should I need to do any troubleshooting, it'll be fresh in my mind.

805
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,520
Yeah, and it seems like the way of the future, way of the future, way of the future.

806
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,480
I really liked it.

807
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,840
And it's going to be way faster than a lot of the competitors.

808
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,360
And if Apple is allowing it on test flight, then there's a good chance they're going to

809
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,640
allow it in the App Store.

810
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,000
And so there's a really good chance that we're going to have pretty good mobile OS

811
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,440
support for WireGuard.

812
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,680
And I think that's I think that's really, really important.

813
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:53,360
And the fact that it's so fast means that it's not a big deal for mobile travelers to

814
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,400
just tap it on and go.

815
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:54,800
Right.

816
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,000
And you've already got stuff like, you know, like a go version of Tink.

817
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,840
Go version, various user land versions.

818
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:04,080
I heard there was talk about maybe a free BSD kernel version sometime down the way.

819
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,200
No way. Really?

820
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:05,920
Yeah, maybe.

821
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,240
Maybe.

822
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,160
They already have one imports for the user land stuff, too.

823
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,480
So it's like, yeah, the availability is really climbing.

824
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:10,640
Yeah.

825
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,400
Well, how about we switch gears and talk about some app picks?

826
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:14,880
What?

827
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,560
Love the app picks.

828
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:22,560
Now, I've been I've been on a really slow decline with Reddit.

829
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,480
Like it's been it's been really since.

830
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,320
I don't know.

831
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,280
Two years, three years.

832
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:27,840
I can't remember.

833
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:33,120
Like, it's just I don't know, slowly and slowly, I use Reddit less and less.

834
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,800
And I find myself using smaller and smaller subreddits.

835
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,680
So the subreddits that I enjoy the most are the really small ones with like less than

836
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,360
a thousand really focused community.

837
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,560
There's not a lot of room for random trolls to come invade.

838
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:46,720
Yeah.

839
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,280
When you get above five thousand, I just I don't know.

840
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,200
It starts to turn toxic, I feel like.

841
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:57,040
But one way that I have been and it's just a visual differentiator.

842
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:02,400
But one way that I have been processing Reddit a lot easier is on the terminal.

843
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,040
And I've been using an app that's likely in the repo.

844
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,760
I thought you were going to say, I mean, just based on this, you know,

845
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,960
an iPad Pro application, that was the best way to browse Reddit.

846
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,240
No, man, I don't like that.

847
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,600
I don't like the Reddit mobile app.

848
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:18,640
And I also really freaking hate that when I go to Reddit on the web on a mobile device,

849
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,360
they're like taking up like a solid fourth of the screen.

850
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:21,680
It's huge.

851
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:22,880
Yeah, it's very annoying.

852
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,160
A third of the screen, really.

853
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,120
It's a third of the screen.

854
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,720
Almost half of the screen.

855
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,160
They're taking a full screen.

856
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,680
They're taking up your entire screen.

857
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,600
And then there's that annoying nag they put in lately, which is,

858
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,800
do you want to use our mobile?

859
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,760
That's what I'm talking about.

860
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,520
No, no, no, no, I don't.

861
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,720
That's why I'm not using it.

862
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,280
Go away.

863
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,320
That is what I'm talking about.

864
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,880
That thing that takes up basically half the screen.

865
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,960
Three quarters is so annoying and takes up the whole screen where it's come full screen,

866
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,400
full screen, full screen.

867
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,040
It's it's got to go in the meantime, though.

868
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:58,720
In the meantime, though, if you're on a Linux box, see if you have RTV in your repo.

869
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,160
RTV is a terminal user interface for Reddit that allows logging into your Reddit account.

870
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,680
So you get your subreddits.

871
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,000
I do.

872
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,600
I do have it in my repo.

873
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,000
You do.

874
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,400
You do.

875
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:08,640
Yeah.

876
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:13,440
And you can use external tools like it will launch your web browser or it can launch,

877
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,440
you know, like a YouTube player.

878
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,120
It's just a simple.

879
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,800
Oh, it's Python.

880
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,760
It's a Python application.

881
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,240
I thought it was something.

882
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,280
It's a Python application.

883
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,040
It's just a simple Python application.

884
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,440
Browse Reddit has clipboard support.

885
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,120
You can open media links in your preferred media player.

886
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,280
It's got easy navigation through the front page.

887
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,440
You can jump to your favie subreddits.

888
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,080
You can open up specific user pages if you want to, like, go get creepy on a user.

889
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,840
You can browse multi-Reddits.

890
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,200
It's got support for multi-Reddits.

891
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,000
Okay.

892
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:42,560
And search.

893
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:44,800
And you can do it all from the command line.

894
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,640
Something about seeing Reddit on the terminal makes it way more palatable for me.

895
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:51,920
Okay. That was pretty easy.

896
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,480
Now I'm browsing our list from the command line.

897
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,280
Isn't that great?

898
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:55,440
Yeah.

899
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,600
If you're on Ubuntu, it's in the repo already.

900
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,760
It's on a lot of repos actually.

901
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,720
I think it's in Fedora's too.

902
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,520
So that's pick number one this week.

903
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,720
Now, pick number two.

904
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:10,800
Pick number two was to replace functionality on a Mac.

905
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:17,200
The Mac, if you ever dip your toe into the Mac, like we've got, you know,

906
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,160
Final Cut on the Mac here that we used to use, thankfully, that's no longer the thing.

907
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,440
And the occasional Photoshop file.

908
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,680
So, you know, I dabble from time to time.

909
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:30,880
Haven't had to for a while.

910
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,760
But one of the things that I noticed about the Mac is they got all these little one-off

911
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,320
applications like we have on Linux for everything.

912
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,600
But they're all like pay-for applications.

913
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,080
Of course.

914
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:43,120
They're all like five bucks, ten bucks.

915
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:45,200
They've got that healthy app store, Chris.

916
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:46,400
Yeah, they sure do.

917
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,200
Actually, it's struggling, but they still like to charge for everything.

918
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,480
But on the Linux side, a lot of the stuff is free.

919
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,800
It's something we don't talk a lot about, maybe because, you know, we want people to

920
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,200
make money and we want them to be able to, you know, make money making software.

921
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,240
Like that's the thing we all want.

922
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,720
But there's so much shit that you get for free besides just the desktop.

923
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,920
There's so much stuff.

924
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,600
And some of this stuff the Mac users have no idea about.

925
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:14,320
This is one of them you can really rub in their face because this is hard to get on

926
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,000
the Mac that's decent quality that isn't at least 20 bucks.

927
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,080
And you may have heard of it, but I got to tell you about it.

928
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,760
It's called Sound Converter, and it's perfect for my workflow.

929
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,120
And Sound Converter is exactly what it sounds like.

930
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,120
It's an easy way to set up a preset.

931
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,080
You drop some files in there, you hit go, and it converts them all to that.

932
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,600
Which, as Wes probably has already guessed, is great for our production flow here because

933
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:41,440
we can record in a multitrack editor and huge WAV files.

934
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,320
And then I can drop all these WAV files in Sound Converter, it spits them out as mono

935
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,640
FLAC files and sends them off to Joe.

936
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,440
Boom.

937
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,000
Done.

938
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,360
And it's the same thing like if you want to convert a whole bunch of stuff to Ogg Vorbis

939
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:56,240
or MP3, you just drop them all in here and you hit go.

940
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,760
It saves you from writing out this whole complicated command line syntax.

941
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,480
And the batch support sounds pretty nice there.

942
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,480
And it has the benefit of giving you a GUI to expose all the options you might possibly

943
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,080
use, which is always really nice when you're getting started with conversion of media.

944
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,160
You don't even know always what you can do.

945
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,560
And this has the option of doing resample or, like in my case, dropping it to mono.

946
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,080
It has the option of transcoding to a different format if it can or just copying it if it's

947
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,360
going to the same format.

948
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,400
I like that Opus is a handy default input right there.

949
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,040
Yeah.

950
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,360
And it basically supports everything.

951
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,040
I'm sure it's just using FFmpeg and a bunch of other great stuff under the hood, but

952
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,600
Honey Badger over here, I don't care.

953
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,600
This is just a great way to use it because I can go from the file manager, boom, I hit

954
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,680
start, it puts it right in the directory I want, that syncs up to Joe, and I'm done.

955
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:47,840
And it's just so nice because there was an application on the Mac that used to do that

956
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:50,240
and it was legitimately like $20.

957
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,960
And I just see that kind of stuff.

958
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:59,200
And I'm just overwhelmingly appreciative of how enabling open source software can be

959
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:05,040
for people that don't have immaculate, huge, ginormous Uncle Scrooge sized budgets.

960
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:05,920
That's a really good point, right?

961
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,320
Because sometimes we're talking from the perspective of professionals or business or

962
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:12,400
just high end people at home.

963
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,880
And that's very different from sort of the baseline.

964
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:17,360
What should you be able to do with a computer for free?

965
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,480
If you just install this, you get that.

966
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:25,920
And because there's so many options, it's easy to forget how valuable that is.

967
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,400
But when I switched over to the Mac and I'm like, I mean, this is something I could do

968
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:30,800
for free?

969
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,160
You're telling me I got to spend $20?

970
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,280
This is ridiculous.

971
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,880
And I was incensed by it.

972
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:39,360
And then it's like, I have lost that appreciation for just how much comes with Linux

973
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,080
that is just totally free besides the desktop itself.

974
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,040
And I feel like the conversation is always around the value of the desktop.

975
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,880
But it's really, it's the entire ecosystem, right?

976
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,200
It's the applications, it's the support, it's all of it that's free.

977
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,320
And that's huge.

978
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,400
So, and this is just one of those great applications.

979
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:57,920
You can get it.

980
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,320
We'll have a link in the show notes, linuxunplugged.com

981
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,720
slash 279 and go there and get links to everything we talked about.

982
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,880
There's also the contact page there.

983
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,480
If you would like to send us some of your feedback, we have the subscribe link there.

984
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,600
If you want to get this show every single week, and we encourage that.

985
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:19,760
Just around the corner is our predictions episode and our roundup and look back.

986
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,600
And our future casting is what I'm going to call it.

987
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:26,000
Where we, if we had a magic wand, if we could just make something happen, where,

988
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,560
we're not constrained by the sad bounds of reality.

989
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:31,920
No, no, no.

990
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,840
And of course, it's a great opportunity for you to get involved in that virtual lug.

991
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,840
Give us your predictions and all of that.

992
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:41,360
So we'll do one the day after Christmas, Wednesday the 26th.

993
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,320
Escape your family.

994
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:43,680
You're tired of visiting with them.

995
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,040
Come hang out with us.

996
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:45,920
You got a hangover.

997
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,320
Just sit in your chair and chat in our mumble room and future cast.

998
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,160
Eggnog is welcome and allowed.

999
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,040
The day after New Year's, we'll have a show then too.

1000
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,800
And you can make your predictions, get it on the record.

1001
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,760
And I have been keeping a list of predictions and checking it twice.

1002
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,560
And I'm feeling really good about my predictions this year.

1003
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,720
I think it's my best year ever of predictions.

1004
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:03,520
So you better get started.

1005
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,240
Oh boy.

1006
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,600
Don't get, this is, this is tough.

1007
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,840
Go get more Wes over at TechSnap.Systems.

1008
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:08,800
Thank you for joining us.

1009
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,080
And we'll see you right back here.

1010
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:26,080
Next Tuesday.

1011
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:48,560
The Unplugged Show.

1012
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:49,760
There we go.

1013
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,120
$279 in the can.

1014
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,360
Let's go pick our title.

1015
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:55,120
And Mr. Payne, without further ado.

1016
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,400
How's that keyboard over there?

1017
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,440
Uh oh.

1018
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,320
It's not quite in flames.

1019
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:02,480
Yeah.

1020
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,760
It doesn't look like it's on fire right now.

1021
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,080
We're having a little bit of a compilation error that I'm working through right now.

1022
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,320
All right.

1023
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,120
Well, you got to post show.

1024
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:12,320
But I guess there's a lot of C++ here to go through.

1025
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,240
I feel like you do well under pressure.

1026
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,040
You'll get this.

1027
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:15,360
All right.

1028
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,760
We'll check back in with Wes Payne and how he's doing on getting his keyboardio on fire.

1029
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,000
We have to also pick our title.

1030
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,960
So we still have, we still have some housekeeping to get to.

1031
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,240
Thank you, Mumble Room.

1032
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,360
Always enjoy having you guys.

1033
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,960
Why are Guardians of the Galaxy?

1034
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,400
That is good.

1035
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:30,960
Yeah.

1036
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,600
Yeah, I agree.

1037
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:32,720
Yeah.

1038
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,160
What does that have to do with anything?

1039
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,040
Where'd that come from?

1040
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,480
Why, why a god?

1041
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,440
Oh, WireGuard.

1042
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:39,920
I see.

1043
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,040
Ah, I see.

1044
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,920
Come on.

1045
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,120
Oh, I see.

1046
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,640
You just heard the Galaxy.

1047
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,040
I did.

1048
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,680
Yeah.

1049
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:48,160
Dar, are you on the Dex doc again this week?

1050
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,040
Yes, I am.

1051
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,160
You maniac.

1052
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,280
You maniac.

1053
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,720
Well, I am doing a Tora experiment.

1054
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:59,280
So yeah, I'm like, I'm also using the iConnect headphones.

1055
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,720
So, ah, I also like embarrassing and embarrassing.

1056
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:05,600
That's pretty good.

1057
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:09,120
WireGuardians of the Galaxy, those really great.

1058
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,680
Man, we have some, those are some good ones.

1059
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,600
MB Aerosine is also pretty good.

1060
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,560
It's hard to say though.

1061
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,960
Micro K8s on Ubuntu.

1062
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,320
I no longer MB you.

1063
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,600
I like you.

1064
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,720
I no longer MB you.

1065
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,080
This is, this is the good one.

1066
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,880
Oh, does anybody, okay.

1067
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:27,200
All right.

1068
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,720
Does anybody have any travel hacks for me?

1069
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,000
Doing a lot of travel these days.

1070
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,080
You guys have any tips to make travel easier?

1071
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,200
Have you got one of those little,

1072
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,000
what's it called?

1073
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,520
Little, I've got this on my desk here.

1074
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,920
It's a little travel router, smart router,

1075
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:41,200
and it runs open WRT or something.

1076
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,360
And it connects to hotel wifi.

1077
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:47,200
So you do the captive portal once and then all your devices

1078
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,600
are magic, like a Chromecast just works.

1079
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,400
It's great.

1080
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,400
I have been thinking more and more about that

1081
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,480
because I could also WireGuard from that, right?

1082
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,240
So that could establish a WireGuard connection

1083
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,040
back to the studio.

1084
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:57,600
Yeah.

1085
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,160
Yeah.

1086
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,600
And that could be extremely useful.

1087
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,840
And I could just route the 192 network over there.

1088
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:07,760
So I used it in the summer when I was over to get BBC iPlayer in America.

1089
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,800
So I just VPN back to England using that little box.

1090
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,360
It's great.

1091
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:11,920
Hmm.

1092
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,920
Is it a GLI neat one?

1093
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:19,040
Yes, I have the GLMT300N.

1094
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:20,880
GLI stuff is great.

1095
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,440
Realms open WRT right out of the box.

1096
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:24,560
They don't do too much.

1097
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,520
They do it their own custom interface, but that's not too bad.

1098
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,040
Could you, you should throw a link.

1099
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:29,520
Yeah.

1100
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,680
I have like three of them.

1101
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:32,160
Link it up.

1102
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,600
Put it in the chat room.

1103
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,280
So this is just open WRT have like a capacity for like connecting to my files too.

1104
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,880
And what about the double net issue?

1105
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,080
Badger, do you have issues with double net when you do this?

1106
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,160
It will repeat Wi-Fi just fine.

1107
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:50,080
And double net, I don't know because I'm only ever going outbound

1108
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,480
because I'm usually where the thing is.

1109
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,920
So I haven't tried.

1110
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,440
I'm worried about that too much.

1111
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,080
Sorry.

1112
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,040
I got to check this out.

1113
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,080
We got to link this up.

1114
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,960
Because this could be, this could be nice.

1115
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,280
The other thing that we were playing with is a little project called iodine.

1116
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:09,360
And this has been fun.

1117
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:09,600
Yeah.

1118
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,200
This has a lot of potential.

1119
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,800
Iodine allows you to, and correct me if I'm wrong, tunnel TCP traffic over DNS.

1120
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:17,760
Yep.

1121
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,480
Try out SSH Shuttle for that.

1122
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,080
It's much easier to set up.

1123
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,440
It just works over SSH.

1124
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:25,680
I'll look into this too, SSH Shuttle.

1125
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,600
SSH Shuttle.

1126
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,760
But the nice thing about iodine is it's, it has,

1127
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,640
DNS has to work for a lot of these captive portals to work.

1128
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,960
So if you're on a network that has a captive portal,

1129
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,840
in order for the page to load, DNS is likely working.

1130
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,360
And so you can exploit that to get access to the internet

1131
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,640
without having to accept the captive portal, which I think has a lot of potential.

1132
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,160
It is not super fast.

1133
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,320
You can hope for maybe like 200 kilobits per second or something.

1134
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:55,680
Yeah, it's, it's straight up.

1135
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,080
Is it, is it Shuttle with two S's or is it?

1136
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:58,480
Yeah.

1137
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,640
I just dropped a link into IRC for you.

1138
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:01,120
Okay.

1139
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:01,600
All right.

1140
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:02,000
All right.

1141
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:02,320
All right.

1142
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,280
This is happening.

1143
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,880
We're, we're getting down on all of this.

1144
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:11,040
So iodine has the potential to keep me connected in situations,

1145
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,920
maybe like when I'm in the air that I normally couldn't be connected

1146
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:19,360
for text messaging and email and IRC and Slack and telegram.

1147
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,320
Not live streaming.

1148
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:22,960
No, not for, not for Netflix or anything like that.

1149
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:23,600
Yeah.

1150
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,800
I did see somebody trying to watch Netflix on the airplane on the flight back.

1151
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:27,280
Oh really?

1152
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,200
How did that go for them?

1153
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,000
Cause I phone those connections to vary a lot.

1154
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,760
I don't, I don't, I didn't watch closely.

1155
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,120
The trick is you download man.

1156
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:40,560
That's why Netflix on mobile devices allows you to download content before you travel.

1157
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,760
Maybe they downloaded.

1158
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:42,480
That might be it.

1159
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:43,840
Maybe they downloaded.

1160
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:44,560
Yeah.

1161
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,960
So S Shuttle, is that, is that what I'm looking for here?

1162
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,120
Yeah.

1163
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:47,600
This looks.

1164
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,560
SSH.

1165
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:48,880
Yeah.

1166
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,120
Yeah.

1167
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:49,600
S Shuttle.

1168
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,560
I suppose it is.

1169
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,000
I've just put some aliases in the, uh, IRC for you too.

1170
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,760
So it puts think the paid file up so you can run it as a demon in the background.

1171
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,760
So very, very nice.

1172
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:02,000
Yeah.

1173
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,240
Transparent proxy server that works as a poor man's VPN forwards over SSH.

1174
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,200
Doesn't require admin.

1175
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,440
Supports DNS tunneling.

1176
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:10,000
That's great.

1177
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,920
I didn't, I've used it for just the regular stuff, but I didn't know it had the DNS component.

1178
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,320
DNS tunneling could be pretty, pretty great.

1179
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,440
I, uh, it's in the, uh, it's in the repo too.

1180
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:19,840
Hmm.

1181
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:22,080
So it's a pretty low barrier of entry here.

1182
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:23,440
I'll put a link to this in the show notes.

1183
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,120
I think this is also worth checking out.

1184
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,000
Thank you, sir.

1185
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,040
That's a good travel hack.

1186
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:27,280
Yeah.

1187
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,480
So that's the kind of stuff I'm talking about.

1188
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:29,360
I like this stuff.

1189
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:31,360
I use it to get around corporate firewalls.

1190
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:38,000
So your mileage, cause you can put SSH on port four, four, three, and then use corkscrew to

1191
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,560
tunnel your SSH through on port four, four, three.

1192
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:45,440
So most proxies can't tell the difference between that and SSH traffic.

1193
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,080
So right.

1194
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,200
Yeah.

1195
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,440
And, um, that's the thing about DNS tunneling is like, they can't shut down DNS or else that

1196
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,320
breaks a lot of stuff.

1197
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:53,200
So they're kind of stuck.

1198
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:56,720
DNS is sort of essential for all this to work.

1199
01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:00,320
So that's what's great about being able to tunnel over DNS is sort of the gotcha, uh,

1200
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:01,200
the gotcha maneuver.

1201
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:01,760
Hmm.

1202
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,200
Well, um, I like that.

1203
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,080
Thank you.

1204
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,440
I'll take a look into all of that.

1205
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,720
If anybody else has any travel tips, uh, travel hack tips.

1206
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:08,960
Yeah.

1207
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,640
We can all get by better together.

1208
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,120
Yeah.

1209
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:11,440
Yeah.

1210
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,560
At Chris Elias.

1211
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,400
Oh, uh, Badger, it looks like J6 is saying in the, uh, chat room that there's actually

1212
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,720
a system D service, uh, for S shuttle too.

1213
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,920
So that could be the way to go.

1214
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,240
Yeah.

1215
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:21,120
Can imagine there is.

1216
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:23,840
All right, Mr.

1217
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,720
Payne, it's the last check-in of the show.

1218
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,640
How are we doing over there?

1219
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:30,560
How is the keyboardio treating you?

1220
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:30,960
Okay.

1221
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:35,600
Well, I, I was able to build the clean firmware for the keyboard.

1222
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:36,080
Okay.

1223
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,560
Now I haven't tested it yet, so we can do that.

1224
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,360
Oh, really?

1225
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,600
So you've rebuilt the entire firmware?

1226
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,100
Yes.

1227
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,920
Oh my goodness.

1228
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,080
And, and you're about to deploy it to the keyboard?

1229
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:46,720
Oh, wow.

1230
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:49,200
We certainly, I mean, that's the next step.

1231
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,240
Now it doesn't have the plugin modifications.

1232
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,800
Oh, that's going to be the, that'll be the trick after this.

1233
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,400
Assuming, assuming this works.

1234
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,120
All right, let's do it.

1235
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:00,640
So let's, uh, let's send that new interface over.

1236
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,880
So this firmware, by the way, so it goes, the interface is USB-C, but the keyboards

1237
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,200
themselves are actually in two pieces combined together.

1238
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,400
Look like butterfly wings.

1239
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:12,960
And they're connected with what seems to be an ethernet cable between the two different

1240
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:18,080
keyboards, Wes Payne plugging it in right now, getting ready to deploy the new keyboardio

1241
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:18,480
firmware.

1242
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:19,520
Yeah, let's see here.

1243
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:25,440
Custom firmware for a custom keyboard with beautiful mechanical key switches,

1244
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:32,160
a nice maple wood enclosure and Linux firmware inside the hardware.

1245
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:32,880
All right, Wes.

1246
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:33,380
All right.

1247
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,320
Um, I mean, it's kind of anticlimactic.

1248
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:38,800
It is, right?

1249
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,400
Well, there's a lot of steps here.

1250
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:40,640
Okay.

1251
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:44,560
You know what, you know, what we'll have to say is, uh, I guess tune in next week to find

1252
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:45,040
out if it works.

1253
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:45,200
Right.

1254
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,800
Tune in next week where I'll be exclusively using the keyboardio.

1255
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:50,240
Really?

1256
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,560
Do we get that handy dandy music again next week?

1257
01:06:52,560 --> 01:07:10,560
Yes.
