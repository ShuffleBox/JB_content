1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
So this is no joke, Wes.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,680
Did you see that the XKCD form got owned?

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,200
A leak?

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,600
Oh, watch out.

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,640
Watch out, Wes.

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,400
It's no good.

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,560
I mean, XKCD, the site's OK.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,160
But the user form, which has a pretty sizable amount

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,480
of accounts, like 562,000 accounts, was compromised.

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,560
Oh, boy, yeah.

11
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,600
Email, IP, and password hashes.

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,560
This was pointed out by the one and only Troy Hunt.

13
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,800
And I guess it actually occurred two months back.

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,160
Yeah.

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,880
You know, happens to all of us.

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,160
Happens to the best of us.

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,440
They did, of course, have a little comic to go with it.

18
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,880
That's pretty great.

19
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,000
There's a How Hacking Works by XKCD.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,320
Very relevant right now.

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:52,560
Hello, friends, and welcome into Linux Unplugged,

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,880
your weekly Linux talk show.

23
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,960
This is episode 317.

24
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,880
My name is Chris.

25
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,680
My name is Wes.

26
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,960
Hello, Wes.

27
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,560
Good to be connected with you from afar.

28
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,680
I'm on the road today.

29
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,760
It's impressive.

30
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,280
But nevertheless, we've got a huge show.

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,800
We do.

32
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,160
Actually, I think it's really kind of,

33
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,240
it might be too much show for a remote episode.

34
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,400
We'll find out if we pull it off.

35
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,200
Well, stop messing around, gosh.

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,440
Well, you know, Wes, I decided to take a little trip, which

37
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,280
I'll tell you all about here in a little bit.

38
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,440
And it turned out to be very fruitful.

39
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,120
Not only did we get to go hang out with the one and only Wendell

40
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,520
Wilson from Level One Techs, but I just

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,320
got back from the Red Hat Tower, too.

42
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,040
So we'll tell you about that and help

43
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,840
us get through all of the community news

44
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,920
and a bunch of big stuff that's launching next week.

45
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,240
Of course, we've got our Mumble Room.

46
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,960
Time appropriate greetings, Virtual Lug.

47
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,460
Hello.

48
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:39,960
Hello.

49
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,460
Hello.

50
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:40,960
Hello.

51
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,460
Hello.

52
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:41,960
Hello.

53
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,160
Hi.

54
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,660
Oh, hi.

55
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,400
And also, we got Cheesy and Drew here,

56
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,800
helping us break it all down, too.

57
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,680
Hello, gentlemen.

58
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,440
Hey, guys.

59
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,560
Hey, nice to have you there.

60
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,400
Boy, we got a packed Mumble Room today.

61
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
So that's pretty great.

62
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,720
Alex, you're graciously hosting me today,

63
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,160
and you're in the Mumble Room.

64
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,000
That's wonderful.

65
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,500
Yeah.

66
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,000
Howdy.

67
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,120
Howdy over there.

68
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,100
Alex has the ultimate podcast set up right now

69
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,000
because I kicked him out of his office to host him,

70
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,960
and he's rocking it like a pro podcaster

71
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,160
right now on the couch.

72
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,560
Soup's comfortable.

73
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,440
I see how it is.

74
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,280
Now that we've launched self-hosted,

75
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,200
you're like just gone all pro now.

76
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,120
He's got a microphone stand that's designed just

77
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,280
to be right next to him.

78
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,480
He's got this comfortable spot with the dog,

79
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,040
and he's been hosting me since Thursday.

80
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,920
We came down.

81
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,800
I came down from Seattle.

82
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,600
He came and picked me up from the airport,

83
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,120
and it's been quite the adventure.

84
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,040
So we have a lot to talk about today.

85
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,760
But we should probably start with some community news

86
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,640
as we like to do, some big things going on

87
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,600
in the community, starting off with the news around exFAT.

88
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,120
So by now, you've likely heard that Microsoft

89
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,800
has given their blessing for the exFAT file system

90
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,520
to not only land in the Linux kernel,

91
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,360
but to also become part of that wider OIN Linux system

92
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:52,920
definition.

93
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,320
So it's big news.

94
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,320
And the information has been pretty extensive.

95
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,840
Like, everybody's really covered this.

96
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,920
We got the story down.

97
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,120
But the short version is code's not out,

98
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,080
but it's a policy change.

99
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,080
And surprise, surprise, a driver has existed for quite a while,

100
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,840
although it's proprietary.

101
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,240
But it started popping up in 2013.

102
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,760
That code was never actually released under a free license

103
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,160
because patent issues remained.

104
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,160
So no real serious efforts to upstream it

105
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,760
went into the mainline kernel.

106
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,440
It just never really happened.

107
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,520
But LWN, Jonathan Colbert, has a really good article

108
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,720
that we'll link to that talks about part of the background

109
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,920
here about this kernel driver that's kind of getting

110
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
beaten into shape now.

111
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,200
Yeah, that's right.

112
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,720
Way back in July, a developer posted

113
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,640
that he'd transformed the code into something that maybe could

114
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,960
be upstreamed, but didn't know what else needed to happen

115
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,160
to make that possible.

116
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,840
And the ensuing discussion made it clear

117
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,760
that the patent issues were still a showstopper.

118
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,960
And I mean, can you blame them with those things outstanding?

119
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,240
I wouldn't want it in my kernel.

120
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,080
Yeah, right.

121
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,800
Although, they may actually have something out of this, right?

122
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,880
Now that Microsoft's given their blessing,

123
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,080
maybe those patent issues aren't such a big deal.

124
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,920
Maybe we're going to get a driver sooner than later.

125
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,640
Yeah, I mean, it seems like with Greg KH agreeing

126
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,680
that it could be part of the staging tree,

127
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,000
I think it's going to happen one way or another.

128
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,480
Yeah, it has all things a bit of drama around this.

129
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,800
Some people think it's too shoddy of work.

130
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,440
Other people think that they should start over clean.

131
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,800
But it looks like it's headed towards the staging tree,

132
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,960
where it will be tested.

133
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,760
And people will determine if it's usable or not.

134
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,040
It's coming faster than I think we anticipated.

135
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,960
Thank goodness, too.

136
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,280
I mean, I just remember a couple of weeks ago,

137
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,760
you were finding out that this didn't work so well

138
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,400
under Linux.

139
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,880
And maybe all the future Crises out there,

140
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,800
they can just forget about this little problem.

141
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,760
Yeah, you're right.

142
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,600
I popped in my SD card from my Canon camera a couple of weeks

143
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,400
ago, took some pictures from the old Sprint Skis that we had,

144
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,480
and thought, oh, I'll just grab these really quick

145
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,040
and share them with everybody.

146
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,800
And realized that out of the box, my Fedora desktop

147
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,440
could not read an exFAT formatted SD card.

148
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,160
And of course, that's a very, very common format

149
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,320
for external disks and for SD storage on cameras.

150
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,960
Yeah, you know, Chris, Joe and I covered this a little bit

151
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,440
on Linux Action News 121.

152
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,120
That you did.

153
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,160
And as always, thank you for filling in on that.

154
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,080
You're always great, Wes, on Linux Action News.

155
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,120
So check that out.

156
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
The guys go into a bit of detail there.

157
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,600
And incidentally, for those of you that don't remember,

158
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,760
in 2014, it was reported that Microsoft makes anywhere

159
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:27,040
from $5 to $15 per Android device that's

160
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,480
shipped with an exFAT driver.

161
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,320
So that's a huge chunk of change.

162
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,080
That's crazy.

163
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,920
That's crazy.

164
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,440
I know.

165
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
It's so much money.

166
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,200
And they say no more further patent litigation is in the works.

167
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,120
They're done with that.

168
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,600
Done.

169
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,840
Woo-hoo.

170
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,480
The Wayland future is near.

171
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,320
And there's some great news coming out

172
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
of a Google Summer of Code project

173
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,760
Michael Eberle over on Ferronix has a write-up about Wayland

174
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,520
Pipe, which will provide network-transparent Wayland

175
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,240
proxy for running native Wayland programs or games

176
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,560
over a network similar to x11's x40 over SSH capabilities.

177
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,000
How great is this?

178
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,360
It all started when student developer Manuel Stogel got

179
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,040
paired up with Google Summer of Code

180
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,340
and funded to work on this.

181
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,280
And it's now successfully working

182
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,680
for Wayland games and applications.

183
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,240
You can go give it a try right now if you like.

184
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,760
It also supports some handy features

185
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,500
like compression, multi-threaded optimizations,

186
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,320
and hardware acceleration in some cases.

187
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,160
I have one reaction to this, which is finally.

188
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,600
Yeah, it's one of those things that's kind of outstanding.

189
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,160
Everyone working on Wayland is like, yeah, yeah,

190
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,800
we'll get to it.

191
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,680
We'll solve it.

192
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,600
So far, no one's complained about it too much.

193
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,520
In theory, we can do it.

194
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,560
There's nothing stopping us.

195
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,240
We just haven't.

196
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,200
And I guess, I mean, now that's true.

197
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,960
Yeah.

198
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,760
Yeah, while Google Summer of Code has ended,

199
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,880
the project is going to go on, hopefully.

200
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,080
Some further code cleanup, potentially some refactoring,

201
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,600
some protocol extension.

202
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,920
There's a really, really kind of comprehensive breakdown

203
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,680
we have linked in the show notes.

204
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,320
We'll give you a couple of highlights.

205
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,960
Unlike the original X protocol, only part of the data

206
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,080
is needed to display an application transferred

207
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,000
over the network for the application

208
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,800
because the connection is done at the compositor level.

209
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,560
So large chunks of information can just

210
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,360
be data that the compositor needs

211
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,760
to draw the application and associated file descriptors.

212
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,200
There is side channel information

213
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,480
you could include in there that talks about the position

214
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,840
and all of that kind of information

215
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,920
that the display manager needs to display it on the other end.

216
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,240
They just need a communications channel between them.

217
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,440
And in this case, they can use SSH.

218
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,400
Yeah, Waypipe even includes some handy little wrappers too.

219
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,960
So you can just sort of run Waypipe,

220
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,120
point it at another server.

221
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,280
It'll handle all the little SSH details,

222
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,720
and you just get a remote Wayland connection.

223
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,480
Yeah, that's really nice.

224
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,360
And some of the small tweaking is

225
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,400
done to just sort of make things a little more network

226
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,320
transportable.

227
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,440
For instance, they'll strip out certain kinds

228
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,920
of advertising capability messages

229
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,320
that will often be associated with graphics cards

230
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,080
or whatnot that advertise what their capabilities are.

231
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,760
Instead, that can be done once, and then it

232
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,160
can be edited out from the transmission over the network.

233
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,480
Yeah, the developer has a very impressive and detailed blog

234
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,360
post up that we'll have linked in the show notes.

235
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Yeah, check it out.

236
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,600
Linuxunplugged.com slash 317.

237
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
I'm really, really hopeful about this

238
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,160
while it was a Google Summer of Code project, which,

239
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,840
side note, some really good stuff coming out of Google

240
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,080
Summer of Code this year.

241
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,600
Anyways, Waypipe also supports a bunch of quality of life

242
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,840
features, including, like Wes said,

243
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,760
that wrapper, hardware accelerated video encoding,

244
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,880
awesome, transfer compression, and a method

245
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,120
to reconnect to applications if your connection,

246
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,480
like your SSH connection, drops.

247
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:44,800
It'll support reconnecting and resuming the applications.

248
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,600
Really excited about this.

249
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,720
And of course, it can proxy programs

250
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,520
that render images using OpenGL.

251
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,640
So like we mentioned, there is a capability here

252
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,040
that you could even stream something

253
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,400
as complex as a game over the network with reasonable results

254
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,200
if your bandwidth is sufficient.

255
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:01,960
That's crazy.

256
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,160
Doesn't this really kind of solve

257
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,080
the number one concern people usually

258
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,920
bring up about switching to Wayland is X11 forwarding?

259
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,120
Yeah, we're getting there.

260
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,360
More and more of these just keep getting knocked down,

261
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,520
sometimes surprisingly quickly, like in this case.

262
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,480
And before long, well, the Wayland future will be here.

263
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,360
The only one left now is NVIDIA, right?

264
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Yeah.

265
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,200
I mean, I know there's initial work on that.

266
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,280
Yeah, that stings.

267
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,520
That does sting.

268
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,880
Because I've been rocking Wayland still.

269
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,360
Since that weekend with Wayland, I

270
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,880
haven't gone back on my ThinkPad.

271
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,360
I'm still using it.

272
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,440
I'm hooked on the Smooth.

273
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,800
Once I see it, I can't go back.

274
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,400
We talked to Wendell about that, too, a little bit.

275
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,200
We'll get to that.

276
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,840
But let's talk about something huge happening next week.

277
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,360
A major version of Gnome Shell, I'm sorry,

278
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,600
Gnome Shell is coming out, Gnome Shell 3.34.

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
And Joey over at OMG Ubuntu has a write-up of some of the top

280
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,740
things that are in there.

281
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,400
But we'll just cover a couple of these.

282
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,400
And then we're going to go deep on some performance work that

283
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,800
really moves the needle.

284
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,440
But from a general user improvement,

285
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,720
there's a few things in here that are nice in Gnome 3.4,

286
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,600
which is scheduled to land next Tuesday,

287
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,200
should everything go as planned.

288
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,920
Now, the new version makes it much easier

289
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,720
to create app folders in that application overview.

290
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,080
Right there, when you have all of the apps that come up,

291
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,600
you can now, from in there, kind of like on a mobile device,

292
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,360
you can drag icons on top of each other.

293
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
It creates a folder.

294
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,480
It makes it nice to organize that.

295
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,440
And then, like in the Ubuntu doc, I believe,

296
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,280
haven't tested this yet, but I believe those folders will then

297
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,520
also work in the doc, which I think

298
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,760
that's a really cool thing.

299
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,280
Oh, that's very nice.

300
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,520
It's also much easier to preview backgrounds.

301
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,000
You don't actually have to set them, you know?

302
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,120
You can also set an image as the desktop background,

303
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,600
lock screen background, or both with the handy new popover

304
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,360
menu.

305
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,080
And you're no longer limited to picking a wallpaper

306
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:56,120
from the top level JPEG folders in your pictures folder.

307
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,600
Just click the Add Picture button

308
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,980
and pick a file anywhere on your system.

309
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,560
I mean, come on, about time.

310
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,680
Hallelujah.

311
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,120
It's truly 2019.

312
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,240
I can now choose my own pictures folder, which is nice,

313
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,660
because I like to organize my pictures folder.

314
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,120
I don't like having everything just

315
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,200
in the root of my freaking pictures folder.

316
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,800
So I am surprisingly stoked about this feature.

317
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,400
Well, another thing you might like

318
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,400
is an improved Sysprof tool for profiling your system.

319
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,360
It's got a redesigned UI, new data sources,

320
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,680
and integration with core GNOME platform libraries,

321
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,520
including GTK and Mudder.

322
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,400
So maybe now you can measure just how smooth it is.

323
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,720
Joey's got a killer screenshot of this.

324
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,760
Like, this looks like a real tool, doesn't it?

325
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,400
Yeah, I mean, if I didn't already have NetData,

326
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,280
I might really, really want this.

327
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,320
Hmm, hmm, yeah.

328
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,280
No, actually, the deep hooks right into GNOME,

329
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,480
this seems like super handy.

330
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
It wasn't as useful before, but now I

331
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
think I'll definitely be using it on systems that have GNOME.

332
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,840
Yeah.

333
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,760
I am also delighted to see improvements

334
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,240
coming to GNOME boxes.

335
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,580
That's the virtual and remote machine manager.

336
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,440
Some nice changes in the 3.34 release.

337
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,000
For instance, the new Box Assistant

338
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,880
has an improved workflow to make it super quick

339
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,640
to get machines up and running.

340
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,880
And there's a new option.

341
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,760
I don't know what this is, Alex, but it's

342
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,060
called the 3D acceleration.

343
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,160
Is it now optional setting?

344
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,960
Do you think they're talking about pass-through?

345
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,640
I don't know.

346
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,600
VirtualBox has had a 3D acceleration thing for a while.

347
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,680
Maybe it's related to that, but we can hope.

348
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,520
Could just be a different kind of driver.

349
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,520
I think it's more likely related to VertIO 3D

350
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,000
acceleration, which is available for some Linux distributions.

351
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,640
Right.

352
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,680
That would make sense.

353
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,480
I feel like GNOME boxes would be the perfect project

354
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,400
to make a PCI pass through a couple of checkboxes

355
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,420
and a dropdown to choose the PCI device you want to pass through.

356
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,160
It would unleash so much virtualization power.

357
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,460
It's a whole new level, right?

358
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,000
Like, that would actually be very accessible to people in a way

359
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,240
that it's just not right now.

360
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,360
Yeah, yeah.

361
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,680
Well, there is some good news.

362
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,000
There is an open issue for that on the GNOME GitLab.

363
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,320
Yeah, maybe it'll result in something.

364
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,680
That would be wonderful.

365
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
We've seen a lot of performance improvements

366
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,120
landing in the most current releases of GNOME.

367
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,840
Talk about a great meme, because the meme is now like, oh, yeah,

368
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,480
every release has performance improvements.

369
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,060
This one, though, is so significant.

370
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,760
We're seeing last-minute inclusion,

371
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,200
although it's been tested.

372
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,120
But GNOME 3.4 is expected to release in just a few days

373
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:25,880
as we record this.

374
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,240
So squeezing this mutterfix in at the last moment

375
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,160
is a big deal.

376
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,480
And it has a big impact for those

377
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,960
that are running GNOME on X11 with the NVIDIA proprietary

378
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,920
graphics driver.

379
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, that's right.

380
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,160
Canonical's been hard at work, in particular,

381
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,960
Daniel von Wut over there.

382
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,160
And you may know him from his many GNOME performance

383
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,840
optimizations that we're very happy with.

384
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Well, over the past two years, he's

385
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,480
been toying with a particular NVIDIA fix.

386
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,280
It's basically the removal of GLX-threaded swap weight

387
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,200
handling for the NVIDIA binary driver.

388
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,280
And it ended up stalling both the CPU and the GPU.

389
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,160
And it's just not serving its intended performance use cases

390
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,640
with the current state of mutters code.

391
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,960
The issue it was originally designed to address

392
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,280
around unthrottled rendering, well, that's

393
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,160
just been addressed in a separate patch

394
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,600
and done in a different way earlier this summer.

395
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,520
So just in time for 3.34.

396
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,900
If you've been fighting with this,

397
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,440
if you've noticed that you're an NVIDIA binary user, hey,

398
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,520
it's a great time to be using GNOME.

399
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,060
Yeah, and that's not the only performance

400
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,600
fix that came from Canonical's Daniel von Wut.

401
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,880
We've got to get him on the show,

402
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,400
because he has done the people's work recently.

403
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,120
He's also landed another fix that

404
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,360
will be performance improving for everyone

405
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,720
that has a mouse cursor.

406
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,880
So if you use GNOME Shell with a mouse,

407
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,920
this performance improvement applies to you.

408
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,400
That's me.

409
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,640
That's me.

410
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,480
It also has a fun name, geometric picking.

411
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,080
And yeah, it's about cursor movement and avoiding OpenGL

412
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,800
or using the GPU for color picking operations.

413
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,680
That logic is now being done on the CPU without OpenGL,

414
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,400
but it turns out it's actually more efficient this way

415
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,720
and is able to cause a measurable drop in CPU usage

416
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,480
when moving the mouse.

417
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,880
And I don't want something that simple to be taxed on my system.

418
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,000
So by not using the GPU, they're saving CPU cycles.

419
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,600
You know, I imagine they were shuffling data off over

420
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,960
to the GPU in this case.

421
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,240
And if it's faster to just do it with the CPU,

422
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,080
then bother to go out, get the data,

423
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,660
send it to the GPU, and bring it back.

424
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,160
Well, that might be a win.

425
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,840
I guess so.

426
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,320
I guess so.

427
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,320
They write on the bug tracker, this new approach also

428
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,120
dramatically reduces the number of picking paint cycles

429
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,240
required for cursor movements since the pickability

430
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,600
of an entire screen is calculated and cached.

431
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,360
That's smart.

432
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,280
Interesting.

433
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,640
Stuff like this is so, so great.

434
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,960
So these are like core infrastructure things

435
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,560
that we need to see improved in Gnome.

436
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,360
It's interesting too, right?

437
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,780
This is kind of exactly the stuff

438
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,000
we were hoping for when Canonical adopted Gnome

439
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,120
as their default desktop.

440
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,360
And it's really been coming true.

441
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,580
100%, 100% true.

442
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,600
Good point.

443
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,120
And kind of along these same lines,

444
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,560
Gwadek just wrapped up the Gnome conference.

445
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,040
And Cassidy, who is, is it the Chief Experience Officer?

446
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,620
Cassidy, is that what the X stands for?

447
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,680
He's joining us today.

448
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,400
Yeah.

449
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,160
Hello, Cassidy.

450
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,200
Thank you for being here.

451
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,320
You had a talk on the need for a free desktop dark style

452
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,400
preference.

453
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,020
Now, you're not in this talk.

454
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,200
You're not advocating dark style, dark theme,

455
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,840
all the things.

456
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,840
But what you are saying is, hey, maybe dark theming

457
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,920
is an accessibility thing.

458
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,920
Yeah, basically over the last year,

459
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,120
we've seen all these other platforms adopting dark styles.

460
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,440
And they've done it in a really similar way.

461
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,280
And so I've been kind of watching this happen.

462
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,760
And I've been listening to developers and users

463
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,800
talk about the issues with dark styles.

464
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,240
And so this proposal is basically a way

465
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,560
that we could support this on free desktop OSes,

466
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,000
like Gnome-based OSes, or KDE-based, or elementary OS.

467
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,320
But in a way that's easy for developers to implement

468
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,480
and doesn't really break everything.

469
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,760
Yeah, you had a great example.

470
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,920
You'll have a link to your video in there.

471
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,720
You talk about, well, what if that one day you're

472
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,260
in a dark conference room, and you want to take notes,

473
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,020
and you want to flip your screen over to dark mode for that day?

474
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,960
Or what if you're starting to have a headache come on,

475
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,520
and you've got to finish something up,

476
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,020
and you just want to flip your system

477
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,840
to dark mode for a little bit?

478
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,360
And then there's also the overwhelming evidence

479
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,920
that all of the other desktop and mobile vendors

480
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,520
are implementing dark mode support,

481
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,640
and including web browsers.

482
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,300
So it's here, really.

483
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,100
And we don't want to be necessarily left out.

484
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,960
But you're not saying everybody go off and do it your own way.

485
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,480
You're saying we should come up with a free desktop.org

486
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,520
standard.

487
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,040
However, you are saying it in a time

488
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,000
when there's a bit of pushback on theming in general.

489
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,360
So I'm curious, how's it being received?

490
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,560
How did the bird of the feather session go afterwards?

491
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,840
How's the overall reception to this idea

492
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,800
that we should accommodate this?

493
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,080
So the BoF, the birds of a feather session,

494
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,640
actually went really well.

495
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,520
It seems like about a year ago, when I first

496
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,120
started bringing this idea up, there was a lot of pushback.

497
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,440
Because this idea of ripping the style sheet out

498
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,280
from under apps and putting a different theme on them,

499
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,720
there was a lot of pushback from app developers.

500
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,440
But when we talk about it from doing it at a specification

501
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,000
level where it's expected, an expected feature

502
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,320
of the platform, and when other platforms are doing it

503
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:38,800
in a really similar way, it seems like the conversation

504
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,300
shifted.

505
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,280
And people are just kind of like, yeah, let's just do it.

506
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,440
And what was cool is we actually combined the birds

507
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,480
of a feather session with the GTK one,

508
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,160
because there wasn't actually that much

509
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,880
to discuss in our separate one for the dark style.

510
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,400
And that meant we got the insight

511
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,600
of very experienced GTK developers,

512
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,200
and we got a whole room of a few dozen people

513
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,720
to kind of think about this and think about a way forward.

514
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,280
So there's already work going into GTK 4 to help support

515
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,000
this, some new APIs.

516
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,280
So it's exciting to see it already moving forward.

517
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,400
I also noted, and I'm not sure if this was a product of Guadec

518
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,200
or if it just happened around the same time,

519
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,920
but it seems like there's been some kind of agreement

520
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,120
that vendor themes are going to stick around,

521
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,000
and now we need to figure out how to properly do them.

522
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,880
Did you see this?

523
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,760
Yeah, and I was actually involved quite a bit in this.

524
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,200
It's actually all intertwined with the different style

525
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,000
sheets that are user style sheets, dark styles,

526
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,440
and then downstream vendors like Ubuntu or Pop!

527
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,200
OS, or even elementary to a certain degree.

528
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,040
We're going to exist forever, and there's

529
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,560
different arguments from different camps of we really

530
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,680
think that the system should have a certain style that

531
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,920
matches our hardware and fits in with our brand.

532
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,000
And I think a year ago, again, we

533
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,540
had that whole theming discussion,

534
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,840
and then this year, it's a little bit

535
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,600
of a more mature discussion, I think,

536
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,400
about it of, OK, we've kind of heard the extremes.

537
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,320
Let's come to the middle and agree on something

538
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
on some way forward.

539
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,420
And so basically, the way we're moving forward,

540
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:26,240
it seems like within Gnome, is a more publicized and supported

541
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,720
styling API, I guess, with publicly exposed CSS variables

542
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,320
in the GTK style sheet so that app developers can

543
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,040
use semantic variables or variables that

544
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,680
are guaranteed to be supported.

545
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,600
And then themes like Pop!

546
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,200
OS or Ubuntu, they can actually make

547
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,040
sure they support those different variables as well.

548
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,160
So it's kind of an in-between of it's not

549
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,320
ripping the entire style sheet out from under apps.

550
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,640
It's more like, hey, it's compatible

551
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,960
with these different variables.

552
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,160
And so I think we'll see some really interesting things

553
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,200
in Yaru moving forward and in Pop! OS

554
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,600
moving forward with this.

555
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,960
It's essentially letting the applications know, hey,

556
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,360
I'm set up to display this way.

557
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,320
I look this way right now.

558
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,540
And they can choose to implement that or not.

559
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,000
And if they do, they can implement it

560
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,120
in a way that they know is consistent with their UI

561
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:16,720
design.

562
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,420
Yeah, and it's from multiple angles, too.

563
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,120
So it's like, applications can say,

564
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,280
can use those variables to create custom styled widgets.

565
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,720
But then the vendors themselves can use those variables

566
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,600
to create their own style sheet that's compatible with Adueda.

567
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,920
So you get less breakage.

568
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,640
Adueda is how you're supposed to say it?

569
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,920
Oh, man, I've been way off.

570
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,080
I have no idea if that's how you're supposed to say it.

571
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,080
That's just how I say it.

572
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,040
So no one knows.

573
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,520
Wow.

574
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,160
You've probably been around people pronouncing it.

575
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,600
So you probably got it close.

576
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,680
I say Aduadia.

577
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,080
So what do I know?

578
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,560
It might be like Advaita or something.

579
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,200
I don't know.

580
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,000
Could we just go with gnome theme?

581
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,840
The built-in, yeah, the shell theme.

582
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,160
Of course, then we'll debate on how you say gnome or gnome.

583
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,000
Exactly.

584
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,240
And there's varying ideas there, too.

585
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,640
There's no winning.

586
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,840
Well, good talk.

587
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:06,160
Everybody on the team watched it.

588
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,760
We liked it.

589
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,080
We have it linked in the show notes.

590
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,720
I think it's a great approach to this.

591
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,160
I'm obviously, I skew on the side of dark theming

592
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,920
all of the things, because I just

593
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,520
find it a strain on my eyes after about five, six hours

594
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,800
of using the computer to have everything so bright.

595
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
But I don't want to go overboard.

596
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,920
And I really like the balance you're

597
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,960
striking with it, Cassidy.

598
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,360
I think you really have a great approach.

599
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:29,720
And I'm willing to bet that's going to translate into pretty

600
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,080
good support in elementary OS.

601
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,400
So some of these things you're talking about in your talk,

602
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,000
are you moving ahead with them in elementary OS?

603
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,560
We're kind of waiting to see.

604
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,920
So the way Free Desktop works is they really

605
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,800
like to have two independent implementations

606
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,680
before they call it a Free Desktop spec.

607
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,760
Because otherwise, it's just only one project

608
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,800
just kind of pushing Free Desktop.

609
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,640
So I think we're going to wait to see how it's done in GTK

610
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,400
specifically and engage the developers there.

611
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,120
And then we'll help expose it in elementary OS

612
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,280
and work with Gnome as well to help expose it.

613
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,360
So I think the elementary implementation in Gnome

614
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,840
counts as two separate implementations.

615
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,400
And then we'll work on officially standardizing

616
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,080
the spec.

617
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,640
Really curious to see where this goes.

618
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,000
I like that it seems like it's, like you said, it's been a year.

619
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,280
So it's not happening super fast.

620
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:23,200
But at the same time, it feels like if it does happen,

621
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,240
it'll be really set.

622
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,280
And it'll stick.

623
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,440
And that's a rarity.

624
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,520
So that's really good to see.

625
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,800
So keep up the good work, sir.

626
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,560
Thank you.

627
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Thank you.

628
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,280
And thank you for stopping by.

629
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,760
Mr. Payne, what do you say?

630
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Should we sashay into the housekeeping?

631
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,880
Oh, yes, we must.

632
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,640
All right, well, let's kick off the housekeeping this week

633
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,120
with announcements.

634
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,600
September's free courses for the Linux Academy community

635
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,400
members is now available.

636
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Couple of things that Al has cranked the free handle on

637
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,120
that caught my attention.

638
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,840
The Microsoft SQL Server on Linux Quick Start guide.

639
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,360
Heck, yeah.

640
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,560
Oh, yeah, right.

641
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,520
Maybe you're interested in self-hosting something

642
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,480
like Bitwarden.

643
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,520
That seems like a great guide.

644
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,600
Exactly.

645
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,960
Network routing fundamentals.

646
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,480
You want to get your wire guard on?

647
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,040
You're going to need to know that one.

648
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,240
And along those same lines, Linux networking

649
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,360
and troubleshooting.

650
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,720
And a Git, Quick Start, and core OS essentials,

651
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,240
plus a lot more.

652
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,040
All free now for Linux community members

653
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,160
for the month of September.

654
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,480
You just go create an account.

655
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,280
Get a community member account, and then

656
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,600
you can go take that Mastering System D class too.

657
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,720
That's a good one there, Al.

658
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,120
You got a good list this month.

659
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:30,640
Thanks.

660
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,520
I'm really hoping to help people kind of get their journey

661
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,000
into Linux Kickstarted.

662
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:39,200
Now, speaking of journeys, let's talk about Texas Cyber Summit.

663
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,400
We have the Be New track, which sounds pretty killer.

664
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,680
We've got a birthday party.

665
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,560
So where do you want to start with the Texas Cyber Summit?

666
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,040
I think I'd like to kick off with the Be New track.

667
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,960
And the concept is really what I've been,

668
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,480
I'm going to say preaching, because I

669
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,240
think I get on my high horse every once

670
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,880
in a while about tackling new things

671
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,760
and not being afraid of it.

672
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,600
The number one feedback that I get to people

673
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,680
where they don't go to conferences is they say,

674
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,760
well, I'm not ready yet.

675
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,920
I'm not at that part of my career.

676
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,960
And I can't stress enough that at the time

677
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,200
that you are starting out, that you're looking to find something

678
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,360
new or looking to get into the tech sector,

679
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,320
that's the perfect time to start going to conferences.

680
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,160
Because you can learn more than just what you can see in a book

681
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,480
or what you can see in a forum.

682
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,440
You can see what people are actually doing with the tech.

683
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,160
So we've built a whole track around, hey,

684
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,280
you want to learn Docker?

685
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,760
Cool.

686
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,120
Let's do it with not just doing DevOps,

687
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,120
but let's learn it with DevSecOps.

688
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,440
Let's put security first and foremost in your learning

689
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,640
process.

690
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,320
You've heard about capturing the flag,

691
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,680
but you don't feel you know enough to do it?

692
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,320
Then come to our Capture the Flag.

693
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,240
Purvey.com has decided to sponsor that for us.

694
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,480
And they will have mentors at the table teaching you

695
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,160
not just how to capture that flag,

696
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,680
but what your thought process should

697
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,400
be when you're actually approaching password cracking

698
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,480
or whatever it is that you have to do to be

699
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,680
able to capture that flag.

700
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,120
So I'm really excited.

701
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,440
Yeah, that seems like the most valuable part is you're

702
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,720
learning how to think, too.

703
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,120
So then you can take that, and you can apply that

704
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,600
to future situations.

705
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,000
And if you understand that kind of stuff, you're employable.

706
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,480
Because technology is always changing.

707
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,640
There's always more to learn.

708
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,800
It's about learning how to think about the problem.

709
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,120
I think the major thing that people can walk away with

710
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,080
is not just being able to say, hey, I

711
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,400
went to this conference, but to say,

712
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,320
hey, I went to this conference, I participated in the event,

713
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,120
and I hands-on was able to build X,

714
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,720
or I was able to win this competition.

715
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,840
That's something that you can put on a resume,

716
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,600
because it shows practical hands-on knowledge.

717
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,280
Now, Texas Cyber Summit is coming up.

718
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,920
It's just around the corner.

719
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,520
So I want to get you the dates, because the crew's going.

720
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,960
A lot of us are going to be there, so we'd love to see you.

721
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,080
So it's October 10th through the 12th

722
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,720
at the Grand Hyatt in San Antonio, Texas.

723
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,240
So if you can make it, we'd love to see you there,

724
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,160
because we're going to have a big presence.

725
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,480
And we're also going to have an unofficial Hacker Family

726
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,880
dinner and a birthday party, too, Elle.

727
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,120
It's going to be my birthday.

728
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,360
And I can't think of anybody who I'd

729
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,400
like to share it more with in our community.

730
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,680
So come by, have some Texas-style barbecue and some cake.

731
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,240
It's going to be a great time the day

732
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,680
before the conference starts.

733
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,560
That's amazing.

734
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,520
We'll be at the Two Brothers barbecue.

735
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,160
I'll be there.

736
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,320
The details, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

737
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,120
I can't believe it's finally happening, Elle.

738
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,520
It's like actually happening, Texas Cyber Summit.

739
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,440
I feel like I've been preparing for months,

740
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,880
so I hope that everyone loves the event.

741
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
I'm pretty sure you and I have been talking about it

742
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,360
since January, at least.

743
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,240
So it's been a long time, and you've probably

744
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,200
been thinking about it even longer than that.

745
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,160
So we'd love to see you there.

746
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,800
And it's a great chance to get started

747
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,600
and just see what the state of the cybersecurity industry

748
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,400
as it is now, quite an industry, where it's at.

749
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:57,520
So all those details, linuxunplug.com slash 317.

750
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,720
Well, that's the housekeeping.

751
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,880
Now let's talk a little bit about some great tips

752
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,480
that I got from Wendell.

753
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,920
So for our self-hosted show, self-hosted.show,

754
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,160
for episode two, we're going to have Wendell on.

755
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,760
And the topic of the episode is why you should actually

756
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:17,040
self-host in the first place, and fairly enough,

757
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,960
when you shouldn't self-host.

758
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,000
And Wendell has a super cool approach to this.

759
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,200
So we went down to his studio in Lexington, Kentucky.

760
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,600
And I got to start the story at the very beginning.

761
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,400
I have to give a shout out to Alex.

762
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,240
He's taking care of all of the trip details, the room booking.

763
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,000
He's letting me bum internet here at his house.

764
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
He cooked a sandwich, or his wife cooked a sandwich.

765
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,760
It's been good.

766
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,360
It's been really good.

767
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,200
So thank you, Alex.

768
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,680
It's been wonderful.

769
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,640
And I flew in last week.

770
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,120
Did I get in Thursday, I think?

771
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,560
I got in, I don't know.

772
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,040
You know, I think I got in Thursday.

773
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,040
I think Thursday.

774
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,920
Yeah, you and the wife picked me up at the airport.

775
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:58,640
And we got right to dinner, which was good.

776
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,160
You know me, I like to eat.

777
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:04,120
And then the next day, we took a drive

778
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:07,360
from Raleigh, North Carolina to Lexington, Kentucky,

779
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,440
which was about 10 hours, 10 or so hours.

780
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,400
But it's a drive through the mountains.

781
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,600
We got to drive on what's called the Tale of the Dragon.

782
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,160
We got to take Blue Ridge Parkway, which are,

783
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,520
they look like they should be in an episode of Top Gear.

784
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,120
They look like they should be in car commercial roads.

785
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,720
That's really something.

786
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,600
I've never had road jelly before,

787
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,080
but I am so envious of the roads around here.

788
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,320
It was a lot of driving, though.

789
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,320
And Alex did more than the majority of it,

790
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,080
so I appreciate that.

791
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,640
When we got in, we got in on Saturday.

792
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,760
And Alex had to stay in a quality

793
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,560
in a hotel, which I will say, the first one was pretty good,

794
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,520
of decent quality.

795
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,800
However, I did have this weird, over-softened bedsheet

796
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,200
situation, where there was this weird residue on my bedsheets

797
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,920
that felt almost a little moist.

798
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,480
That was hard.

799
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,200
This is an awkward silence.

800
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,120
It was a little weird.

801
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,000
It was a little hard.

802
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,480
But I powered through like the pro traveler that I am.

803
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,520
And we got down, and we met Wendell at his studio

804
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,840
and spent the entire day with him.

805
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,280
He was just really gracious.

806
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,760
And you know what's really nice is you get to meet people,

807
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,720
and they're legitimately what they are on camera.

808
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,120
And that doesn't happen very often.

809
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:31,280
But Wendell is a fountain of information.

810
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,920
Alex, do you want to share the story?

811
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,800
Of course, because we're sitting around the studio,

812
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,880
there is all kinds of hardware.

813
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,420
There's probably not a system in there

814
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,880
with less than 16 cores.

815
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,800
I mean, we're talking Tesla video cards.

816
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,660
We're talking just all kinds of great stuff.

817
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,440
And so as one does, when you're in the presence

818
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,080
of such hardware, we start benchmarking.

819
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,080
I never really used the Forerunix benchmark suite

820
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,580
before.

821
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,720
And Wendell just busts it out and says, oh, look,

822
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,800
this machine can compile a kernel in, what, 20 seconds,

823
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,840
12 seconds?

824
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,040
He showed us a system that it compiled so fast

825
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,840
that I believe the test suite had to do further tests

826
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,000
because it figured it was an error that had compiled

827
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,520
the kernel so fast.

828
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,920
Yeah, it was pretty great.

829
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:19,720
He had two 2-terabyte NVMe boot drives in RAID 0.

830
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,600
Yeah.

831
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,680
And then, of course, he had a massive CPU in there.

832
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,320
I can't even remember how many cores it had.

833
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
It might have been 24 cores.

834
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,920
I don't know.

835
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,480
He just casually threw out, oh, this one has a Thread Ripper,

836
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,000
but this one has a 3900X.

837
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,560
Oh, there's another Thread Ripper over there.

838
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,480
What really impressed me is because, of course,

839
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,480
as soon as we busted out the Forerunix test suite,

840
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,200
I start geeking out.

841
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,240
Because you guys know how much I love that freaking thing.

842
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,320
So we're talking about it.

843
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,360
And, of course, Alex is discovering it.

844
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,720
And we're like, well, Alex, let's run it on your systems.

845
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,280
So Alex remotes in, and he's got a server here

846
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,440
with a bunch of cores and a couple of Xeons in it.

847
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,640
And he's got a desktop.

848
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,180
And you go to town, and Alex discovered the same Wendell

849
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,560
rabbit hole, which I now find myself in, which is so funny.

850
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,680
So tell them first what you discovered,

851
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,200
and then I have something I have to admit.

852
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,960
So I ran this benchmarking suite on a dual Xeon system.

853
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,200
And I was able to compile a kernel, I think,

854
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,200
in 64 seconds, which was a good deal slower than his Ryzen

855
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,440
system in front of me, but it seemed pretty good.

856
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,760
So then I thought, OK, let's break out the i7-8700K.

857
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,920
Let's see what this can do, expecting a really good result.

858
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,800
126.

859
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,320
Horrible.

860
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,640
So I was quite disappointed by that.

861
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,320
What's great about Wendell, too, just a side note,

862
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,440
is you can rattle off the parts.

863
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,360
And before the benchmark finishes,

864
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,040
he'll tell you what number you should expect.

865
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,640
And then when you didn't get the number that you expected,

866
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,840
he knew what the problem was from afar.

867
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,800
He just said to me, what motherboard is it?

868
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,200
And I said, oh, it's a Z370 Tai Chi ASRock motherboard.

869
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,760
And he goes, ah, you haven't enabled

870
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,280
this setting in your BIOS.

871
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,480
I get home, lo and behold, I enable that setting,

872
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,240
and I knock 25 seconds off.

873
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,480
Amazing.

874
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,040
He knew exactly what setting it was,

875
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,480
where it was in the BIOS, right off the top of his head

876
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,200
with that particular hardware combination.

877
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,240
So I couldn't resist but start talking

878
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,680
to him about the general performance and smoothness

879
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,440
of the Linux desktop.

880
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,520
He has a video that's coming out on his Level 1 Linux channel,

881
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,080
probably by the time this episode is posted.

882
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,680
And we chat a little bit further about this with him

883
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,960
in his video.

884
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,120
And he has a pretty good idea of what

885
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,120
it would take to get the Linux desktop a little more

886
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:27,880
responsive.

887
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,200
And I agree with him completely.

888
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,560
And he gave me a couple of tips that I've heard over the years.

889
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,280
But when you combine them all together,

890
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:38,680
really do make a pretty sizable performance difference.

891
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,880
So I wanted to share them with you guys,

892
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,840
so that way you could go down the same rabbit hole.

893
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,200
Because I did these things and realized

894
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,760
there was a lot more area for optimization and improvement.

895
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,440
And now I've been spending my free time in the evenings,

896
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,520
locked away in my room, tweaking my laptop.

897
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,400
And so I want you all to experience this, too.

898
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:00,800
First of all, take a little time.

899
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,120
Don't run it forever.

900
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,320
But if you're on GNOME, install the CPU FREQ extension,

901
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,320
just for a little bit.

902
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,080
It's a little slow.

903
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,400
It's a little clunky.

904
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,280
It's got a pop-up banner thingy, not a pop-up.

905
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,800
It's got a splash thingy while it loads.

906
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,920
But it gives you such a good wealth of information,

907
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,880
including a simple way to turn on turbo boost, which

908
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,040
on some machines is off by default.

909
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,720
So that's A with right there, A number one.

910
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,880
You can increase performance by turning on turbo boost.

911
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,840
CPU FREQ will also tell you what things

912
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,560
you need in order to control your governor.

913
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,960
Most Linux boxes are not in a performance mode,

914
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,960
so you'll get some throttling.

915
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,400
And in this, you can also do things

916
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,640
like turn off some of the cores.

917
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,320
So this morning, I was in a long meeting,

918
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,800
didn't have my power plug, so I just

919
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,040
turned off four of my CPU cores.

920
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,800
Additionally, it'll tell you if there's

921
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,720
a couple of low-hanging fruit performance

922
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,400
items on your Linux box that you need to resolve.

923
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,120
For myself, this is interesting because Wendell

924
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,480
brought this up, IRQ Balance, which

925
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,840
is a service that it looks like it's designed for performance.

926
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,760
In fact, if you read most things online,

927
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,960
most people say install IRQ Balance for performance,

928
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,000
because it's a little piece of software outside the kernel

929
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,960
that looks at your load and your tasks

930
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,560
and will do some workload splitting up

931
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,160
amongst your CPU cores.

932
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,000
I mean, that sounds like a good thing, right?

933
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,160
Turns out, eh, not so much.

934
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,920
It's kind of conservative in how it actually manages things.

935
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,760
And the logic in sorting all of that out

936
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,360
puts overhead in there, and it actually

937
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,320
can be one of the things that can make your machine a little

938
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,960
more leggy.

939
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,760
So this is something that this application

940
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,960
will flag, the CPU FREQ, CPU-F-R-E-Q, like frequency.

941
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,720
It also puts a little item up in your Gnome Shell toolbar

942
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,360
that tells you what frequency your processors are running at,

943
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,000
which is something that you can use to see if you're getting

944
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,640
the full peak performance that your CPU is capable of.

945
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,640
Before I made some of these changes, I wasn't.

946
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,920
By stock, Wes, you probably aren't either,

947
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,440
because some of these settings will be the same for you.

948
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,120
So you install that.

949
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,280
It'll tell you if you have IRQ Balance messing up

950
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,920
your performance.

951
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,380
It'll tell you if your CPU is being throttled.

952
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,720
You can do things like turn off your cores,

953
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,720
turn on turbo boost. So if it's a one catch-all application,

954
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
it's like the first thing Wendell was installing

955
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,640
on his machine, because he set up a Fedora box

956
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,120
while we were there for some testing.

957
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,600
And the first thing he installed was CPU frequency.

958
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,200
Do you remember the drill that he installed the CPU cooler

959
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:26,720
with?

960
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,680
And then he didn't.

961
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,200
So he wanted to get as close as he

962
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,240
could to replicating Alex's home setup.

963
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,480
And he basically has every machine iteration.

964
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,640
So he grabs an MV&E drive and a CPU and walks up to a machine

965
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,320
and just takes a screwdriver and screws the CPU and cooler

966
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,920
in, pops the MV&E in, gets to work.

967
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,960
It was great, because you're having a conversation

968
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,480
with Wendell.

969
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,920
And it goes like this, hmm, I wonder

970
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,160
how that would work.

971
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,560
And then he says, well, let's go test it.

972
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,480
So that's what we did on several things.

973
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,160
Every time.

974
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,200
Yeah.

975
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,840
That was pretty fun.

976
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,560
So I have links to that in the show notes.

977
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,160
If you're on a T480, there's an additional step

978
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,840
you need to take.

979
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,680
Or if you're on, actually, it's not just a T480.

980
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,160
There's several ThinkPad laptops,

981
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:17,000
including a lot of the X series, like the X280, the XC16,

982
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,560
the T580 is also, the ThinkPad Anniversary Edition even,

983
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,880
a couple of E series, the Dell XPS 9365 and 9370 series,

984
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:30,080
and the Microsoft Service Books are all

985
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:36,160
suffering from aggressive, naughty CPU throttling,

986
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,800
where they're actually even cranking down

987
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,600
the wattage of the CPU.

988
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,800
Initially, it's 44 watts when you're plugged in.

989
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,040
And then when you're on battery, it hard

990
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,600
limits it to 29 watts.

991
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,920
And you can't ever go above that, even

992
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,800
for turbo boosting.

993
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,400
And it actually resets to that every five seconds.

994
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,200
Yikes.

995
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,440
Yeah, and it's every 30 seconds when you're on battery.

996
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,240
And it's a value from the driver and the embedded controller

997
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,520
that are getting passed back and forth.

998
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,600
And it represents itself in essentially limiting

999
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,400
your overall CPU burstiness.

1000
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,200
Your machine might run slightly cooler.

1001
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,240
Your battery life might be slightly better.

1002
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,940
But if you're plugged in or you have great battery life already,

1003
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,720
this isn't really a concern for you.

1004
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,160
So there's a fix you can run.

1005
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,440
And I'll have that linked to the show notes.

1006
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,800
And it sets up a system de-service that essentially

1007
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,440
turns this off.

1008
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,880
It's still safe, but you can use it at your own risk.

1009
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
But it was fun talking to him about this stuff,

1010
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,520
because he talks about it in kind of a holistic way.

1011
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,840
He talks about how it's all these different components that

1012
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,600
kind of need somebody to come in like an orchestrator

1013
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,440
and fix it all up.

1014
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,120
You know, you need somebody who's working at the compositor

1015
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,760
level, at the graphic stack level, at the kernel level,

1016
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,360
and at the audio stack level, and at the scheduling level.

1017
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,240
All of these things need to be kind of working together

1018
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,800
to really get the kind of performance

1019
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,360
that we want on Linux.

1020
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:02,000
But you do have the means to make some of these tweaks

1021
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,160
yourself, since it's Linux after all,

1022
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,360
and get the performance closer there than you do by stock.

1023
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,200
And I don't know.

1024
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,220
You look at some of these settings,

1025
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,400
and you think to yourself, why are we

1026
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,480
doing this out of the box on desktop distributions, things

1027
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,880
like IRQ balance?

1028
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,440
Maybe there's reasons, but I don't know what they are.

1029
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,280
Yeah, and I'm sure much of it is legacy changes

1030
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,660
in architecture that just haven't bubbled up

1031
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,320
all the way through the different layers.

1032
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,760
And Linux is deployed on so many different types of systems,

1033
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,880
especially maybe older or low-end systems,

1034
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,200
that I imagine it's a hard thing to get just right.

1035
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,640
But if more of us start experimenting with it,

1036
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,760
maybe we can change that.

1037
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,860
Yeah.

1038
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:48,480
I love the idea, though, of maybe one day,

1039
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,940
some Skunk Works project turns into this big project

1040
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:54,140
where people put money into funding development on all

1041
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,780
of these little rough edges to make Linux audio just

1042
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,880
a little bit smoother, to make performance mode a little bit

1043
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,420
easier to achieve.

1044
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,000
There is a project out there.

1045
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,880
I think, oh, I always forget this,

1046
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,540
but there's a project out there that's

1047
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:13,160
made by a group that changes some of this for you.

1048
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,200
They're a gaming company.

1049
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,400
I don't know if you guys know who I'm talking about.

1050
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,800
They have a game mode for Linux.

1051
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,240
You guys familiar with this?

1052
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,200
I actually have it installed on my system.

1053
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,000
All right, maybe you can make me look it up.

1054
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:23,960
Game mode for Linux.

1055
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
And it is a project that's attempted, yeah,

1056
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,280
by Farrell Interactive.

1057
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,640
That's who.

1058
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,540
You guys are probably familiar with Farrell Interactive.

1059
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,160
They have a project right now called Game Mode for Linux,

1060
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,920
which optimized Linux's performance

1061
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,720
for on-demand gaming.

1062
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,760
And it essentially changes a lot of these things.

1063
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,120
That's what I'm talking about, your CPU governor, your IO

1064
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,400
priority, and it even goes a little bit further

1065
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,080
in some cases.

1066
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,360
It'll put your GPU, if it's an AMD or NVIDIA,

1067
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,640
in performance mode.

1068
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,800
It'll inhibit your screen saver.

1069
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,840
It can change the kernel scheduler.

1070
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,240
So it can go even further.

1071
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,720
Yeah.

1072
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,480
This looks great.

1073
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,200
No, I totally missed this one.

1074
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,080
Yeah, this is something that's been around.

1075
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,160
I've been watching for a little bit.

1076
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,760
They have different installation methods

1077
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:01,760
for different distributions.

1078
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,520
So you could play around with it.

1079
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,160
They got stuff for Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora, Gen 2,

1080
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,560
or you could build it yourself.

1081
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,760
I've been running it for a little bit on my laptop.

1082
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,000
You activate it, and you go play some No Man's Sky.

1083
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,840
It works great.

1084
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,640
I'm sitting here gaming on Wayland,

1085
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,120
playing No Man's Sky under Proton with an eGPU all day

1086
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,240
long.

1087
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,960
That's wonderful.

1088
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,240
It's made a big difference.

1089
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,400
It's a noticeable game of difference.

1090
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:28,720
And I, on my setup, haven't noticed any stability impacts.

1091
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,800
One of the other amazing tools that Wendell threw

1092
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,040
into my toolkit this weekend is i7z.

1093
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,040
This allowed me to look at the CPU frequencies

1094
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,560
and the different C states of my processors

1095
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,240
as well whilst I was running benchmarks.

1096
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,040
And I find this is going to be an excellent new tool

1097
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,000
in my toolkit alongside something like S2E, which

1098
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,080
is another tool that lets you do a similar thing.

1099
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,400
Yeah, we've covered S2E on a previous Linux Unplugged

1100
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,840
pick, I believe.

1101
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,040
It's pretty great.

1102
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,600
So we'll have a link to CPU frack.

1103
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,360
We'll have a link to i7z and also ThrottleD

1104
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,520
if you're on one of those laptops that's

1105
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,960
impacted by that built-in throttling,

1106
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,320
which is really kind of a bug that's really a shame

1107
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,680
that Lenovo hasn't fixed a firmware update.

1108
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,880
So it's kind of on them.

1109
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,840
You know, I saw a little update in a Lenovo forum recently.

1110
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,120
It sounds like they're working on it, but nothing concrete yet.

1111
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,880
All right.

1112
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,760
One thing I'd like to mention about ThrottleD

1113
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,000
before we move on is the undervolting section

1114
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,600
can be pretty important when you're

1115
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,320
trying to really get those thermal levels down.

1116
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,320
I went through and did that today

1117
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,240
and noticed some real improvements.

1118
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,600
But you do kind of have to know what you're doing

1119
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,480
and test conservatively as you start activating that feature.

1120
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,680
What are you using to monitor your thermals?

1121
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,080
ThrottleD actually has a built-in utility

1122
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,360
that you can launch on the command line

1123
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,880
with the dash dash monitor flag.

1124
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,440
And it will show you exactly what's causing any limits.

1125
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,080
No way.

1126
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:56,600
Really?

1127
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,400
I got to try that.

1128
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,160
That is so great.

1129
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,920
Thanks, Drew.

1130
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,840
That's a really handy way to kind of see some.

1131
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,840
I've been using CPU frack, and that's a lot.

1132
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,000
It's verbose, it's gooey.

1133
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,600
And I don't plan to keep the extension around forever.

1134
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,200
So that's awesome.

1135
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,440
Yeah, I find between Tuned and ThrottleD,

1136
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,840
once ThrottleD is configured properly,

1137
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,640
I'm getting some good performance

1138
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,800
with better thermals.

1139
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,840
That's a win-win.

1140
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:22,520
So check out the links in the show notes

1141
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,160
if this has got your interest piqued.

1142
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,680
And be sure to keep an eye on selfhosted.show.

1143
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,360
Episode one comes out on September 12th.

1144
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,600
And then episode two comes out with Wendell

1145
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,360
on why to self-host, and then we kick off

1146
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,280
a whole series of episodes.

1147
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,600
We had a good chat with Wendell.

1148
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,940
We talked a little bit about his home setup, his Linux

1149
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,640
background, his server setup that he

1150
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,440
has there in the studio, what he chooses to cloud

1151
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,320
host versus what he doesn't trust in the cloud.

1152
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:53,480
Really good conversation coming up in self-hosted episode

1153
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,560
number two.

1154
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,320
And that's at selfhosted.show.

1155
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,400
They all start shipping on September 12th,

1156
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,880
and it follows fortnightly after that.

1157
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,160
Selfhosted.show slash subscribe for the RSS feed.

1158
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,320
Really was a great trip.

1159
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,920
Alex, thank you so much for the fun drives, for the trip,

1160
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,080
for scheduling all the details so I could just show up

1161
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,460
and get the work done and not have

1162
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,520
to worry about all the individual itty-bitties.

1163
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,440
Thank you very much, sir.

1164
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,600
It was a pleasure having you.

1165
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,480
I mean, the farts aside.

1166
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,240
Now also, Cheesy's been doing some work.

1167
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,880
He set up a new gallery that has all of the photos

1168
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,680
from a lot of these events we've been talking

1169
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,480
about over the last few weeks, including Red Hat Summit,

1170
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,480
Linux Fest, Northwest, our sprint for Self Hosted,

1171
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,400
the trip that Alex and I just took to go see Wendell,

1172
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,600
all of that at a new site, jupyter.gallery.

1173
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,140
What's some of the magic here, Cheesy?

1174
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,140
What's on the back end to make all this happen?

1175
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,800
Well, I mean, obviously it's self-hosted

1176
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,560
with a little assistance from my buddy Wes over there.

1177
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:04,280
But yeah, it's Lychee, I believe is how you guys pronounce it.

1178
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:09,080
Essentially, all I've done is set it up through Docker.

1179
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,400
And I got it set up on a Linode.

1180
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,360
And just kind of messing around with it this weekend.

1181
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,120
I looked at various other options, other choices

1182
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,800
out there, other pieces of software and self-hosted

1183
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,360
routes.

1184
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,040
But this was really the most attractive to me.

1185
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,120
So that's why I ended up choosing Lychee.

1186
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,220
And it seems to be doing pretty well so far.

1187
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,480
We'll see.

1188
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,480
Right now, obviously, everything's been posted

1189
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,800
in September of 2019.

1190
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,760
But as we progress through, those dates will be fixed.

1191
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,640
And everything will be in order from here on out.

1192
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,760
So looking forward to it.

1193
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,040
It's a great way for us to catalog our photos.

1194
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,000
And I encourage any of the listeners out there,

1195
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,800
if you have photos from any of these events

1196
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,880
that you see there, please get them over to me.

1197
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,720
Cheeze at Jupyter Broadcasting.

1198
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:58,200
I'll get them posted into these galleries.

1199
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,440
Because really, the whole part of this is showing our community.

1200
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:05,680
And I want our community to share their photos with us

1201
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,120
so we can enjoy them as well.

1202
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:10,760
I'm sure there are some great shots of myself, or Chris,

1203
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,680
or some other great candids out there

1204
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,280
that we just haven't seen yet.

1205
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,400
Maybe we can get one of those Noah photos

1206
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,080
in there of him in his bathing suit.

1207
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:20,960
Oh, my gosh.

1208
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:21,740
Oh, my gosh.

1209
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:22,880
Those might be too hot for the internet.

1210
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,840
I got a couple of those.

1211
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:27,200
And so there you go.

1212
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:29,640
It's nice looking back at the LinuxFest Northwest pictures,

1213
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,120
just remembering how long that line was

1214
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:34,400
that you had to go to the front for for your brands.

1215
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:34,880
Oh, yeah.

1216
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,600
Yeah, that's right.

1217
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,400
Yeah, good times.

1218
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:36,920
Good times.

1219
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,880
And that's really what the gallery is about,

1220
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,160
is to capture those moments.

1221
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,420
And so I encourage any of the community members

1222
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:45,220
out there that have photos to share, please get them to me.

1223
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:47,840
And I'll make sure to get them uploaded into the gallery.

1224
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,400
And yeah, looking forward to seeing it grow.

1225
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,160
Jupyter.gallery for that.

1226
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,400
And the software, the open source software

1227
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,960
that's the gallery management software,

1228
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,440
is L-Y-C-H-E-E, if you want to check that out.

1229
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,640
And yeah, it's fun having all the pictures in one spot.

1230
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:05,560
So go see that.

1231
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:06,400
It's pretty great.

1232
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,160
It is.

1233
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,960
And we had some emails come into the show.

1234
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,360
I thought this was a really good one.

1235
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,780
So I wanted to read it on the show.

1236
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:16,680
And then lucky us, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Drew DeVore,

1237
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,980
still in the house, hasn't evacuated yet.

1238
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,680
And he's here to answer your technical audio questions.

1239
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,960
He's just perfect for this one.

1240
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,280
I know.

1241
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:23,760
He really is.

1242
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,520
So JT wrote in.

1243
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,320
He says, I've read on a few different blogs and message

1244
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,800
boards that the audio systems in Linux

1245
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,120
are not up to professional standards.

1246
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,080
I know we don't have any DAWs, that's

1247
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,360
Digital Audio Workstations, as fully baked to say Pro Tools.

1248
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,400
But is that the result of an inferior audio system

1249
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,720
or just the typical Linux problems

1250
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:47,680
we always face when it comes to proprietary applications?

1251
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,880
Is there something lacking in ALSA, Jack, or Pulse Audio stack

1252
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,320
that I'm not aware of?

1253
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,780
Or is there something that we obviously

1254
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,480
can do in pro audio production, given

1255
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,520
that we have Arduer and Reaper and Audacity,

1256
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,240
that people just are missing?

1257
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,480
Thank you very much, JT.

1258
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,800
Well, Drew, I thought this would be a great question for you

1259
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,000
to answer, since your day job is audio engineering on Linux.

1260
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,880
That's right.

1261
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:16,560
So audio production in Linux definitely is not fault free.

1262
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,200
There are plenty of issues with it,

1263
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,000
probably the most visible one being that the ALSA, Jack,

1264
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,200
and Pulse stacks, when you put them all together,

1265
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,040
it's really complex.

1266
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,840
And it hopefully will get streamlined down

1267
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,720
with Pipewire in the future.

1268
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:38,720
But for the moment, it's still pretty hairy

1269
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:42,480
to try to work with it on a daily basis.

1270
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,600
Once you understand it, you can work around

1271
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,160
a lot of those issues.

1272
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,360
But it does take some deep diving.

1273
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:55,640
Now, as far as software, with things like Bitwig and Reaper

1274
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,600
and VST producers starting to target Linux,

1275
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,360
I think the tide is starting to shift.

1276
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,320
And hopefully, we'll see more pro level

1277
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,560
software coming our way.

1278
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,920
But honestly, for now, I can do 90% of what

1279
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,280
I need to do all in Linux.

1280
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,240
There are still a couple of things that I run in Wine.

1281
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,960
But even that works just fine so long

1282
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,600
as the application is compatible with Wine,

1283
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:24,680
and even some Wine VSTs that I can run directly

1284
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:26,560
through a compatibility layer.

1285
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,200
Right, and those Wine VSTs and things

1286
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,960
that you're running through an app compatibility layer

1287
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,120
are actually, it's possible to bring them up in Reaper.

1288
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,760
So it's like in the Linux editing application you're

1289
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,440
using, you can summon these Wine plugins.

1290
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,120
Right, they just masquerade as a Linux VST,

1291
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,120
and they're just kind of piped through Wine

1292
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,960
to get them into the application.

1293
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,520
So will we ever see things like Audition or Pro Tools

1294
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,800
or the other big boys coming to Linux?

1295
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:56,320
I don't know.

1296
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,640
I kind of doubt it.

1297
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:01,080
But Reaper is really, really good.

1298
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,960
I consider it professional quality.

1299
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,840
So realistically, I don't know if we need everything

1300
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,960
to come to Linux so long as we have

1301
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,240
enough things of high enough quality

1302
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,520
that we can get the work done.

1303
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,840
And I'd say we're most of the way there.

1304
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:20,800
Yeah, and Wes, you've done some deep diving into Jack.

1305
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,000
And once you learn the system, there

1306
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
are a lot of powerful things you can do from not just audio

1307
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,520
processing and routing, but real time monitoring

1308
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,500
and all kinds of stuff that are really

1309
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,380
useful in a professional audio workstation.

1310
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:33,880
Oh, yeah.

1311
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,940
I mean, you definitely have to invest.

1312
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,040
And really, I think a lot of areas were lacking.

1313
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,380
I mean, you've been using Reaper a bit more.

1314
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,800
You've also introduced me and shown me some stuff

1315
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,880
over on the Mac side that can do some similar audio routing

1316
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:47,820
capabilities.

1317
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,080
And it doesn't expose to you the same level of detail,

1318
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,420
but it also has a much simpler default and easy

1319
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,600
to use sort of settings.

1320
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,640
And Drew, you were helping us out learning Reaper better.

1321
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,200
And there's a lot of stuff you've

1322
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,420
got to go tweak and configure to make it look competitive,

1323
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:05,080
to make it sort of as nice of an editor.

1324
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,380
You can get there.

1325
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,560
You just have to be willing to invest the time.

1326
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:09,880
Yes, that's right.

1327
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,100
And I would say that I like Jack better than anything

1328
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,440
on Windows or Mac that I've played with.

1329
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,800
But yeah, you've got to learn a lot more

1330
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,720
to really expose those features and take use of them.

1331
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,280
And once you do, you have a whole new tool set

1332
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:27,900
to work with.

1333
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,560
And that's the part I'm struggling with,

1334
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:33,520
is I'm in that point right now where specifically with Reaper,

1335
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,760
like Jack is clicking with me more.

1336
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,000
And I get it.

1337
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,640
But Reaper is a big shift from what

1338
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,720
I'm used to in proprietary world editors.

1339
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,600
But I can already tell that once I have it set up and working,

1340
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,640
it's just as powerful, if not more powerful,

1341
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,180
than what I've used in the past on the proprietary side.

1342
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,800
This isn't totally fair.

1343
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,940
But I've jokingly said to the guys behind the scenes

1344
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:04,280
that Reaper has a $60 UI and a $5,000 functionality.

1345
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,960
And the UI, thankfully, is themable.

1346
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,380
So you can get far if you just know a couple of websites

1347
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,460
to go to to set things up properly.

1348
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,860
Drew, what's the number one one you always told me to go to

1349
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,880
for my Reaper stuff?

1350
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,000
Stash.reaper.fm.

1351
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,840
And it's also worth noting that not only can you theme it,

1352
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:27,800
you can configure just about everything in the workstation

1353
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,440
as well.

1354
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,440
So you can put things in different places.

1355
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,040
You can add different things to your toolbars.

1356
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,680
The whole thing is just fully extensible,

1357
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,320
which I know I sound like an ad for Reaper right now.

1358
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:42,240
But it's the one thing that lets me do my job on Linux

1359
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,000
all day, every day.

1360
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,440
Now, when you make a really good product

1361
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,520
and you make it available for Linux as a native binary,

1362
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,720
and you update it frequently, and you've been doing it

1363
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:57,040
for years on Linux, and you only charge $60 for personal use,

1364
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,640
you buy loyalty that $60 could never afford you.

1365
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:02,760
We're just such huge fans of it.

1366
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,320
The thing is, and I think, JT, this is what you're noticing,

1367
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,500
because I suffered from this as well,

1368
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,800
is there is a lot of hard lessons

1369
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,100
you've got to learn when you're doing production on Linux.

1370
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,000
PulseAudio is going to fail you a few times.

1371
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,940
Jack's going to be complicated.

1372
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,560
You've got to learn a really weird UI in Reaper.

1373
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,840
And these paper cuts add up to a really frustrating experience,

1374
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,360
especially when you're used to being really proficient

1375
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,720
at a particular job.

1376
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,080
And then you move to do that same job on another platform,

1377
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:31,480
and you are no longer proficient.

1378
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:35,320
You actively seek out all of the things that are not your fault

1379
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:38,240
as to why it's bad, because you're frustrated.

1380
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,380
You're suffering.

1381
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:42,040
And so a lot of times what you see is people go to their blog,

1382
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,960
their Twitter account, their podcast,

1383
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,000
and they'll do a kind of a rant and rave

1384
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,560
when they're in the midst of that.

1385
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,320
And then you fast forward like a year later.

1386
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:53,280
Like, we're nearly two years into this transition now.

1387
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,280
And it's so smoothed out that it's just table stakes now.

1388
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,400
Everything.

1389
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,440
This show is being streamed live on Linux.

1390
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,640
All of our hosts are connecting in over Linux remotely.

1391
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,240
I mean, I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina,

1392
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,780
and I'm using all Linux to do this right now.

1393
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:11,040
It's being recorded on Linux.

1394
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,720
It gets edited on Linux.

1395
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,660
It's the whole thing from top to bottom of what

1396
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:18,960
I feel like are some of the best podcasts on Linux in the world

1397
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:22,640
is all produced and done every single day on Linux.

1398
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,840
It's totally capable.

1399
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,480
It's just once you get it all figured out

1400
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,000
and it's no longer a frustrating topic,

1401
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,340
you just don't talk about it as much because it's old news.

1402
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:29,840
Yeah.

1403
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,160
And that's why it's doubly hard.

1404
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,380
I mean, if you're trying to learn

1405
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,720
how to do a bunch of audio production work on Linux,

1406
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,600
you have to learn two things at the same time.

1407
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:38,600
And all the tools and examples are

1408
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,000
targeting those other platforms.

1409
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,800
And experts are already used to assembling their own tools

1410
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:44,640
in this domain.

1411
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,620
So they just go tune their references and get to work.

1412
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,480
And the rest of us are left wondering

1413
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,040
how they make it all happen.

1414
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:51,540
Yeah.

1415
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:52,800
And the other thing that can be, there's

1416
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,040
a creative element to this too.

1417
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,840
And if what you're doing is like you want to make music

1418
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,200
and you just want to have a creative expression

1419
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,440
and you're mashing your face against your tools,

1420
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,880
it's really kind of an impedance mismatch.

1421
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,400
You want to creatively express.

1422
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,540
You don't want to go do a deep dive and learn.

1423
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:13,140
So what I have found is for me to really learn a new tool,

1424
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,720
it has to be a project that I'm starting fresh with.

1425
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,680
Fresh project, maybe it's not under a massive deadline.

1426
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,760
So I can learn the tool as I learn the project.

1427
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,840
And that's the best way to make a transition.

1428
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,480
And I am applying that very logic to Reaper.

1429
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,120
There's a new project we're working on.

1430
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:31,620
And I'm going to use Reaper for it.

1431
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,360
I'm going to make myself use Reaper.

1432
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,480
And I'll learn it that way.

1433
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,800
Oh, that makes me happy.

1434
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,280
I know.

1435
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:36,920
It's great, isn't it?

1436
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,500
It is fun because we get to geek out.

1437
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,920
We're all geeking out on different Linux audio tricks

1438
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:41,400
now.

1439
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,280
So it's just something to consider.

1440
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,280
And if you get frustrated, I have something

1441
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,440
to help you Zen out.

1442
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,240
It's called ZFrag.

1443
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,640
We got two app picks this week, and this first one's silly.

1444
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,200
But it's so awesome.

1445
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:55,980
If you've switched to Linux from Windows

1446
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,560
and you've missed defragging your hard drive, well, friends,

1447
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,760
I've got a fake application for you.

1448
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,480
It's a fake DOS display of defragging your hard drive.

1449
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,160
There's an interactive version and an automated version

1450
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,600
where it just sits there and does a fake DOS-style defrag

1451
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,800
for all day, every day.

1452
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:16,840
That's all it does.

1453
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,240
Oh, man, there's an automated?

1454
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:18,720
I missed that.

1455
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,080
I'm just sitting here in the studio.

1456
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,600
I've been doing it while you've been blabbing on

1457
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,840
about Reaper this whole time.

1458
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,040
It's very relaxing.

1459
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:26,880
I love, too, that if you're doing it, it measures you, too.

1460
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,880
So it shows you how far you've completed and then

1461
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,800
the elapsed time.

1462
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,760
And we can all maybe make it a race

1463
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,160
if you're feeling a little too relaxed.

1464
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,800
Our Windows and Mac-using friends aren't left out, too.

1465
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,680
There is a download for them as well.

1466
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,320
Yeah, you just kind of find the auto defrag mode

1467
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,600
and then just sit back and enjoy the show.

1468
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:43,880
It's a little bit of nostalgia.

1469
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,120
Well, you just need then a little hard drive

1470
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:50,520
seeking sound effect, you know, as it's

1471
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,320
moving all the stuff around.

1472
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,200
That's sort of perfect.

1473
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,680
So check out ZFrag.

1474
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,640
The URL is not friendly for air.

1475
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,480
So you're just going to have to get it from the show notes.

1476
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,960
And then Cheesy coming in with old Mesh Room, which

1477
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,360
looks like some high-end stuff.

1478
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,160
This is really cool.

1479
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,160
And it's open source.

1480
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,480
Yeah, so Mesh Room.

1481
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,400
And I just started getting into photogrammetry,

1482
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:18,200
which is basically where you use photos to help you determine

1483
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,720
distances and depths.

1484
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:24,040
And you can use it for mapping and those sorts of things.

1485
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,640
But you could also, say, use it if you

1486
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,020
wanted to take a bunch of photos of your boss

1487
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,080
and create a bobblehead of his head.

1488
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:30,760
Sorry, what?

1489
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,400
Yeah, exactly.

1490
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,960
Oh, oh, we do want to do that.

1491
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,280
So I was just looking at some different photogrammetry tools

1492
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,320
to do this with.

1493
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,840
And I came across this one.

1494
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,360
Mesh Room is produced by Alice Vision.

1495
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,760
They also have another application.

1496
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,200
And it looks like they support Windows and Linux.

1497
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,820
So sorry, Mac folks.

1498
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:55,720
But you should take a look at it if you're into photogrammetry.

1499
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,940
If you're not into it, maybe you have a 3D printer

1500
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,560
and you want to do something different.

1501
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,800
And you could go to some statue in your town

1502
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,880
and take a ton of photos of it and use this Mesh Room

1503
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:10,420
to put it all together and 3D print an object for yourself.

1504
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,240
Oh, man.

1505
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,320
Now I'm never going to hear the end of it from Alex.

1506
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,080
This whole week he's been trying to get

1507
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:17,200
me to get a 3D printer.

1508
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,240
Now it's my excuse.

1509
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,080
There's life before 3D printing, a life after.

1510
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,720
Well, you just have to find space in the rig for it, I guess.

1511
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:26,680
I think I could fit it.

1512
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,560
Because I'm sitting next to Alex's right now

1513
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,160
in his studio here.

1514
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,960
And now I understand why when he's on the post show,

1515
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,960
you can hear his printer.

1516
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,120
Because it's within arm's reach of the microphone.

1517
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:37,880
It's pretty cool.

1518
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,240
I think that would totally fit in the RV, too.

1519
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,080
There's really no excuse.

1520
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,160
I could put that in a storage bay.

1521
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,040
I could have a 3D printer in a storage bay,

1522
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,640
like a replicator bay.

1523
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,480
You could 3D print some storage for your 3D printer.

1524
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:48,980
Totally.

1525
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:49,880
That would be nice.

1526
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,800
I like it.

1527
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,440
Yeah, some meta boxes.

1528
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,680
That's what I'll call them.

1529
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,720
All right, well, before we get out of here,

1530
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,600
just a couple of bits of business.

1531
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,040
Everything's over at linuxunplugged.com.

1532
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,080
Of course, check out the self-hosted show.

1533
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,800
A couple of other things to check out.

1534
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,720
Go listen to our friends over at Ubuntu Podcast.

1535
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:07,060
They're not here this week, but they're still great.

1536
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,320
So we'll give them a plug.

1537
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:12,360
Of course, TechSnap with Mr. Wes Payne and Jim Salter

1538
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,360
from Ars Technica.

1539
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,760
Check out TechSnap.

1540
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,120
Better than ever, you guys are killing TechSnap.

1541
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,160
So if you haven't listened to TechSnap for a while,

1542
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,240
go grab that.

1543
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:24,000
And of course, go listen to Choose Linux with both Drew

1544
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,720
and Ell on it.

1545
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,120
And Joe, he's on there.

1546
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,280
Great show.

1547
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,720
Always some fun distributions you guys are trying out.

1548
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,760
Do you want to give any teasing for the one that's

1549
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,440
coming up this week, since you guys are likely in the know?

1550
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,400
Sure.

1551
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:39,480
So we're going to be talking about Slackl.

1552
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,840
That's a distribution based on Slackl.

1553
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,960
It's based on Slackware and Salix.

1554
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,480
Sorry, Drew.

1555
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,080
It sounds like you're saying Slackl.

1556
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,680
That doesn't make any sense.

1557
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,560
I'm sorry, Drew.

1558
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,160
That's what you get when Drew drinks.

1559
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,360
That's the name of the distro.

1560
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,640
Oh, OK.

1561
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,120
So it's based on Slackware, huh?

1562
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:01,960
Yeah.

1563
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:02,680
Cool.

1564
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,880
I'll definitely check that out.

1565
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:04,760
I always do.

1566
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:05,480
So there's that.

1567
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,480
And also, I'm going to give one more plug because I'm

1568
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,440
feeling generous today.

1569
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:10,320
You've got to go check out UserAir.

1570
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:14,400
And then tweet, myself and at Joe Resington,

1571
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,960
top or bottom bunk after you listen to UserAir.

1572
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:18,880
I've got to know.

1573
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:19,080
All right.

1574
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,420
That's all the plugging I have.

1575
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,880
Thank you so much for joining us.

1576
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,960
I'm at Chris LAS.

1577
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:23,920
He's at Westpane.

1578
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,280
The network is at Jupiter Signal.

1579
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:29,720
Be sure to check out selfhosted.show next week.

1580
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:33,240
And we will see you next Tuesday.

1581
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,640
Bye-bye.

1582
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,520
Cassidy, so welcome.

1583
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,520
You just got back a little bit ago from Guadic.

1584
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,920
Thanks for making it on the show, man.

1585
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,200
Guadic was incredible.

1586
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:12,400
It was my second year this year.

1587
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,480
And we were in Greece on the beach.

1588
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,600
Oh, it's hard to beat that.

1589
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,480
Yeah, it was so good.

1590
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:20,920
So Guadic, is it just for Gnomies?

1591
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,960
Is it worth somebody like myself going?

1592
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,000
I think it's worth anybody who uses Gnome or uses

1593
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
stuff that's based on Gnome.

1594
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,720
I mean, other than Gnome, I think

1595
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,280
uses stuff that's based on Gnome.

1596
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,160
Elementary is trying to go there every year now.

1597
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,080
And we're not strictly Gnome-based,

1598
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,440
but we work with Gnome on stuff.

1599
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,640
So it's just a lot of really cool people

1600
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:42,040
building a lot of really cool stuff

1601
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,520
and sharing what they're working on.

1602
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:46,880
How big of a presence is Endless there?

1603
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,720
They're always there.

1604
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:49,280
I don't know.

1605
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,360
I think there's a handful of people there always.

1606
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,840
Man, I wish they'd have it somewhere

1607
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,720
where it would be a little bit easier for me to get to.

1608
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:55,840
And I'd totally go.

1609
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:57,640
I think that does sound like it'd be nice.

1610
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,200
So next year, the two intense, so they

1611
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,400
bid for the location every year.

1612
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,520
One of the bids is for Mexico.

1613
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,440
I forget what city, but it's somewhere in Mexico,

1614
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,760
which is a little closer for me to get to.

1615
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,680
Yeah, I could probably make the one in Mexico.

1616
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:13,720
That sounds really fun.

1617
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,120
Yeah, that does sound great.

1618
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,880
I mean, if it has to be in a nice location

1619
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,000
with great weather, I mean, that's OK, I guess.

1620
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,960
We'll rough it?

1621
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,440
No, we have to.

1622
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,120
Well, I'm really glad you've enjoyed it.

1623
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,120
It does seem like it's pretty important for elementary

1624
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:29,680
to be there.

1625
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,880
Because like you said, you don't use Gnome Shell.

1626
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,440
Gnome Shell, I'm trying to say Gnome this episode.

1627
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,640
But you do use a lot of the stack, like a lot of the stack,

1628
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,240
don't you?

1629
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,680
Yeah, we use basically all the underlying stuff,

1630
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,720
just a different UI.

1631
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:47,160
So it's really important that things like GTK and GLib

1632
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,560
are being developed not just with Gnome in mind,

1633
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,920
but with these other downstreams like XFCE and elementary.

1634
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,120
I got a funny, just anecdotal story for you.

1635
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,840
Not that it really matters, but I just

1636
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,040
thought it was interesting.

1637
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:04,080
I decided to reinstall my wife's XPS 13 from Kubuntu,

1638
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,200
which had been great.

1639
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,160
But just some things had collected over time,

1640
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,880
and I thought, let's do a fresh install.

1641
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,800
And I put her on the latest elementary.

1642
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,280
It's even got the new login, which looks really slick.

1643
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:15,320
And she felt like I upgraded her whole computer.

1644
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,800
She felt like it was a more professional, elegant

1645
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,360
experience.

1646
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:23,120
She really took to it a lot more than I thought she would.

1647
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,600
So it's two of my family now in elementary OS.

1648
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,360
You're next.

1649
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,000
You know what?

1650
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,960
I could see it.

1651
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,640
I could definitely see it.

1652
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:34,240
Yeah, well, and I run it myself, and I'm also a supporter.

1653
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:40,160
So I think JB is definitely covering the elementary aspect

1654
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:42,120
with private machines, that's for sure.

1655
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:42,800
There you go.

1656
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,040
Yeah, we do.

1657
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,400
We love it.

1658
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,720
Well, I'm glad you made it.

1659
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,800
Thanks for coming today.

1660
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,140
Yeah, absolutely.

1661
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,640
I also just got back from somewhere kind of neat.

1662
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:52,320
Just a little bit before the show,

1663
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,520
Alex arranged a tour of Red Hat Tour.

1664
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:57,320
He works at Red Hat on OpenShift as part of his day job

1665
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,280
over there.

1666
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,000
And so we called him up and said,

1667
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,920
hey, I'd like to give this podcaster guy a tour of Red Hat

1668
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:05,160
Tower in downtown Raleigh.

1669
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:09,040
And after some back and forth, as happens with PR departments

1670
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:10,960
and whatnot, they arranged it for us.

1671
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:11,840
I got to go there.

1672
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:16,680
And let me tell you, this office is

1673
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,480
decked out with glass gates.

1674
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,680
And they have a badge culture.

1675
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,040
I mean, the security around this place is top notch.

1676
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,720
There is a real culture around everybody badges in.

1677
01:04:29,720 --> 01:04:33,120
Even if somebody holds the door open for you, you still badge in.

1678
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:34,440
Well, you don't want stragglers.

1679
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,000
Come on.

1680
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,960
You get your picture printed on your guest badge.

1681
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,520
But a beautiful office.

1682
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,980
Not only just high quality interior stuff,

1683
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:47,800
but beautiful displays, glass artwork, huge open windows,

1684
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,360
interesting different kind of workspaces,

1685
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,520
and of course, cafeterias and snacks.

1686
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,600
Lots of snacks.

1687
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:54,680
Lots of snacks.

1688
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:58,000
But there was one thing that Alex had his eyes on,

1689
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,760
like 10 minutes after we got there.

1690
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,080
And this is part of that sandwich that they made for me

1691
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:02,760
earlier.

1692
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:03,420
What is it, Alex?

1693
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,160
What is this?

1694
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,800
He goes and he buys a sauce from the cafeteria.

1695
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,080
It's so funny, because if you get the sauce anywhere else,

1696
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,600
you've got to pay an arm and a leg.

1697
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,300
I've got to deal with the cafeteria guy.

1698
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:17,480
He sells me a big pot of Chipotle gourmets for $10.

1699
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,600
They get a hookup here.

1700
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:22,320
So they got the food system, which is all sort of discount

1701
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:25,360
or subsidized, however you want to put it.

1702
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,360
But Wes, get ready for this perk.

1703
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,480
Are you ready for this?

1704
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,360
Ooh, tell me, tell me.

1705
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,680
They've got a post office.

1706
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,200
No, just like right there?

1707
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:33,960
In the building.

1708
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,000
You go up to it.

1709
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,160
You give them something you need to ship.

1710
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:36,880
They'll weigh it.

1711
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:37,700
They'll box it.

1712
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:38,440
They'll ship it.

1713
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,680
And then the cost of the postage is subsidized.

1714
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:42,460
No.

1715
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:42,960
Yes.

1716
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,960
How does that make sense?

1717
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:44,760
That's incredible.

1718
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:47,100
I tell you what, that's a serious perk.

1719
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:49,120
It's almost making me want to send mail.

1720
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,240
I know.

1721
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,000
You know how I hate sending mail.

1722
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,520
But I mean, come on, right?

1723
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,600
That seems pretty serious.

1724
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:56,560
That seems legitimate.

1725
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:58,960
So I was pleasantly surprised with my tour.

1726
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,540
It's a corporate office space, but it's

1727
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:04,560
one with a lot of accoutrements, a lot of nice accoutrements.

1728
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,600
I was really impressed.

1729
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:08,840
It's a pretty nice place to work, it seems.

1730
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:12,080
And you have one of the best views of downtown Raleigh

1731
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,080
from this red hat tower.

1732
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:16,480
It even has a red hat.

1733
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:22,040
And happy to report, they are so on point with the branding.

1734
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,920
You know the new red hat logo?

1735
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:38,960
They've even updated the signs in the parking garage.
