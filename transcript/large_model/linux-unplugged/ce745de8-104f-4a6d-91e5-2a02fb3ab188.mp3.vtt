WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.600
So I got this text message from DHL, the delivery service,

00:02.600 --> 00:05.000
saying, hey, your thing from China is about to arrive.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.200
Are you going to sign for it?

00:06.200 --> 00:10.160
And I'm thinking to myself, thing from China?

00:10.160 --> 00:11.360
What did I order from China?

00:11.360 --> 00:12.600
You ever have this problem?

00:12.600 --> 00:13.880
Or maybe I'm just ordering too many things.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.720
I think you're ordering too many things.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.560
So we open up the box, and we pulled out

00:18.560 --> 00:21.960
what was basically 100 little different parts

00:21.960 --> 00:25.800
that once you assemble it, you have the Clockwork Pi

00:25.800 --> 00:27.000
dev terminal.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.000
This thing's really retro looking.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.440
Yeah, it was super fun to put together, too.

00:31.440 --> 00:33.400
I will admit, we did look at it for about three minutes

00:33.400 --> 00:37.480
once we opened the box and said, what is this thing again?

00:37.480 --> 00:40.320
Why does it have a thermal printer?

00:40.320 --> 00:42.680
Once we dug into it, though, it's actually really great.

00:42.680 --> 00:47.000
They set it up so that you can just build the thing yourself,

00:47.000 --> 00:48.880
which was a fun experience, really.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.520
Yeah, it snaps together.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.640
And I know your son, Dylan, was super interested,

00:52.640 --> 00:55.520
because I was able to, in front of him, just take it all apart.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.800
And then we built it up again.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.840
And it was really fun and modular.

00:58.840 --> 01:01.200
So it's basically, I guess it's Pi-based.

01:01.200 --> 01:02.440
You're going to fill me in.

01:02.440 --> 01:03.680
You got the details in front of you here.

01:03.680 --> 01:04.760
Yeah, Pi 3 base.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.840
So this is the Clockwork Pi dev term.

01:06.840 --> 01:10.960
And it's got a full keyboard on it, which is impressive.

01:10.960 --> 01:17.480
It also has lots of USB inputs, got three USB-As, USB-C power,

01:17.480 --> 01:20.320
and also can run on batteries, lithium batteries.

01:20.320 --> 01:22.320
Yeah, it doesn't come with the lithium batteries,

01:22.320 --> 01:25.100
but they're just a standard size that you can order from Amazon.

01:25.100 --> 01:26.200
And we did just that.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.320
It runs Armbian, which was fun.

01:28.320 --> 01:30.360
That was my first dive into that.

01:30.360 --> 01:34.120
And this expansion port with the thermal printer, I thought,

01:34.120 --> 01:35.080
would be kind of fun.

01:35.080 --> 01:38.440
So we're looking for ideas of what to do with this thing.

01:38.440 --> 01:42.560
It also has a mini trackball at the very top of the keyboard.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.760
A la Blackberry.

01:43.760 --> 01:45.080
Yeah, exactly.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.500
And then on the far right side of the keyboard,

01:47.500 --> 01:52.440
above the Backspace key, it has a X, Y, B, and A

01:52.440 --> 01:56.000
sort of Super Nintendo-style gamepad buttons.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.560
It has arrow key buttons on the far left side of it.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.360
It's pretty fascinating.

02:01.360 --> 02:04.360
I'll be honest, a little tough to type on in that size.

02:04.360 --> 02:04.860
It's true.

02:04.860 --> 02:06.400
It's just right for Dylan's hands.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.320
It was fine once I taped those pencils onto my fingers.

02:09.320 --> 02:09.880
Right.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.680
I just shaved down my nails real good.

02:11.680 --> 02:16.120
And ours also makes a hilariously loud buzzing noise.

02:16.120 --> 02:17.640
It's really too bad when you have it

02:17.640 --> 02:19.800
plugged into the power source, which in this case

02:19.800 --> 02:21.760
is a USB-C power source.

02:21.760 --> 02:25.560
It kind of does that electronic hum that everybody hates.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.680
And so we were thinking of having it in the studio

02:27.680 --> 02:29.920
to control the soundboard for guests and stuff.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.400
But it's just so irritating.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.000
It's too noisy.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.040
It's fine with the battery.

02:34.040 --> 02:34.200
Right.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.600
Once you charge up the batteries, it's totally fine.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.160
So now I'm just thinking there's going

02:38.160 --> 02:40.280
to be some way that we could have something that prints out

02:40.280 --> 02:41.800
on that thermal printer from time to time,

02:41.800 --> 02:43.200
because that's just too much fun.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.920
Someone once suggested the, well,

02:44.920 --> 02:47.200
it was Dylan actually that suggested having the Bitcoin

02:47.200 --> 02:49.200
price once an hour just print out on this thing.

02:49.200 --> 02:49.700
Oh, no.

02:49.700 --> 03:02.720
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

03:02.720 --> 03:03.520
My name is Chris.

03:03.520 --> 03:04.320
And my name is Wes.

03:04.320 --> 03:04.840
Hello.

03:04.840 --> 03:05.600
My name is Brent.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.600
Oh, hey, Brent.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.960
Yeah, Wes is actually out on assignment

03:09.960 --> 03:12.280
trying to work out a distribution deal with Spotify

03:12.280 --> 03:14.040
because everybody's doing it.

03:14.040 --> 03:17.040
But this week, we thought maybe it was the perfect moment

03:17.040 --> 03:21.360
to talk about how open source can help save podcasting.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.560
Really, what I mean by that is keep

03:23.560 --> 03:26.400
podcasting independent and decentralized

03:26.400 --> 03:30.080
so it doesn't end up behind these giant corporate platforms

03:30.080 --> 03:31.080
like Spotify.

03:31.080 --> 03:33.000
Not that we have any problem with you choosing

03:33.000 --> 03:34.320
to listen in Spotify.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.200
In fact, we think that's an important aspect.

03:36.200 --> 03:39.320
You should have the right to choose any player you want.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.360
And that's what we're trying to protect here.

03:41.360 --> 03:44.440
And it turns out open source is the key.

03:44.440 --> 03:47.000
So we thought at this point, this time of the year,

03:47.000 --> 03:48.040
maybe we should talk about this.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.520
Because it's something that's what's

03:49.520 --> 03:51.360
going to impact all of you all out there.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.320
And then to help us get through the feedback

03:53.320 --> 03:55.280
after we're done with our interview with Dave,

03:55.280 --> 03:57.640
we have our buddy from Self hosted.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.580
Hello, Alex.

03:58.580 --> 03:59.680
Welcome back to Linux.

03:59.680 --> 04:00.560
Unplug, sir.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.120
I like what you've done with the place.

04:02.120 --> 04:02.800
It's nice.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.280
Yeah.

04:03.280 --> 04:03.800
Cozy.

04:03.800 --> 04:07.000
Well, you know, when Brent's here, projects get done.

04:07.000 --> 04:07.940
They do.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.600
Oh, did we send him the picture of you

04:09.600 --> 04:11.640
and Hadid with the construction in the bathroom?

04:11.640 --> 04:12.200
No, we didn't.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.320
Oh, we shouldn't do that.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.560
Brent's been doing bathroom construction while he's here.

04:15.560 --> 04:16.560
Few renos at the studio.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.000
We did fix the fence, too.

04:18.000 --> 04:18.760
Oh, yeah.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.840
That is actually a good thing.

04:20.840 --> 04:21.640
That fence needed.

04:21.640 --> 04:22.400
It got blown over.

04:22.400 --> 04:23.720
Keeps the dog in the house.

04:23.720 --> 04:26.180
Yeah, the wind was strong that night, Brent.

04:26.180 --> 04:28.320
It's handy having Brent here in multiple ways.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.680
So before we get into the show, before I tell you about what

04:30.680 --> 04:32.120
we've got coming up, we've got to do

04:32.120 --> 04:33.120
a little bit of business here.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.440
We've got to say hello to our virtual time appropriate

04:35.440 --> 04:36.560
greetings, Mumble Room.

04:36.560 --> 04:37.440
Hello.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.800
Hello.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.720
Hello, everybody.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.440
Thank you for being here on a Sunday.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.200
It's nice to see.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.440
We've got about 21 people joining us in there today.

04:44.440 --> 04:46.080
A lot of people just choosing to hang out

04:46.080 --> 04:48.720
in the quiet listening, probably kind of cool on a Sunday.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.120
You know, you pop in, you get a nice high quality opus

04:51.120 --> 04:53.520
codec and low latency, and you get to listen to the show.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.640
And if you want to say something,

04:54.640 --> 04:55.980
you can pop in the On Air channel.

04:55.980 --> 04:57.680
Perfect for doing your Sunday chores.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.840
And it could get even more real if you want

04:59.840 --> 05:01.360
to join us here at the studio.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.360
We have a meetup coming January 30,

05:04.360 --> 05:06.320
right here at our humble little abode.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.960
I have the meetup page up now.

05:07.960 --> 05:09.560
I'm going to use a meetup for this one.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.720
So go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting

05:11.720 --> 05:13.360
for the event details there.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.320
We're going to make it a birthday party for myself,

05:15.320 --> 05:16.480
a little hangout and chow.

05:16.480 --> 05:19.200
I'm going to encourage people to bring their favorite dish,

05:19.200 --> 05:20.320
although you don't have to.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.440
Food will also be supplied.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.680
We just want to see your smiling faces,

05:23.680 --> 05:26.440
because it's a big number, this one.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.200
Sounds like a podcast potluck to me.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.640
Yeah, it is kind of a podcast potluck.

05:29.640 --> 05:30.940
So what I was thinking, and I haven't really

05:30.940 --> 05:31.980
sorted out all the details yet.

05:31.980 --> 05:33.980
I don't know if people are interested in this.

05:33.980 --> 05:37.040
What I was thinking is people show up around,

05:37.040 --> 05:39.440
what did I put in there, like 11, 11.30, or something

05:39.440 --> 05:40.560
like that AM.

05:40.560 --> 05:41.900
Now, we could do it another way.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.780
But what I was what I was consternating on

05:43.780 --> 05:48.400
is people show up, do the meet and greet, get snacks going,

05:48.400 --> 05:51.400
and then we do a live Linux unplugged.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.280
Put the speaker out there, put the screen up,

05:53.280 --> 05:55.120
and everybody attends a live Linux unplugged.

05:55.120 --> 05:57.360
And then afterwards, we break out all the food

05:57.360 --> 05:58.360
and start eating.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.640
I don't know, that seems like kind of the way to do it.

06:00.640 --> 06:02.440
So if you're interested in attending a live Linux

06:02.440 --> 06:04.560
unplugged, I mean, you'll be out in the other room,

06:04.560 --> 06:06.000
but you'll be listening live.

06:06.000 --> 06:10.520
And you want to then chow down with us for my big four zero,

06:10.520 --> 06:13.700
go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

06:13.700 --> 06:17.000
And if you have a small vessel of flight,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.480
we do have a local airport about 10 minutes from the studio.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.000
It's true.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.160
We have to mention that because in the past, listeners

06:22.160 --> 06:23.280
have flown in for meetups.

06:23.280 --> 06:24.000
That's true.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.760
There's one just here that interrupts us.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.320
You know what?

06:26.320 --> 06:28.800
I mean, we're just saying.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.480
We're just saying.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.400
You never know.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.920
And then before we get in, if you've

06:31.920 --> 06:33.920
been listening recently, before we get into the main topic

06:33.920 --> 06:36.400
today, I just want to give you a brief update on our server.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.080
Just been doing the migration thing.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.600
Although, Brent, this is so tricky when Wes isn't around

06:40.600 --> 06:42.160
because he may have had the solution,

06:42.160 --> 06:45.400
but twice this week, I ended up finding these pieces

06:45.400 --> 06:48.720
of rando software that I just wanted to try out.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.600
You don't install those on the server, do you?

06:50.600 --> 06:53.320
Well, this is where I think maybe I should

06:53.320 --> 06:54.960
have set up a Proxima Xbox.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.700
But I thought, it's safe.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.320
But yeah, I'm going to run it on the server

06:59.320 --> 07:00.760
because I want to hear on the LAN.

07:00.760 --> 07:04.720
But that was not the way to go because all of these just all

07:04.720 --> 07:05.520
assume Docker.

07:05.520 --> 07:06.920
They all, and it's like some of them

07:06.920 --> 07:09.920
are a shell script that assumes you have Docker.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.680
Ultimately, I ended up not doing it on the server

07:12.680 --> 07:13.920
because we're using Podman.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.600
And I ended up doing it on the Linode.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.880
But I ran into it, it was just kind of funny

07:17.880 --> 07:20.240
because we're like, we're going to try doing Podman.

07:20.240 --> 07:26.120
And we have probably 30 containers that are Docker.

07:26.120 --> 07:28.760
And how many have we transitioned successfully so

07:28.760 --> 07:29.260
far?

07:29.260 --> 07:29.760
Two.

07:29.760 --> 07:30.260
Ah.

07:30.260 --> 07:33.000
Yeah, it's been bumpy.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.160
It hasn't been as smooth as I was hoping.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.320
I think Wes would probably be quicker at it, but you know.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.900
You and I are just hopeless, I think.

07:39.900 --> 07:42.840
Well, and you know me, I'm doing five things at once, right?

07:42.840 --> 07:45.120
So I'll actually spend five minutes on the actual task

07:45.120 --> 07:47.240
where Wes will just wait for us all to go to bed

07:47.240 --> 07:51.440
so we stop messaging him, and then he'll just get it done.

07:51.440 --> 07:54.040
So that continues.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.960
We'll have more updates on that soon.

07:55.960 --> 07:59.160
But Brent is also going to put out the word to help

07:59.160 --> 08:01.440
us build a server cabinet.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.400
You're looking for input?

08:02.400 --> 08:03.320
You've got a few ideas.

08:03.320 --> 08:05.360
Yeah, I think we've been thinking about this ever

08:05.360 --> 08:07.720
since these servers showed up is.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.320
We don't want to cook them next summer.

08:09.320 --> 08:11.660
Yeah, that was an issue we were worried about on our trip

08:11.660 --> 08:15.480
to Denver this year was the heat in that garage.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.160
And we even considered keeping the garage

08:17.160 --> 08:20.800
open a little bit throughout the trip, which obviously

08:20.800 --> 08:22.520
has some implications.

08:22.520 --> 08:24.560
So cooking up, I think, in the back of our minds

08:24.560 --> 08:26.880
has been, what is the solution?

08:26.880 --> 08:30.760
And I came up with so far, but I'm looking for some input.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.980
Building a little server cabinet,

08:32.980 --> 08:36.440
it doesn't need to be huge, but it needs to be adequate

08:36.440 --> 08:38.480
and needs to hold, I think, a few servers while we're

08:38.480 --> 08:39.720
doing some migrations.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.840
Possibly as many as three servers.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.920
And I wondered if network equipment

08:44.920 --> 08:48.160
could be thrown in there, too, just to clean things up a little.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.120
Probably should be.

08:49.120 --> 08:52.560
You could always go down the Ikea lack route, the lack rack.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.880
So most servers are 19 inches wide,

08:54.880 --> 08:58.680
and a lack table is exactly 19 inches wide.

08:58.680 --> 09:00.440
Well, I was thinking of using real wood,

09:00.440 --> 09:02.080
but I will explore that.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.040
I was thinking of using cardboard.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.240
It's true, he didn't mention cardboard and hot glue.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.280
I'm like, we've got a lot of boxes.

09:09.280 --> 09:12.080
The thing about the lack setup is it's super cheap.

09:12.080 --> 09:16.960
A lack table is like $15, and lumber prices at the moment,

09:16.960 --> 09:18.480
they're almost back to normal.

09:18.480 --> 09:21.120
I think it's a great suggestion, and I'm

09:21.120 --> 09:24.000
at the phase where I'm looking, just scouring for ideas.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.120
So I would love to check that out.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.200
It sounds like the route I should go if I didn't have a brand.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.600
Mayhaps.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.600
I mean, I built a rack out of two by fours

09:32.600 --> 09:34.080
that's been sat in my basement now

09:34.080 --> 09:36.320
for the last three or four years working just fine.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.720
I mean, that is the beauty of it.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.480
Once you build it once, it's done forever.

09:40.480 --> 09:44.400
And a lot of guys actually that do Bitcoin mining

09:44.400 --> 09:46.960
build these plywood boxes to put their servers in,

09:46.960 --> 09:48.920
and then they have air filters and stuff

09:48.920 --> 09:52.080
like that on the intakes, and just use passive cooling

09:52.080 --> 09:54.920
to pull the air through and cool it sufficiently.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.520
I think in the winter, passive cooling

09:56.520 --> 09:59.320
would be perfect for this box.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.920
The summer, I think there's an opportunity there.

10:01.920 --> 10:05.920
And Alex, I think this might tickle a few of your fancies.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.880
I think there's an opportunity to maybe connect

10:07.880 --> 10:11.600
some kind of cooling mechanism, so maybe a household air

10:11.600 --> 10:14.200
conditioner, but to also connect that

10:14.200 --> 10:17.960
to something like Home Assistant to control it and have

10:17.960 --> 10:20.960
a look at it while, I don't know, Chris,

10:20.960 --> 10:22.720
you're traveling and such.

10:22.720 --> 10:26.120
Get a few ESP boards involved and measure those metrics

10:26.120 --> 10:27.920
and find out what your parameters are.

10:27.920 --> 10:28.560
Sure.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.120
And why could we not share this design?

10:31.120 --> 10:33.640
I'd like it to be approachable.

10:33.640 --> 10:37.760
I have knowledge in building stuff with wood.

10:37.760 --> 10:41.240
Alex, you've done some furniture building and stuff like that.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.880
We should just do a springtime project out here or something.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.280
You know, Alex was telling me that he's

10:45.280 --> 10:46.560
considering buying a CNC.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.240
So this is really where this conversation is going.

10:49.240 --> 10:53.800
I would like to, but they are so expensive.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.360
You know, I have run into some maker spaces

10:56.360 --> 10:57.520
that have CNC's and stuff.

10:57.520 --> 10:59.160
So maybe we could look up one of those.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.560
But anyways, I'm looking for suggestions.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.000
We want it to be climate controlled.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.600
I think having it on casters might

11:06.600 --> 11:08.320
be kind of neat to move it around.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.560
You know, we could build it into the wall, but maybe.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.840
Casters could be nice.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.120
So that's an idea.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.600
Also, where I was going was thinking

11:16.600 --> 11:18.800
about working on this thing.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.320
If it's a sealed box, it's going to be a pain to work on.

11:21.320 --> 11:24.680
So I'm thinking removable front and back panels.

11:24.680 --> 11:25.360
Sure.

11:25.360 --> 11:27.040
You're going to need some working room from time to time.

11:27.040 --> 11:27.560
That's it.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.080
So even if you're doing a big server migration

11:30.080 --> 11:33.080
or adding something to it, you could just roll it out,

11:33.080 --> 11:34.880
take the front and back panels off,

11:34.880 --> 11:37.440
get some access to all the parts and things.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.000
So that's kind of where I was going.

11:39.000 --> 11:39.960
I think our trickiest thing is going

11:39.960 --> 11:43.280
to be cooling because we don't have like an outside wall.

11:43.280 --> 11:45.240
We can drill a hole for venting.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.680
We do have the roof.

11:46.680 --> 11:47.280
Yeah.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.200
Yeah, we could go out.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.560
We could go out the roof.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.880
There's a crawl area up there we could vent into,

11:51.880 --> 11:53.520
which has some vents.

11:53.520 --> 11:55.560
It's possible, although it gets very hot up there.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.360
I think in general, you'd be surprised

11:57.360 --> 12:01.240
with how little active cooling you would need.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.880
Just a little bit of airflow is probably

12:03.880 --> 12:07.040
so that the air isn't stagnant and just reheating itself.

12:07.040 --> 12:08.240
That's probably all you need.

12:08.240 --> 12:11.440
You need a source of fresh air and then a way to exhaust it.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.040
And probably not even in massive volumes either.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.200
That's probably a good point.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.920
I mean, I'm not an expert in doing this kind of stuff.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.360
Just getting the hot air out.

12:19.360 --> 12:22.040
The only problem is all of the air in the garage

12:22.040 --> 12:24.080
is very hot because the garage roof is

12:24.080 --> 12:25.720
exposed to the afternoon sun.

12:25.720 --> 12:28.080
So it just really heats up and the door as well.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.960
We could consider a fresh air intake

12:29.960 --> 12:31.760
as well that pokes out of the garage.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.320
So there are possibilities.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.160
But if anyone has some ideas or has even

12:35.160 --> 12:38.800
built something like this, please.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.200
Linuxonblog.com slash contact would be a great way

12:41.200 --> 12:43.080
to send in your suggestions.

12:43.080 --> 12:45.920
I'm open to receiving photographs and diagrams

12:45.920 --> 12:47.560
and sketches and websites and things.

12:47.560 --> 12:48.200
Things you've tried.

12:48.200 --> 12:48.720
Please.

12:48.720 --> 12:49.880
Hard lessons you've learned.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.360
Please.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.840
Help us keep our servers alive.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.760
Or some crazy thing you want us to try.

12:54.760 --> 12:55.840
Yeah.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.000
Also, I'll just do a mention for extras.show.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.960
Go to extras.show slash subscribe

12:59.960 --> 13:02.400
because we have a couple of things coming up in the feed.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.200
We just published Why Linux Will Win in 20 Years.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.080
That was one of many topics that we covered.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.480
We just had a whole list of topics we were talking about.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.600
We threw them into a randomizer and covered them.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.760
And some stuff that we wouldn't normally think of touching on

13:16.760 --> 13:17.480
came up.

13:17.480 --> 13:18.600
It was good to revisit.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.560
Many of those topics came from listeners in our feedback

13:21.560 --> 13:25.360
forms and were maybe topics that we didn't quite

13:25.360 --> 13:27.040
find a slot for yet in the shows.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.480
But we just threw them all in there

13:28.480 --> 13:29.560
and hit the random button.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.480
And it was really fun.

13:30.480 --> 13:30.680
Yeah.

13:30.680 --> 13:31.560
So check that out.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.280
That'll be at extras.show already.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.640
And then coming up in a couple of days,

13:35.640 --> 13:37.760
it's our Denver road trip memories.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.240
The secret about the Denver road trip

13:40.240 --> 13:44.440
is during the entire trip, Brent and I were recording.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.320
And we got a ton of audio that we've never

13:46.320 --> 13:48.200
played on air before.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.040
And we're going to start publishing some of that.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.160
And the first one goes out just a couple of days

13:54.160 --> 13:56.440
after this episode is published.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.960
And then a few days after that extra is published,

13:58.960 --> 14:02.400
the tech we used for our road trip will be published.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.640
And that's a deep dive into everything

14:04.640 --> 14:09.200
from the automation systems on the RV to the networking gear

14:09.200 --> 14:12.000
that we use, the power tech that we used,

14:12.000 --> 14:15.240
and obviously the recording stuff that we used as well.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.520
So it's like a whole rundown of everything.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.000
And it goes into the good and bad.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.160
I mean, we had some failures that caused us some issues.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.080
So those are always fun to talk about.

14:24.080 --> 14:24.640
Yeah.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.440
So that'll be published on extras.show in a few days.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.040
It's all coming out over there.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.440
And just a little spat of extra content for you,

14:31.440 --> 14:34.840
because we love you.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.560
Linode.com slash unplugged.

14:36.560 --> 14:39.680
Go there to get $100 and 60 day credit on a new account.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.320
And go there to support the show.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.720
And go there to try out Stream 9.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.160
CentOS Stream 9 is now available on Linode.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.800
You could try it out with one of those systems that has MVME

14:48.800 --> 14:49.600
storage.

14:49.600 --> 14:50.960
I mean, I don't know why.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.320
Because honestly, all their systems are screaming fast.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.800
And the price is great.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.760
This is a great time to go sign up for Linode.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.040
It's the beginning of the year.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.600
If you've been listening to the show for a little while

14:59.600 --> 15:01.760
and you've been thinking about doing it,

15:01.760 --> 15:04.400
why not pull the trigger right here in January?

15:04.400 --> 15:06.320
Kick it off with Linode.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.920
So go to Linode.com slash unplugged.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.120
Get that $100 and really try it out.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.400
I mean, Linode's giving you real money there to work with,

15:12.400 --> 15:15.520
because they're confident that if they give you

15:15.520 --> 15:17.160
an amount that lets you spend some time,

15:17.160 --> 15:18.240
you're going to love it.

15:18.240 --> 15:20.280
You're going to see why it's better.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.680
You'll see the super fast systems, the easy deploy,

15:22.680 --> 15:23.920
one-click applications.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.920
I mean, they've been doing this for 18 years.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.960
So as you use the system, you'll start

15:29.960 --> 15:32.280
to appreciate all the small little edge cases

15:32.280 --> 15:34.280
that the experience has brought them.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.680
And the passion for the technology

15:35.680 --> 15:38.400
that underpins all of this, Linux,

15:38.400 --> 15:40.560
is what brought them into this.

15:40.560 --> 15:43.160
And even 18 years later, you can still

15:43.160 --> 15:45.320
see that DNA in the product.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.640
And Linode has learned that customer support is critical.

15:47.640 --> 15:51.520
So they have invested in the absolute best customer

15:51.520 --> 15:53.160
support in the business.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.840
I get notes from listeners all the time.

15:54.840 --> 15:57.800
In fact, please keep sending them in.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.760
Just go to linuxunplugged.com slash contact

15:59.760 --> 16:01.520
and tell us your story with Linode,

16:01.520 --> 16:03.240
because it's great to hear it.

16:03.240 --> 16:05.760
It really has resonated with our community,

16:05.760 --> 16:08.000
because it hits on all those key points.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.360
Performance, customer support, a Linux culture that runs deep.

16:12.360 --> 16:13.800
They support the community.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.000
They support events.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.200
They support a lot of Linux content creators.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.560
And they support projects and free software

16:19.560 --> 16:21.040
that enable all of this.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.680
They really get investing in the entire ecosystem.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.320
So let's go put everything over the top.

16:25.320 --> 16:28.440
Go grab that $100 in credit and support the show.

16:28.440 --> 16:31.080
Go to linode.com slash unplugged.

16:31.080 --> 16:36.320
Chris, you had the opportunity to sit down with Dave Jones.

16:36.320 --> 16:38.600
And he's working over at the Podcast Index.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.920
And it sounds like they're doing some pretty interesting stuff

16:40.920 --> 16:41.360
over there.

16:41.360 --> 16:43.520
Yeah, they're calling it Podcasting 2.0.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.240
And I like it.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.120
I think it's a great name.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.780
It really describes what they're trying to do.

16:46.780 --> 16:49.720
And I thought, this is a topic that impacts all of us.

16:49.720 --> 16:53.320
They're using open source to try to decentralize and keep

16:53.320 --> 16:56.640
podcasting independent for those who want it, to give listeners

16:56.640 --> 17:00.280
the choice of app and way of listening, however you want.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.720
It's, you know, keep it an RSS feed that you consume.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.320
And so we thought, this is a great moment to sit down,

17:06.320 --> 17:09.320
talk about these challenges, maybe more so right now

17:09.320 --> 17:10.320
than ever.

17:10.320 --> 17:14.280
Podcasting is in a precarious place right now.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.360
There's a lot of really big interests

17:16.360 --> 17:18.160
that are trying to influence the market.

17:18.160 --> 17:21.160
There's downward pressure on the price of advertising.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.840
And there's just a lot of podcasts.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.040
Not to mention, certain players in the market

17:27.040 --> 17:30.000
are beginning to move forward with agendas that are really

17:30.000 --> 17:33.880
kind of aimed at locking podcasts up into their silos

17:33.880 --> 17:37.080
and monetizing them even further.

17:37.080 --> 17:39.000
So my guest today is Dave Jones.

17:39.000 --> 17:42.200
And along with Adam Curry, they launched their Podcasting 2.0

17:42.200 --> 17:44.640
initiative about a year and a half ago.

17:44.640 --> 17:47.440
It's a platform that has an index and an umbrella

17:47.440 --> 17:50.520
of open source applications and an API.

17:50.520 --> 17:51.840
So we kicked off the conversation

17:51.840 --> 17:53.800
when I asked Dave what sparked the idea

17:53.800 --> 17:57.240
for a decentralized podcast platform in the first place.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.040
I guess the abbreviated version of that

17:59.040 --> 18:01.520
is that a guy I've been working with for a long time,

18:01.520 --> 18:03.960
widely known in podcasting, co-invented podcasting,

18:03.960 --> 18:05.240
is Adam Curry.

18:05.240 --> 18:10.760
And Adam and I had been friends for probably 10 years or more,

18:10.760 --> 18:14.000
working on various projects around RSS

18:14.000 --> 18:17.120
and feed aggregation and OPML.

18:17.120 --> 18:20.320
And we jointly built a show notes

18:20.320 --> 18:25.560
system for his podcast, The No Agenda Show, which is huge.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.360
Got about a million listeners.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.880
And so we had kind of been through the trenches

18:29.880 --> 18:33.040
in aggregation software and RSS.

18:33.040 --> 18:38.720
But he called me about a year and a half ago and said,

18:38.720 --> 18:41.360
maybe a little bit longer back, said, hey,

18:41.360 --> 18:45.360
this whole thing with Apple sort of controlling the default

18:45.360 --> 18:49.680
search, sort of the yellow pages of podcasting, number one,

18:49.680 --> 18:50.440
makes no sense.

18:50.440 --> 18:53.960
And number two, it's concerning with all the deplatforming

18:53.960 --> 18:56.840
going on and all this kind of thing.

18:56.840 --> 18:59.880
And so what you end up with is this

18:59.880 --> 19:04.280
was supposed to be an open, decentralized system

19:04.280 --> 19:07.720
of podcasting built on RSS.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.200
And that's true.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.480
It mostly operates that way.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.800
But then when you look at, in practice,

19:13.800 --> 19:16.400
where do you go to find podcasts and where

19:16.400 --> 19:18.560
do all those things live, everything

19:18.560 --> 19:21.440
goes to Apple, which is literally the largest

19:21.440 --> 19:23.080
company in the world.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.880
So you have this huge dichotomy here

19:24.880 --> 19:27.520
between what podcasting is supposed

19:27.520 --> 19:29.680
to be at a technical level and what it actually

19:29.680 --> 19:31.880
is in practice.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.560
And he's like, we really need to change this.

19:34.560 --> 19:37.360
And we have the chops to do it.

19:37.360 --> 19:40.920
So why don't we get together and create an index

19:40.920 --> 19:45.360
to begin with, an open directory of podcasts,

19:45.360 --> 19:49.840
and then tie an API to it to where any app developer can

19:49.840 --> 19:53.760
write an app and just hook into it for free.

19:53.760 --> 19:58.440
We'll have it be donation-based and not a paid product.

19:58.440 --> 20:01.280
And then we'll do a podcast to go along with it.

20:01.280 --> 20:05.240
And as we build it, we'll just podcast about what we're doing.

20:05.240 --> 20:08.360
And hopefully, we'll get a whole bunch of app developers

20:08.360 --> 20:12.440
on board that are struggling to pay for all the infrastructure

20:12.440 --> 20:15.800
that it takes to run a back end for a podcast app.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.160
We'll make that easier for them.

20:17.160 --> 20:20.560
And in the process, we'll build this alternative directory

20:20.560 --> 20:24.400
to Apple so that we can take that centralization away.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.040
And then in the process, one of the elements of it

20:27.040 --> 20:29.440
will be we'll give the whole database away.

20:29.440 --> 20:32.720
So I was like, hey, that sounds like a challenge.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.360
Sounds fun to do.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.160
Yeah, let's do it.

20:35.160 --> 20:37.280
And so that's kind of where it was born about a year

20:37.280 --> 20:38.360
and a half ago.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.560
It sounds like Apple was definitely a major influencer.

20:40.560 --> 20:42.920
But how much more critical has this idea

20:42.920 --> 20:46.080
become since Spotify has gotten so invested in podcasting?

20:46.080 --> 20:47.840
And I know you're familiar with the fact

20:47.840 --> 20:50.160
that YouTube just announced they want to get involved

20:50.160 --> 20:51.520
with podcasting.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.880
So the idea of a decentralized podcast

20:53.880 --> 20:55.600
index that's essentially just backed

20:55.600 --> 21:00.000
by people who are motivated by podcasts' best interest, right?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.640
I mean, it's great that Adam Curry is involved.

21:02.640 --> 21:06.080
And I sniffed around on the socials and checked out

21:06.080 --> 21:07.400
a couple of the podcasts.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.160
And the motivation is obvious.

21:09.160 --> 21:13.000
You guys want podcast index to be the place that

21:13.000 --> 21:15.160
is sort of a trusted, not connected

21:15.160 --> 21:18.760
to any particular commercial cornering the market interest.

21:18.760 --> 21:19.680
Yeah, that's right.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.960
So we kind of have our motto, if you want to say,

21:22.960 --> 21:26.760
or mission statement, is preserve, protect, and extend

21:26.760 --> 21:30.880
the open podcasting ecosystem in that it's not just words.

21:30.880 --> 21:33.280
There's sort of meaning behind each one of those.

21:33.280 --> 21:36.000
And what you just mentioned was Spotify.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.840
And then later, Apple coming in and beginning

21:38.840 --> 21:42.200
to wall the garden as well with their subscription product

21:42.200 --> 21:43.360
and that kind of thing.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.360
You've always had this effort to wall

21:46.360 --> 21:48.320
the garden around podcasting.

21:48.320 --> 21:51.520
But really, in the last three to four years,

21:51.520 --> 21:53.840
it's gotten to a fever pitch.

21:53.840 --> 21:57.120
And you now have the CEO of Anchor coming out

21:57.120 --> 22:01.880
and saying they're going to actively push their users away

22:01.880 --> 22:03.160
from RSS.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.600
You don't even get an RSS feed when

22:04.600 --> 22:07.760
you start an Anchor podcast unless you request it.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.640
And supposedly, the reasoning behind that is RSS is antiquated

22:11.640 --> 22:14.720
and it can't give the new modern features

22:14.720 --> 22:18.000
that everybody expects from a platform, which

22:18.000 --> 22:19.480
is completely bogus.

22:19.480 --> 22:23.040
But we had this idea to preserve, protect, and extend

22:23.040 --> 22:24.440
podcasting.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.960
And that's really aimed at that.

22:26.960 --> 22:30.680
Where you've got to fend off those walled gardens.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.880
And to do that, you have to have a directory and an API

22:33.880 --> 22:36.240
that everybody can look into that's not

22:36.240 --> 22:38.280
dependent on one of those guys.

22:38.280 --> 22:42.000
And then you decentralize everything.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.840
Don't keep it a single point of failure

22:43.840 --> 22:46.680
because then you're just recreating the same problems

22:46.680 --> 22:48.820
that those guys have.

22:48.820 --> 22:52.280
And then you build around that a vocal group of people

22:52.280 --> 22:55.040
who are like-minded and also are committed

22:55.040 --> 22:58.480
to the open podcasting preservation.

22:58.480 --> 23:03.080
And then finally, you extend it by creating a namespace,

23:03.080 --> 23:07.000
which is what we've done, and just listening and asking

23:07.000 --> 23:10.280
people, what features does everybody want in podcasting?

23:10.280 --> 23:13.440
Technical features and user-facing features.

23:13.440 --> 23:16.000
We've spent the last year just building out

23:16.000 --> 23:20.200
a comprehensive namespace for RSS that has

23:20.200 --> 23:21.440
all of those features in it.

23:21.440 --> 23:26.040
And I can tell you this, there is no silo or walled garden

23:26.040 --> 23:28.080
Spotify, Apple, anybody you want to name

23:28.080 --> 23:30.600
that has anything close to the feature list

23:30.600 --> 23:33.040
that open RSS has at this point.

23:33.040 --> 23:37.000
The podcasting 2.0 tags are killer.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.000
Let's talk about that.

23:38.000 --> 23:42.200
So this is something that, as a content creator that publishes

23:42.200 --> 23:45.800
everything as a podcast, I have felt like this hasn't really

23:45.800 --> 23:46.600
moved much.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.760
And then we started seeing these siloed platforms

23:49.760 --> 23:51.560
introduce their own proprietary features

23:51.560 --> 23:52.680
to go along with podcasting.

23:52.680 --> 23:55.120
But what you guys have done here with this namespace stuff

23:55.120 --> 23:59.320
is super appealing, like really taking podcast chapters

23:59.320 --> 24:01.840
to the next level, for example, allowing images really

24:01.840 --> 24:04.360
to be displayed in line, not necessarily

24:04.360 --> 24:06.800
even with a particular chapter, but with time markers.

24:06.800 --> 24:09.240
And I love the idea of a sound bite

24:09.240 --> 24:11.640
tag that kind of identifies to the podcast player

24:11.640 --> 24:14.240
that the publisher has said this is like a good little preview

24:14.240 --> 24:17.120
sound bite if you'd like to listen to a bit from the show.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.160
I think that's awesome.

24:18.160 --> 24:20.280
I wish we've had that for years.

24:20.280 --> 24:23.400
And that's just like two of a bunch of really good ideas

24:23.400 --> 24:24.160
that are in there.

24:24.160 --> 24:28.440
But it seems to me you've got to get the podcast apps

24:28.440 --> 24:30.120
to support that stuff, right?

24:30.120 --> 24:32.000
Yeah, and that's always the issue.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.720
Whenever you start a project like this, what happens

24:34.720 --> 24:38.640
is immediately people start pelting you from on high

24:38.640 --> 24:42.960
with XKCD comic references.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.680
You know, you've got 13 specs, and you're

24:44.680 --> 24:47.360
going to create a unifying spec, and now you just got 14 specs.

24:47.360 --> 24:51.240
And you just get all this sort of like, not hostility,

24:51.240 --> 24:55.000
but just sort of negativity around, oh, here's

24:55.000 --> 24:58.040
another standard, and they're going to fix everything.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.280
And then you had the chicken and egg problem

25:00.280 --> 25:03.520
of who's going to support it first, the publisher or the app.

25:03.520 --> 25:07.040
And so there's always that kind of thing.

25:07.040 --> 25:12.280
But what we found out was that it's really necessary

25:12.280 --> 25:14.840
to do some of this stuff, even if it slightly recreates

25:14.840 --> 25:17.160
the wheel in some respects.

25:17.160 --> 25:19.800
And I'll give you a perfect example, something

25:19.800 --> 25:22.000
like the funding tag.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.560
Now, you could do this before the podcast namespace funding

25:26.560 --> 25:27.240
tag.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.200
You could have a link to a PayPal.

25:29.200 --> 25:32.760
There's an atom link called rel="payment,"

25:32.760 --> 25:34.360
and you could do that.

25:34.360 --> 25:37.900
And there was some support for it in apps.

25:37.900 --> 25:40.240
It was, I don't know, 50-50.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.400
But you take a thing like that, and then how

25:43.400 --> 25:45.920
do you actually extend it?

25:45.920 --> 25:48.720
There's nowhere to go to talk to the developers

25:48.720 --> 25:50.500
if you needed to tweak that.

25:50.500 --> 25:51.960
Let's say that you're going to try

25:51.960 --> 25:55.200
to tweak something like Dublin Core, which

25:55.200 --> 25:58.640
is another popular namespace extension for RSS.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.080
That committee or working group or whoever had that,

26:02.080 --> 26:03.880
that thing's gone now.

26:03.880 --> 26:07.160
Same with Media RSS, which was part of Yahoo

26:07.160 --> 26:09.240
back a million years ago.

26:09.240 --> 26:13.720
A lot of these things that exist in RSS as namespace extensions,

26:13.720 --> 26:15.480
they have no more leadership anymore.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.640
They have no working groups.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.880
They have no place that you can go

26:18.880 --> 26:22.960
that if you wanted to modify the spec to meet a modern need,

26:22.960 --> 26:25.880
you can't do it, or there's nobody in charge of that thing

26:25.880 --> 26:26.400
anymore.

26:26.400 --> 26:27.520
It's failed.

26:27.520 --> 26:31.560
So what this is is we will recreate the wheel

26:31.560 --> 26:34.200
in some respects with some of these tags,

26:34.200 --> 26:38.280
but they're modern, and there's a group that now exists

26:38.280 --> 26:40.080
that's in control of it.

26:40.080 --> 26:42.800
You can go and say, hey, I think we need this extension

26:42.800 --> 26:44.480
to be tweaked a little bit, or I think

26:44.480 --> 26:47.920
we need this extra attribute on this RSS tag.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.800
And everybody talks about it, and we all

26:50.800 --> 26:53.440
come up with a solution, and it moves forward.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.480
And so one of the things that you talked about

26:55.480 --> 26:56.800
was the soundbite tag.

26:56.800 --> 26:58.120
That didn't come from us.

26:58.120 --> 27:01.800
That came from Buzzsprout, the hosting company.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.720
They had this idea for a soundbite tag for a long time,

27:04.720 --> 27:07.200
and they popped up into the namespace one day and was like,

27:07.200 --> 27:08.760
hey, we've got this soundbite tag.

27:08.760 --> 27:12.400
We're already using it, but no apps have supported it yet.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.440
And so we're like, yeah, this looks great.

27:14.440 --> 27:18.440
Let's formalize it into an actual namespace declaration

27:18.440 --> 27:19.280
and make it happen.

27:19.280 --> 27:21.080
Same with the transcript tag.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.160
We added the transcript tag so you can just

27:23.160 --> 27:30.040
take any SRT or WebVTT or JSON-based transcript,

27:30.040 --> 27:31.120
and it's just a URL.

27:31.120 --> 27:35.600
You drop it in your feed item, and you can specify it,

27:35.600 --> 27:37.400
and the app can go look for the transcript

27:37.400 --> 27:39.200
and pull a time code to transcript down

27:39.200 --> 27:41.040
and give you close captioning.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.960
And so it's those types of things

27:42.960 --> 27:45.120
where sometimes we're recreating the wheel.

27:45.120 --> 27:46.920
Sometimes we're creating something new.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.520
But the real purpose of the whole thing

27:48.520 --> 27:53.280
is to have an actual group that exists in perpetuity, that's

27:53.280 --> 27:56.000
open source, that's community-led,

27:56.000 --> 28:00.600
without being dependent on any corporate backing, that

28:00.600 --> 28:02.800
will forever be in charge of this spec

28:02.800 --> 28:05.600
and is purely for the benefit of podcasters.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.440
Finally.

28:08.440 --> 28:09.640
This is my livelihood.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.360
I've been doing this for like 14 years.

28:12.360 --> 28:14.880
I mean, I've been doing it since people

28:14.880 --> 28:18.840
were burning MP3 files to CD-ROMs to listen to my shows.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.240
So I really do appreciate it.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.440
And I know that one of the things we've needed to do

28:22.440 --> 28:24.480
is sort of fill out podcasts a little bit,

28:24.480 --> 28:26.880
give them a little bit richer of an experience.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.880
They've kind of just been the same for a while.

28:28.880 --> 28:32.040
And I was really worried that some closed ecosystem was

28:32.040 --> 28:34.240
going to be the only way that was going to move forward,

28:34.240 --> 28:36.920
and consumers would move there because of the features.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.920
But you guys are also doing some other stuff

28:38.920 --> 28:40.600
beyond just the namespace stuff.

28:40.600 --> 28:42.360
Tell me a little bit about Podping,

28:42.360 --> 28:45.840
because that seems like as podcasting gets

28:45.840 --> 28:48.880
way more successful, and you have all these users

28:48.880 --> 28:52.560
with mobile apps and whatnot that are checking in on feeds,

28:52.560 --> 28:55.360
it sounds like Podping is maybe a solution that scales

28:55.360 --> 28:56.360
a little bit better here.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.080
Yeah.

28:57.080 --> 29:00.480
We've tried to, in the second leg of what

29:00.480 --> 29:03.480
we're doing with protecting podcasting,

29:03.480 --> 29:05.520
is decentralizing everything.

29:05.520 --> 29:09.880
So it's really important to decentralize

29:09.880 --> 29:13.200
every bit of our infrastructure so that we don't just become

29:13.200 --> 29:15.160
another single point of failure.

29:15.160 --> 29:18.520
We use IPFS extensively.

29:18.520 --> 29:21.800
We use Activity Pub everywhere we can.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.480
And one of the things we've been doing

29:23.480 --> 29:25.480
is a lot of blockchain work.

29:25.480 --> 29:30.040
And as sysadmins, which my day job is as a sysadmin

29:30.040 --> 29:33.360
in financial services, is you hear blockchain,

29:33.360 --> 29:35.680
and you roll your eyes, and you're like, oh my god,

29:35.680 --> 29:36.920
here we go again.

29:36.920 --> 29:40.640
And it's like the solution without a problem.

29:40.640 --> 29:44.920
But blockchain does have a very narrow use case,

29:44.920 --> 29:49.560
which it can do that really nothing else can do.

29:49.560 --> 29:51.040
And that's where Podping comes in.

29:51.040 --> 29:56.200
And so this whole web 3.0 world, where these distributed apps

29:56.200 --> 29:59.560
are running on blockchain, we found a blockchain

29:59.560 --> 30:03.240
through a guy who's part of our group, and it's called Hive.

30:03.240 --> 30:04.800
The Hive blockchain.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.480
It produces a new block every three seconds.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.960
And what we've done is created an open piece of software.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.480
It's written in Rust.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.760
And it's basically just a web front end

30:15.760 --> 30:20.000
and a blockchain Hive writer on the back end.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.160
And it just takes an authorization token.

30:22.160 --> 30:25.160
So if you had like Jupiter Broadcasting wanted

30:25.160 --> 30:28.720
to inform the whole world every time you published

30:28.720 --> 30:30.640
a new episode or made a significant change

30:30.640 --> 30:35.200
to your feed, you could call out to Podping

30:35.200 --> 30:38.400
with your auth token and just a simple get request

30:38.400 --> 30:40.600
with the feed URL in it.

30:40.600 --> 30:44.360
And the Podping system will take that URL,

30:44.360 --> 30:47.480
write it to the Hive blockchain, and then everybody

30:47.480 --> 30:49.840
in the world can, since it's a public blockchain,

30:49.840 --> 30:52.520
can just read it with a simple Python script.

30:52.520 --> 30:55.280
And within three seconds, everybody knows, hey,

30:55.280 --> 30:59.040
this podcast has just updated, and you don't have to poll.

30:59.040 --> 31:03.080
You don't have to sit there and hammer your RSS feed 25 times

31:03.080 --> 31:05.600
an hour to see, have you published yet?

31:05.600 --> 31:06.480
Have you published yet?

31:06.480 --> 31:07.440
Over and over.

31:07.440 --> 31:10.240
This is a decentralized blockchain-based push

31:10.240 --> 31:13.160
notification system for podcasting.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.320
So yes, what Podping is.

31:14.320 --> 31:16.000
We're pretty jazzed about it because there's

31:16.000 --> 31:18.600
been attempts to do stuff like this in the past.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.880
The most famous attempt is Websub,

31:21.880 --> 31:24.400
which used to be called PubSubHubbub.

31:24.400 --> 31:26.520
And it works.

31:26.520 --> 31:30.760
But the problem is it's a server-based system.

31:30.760 --> 31:33.400
So if my server is not listening all the time,

31:33.400 --> 31:37.040
I don't get your webhook calls when you publish a new episode.

31:37.040 --> 31:40.480
The other issue with Websub is it's subscription-based.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.720
So if I'm monitoring the podcast index,

31:42.720 --> 31:45.920
we have 4 and 1 half million podcast

31:45.920 --> 31:48.280
feeds in our database, that means

31:48.280 --> 31:51.120
I would have to have 4 and 1 half million Websub

31:51.120 --> 31:54.920
subscriptions that would be resubscribing

31:54.920 --> 31:57.200
every 7 to 15 days.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.420
You'd spend all day just resubscribing to feeds.

32:00.420 --> 32:04.160
So this system is purely push-only.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.800
There's no subscriptions.

32:05.800 --> 32:07.320
It's all just public on the blockchain.

32:07.320 --> 32:12.160
So that's one example of some of the supporting technologies

32:12.160 --> 32:17.000
that go along with the podcast index and the namespace

32:17.000 --> 32:20.560
to flesh out this whole thing and make it decentralized.

32:20.560 --> 32:23.720
The last year and the next year are

32:23.720 --> 32:29.560
going to be totally just change everything kind of situations

32:29.560 --> 32:31.200
for advertising and podcasting.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.080
I have a good sense.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.280
I've been reading the tea leaves,

32:34.280 --> 32:38.000
and there's a lot of downward pressure on the price.

32:38.000 --> 32:38.960
Like the CPM?

32:38.960 --> 32:39.920
Yeah.

32:39.920 --> 32:41.840
And there's certain groups out there

32:41.840 --> 32:43.920
that sort of are establishing themselves

32:43.920 --> 32:46.480
as the authority on podcast advertising.

32:46.480 --> 32:48.440
They're declaring the prices are just

32:48.440 --> 32:52.680
like bottom basement fast food prices for podcast advertising.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.040
And so content creators, podcasters,

32:55.040 --> 32:56.920
we get in this situation where it's like,

32:56.920 --> 32:59.200
well, then I got to just take on more sponsors and more

32:59.200 --> 32:59.680
sponsors.

32:59.680 --> 33:01.080
And you get the shows loaded up.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.960
And then you go to dynamic ad insertion and all that.

33:03.960 --> 33:04.460
Yeah.

33:04.460 --> 33:05.000
Yeah.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.520
Pretty soon you start monetizing the back catalog,

33:07.520 --> 33:09.800
and the ads are hard cut in there.

33:09.800 --> 33:13.000
And it's kind of like you end up these podcasters,

33:13.000 --> 33:15.880
and I've tempted fate with this for a little while.

33:15.880 --> 33:17.680
You end up kind of creating content

33:17.680 --> 33:20.600
to serve the sponsors, not to serve the audience.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.920
And I think that's why I really perked up

33:23.920 --> 33:26.080
when I saw that you guys have adopted and are sort

33:26.080 --> 33:29.240
of encouraging people to use a value for value model

33:29.240 --> 33:30.440
to support podcasters.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.520
And you're building tools in there for them.

33:32.520 --> 33:35.440
Quickly, a value for value model is simply

33:35.440 --> 33:38.600
if you get value from the podcaster, from the content,

33:38.600 --> 33:41.000
you give them the value you think it was worth to you.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.240
Value for value, and it's something

33:42.240 --> 33:44.080
that they practice on the No Agenda Show.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.440
And it's a concept that I think is,

33:46.440 --> 33:49.040
it actually does deserve wider adoption.

33:49.040 --> 33:52.000
So what does this mean for the podcast index?

33:52.000 --> 33:54.840
How is monetizing with value for value,

33:54.840 --> 33:57.120
how does all that come together with something that's

33:57.120 --> 33:58.680
an index for podcasts?

33:58.680 --> 34:02.080
The podcasting 2.0 movement is a little all over the map.

34:02.080 --> 34:05.160
It's a little hard to sort of pin down,

34:05.160 --> 34:07.360
but it's really sort of four parts.

34:07.360 --> 34:10.960
It's the podcast index database and the API.

34:10.960 --> 34:14.040
It's the podcast namespace, and then it's

34:14.040 --> 34:15.880
the infrastructure around it, which

34:15.880 --> 34:19.040
is things you mentioned, like Podping and Helipad

34:19.040 --> 34:22.280
and the podcaster wallet and all this other code.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.160
It's all open source.

34:23.160 --> 34:25.040
It's all in our GitHub repository.

34:25.040 --> 34:27.000
Then it's our show that we do every Friday

34:27.000 --> 34:28.880
called Podcasting 2.0.

34:28.880 --> 34:32.040
And for us, as an example, the Podcasting 2.0 show

34:32.040 --> 34:33.560
is value for value.

34:33.560 --> 34:35.720
And we're purely run on donations.

34:35.720 --> 34:37.400
We don't have any advertising.

34:37.400 --> 34:41.320
And we were sort of the first test case of this new technology

34:41.320 --> 34:45.760
that we wanted to push, which is Bitcoin Lightning streaming

34:45.760 --> 34:46.440
payments.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.960
And so if anybody's not familiar with the Lightning

34:48.960 --> 34:52.360
network on Bitcoin, what it is is this so-called Layer 2

34:52.360 --> 34:53.520
technology.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.400
So the Bitcoin blockchain is fantastic,

34:56.400 --> 35:02.320
and we all know why it's trust no one and distributed

35:02.320 --> 35:05.840
and no double spend and all these great things.

35:05.840 --> 35:09.000
But the problem is it's slow.

35:09.000 --> 35:10.760
Transaction times are extremely slow,

35:10.760 --> 35:12.720
and the fees are expensive.

35:12.720 --> 35:15.400
So these Layer 2 technologies have developed Lightning

35:15.400 --> 35:17.560
being the best example.

35:17.560 --> 35:20.960
And so it sits on top of the blockchain

35:20.960 --> 35:26.120
and creates a peer-to-peer distributed network of nodes

35:26.120 --> 35:30.000
that are willing to lock up some funding in channels

35:30.000 --> 35:31.240
between each other.

35:31.240 --> 35:34.120
So what you end up with is a mesh network

35:34.120 --> 35:36.600
of multi-signature wallets, if that makes sense

35:36.600 --> 35:38.560
to anybody listening.

35:38.560 --> 35:41.040
You end up with a mesh network of multi-signature wallets

35:41.040 --> 35:44.520
between nodes so that you can relay payments

35:44.520 --> 35:46.880
between nodes from end to end.

35:46.880 --> 35:49.040
So if I was going to send you, Chris,

35:49.040 --> 35:52.720
if I was going to send you $20 of Bitcoin,

35:52.720 --> 35:55.520
I don't necessarily have to have a direct connection to you.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.880
I could have a connection to three other people who

35:58.880 --> 36:01.200
have a connection to you, and then that payment

36:01.200 --> 36:03.720
can be relayed through the network.

36:03.720 --> 36:05.200
It's awesome technology.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.200
And it's cheap and fast, too, which is key.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.960
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

36:08.960 --> 36:11.280
The problem with Lightning was it was invoice-based.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.880
So it's like if I was going to pay you,

36:13.880 --> 36:16.000
you would have to send me an invoice for $20,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.440
and then I would scan the QR code of that invoice

36:18.440 --> 36:20.280
or plug in the text invoice number,

36:20.280 --> 36:22.600
and then it would do the payment.

36:22.600 --> 36:25.920
Well, Adam, about a year ago or so,

36:25.920 --> 36:29.200
found a technology called Keysend,

36:29.200 --> 36:32.200
which is a part of the Lightning protocol.

36:32.200 --> 36:34.760
But it just wasn't super widely used.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.880
It basically just allows you to send random invoiceless

36:37.880 --> 36:39.280
payments to another node.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.040
So if I know your node ID on the network,

36:42.040 --> 36:43.760
I can just send you $20.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.120
And you can't even stop me.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.000
It's not like you can say, I don't want it.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.040
You're going to get it.

36:48.040 --> 36:49.840
So this was perfect.

36:49.840 --> 36:53.160
So what we did was we took the name space, the podcast name

36:53.160 --> 36:58.040
space, and we put in a new tag called the value tag.

36:58.040 --> 37:03.440
And so what I can do is I can take multiple Lightning nodes

37:03.440 --> 37:08.320
and put those into my RSS feed in this tag structure.

37:08.320 --> 37:13.120
And every time somebody listens to my podcast

37:13.120 --> 37:17.880
on a Podcasting 2.0 app that supports this technology,

37:17.880 --> 37:20.920
it will look at those Lightning node IDs

37:20.920 --> 37:26.520
and begin to send streaming Bitcoin back to the creator.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.960
So I can fill up as a listener, if I'm

37:28.960 --> 37:32.440
using a podcast app like Cast-O-Matic or Fountain

37:32.440 --> 37:36.480
or Podfriend or Podverse or one of these apps that support it,

37:36.480 --> 37:40.840
or Breeze, I can take and load up my Bitcoin wallet

37:40.840 --> 37:44.360
on my podcast app with, let's just say, $20.

37:44.360 --> 37:47.200
And I can set an amount like, let's just say,

37:47.200 --> 37:49.760
50 Satoshis a minute.

37:49.760 --> 37:52.280
And then every time I hit Play, it just

37:52.280 --> 37:54.440
starts streaming 50 Satoshis a minute back

37:54.440 --> 37:56.840
through the Lightning network to that podcaster's Lightning

37:56.840 --> 37:57.840
node.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.760
It is super cool.

37:59.760 --> 38:03.880
One of the things that's really amazing to watch as a podcaster,

38:03.880 --> 38:05.440
and we see it every week on our show,

38:05.440 --> 38:07.680
is when people are listening, you

38:07.680 --> 38:10.320
can just look at your Lightning node wallet.

38:10.320 --> 38:12.920
And you can just see those Satoshis coming in.

38:12.920 --> 38:16.080
They're just two Satoshis, 20 Satoshis, 40 Satoshis.

38:16.080 --> 38:19.800
It's just every minute, bing, bing, bing, you're getting paid.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.240
And you know people are listening.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.160
There's a few things I love about this, right?

38:23.160 --> 38:25.720
I mean, number one, there's no middleman.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.880
It's decentralized.

38:26.880 --> 38:32.280
There's no PayPal or Patreon or 13% fee or anything like that.

38:32.280 --> 38:34.320
And the other thing that I think is intriguing

38:34.320 --> 38:36.840
is if you do combine it with a podcast app that has some sort

38:36.840 --> 38:38.800
of wallet functionality.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.480
What is great about sending, like you're saying,

38:41.480 --> 38:44.120
some Satoshis, which is just a part of a Bitcoin,

38:44.120 --> 38:48.440
to a podcaster is that is likely going

38:48.440 --> 38:51.080
to be something that over time will appreciate in value.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.200
So you're giving a really small donation.

38:53.200 --> 38:56.960
Maybe it equals $50 over a year, right?

38:56.960 --> 38:59.320
But if that podcaster were to hold on

38:59.320 --> 39:02.160
to those Satoshis for five years,

39:02.160 --> 39:04.960
it could be worth 100% more than it was at the time you gave it

39:04.960 --> 39:05.760
to them, possibly.

39:05.760 --> 39:06.800
Yeah, 100%.

39:06.800 --> 39:08.840
If Bitcoin continues to trend in the direction it has

39:08.840 --> 39:10.560
trended over the last decade.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.560
And so it's actually giving the podcaster

39:12.560 --> 39:15.240
not only a form of payment that allows

39:15.240 --> 39:17.840
them to bypass advertisers, but it's actually

39:17.840 --> 39:20.440
giving them something that may pay dividends down the road

39:20.440 --> 39:21.780
that they could reinvest in their business

39:21.780 --> 39:23.280
and keep the content creation going.

39:23.280 --> 39:27.840
And it's all done just by following some namespace

39:27.840 --> 39:30.720
standards and then the Bitcoin standard.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.480
I think it's a brilliant system.

39:32.480 --> 39:35.720
And one of the things you guys have done at the podcastindex.org

39:35.720 --> 39:38.360
website is you've highlighted some of the value

39:38.360 --> 39:40.800
for value podcasts there.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.760
And it seems like it's a range.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.640
How much activity are you actually seeing?

39:44.640 --> 39:46.120
Do you get any idea of that?

39:46.120 --> 39:52.640
So what we do is we take a 1% fee on anything

39:52.640 --> 39:54.680
that uses our API.

39:54.680 --> 39:58.080
And that way, we can gauge what's going on.

39:58.080 --> 40:01.880
But the technology itself, it's all just RSS.

40:01.880 --> 40:02.520
It's open source.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.640
So there's people out there doing this

40:04.640 --> 40:06.800
that don't involve us at all.

40:06.800 --> 40:09.440
So we can't really have visibility into that.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.760
But the stuff we do have visibility in,

40:11.760 --> 40:16.080
which is that if a podcast app uses us as their back end

40:16.080 --> 40:19.720
and we put that fee on there, that

40:19.720 --> 40:23.060
is something we can calculate.

40:23.060 --> 40:25.160
And the best we can come up with is

40:25.160 --> 40:29.080
there's about a million SATs a day flowing through the Podcast

40:29.080 --> 40:30.840
Lightning landscape.

40:30.840 --> 40:34.120
So I feel pretty comfortable with that number.

40:34.120 --> 40:35.640
That's also based on what we see.

40:35.640 --> 40:41.040
So you mentioned that people are sending small payments.

40:41.040 --> 40:45.840
And the per minute streaming stuff is small.

40:45.840 --> 40:49.000
But there's also this option called a boost.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.680
And so if you're listening, most of these podcasting 2.0 apps

40:52.680 --> 40:54.080
have a boost button.

40:54.080 --> 40:55.040
And so you hit the boost.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.080
And it says, hey, how many SATs do you want to send?

40:57.080 --> 40:59.520
And it gives you a place to type in a message.

40:59.520 --> 41:04.000
And so since the Lightning network can also have a payload,

41:04.000 --> 41:06.080
it can have arbitrary payloads with it,

41:06.080 --> 41:11.680
we include a JSON message format in there with it.

41:11.680 --> 41:12.880
This is all part of the spec.

41:12.880 --> 41:15.600
It's in the open source namespace docs.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.880
I can be listening to your show.

41:16.880 --> 41:20.040
I can be listening to code or radio.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.760
And I can send you a boost.

41:21.760 --> 41:26.000
And I can say, hey, guys, this episode was awesome.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.680
And you get those SATs, those Satoshis.

41:28.680 --> 41:31.400
And you also see my message and my name

41:31.400 --> 41:34.240
if I choose to show it to you in the sender.

41:34.240 --> 41:38.000
It's just like PayPal or Patreon or Buy Me a Coffee.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.040
But there's no middlemen.

41:40.040 --> 41:42.520
And also, even though the streaming

41:42.520 --> 41:47.120
SATs per minute are small, we've had boosts on our show.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.600
We had one a few weeks ago that was 500,000 SATs.

41:50.600 --> 41:52.960
That's like $250.

41:52.960 --> 41:56.200
This is not chump change, really.

41:56.200 --> 41:59.080
People can send large amounts of money, and it works.

41:59.080 --> 42:02.240
We've had a 500,000 SAT donation.

42:02.240 --> 42:06.240
We've had a 300,000, a 200,000, and a couple of 100,000s.

42:06.240 --> 42:10.440
I mean, it's legit money coming through the system.

42:10.440 --> 42:13.760
And like I said, this is all open spec.

42:13.760 --> 42:17.880
So you don't need us or the podcast index or any

42:17.880 --> 42:19.160
of this stuff to make all this work.

42:19.160 --> 42:21.000
You just stick this stuff in your feed,

42:21.000 --> 42:22.240
and you're off to the races.

42:22.240 --> 42:25.680
Yeah, and even if it's not, that's around with Bitcoin.

42:25.680 --> 42:26.720
I don't want any Bitcoin.

42:26.720 --> 42:29.080
It might not be for everybody, but it doesn't need to be.

42:29.080 --> 42:32.640
Because even with some adoption now,

42:32.640 --> 42:33.960
it'll continue to grow out.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.640
The feature set will get better.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.200
It'll get easier to use.

42:37.200 --> 42:38.640
It'll become more commonplace.

42:38.640 --> 42:41.960
And then if we got in a scenario where

42:41.960 --> 42:43.520
it was the best way to fund somebody,

42:43.520 --> 42:45.000
all of the plumbing has been done.

42:45.000 --> 42:46.680
So I think that's pretty interesting.

42:46.680 --> 42:48.880
I want to talk a little bit about the fundamentals.

42:48.880 --> 42:52.120
So there is some money coming in with maybe some

42:52.120 --> 42:55.440
of the transactions if they use the API, which I'm assuming

42:55.440 --> 42:57.800
goes into fund the infrastructure and all of that.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.440
So there must be a small business

42:59.440 --> 43:01.360
behind this for the tax and all the stuff

43:01.360 --> 43:03.360
you have to do for being a business, right?

43:03.360 --> 43:07.240
Yeah, we decided not to be a non-profit just

43:07.240 --> 43:10.280
because a lot of that stuff's kind of gross.

43:10.280 --> 43:11.520
And a lot of work, too.

43:11.520 --> 43:16.140
Yeah, the 501c3 landscape is just a dumpster fire.

43:16.140 --> 43:19.880
So we're like, hey, we need something to fund this,

43:19.880 --> 43:22.440
and we're going to have to have a business because we are all

43:22.440 --> 43:23.400
hosted at Linode.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.600
So we're like, we're going to have to pay bills

43:25.600 --> 43:26.480
and all this stuff.

43:26.480 --> 43:29.080
So we have an LLC between me and Adam

43:29.080 --> 43:32.920
and another guy who does our bookkeeping and backend stuff.

43:32.920 --> 43:37.840
Mostly, it's really just 20 servers running at Linode

43:37.840 --> 43:42.080
and a whole bunch of elbow grease and manpower

43:42.080 --> 43:45.760
over the last couple of years, year and a half or so

43:45.760 --> 43:46.800
to make it work.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.800
Oh, man, are you managing all those 20 boxes?

43:48.800 --> 43:49.520
Is that your job?

43:49.520 --> 43:50.000
Yeah.

43:50.000 --> 43:50.660
Wow.

43:50.660 --> 43:52.160
Is this a full-time thing for you?

43:52.160 --> 43:53.480
No, no, this is no.

43:53.480 --> 43:55.200
We don't make any money, really.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.640
We make just enough money in income

43:57.640 --> 44:02.800
right now to pay the hosting fees and pay our taxes.

44:02.800 --> 44:03.720
That's about it.

44:03.720 --> 44:04.360
Yeah.

44:04.360 --> 44:07.360
That was our goal for the Lightning stuff,

44:07.360 --> 44:09.360
for the Bitcoin stuff.

44:09.360 --> 44:13.600
The reason that 1% fee is there is so that we can hopefully

44:13.600 --> 44:16.800
fund the index in perpetuity without having

44:16.800 --> 44:19.720
to ever charge for API access and that kind of thing.

44:19.720 --> 44:21.000
That's really the goal.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.720
And as long as that happens, I'm happy because it's

44:24.720 --> 44:26.880
about bigger things than money.

44:26.880 --> 44:30.000
If the API docs are any indication

44:30.000 --> 44:31.560
of the actual quality of the API,

44:31.560 --> 44:33.000
it is probably worth some money.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.800
I mean, this is some impressive work

44:34.800 --> 44:36.320
just documenting all of this.

44:36.320 --> 44:38.320
This is some serious stuff that developers can use

44:38.320 --> 44:39.480
to actually build their app.

44:39.480 --> 44:41.600
That is part of the value for value model.

44:41.600 --> 44:44.320
The value for value model is not just about money.

44:44.320 --> 44:47.840
Adam always says it preacher style.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.720
He says time, talent, and treasure.

44:49.720 --> 44:51.560
And so it really is about that.

44:51.560 --> 44:55.360
So the documentation for the API, I wrote all the API,

44:55.360 --> 44:56.880
but then the documentation for it

44:56.880 --> 45:01.200
came from a guy named Stephen Crater in the Podcasting 2.0

45:01.200 --> 45:02.800
Mastodon group.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.400
And he just popped up and he's like, hey,

45:04.400 --> 45:05.560
I do this for a living.

45:05.560 --> 45:07.400
I'm really good with docs.

45:07.400 --> 45:08.440
I'll do it.

45:08.440 --> 45:10.400
And so he just jumped on the GitHub,

45:10.400 --> 45:12.480
did the documentation repo, put it all

45:12.480 --> 45:15.520
into a nice dynamic format.

45:15.520 --> 45:17.280
I never did any of that.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.800
He spent hours putting it all together.

45:19.800 --> 45:21.920
And that's all work that I didn't have to do.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.600
And man, that is every bit as valuable as money, every bit.

45:25.600 --> 45:27.640
That's an idea the open source community can

45:27.640 --> 45:28.960
wrap their heads around too, which

45:28.960 --> 45:31.340
is what I like so much about this really

45:31.340 --> 45:33.800
feels like the open source community's solution

45:33.800 --> 45:37.080
to solving the centralized podcasting problem.

45:37.080 --> 45:39.480
And man, am I just so happy to see you guys doing well.

45:39.480 --> 45:39.960
Thank you.

45:39.960 --> 45:41.680
I made sure this morning, I went through and looked like,

45:41.680 --> 45:43.100
OK, all of our shows are published.

45:43.100 --> 45:45.720
One, I think I hadn't submitted yet because I'm an idiot.

45:45.720 --> 45:47.600
So I made sure I got that submitted.

45:47.600 --> 45:48.960
And I could tell you guys are putting a lot of work

45:48.960 --> 45:52.320
into it because we just recently launched a network membership

45:52.320 --> 45:53.360
donation option.

45:53.360 --> 45:57.000
And there was a link for Linux Unplugged to go to that.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.920
Yeah, one thing I was looking at in your shows,

45:58.920 --> 46:01.280
and this is a reference to the namespace,

46:01.280 --> 46:05.440
is one of our namespace tags is the alternate enclosure tag.

46:05.440 --> 46:07.800
And that's a fairly new tag.

46:07.800 --> 46:08.840
We do this in phases.

46:08.840 --> 46:11.440
So the namespace, we take submissions

46:11.440 --> 46:13.360
for tag suggestions.

46:13.360 --> 46:17.400
And then we hash it out for two or three months

46:17.400 --> 46:20.400
and then make some decisions and then finalize

46:20.400 --> 46:22.360
a portion of those proposals.

46:22.360 --> 46:24.040
And so we go through these phases.

46:24.040 --> 46:27.360
And the phase three namespace was the most recent one

46:27.360 --> 46:29.400
that was fully closed.

46:29.400 --> 46:32.520
And the alternate enclosure tag is

46:32.520 --> 46:37.240
a way to specify multiple enclosures in a single episode

46:37.240 --> 46:41.000
in a way that you can reference different delivery technologies

46:41.000 --> 46:42.160
and different formats.

46:42.160 --> 46:47.760
So if I had a podcast that had an Ogg Vorbis format,

46:47.760 --> 46:54.200
a video feed, an MP3 feed, and something else,

46:54.200 --> 46:57.120
you could, instead of having four separate RSS feeds

46:57.120 --> 46:59.800
for that, you can have one feed.

46:59.800 --> 47:01.240
And then for each episode, you just

47:01.240 --> 47:03.880
reference each different item.

47:03.880 --> 47:07.400
And so from an app's perspective, the app can see,

47:07.400 --> 47:11.960
OK, this thing has four separate possible enclosures in it.

47:11.960 --> 47:15.400
And oh, the listener wants to see the video.

47:15.400 --> 47:17.040
OK, well, I'll switch video on.

47:17.040 --> 47:19.120
Oh, now they want low bandwidth because they're

47:19.120 --> 47:20.840
going through a congestion area.

47:20.840 --> 47:23.640
OK, I'll switch over to the Ogg format.

47:23.640 --> 47:27.680
And it allows it to do intelligent auto changing

47:27.680 --> 47:30.680
to the listeners what their listener wants without having

47:30.680 --> 47:33.200
to have literally four separate feeds

47:33.200 --> 47:35.200
and publish all those separate feeds

47:35.200 --> 47:37.240
and have the listener keep track of them all.

47:37.240 --> 47:39.560
That's one example of what we're doing

47:39.560 --> 47:42.440
that applies to even something like you because I noticed you

47:42.440 --> 47:44.560
had a lot of different format feeds.

47:44.560 --> 47:46.560
Yeah, a lot of legacy feeds, too.

47:46.560 --> 47:48.920
So you must also then have to be reaching out

47:48.920 --> 47:51.200
to a lot of the podcast platforms

47:51.200 --> 47:54.080
because there's a few of them now, like Fireside,

47:54.080 --> 47:57.760
like the one we use, and try to get those different platforms

47:57.760 --> 48:00.720
to add support for these namespace features.

48:00.720 --> 48:02.880
Are y'all on Dan Benjamin's Fireside?

48:02.880 --> 48:03.480
Yeah.

48:03.480 --> 48:06.460
Yeah, Dan was an early adopter of the namespace.

48:06.460 --> 48:08.960
And he's got a few of those things in there.

48:08.960 --> 48:12.320
He's got, I think, chapters, person.

48:12.320 --> 48:14.520
Seasons, he has a good amount of them, yeah.

48:14.520 --> 48:16.560
Yeah, he's a friend of mine.

48:16.560 --> 48:20.360
And that's an example of the legwork that has to go.

48:20.360 --> 48:23.480
The technology part is only half the battle.

48:23.480 --> 48:25.140
You can write all the specs in the world,

48:25.140 --> 48:28.880
but then you have to go and evangelize them and let

48:28.880 --> 48:33.440
people know and then show them code, give them example code,

48:33.440 --> 48:35.360
talk to developers.

48:35.360 --> 48:38.360
And I think this is where a lot of open source projects

48:38.360 --> 48:44.480
fail, perhaps, is that they're so focused on the tech

48:44.480 --> 48:47.600
that they forget to do the evangelism part.

48:47.600 --> 48:51.160
And just build it and they will come is not true.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.160
That's not how this stuff works.

48:53.160 --> 48:56.720
You have to build it, and then you have to go to conferences.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.560
And then you have to talk to people.

48:58.560 --> 49:00.700
And you have to build relationships

49:00.700 --> 49:03.740
with podcasting hosts and app developers.

49:03.740 --> 49:04.600
It's a lot of work.

49:04.600 --> 49:09.000
But the tech and the writing code is really probably less

49:09.000 --> 49:12.840
than half of what it takes to get a successful project going.

49:12.840 --> 49:15.760
Well, I do appreciate you doing some of that legwork,

49:15.760 --> 49:17.400
because I look at this and I think,

49:17.400 --> 49:20.680
I can't get apps and platforms to adopt this stuff

49:20.680 --> 49:21.280
fast enough.

49:21.280 --> 49:24.720
And I know that Apple and Spotify and probably Google

49:24.720 --> 49:28.200
and YouTube, they're going to be the last to adopt

49:28.200 --> 49:29.920
some of this stuff, I would think.

49:29.920 --> 49:34.240
But the nice thing about our audience is they're technical.

49:34.240 --> 49:36.840
They can go find an app that does support this stuff.

49:36.840 --> 49:38.880
Do you have a favorite podcast app right now that

49:38.880 --> 49:40.200
supports some of these features?

49:40.200 --> 49:40.800
I use them all.

49:40.800 --> 49:42.000
I literally do use them all.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.600
I've got 10 podcast apps on my phone,

49:44.600 --> 49:48.320
because every time one of the developers in our group

49:48.320 --> 49:51.320
comes up with a new app or something new,

49:51.320 --> 49:55.400
I listen to podcasts in probably four different apps a day.

49:55.400 --> 49:56.980
I like them all for different reasons.

49:56.980 --> 49:59.000
They all have different feature sets.

49:59.000 --> 50:02.920
And one thing about that whole idea of,

50:02.920 --> 50:06.840
and we hear this a lot is, well, unless Apple and Spotify

50:06.840 --> 50:10.400
support it, we're not going to spend any time developing it.

50:10.400 --> 50:11.480
You hear that a lot.

50:11.480 --> 50:14.080
But what we have to remind people,

50:14.080 --> 50:16.040
and we've been successful with reminding people

50:16.040 --> 50:18.120
about this in the podcasting world,

50:18.120 --> 50:23.280
is that that is just simply giving your power away

50:23.280 --> 50:24.520
willingly.

50:24.520 --> 50:29.200
The independent podcast ecosystem collectively

50:29.200 --> 50:32.160
is much bigger than those platforms.

50:32.160 --> 50:35.920
Even if those platforms represent 50% of the market

50:35.920 --> 50:39.960
or 40% of the market, you've got 50% to 60%

50:39.960 --> 50:44.000
of the decentralized podcast market over here

50:44.000 --> 50:45.440
on the other side.

50:45.440 --> 50:48.760
And we can move and innovate much faster than those guys

50:48.760 --> 50:49.360
can.

50:49.360 --> 50:51.600
Look at the podcast namespace, really.

50:51.600 --> 50:58.040
In the last year, we have formalized 15 new feature tags

50:58.040 --> 51:00.240
within RSS.

51:00.240 --> 51:03.080
And in that same time frame, Spotify

51:03.080 --> 51:05.560
has given us what exactly?

51:05.560 --> 51:07.280
More dynamic ads?

51:07.280 --> 51:10.280
Yeah, more streaming ad insertion.

51:10.280 --> 51:11.880
That's what I'm saying.

51:11.880 --> 51:15.200
We went into this thinking, OK, the siloed companies,

51:15.200 --> 51:17.440
the walled gardens, they're going to move super fast.

51:17.440 --> 51:18.940
And they're going to innovate quick.

51:18.940 --> 51:21.440
And we have to innovate fast enough to keep track,

51:21.440 --> 51:24.240
to keep pace with them, keep feature parity.

51:24.240 --> 51:25.720
And what we find out really quickly

51:25.720 --> 51:27.840
was that's actually not true.

51:27.840 --> 51:31.880
We pass them with the foot down to the floorboard.

51:31.880 --> 51:36.400
I mean, they move so slow because everything they do

51:36.400 --> 51:40.360
is about shareholder returns and money.

51:40.360 --> 51:44.240
And they cannot innovate as fast as a group

51:44.240 --> 51:48.120
of dedicated open source community members can.

51:48.120 --> 51:49.840
They're good coders.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.480
We can beat them all day long.

51:51.480 --> 51:52.520
And we have.

51:52.520 --> 51:56.600
And so the typical Podcasting 2.0 app,

51:56.600 --> 51:57.960
and there's a big list of them.

51:57.960 --> 52:01.080
If you go to podcastindex.org slash apps,

52:01.080 --> 52:03.800
there's a big list of all of them.

52:03.800 --> 52:08.200
A Podcasting 2.0 app blows Spotify out of the water

52:08.200 --> 52:10.360
with the feature set that it has.

52:10.360 --> 52:12.440
And that's all just community built.

52:12.440 --> 52:15.000
And most of those apps are not profitable.

52:15.000 --> 52:18.720
They're not apps that are where the developer is

52:18.720 --> 52:20.360
making a living doing it.

52:20.360 --> 52:22.760
They're apps that are just passion projects.

52:22.760 --> 52:26.480
And Cast-O-Matic is a perfect example.

52:26.480 --> 52:28.480
It's a really great iOS app.

52:28.480 --> 52:32.520
And the developer of that app is a physician in Italy.

52:32.520 --> 52:34.760
His day job is as a doctor.

52:34.760 --> 52:37.200
And he just works on this thing part time.

52:37.200 --> 52:41.440
And it is a high quality, feature rich app.

52:41.440 --> 52:44.640
And Spotify, last I checked, they don't even have chapters.

52:44.640 --> 52:46.160
I know.

52:46.160 --> 52:47.240
That's what I'm saying.

52:47.240 --> 52:50.840
I mean, it shows this project more than anything else

52:50.840 --> 52:53.000
I've ever been involved in, shows

52:53.000 --> 52:57.160
the power of a nimble, talented, open source community.

52:57.160 --> 52:59.880
Yeah, it couldn't be coming along at a better time either.

52:59.880 --> 53:01.440
So Dave, thank you for your work.

53:01.440 --> 53:03.720
Thank you to the pod father and your whole team over there.

53:03.720 --> 53:04.960
I know it's not a big team.

53:04.960 --> 53:07.520
So sending a lot of good vibes your guys' way,

53:07.520 --> 53:08.880
because I hope it grows, actually.

53:08.880 --> 53:11.600
I hope this becomes a thing and really takes off.

53:11.600 --> 53:13.880
And I hope to see more and more apps and platforms support it

53:13.880 --> 53:14.520
too.

53:14.520 --> 53:17.040
Stay in touch, because I'm on board, man.

53:17.040 --> 53:20.880
Actually, I want to know how to become a Podcast Index

53:20.880 --> 53:22.200
premier network.

53:22.200 --> 53:23.360
Like, how do I go all in?

53:23.360 --> 53:25.200
So maybe we'll chat more.

53:25.200 --> 53:27.720
You get the badge, the Podcasting 2.0 Certified Badge,

53:27.720 --> 53:27.920
man.

53:27.920 --> 53:28.840
We've even got one.

53:28.840 --> 53:29.720
There you go.

53:29.720 --> 53:30.520
OK.

53:30.520 --> 53:31.480
Thanks, Dave.

53:31.480 --> 53:34.320
Thanks, Chris.

53:34.320 --> 53:37.360
Just a real quick housekeeping, because we're getting long.

53:37.360 --> 53:39.360
We're going long, but I just really

53:39.360 --> 53:41.320
enjoyed that chat with Dave.

53:41.320 --> 53:42.520
There's a lot to it.

53:42.520 --> 53:43.920
So we'll do a little follow up.

53:43.920 --> 53:46.160
But first, I wanted to mention we're

53:46.160 --> 53:49.500
doing one last run of the Rando swag bags.

53:49.500 --> 53:52.040
They've got the journal option and the non-journal option.

53:52.040 --> 53:53.920
We're just going to do it for a little bit longer.

53:53.920 --> 53:55.720
So that's at jupitergarage.com.

53:55.720 --> 53:57.480
Also, thank you to our members.

53:57.480 --> 54:00.320
This is right here, a single sponsor episode.

54:00.320 --> 54:04.240
So the members are really what's keeping the show going,

54:04.240 --> 54:06.040
keeping the production going, all of that.

54:06.040 --> 54:08.360
Our community information, like our matrix, our telegram,

54:08.360 --> 54:12.800
our contact information, all of that is at linuxhomeplug.com.

54:12.800 --> 54:14.840
And last but not least, come join us on a Sunday.

54:14.840 --> 54:17.080
Now, the show is moved over to Sundays.

54:17.080 --> 54:20.640
We fire up the stream around noon 30 Pacific time

54:20.640 --> 54:24.280
over at jblive.tv.

54:24.280 --> 54:27.200
All right, so I'm opening it up now to the virtual lug

54:27.200 --> 54:28.600
as we chat about this.

54:28.600 --> 54:32.160
In the show notes today, I'll have some links

54:32.160 --> 54:35.320
to the podcast index, including those new podcasting apps

54:35.320 --> 54:38.120
that Dave was chatting about.

54:38.120 --> 54:39.800
But you know, I was talking to him.

54:39.800 --> 54:41.880
What just kept looping in the back of my mind

54:41.880 --> 54:43.880
is like, this has got to be a way where

54:43.880 --> 54:45.920
we can help free software developers monetize

54:45.920 --> 54:47.320
some of their work.

54:47.320 --> 54:50.240
This Lightning Network solution seems like a great way

54:50.240 --> 54:52.880
to solve one of free software's most common problems.

54:52.880 --> 54:55.400
I mean, we just saw it with the log for J vulnerability.

54:55.400 --> 54:57.680
A couple of developers working for over a decade

54:57.680 --> 54:59.120
never made a dime on something that

54:59.120 --> 55:01.280
propped up tons of industry.

55:01.280 --> 55:05.320
It just happened with basically every major vulnerability

55:05.320 --> 55:07.640
we heard about last year.

55:07.640 --> 55:09.880
It all came down to, oh, yeah, a couple of developers

55:09.880 --> 55:11.120
and they never made a buck.

55:11.120 --> 55:12.840
Like, it seems like maybe it was something

55:12.840 --> 55:15.240
like the Lightning Network where you could send a Satoshi

55:15.240 --> 55:16.760
can be less than a penny.

55:16.760 --> 55:19.160
I mean, these things, I have a link in the show notes.

55:19.160 --> 55:21.080
If you've never heard this term Sat or Satoshi,

55:21.080 --> 55:22.960
and you're like, what, 1,000 Sat's?

55:22.960 --> 55:24.440
That sounds like a lot.

55:24.440 --> 55:26.200
It's not.

55:26.200 --> 55:28.280
I think it's something like you can divide a Bitcoin

55:28.280 --> 55:30.840
100 million times down, and that's what a Satoshi is.

55:30.840 --> 55:33.840
And so you're talking you could send $0.25,

55:33.840 --> 55:36.840
but if maybe log for J has 10,000 people,

55:36.840 --> 55:39.880
send them $0.25, all of a sudden, that matters.

55:39.880 --> 55:43.400
What was really interesting to me in the podcasting iteration

55:43.400 --> 55:47.680
of this was that like ticking counter of getting Satoshis

55:47.680 --> 55:50.080
in as you're listening, and I think there's really

55:50.080 --> 55:51.360
something to that.

55:51.360 --> 55:54.200
I don't know how it translates to open source software

55:54.200 --> 55:55.160
projects.

55:55.160 --> 55:57.680
We did, I think, touch on this slightly last week.

55:57.680 --> 56:00.320
Yeah, it's something that's been coming up more and more,

56:00.320 --> 56:03.160
I think, because of log for J. It's just been on our minds.

56:03.160 --> 56:05.280
Well, I think it's been on our minds for years,

56:05.280 --> 56:08.520
but we've never really had a true potential solution for it.

56:08.520 --> 56:12.320
And what seems unique here is, so the Lightning Network,

56:12.320 --> 56:15.600
the white paper was published in February of 2015,

56:15.600 --> 56:19.840
but adoption has been slow until really about this year,

56:19.840 --> 56:22.440
in combination because Jack Dorsey started upping it

56:22.440 --> 56:25.640
on Twitter and with his new company,

56:25.640 --> 56:29.960
but also because El Salvador did like a pilot, Bitcoin pilot,

56:29.960 --> 56:31.960
and the Lightning Network worked so well for them

56:31.960 --> 56:35.880
that they've now adopted Bitcoin as a currency in El Salvador.

56:35.880 --> 56:38.760
That really put a big focus on the Lightning Network,

56:38.760 --> 56:41.240
and it's really kind of exploded.

56:41.240 --> 56:43.200
And it's all open source code.

56:43.200 --> 56:44.200
It's all free software.

56:44.200 --> 56:48.120
So you've kind of got this decentralized network that's

56:48.120 --> 56:52.760
been built out that allows for super efficient, quick, stupid

56:52.760 --> 56:56.840
cheap payments, and the entire stack is free software.

56:56.840 --> 56:59.960
And it's all auditable because it's on a public ledger.

56:59.960 --> 57:03.440
So you can contribute to a free software project,

57:03.440 --> 57:06.760
and anyone in the world that has access to the internet

57:06.760 --> 57:08.360
can audit that.

57:08.360 --> 57:10.960
This sounds almost like exactly what we've

57:10.960 --> 57:12.560
been hoping for for a long time.

57:12.560 --> 57:14.520
It's like so many different ideals

57:14.520 --> 57:17.520
that I've had festering in my own little brain

57:17.520 --> 57:18.560
all coming together.

57:18.560 --> 57:21.720
And I've got to say, you've been really mentoring me

57:21.720 --> 57:24.560
in some of these concepts this last week or two

57:24.560 --> 57:25.720
since I've been at the studio.

57:25.720 --> 57:28.520
And gosh, am I ever excited about it.

57:28.520 --> 57:35.000
I've got to say, I didn't quite do a dive into it previously,

57:35.000 --> 57:38.200
but I think this podcasting index might be a really nice way

57:38.200 --> 57:40.680
for many of us to just get our feet wet a little bit

57:40.680 --> 57:42.520
and start to get interested in the concepts

57:42.520 --> 57:45.880
and dive a little bit more into how even blockchains could

57:45.880 --> 57:47.720
solve real problems.

57:47.720 --> 57:48.640
Without the hype, right?

57:48.640 --> 57:51.680
Without all of the, it's going to take over the world

57:51.680 --> 57:53.000
and be a new web, right?

57:53.000 --> 57:55.800
It's just like, well, this is a thing that works practically.

57:55.800 --> 57:58.200
And if you apply it in the right application,

57:58.200 --> 58:00.640
just like every other technology we talk about on the show,

58:00.640 --> 58:03.680
like ButterFS, like containers, it's like, yeah,

58:03.680 --> 58:08.000
there's absolutely a use case for that in some workloads.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.400
The Podping software they talk about,

58:10.400 --> 58:13.200
that's using the Hive blockchain, which is essentially

58:13.200 --> 58:16.000
just a decentralized JSON message bus.

58:16.000 --> 58:19.940
It's like D-Bus for the internet, simpler, obviously.

58:19.940 --> 58:23.120
And so the idea is that the podcast client just

58:23.120 --> 58:24.560
checks that Hive blockchain, which

58:24.560 --> 58:28.920
is a super low energy efficient blockchain that

58:28.920 --> 58:33.800
solves the idea of, how do you create a consumable message

58:33.800 --> 58:35.380
bus for the internet?

58:35.380 --> 58:37.080
What really struck me in that conversation

58:37.080 --> 58:40.580
or that bit of the conversation was the efficiency of it.

58:40.580 --> 58:42.280
So it seems like, OK, we're doing things

58:42.280 --> 58:44.080
a certain way with the internet right now,

58:44.080 --> 58:46.480
and then querying servers over and over and over

58:46.480 --> 58:48.800
to see if there's a new podcast episode.

58:48.800 --> 58:51.360
It seems like if we can make the internet much more efficient,

58:51.360 --> 58:53.640
it does tackle some of these things

58:53.640 --> 58:56.480
that we've been worried about, like energy usage of the internet

58:56.480 --> 58:58.320
as a whole or some of these cryptocurrencies,

58:58.320 --> 58:59.080
et cetera, et cetera.

58:59.080 --> 58:59.840
Yeah.

58:59.840 --> 59:01.000
Boy, we could make a whole episode out

59:01.000 --> 59:02.280
of the energy usage thing.

59:02.280 --> 59:03.920
So what I'll do is I'll put a link

59:03.920 --> 59:07.840
to the University of Cambridge's Bitcoin Electricity Consumption

59:07.840 --> 59:08.400
Index.

59:08.400 --> 59:12.800
It's a real time index that they update of Bitcoin's power usage

59:12.800 --> 59:16.560
and gives it to you in perspective of household

59:16.560 --> 59:18.760
consumption and industry consumption.

59:18.760 --> 59:20.840
And they try to track all of the different metrics,

59:20.840 --> 59:23.320
including where the mining is happening and all of that.

59:23.320 --> 59:26.760
So you kind of have an idea of what types of power sources

59:26.760 --> 59:28.160
are powering that mining.

59:28.160 --> 59:30.600
And it's probably not perfect, guys,

59:30.600 --> 59:34.680
because it's a decentralized, anonymized network.

59:34.680 --> 59:36.960
It's pretty hard to get really good numbers.

59:36.960 --> 59:38.800
But Cambridge is doing their best.

59:38.800 --> 59:42.200
And I think when we throw around terms like planet incinerating,

59:42.200 --> 59:45.560
we should probably try to put it in perspective of things

59:45.560 --> 59:47.000
like machine learning.

59:47.000 --> 59:49.440
How much electricity does machine learning take?

59:49.440 --> 59:52.160
How much electricity does Twitch video game streaming,

59:52.160 --> 59:54.800
the entire Twitch network of everybody ramping up their GPUs

59:54.800 --> 59:57.880
and streaming it to everybody whose GPUs are decoding it,

59:57.880 --> 59:59.920
how much energy use does that take?

59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.880
And does a decentralized, open source currency

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.840
built for the internet with no borders so anyone in the world

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.720
can send money to anyone else in the world that's totally

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.400
backed by cryptography, what is the value of that?

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.920
What is the value of sound money?

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:16.280
So I have a link in the show notes

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:18.160
because I think when we're talking about energy

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.160
use of these different blockchain technologies,

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.520
and there are several kinds.

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.240
Bitcoin is a proof of work.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.200
But there are many proof of stake, which use much less

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.960
or maybe very little energy usage, depending.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.280
So all of that's in there.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.780
It's worth taking a look at just to have that conversation

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:39.080
with people because I think it's an important conversation.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.480
And so actually having the data and keeping in mind

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.080
there's a lot of things in technology

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.080
we do that use quite a bit of power.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.680
Right now, we're recording a podcast,

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.000
and the CPUs are burning on all these machines in here.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.560
How many computers are just near us right now?

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:52.280
Right.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.560
We don't really think about it.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.920
Or how much power would it take if you bought a Tesla

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.480
and you started charging it every night?

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.560
And how much power does it take if your significant other also

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.120
has an electric car and you're charging both of those

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:01.800
every night?

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.800
Is that worth it?

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.880
How much power does it take to use Google Photos?

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:05.400
Sure.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.840
And in the case of Bitcoin, there's

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:14.320
the economics that make mining actually more profitable

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:15.840
the cheaper your energy access is.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.760
So I think it's all changing, too.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:23.000
Like what we consider today as energy use and how it's used

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.680
could be completely different in five years

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.360
as the economics of Bitcoin mining

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.520
drive people to use renewables.

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.000
That, I think, is a conversation for a different show.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.400
But it all can be practical implementations.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.600
It doesn't have to be hype.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.640
It doesn't have to be this huge overthrow

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:41.480
the system kind of technology.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.440
It's not an all-some game here, because you

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.320
can see with the podcast index, they're

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.640
using these things in a very rational, very unique way.

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:52.080
And I took from that chat with Dave

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.560
that I think the free software community needs

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.360
to rethink some of this stuff.

01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:59.240
Like the way we reacted to Mozilla, does that make sense?

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.760
Because what we're really talking about

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:03.000
is the alternative is something that's

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.960
controlled by banks that are not necessarily

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.920
accessible to everyone who wants to participate

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:08.880
in free software.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.840
Kind of the status quo.

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:11.400
And that's not very exciting, is it?

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:11.640
Right.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.360
When we're in the West, this is something

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.680
that's hard to really keep in mind,

01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.240
but in the Western countries, we've

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:21.720
had a good, stable, reliable state currency for a long time.

01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.920
But that is not true for everywhere else in the world.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:28.880
And they also don't necessarily get access

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:31.960
to our banking system because of the volatility

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.840
of their country's economy.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:37.000
And so they're really cut off in a lot of major ways.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.560
And they want to participate too, right?

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:43.480
And they should be able to get paid as well for their work.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:45.440
They deserve that.

01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.640
When we're talking about these things,

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.560
and we're talking about their energy usage,

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.140
and what their practical use could be,

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:54.320
and how they don't do anything new, I know it sounds funny.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.480
And I don't love saying it.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.840
But we have to consider we may be

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.840
sitting from a position of privilege

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.400
if we live in a Western country where we've never really had

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.880
to worry about these things yet.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:06.840
And I think free software could benefit from this technology.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.320
It's weird because the free software community

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.840
sort of feels like it's just kind of become about cloud

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.940
and Linux and not about all the other free software that's

01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:17.160
out there.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.440
That other people are like, we are shunning some technology now

01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:24.480
and declaring other technologies allowed.

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.840
And we're doing it by Twitter outrage.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.300
Like what just happened with Mozilla.

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.320
Mozilla reminded people they accept Bitcoin and Doge.

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.640
And the community freaked out.

01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.280
Original contributors to Mozilla and Gecko

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.120
lit them on fire for incinerating the planet.

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.040
And all of those people are sitting

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:45.320
from a position of wealth and privilege.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.040
But they don't even see it.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.800
And I think when we talk about the energy consumption,

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.840
we have to consider that for some people,

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:52.360
they don't have sound money.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.040
And we might not always have sound money.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.080
Things can change.

01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:56.840
Disasters can happen.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.520
History can be made.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:01.560
And you can also see the practical content

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.080
creators getting paid is going to lead to better content.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.880
It's going to lead to more accurate content

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.680
when it's funded by the audience.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.160
That serves everyone that produces the show

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.620
and that listens to the show.

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:18.000
It takes it away from like Spotify or Squarespace.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.680
And it puts it directly between the audience and the creator

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:27.360
with no one in between, no PayPal, no Patreon, no 5%,

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.360
10% GRIFT.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:33.460
And it's all on a free software system from top to bottom,

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:35.480
from the software you can receive the currency

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.440
and to send to the network.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.320
And it's available to anyone in the world.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.960
Doesn't matter what political party, what country line.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.640
If you can get access to the Tor network,

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:46.480
if you can get access to a VPN, if you can get IP routing,

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.840
you can get paid.

01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:50.200
Then I know we've all heard the stories about the protesters

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:53.960
in China who got shut out of the banking system just recently.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:57.520
And then they use the lightning network to raise funds.

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:01.480
And they funded their anti-government protests

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.180
with Bitcoin after being shut out

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:06.720
by the Chinese financial system, even with China's control

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:08.000
over the internet.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
And there's 100 stories of that every day.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.320
And then you see this technology,

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:13.160
how it could help something like the podcast

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.920
landscape, which could even be applied to a video platform.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.720
You could take all of the concepts they have

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:21.160
with the podcast index and the monetizing and the namespace

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.120
for the RSS feed, and you could build an amazing PeerTube

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.520
community around that.

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.880
And because it's open source and it's an open spec

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:30.980
and they have amazing documentation and tons

01:05:30.980 --> 01:05:33.240
of sample code and open source apps that have already

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:36.560
implemented this, it's all there for us to take it.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.320
But I think our own prejudice about a technology

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.800
that we don't understand is preventing us as a community

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:45.000
from adopting this.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.400
And I said it on the live stream,

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.200
and I'll say it in the show, this

01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.800
is a result of a failure of leadership

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.800
by the Free Software Foundation.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.960
They should be pioneering a open source free software payment

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:58.440
system to fund free software development.

01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.360
But they're old, and they're out of touch,

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.520
and they're too busy licking their own wounds.

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.640
And there's no other leadership in the community

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.760
that thinks Foundation essentially

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.920
is the centralization of everything else.

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:10.920
And they don't have any reason to change this.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.560
They like the way the payment system works.

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:13.880
They hire the developers they want.

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.000
They get paid to write the code they need.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
It's a great system for them.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.520
Oh, somebody got left out?

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:21.160
We'll create a brand new foundation.

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.720
We'll make sure everything's taken care of for them.

01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.840
Problem solved.

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.480
Problem solved.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.480
No other problems out there.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:25.960
We did it.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.760
We fixed it, everybody.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:27.320
Didn't we do good?

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:27.920
Look at our report.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.600
Look at this PDF.

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.040
Look how good we did.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.880
That's the alternative.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:34.840
Because no one is in our community in a position

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.760
of leadership championing these ideas,

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.680
typical human prejudice have prevented us

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.280
from adopting this.

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.960
And so things like log4j will just

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.280
keep happening over and over and over again.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.240
And in part, it's our own fault, because free software

01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.920
has become about Linux and the cloud,

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.040
and not everything else out there.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.440
And when you shut down new things

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.960
because somebody's grifting with an NFT,

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:58.360
you're participating in the same kind of thought

01:06:58.360 --> 01:07:03.280
process and suppression that led to Linux FUD.

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.960
It's just a new generation of FUD.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.840
So I hope things like the podcast index

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.440
get adopted by at least parts of this, right?

01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.720
Some of it's podcast specific.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.960
I acknowledge that.

01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:15.800
But wouldn't it be great if some parts got

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.040
adopted by a project that we all know and love,

01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:22.440
and we could help those developers live a comfortable

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:25.200
life just doing free software full time?

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.760
You caught it there in the interview, Brent.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:31.440
Dave Jones is helping build this entire decentralized podcast

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:34.760
index, which is the only alternative to Apple, Spotify,

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.840
and YouTube, and Google.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:39.560
The only thing out there that's legitimate and large enough

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:42.640
and has any adoption and has apps that are supporting it,

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:44.440
and he's doing it as a part-time job.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.640
And the funds coming in are only paying for their taxes

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:49.480
and their 20 Linux, and that's it.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.920
And podcasting is an entire industry now.

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.400
And we're just doing it over.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.240
We're doing it to free software developers.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.800
It's happening to the podcast ecosystem.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.520
It's because these ginormous rich organizations

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:06.800
or foundations can distort reality

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.600
and make everyone expect to get everything for free.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:11.720
And when it's not easy and when it's something new,

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.360
that's gross.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:14.440
What do you mean they don't accept PayPal?

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.800
What do you mean they don't?

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.640
No, I'm not doing that.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:20.200
Until it's inevitable, and it's been rolled out everywhere,

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:21.600
and then everybody will just pretend

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:22.720
like it was obvious all along.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:25.600
And nobody will own the fact that they were essentially

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.000
blocking the adoption.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.400
So that's the end of my rant.

01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.280
But I thought it was a really thought-provoking conversation

01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:30.600
with Dave.

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:32.480
So thank you to Dave and all the work that's

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:34.280
happening over at the Podcast Index.

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.680
Whew.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.960
You know what we'll do is we'll put a couple of links

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:39.080
in the show notes.

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:43.080
I tried out Fountain, and I just got another one, too.

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.400
I just downloaded Cast-O-Matic, but I haven't tried it yet.

01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:48.320
But I tried out Fountain, which is available for iOS

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.240
and for the Android.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:53.200
And it took me, I don't know, like a half hour

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.280
to get my sign-up email.

01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:55.640
I don't know what that's about.

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.600
But once I'm in, it's great, man.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.360
I really like it.

01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.520
So you can import from Spotify, which is interesting.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.200
Oh, that's nice.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.040
Yeah, this is Fountain.

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.120
So if you just want to get off Spotify and try something else,

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:05.880
you don't have to give it up.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.760
You could try it, and it'll import it.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.720
But it'll also import from Apple Podcasts on iOS,

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:13.360
and it'll search the podcast directory.

01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.160
So I toyed around with the lightning support.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.440
I think I have it turned on.

01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.840
I have so much to learn about the lightning network stuff

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:20.760
still.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.320
But I love the idea.

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:26.560
And I feel like I want to try to validate it here somehow

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.200
once I figure it all out.

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.280
And then I want to become an advocate

01:09:30.280 --> 01:09:32.400
to monetize free software development with it.

01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.360
And I don't mean like monetize in a bad way.

01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.920
I mean make it possible for these developers

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.120
not to live on the edge of burnout.

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.200
And OK, OK, I'm sorry.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.140
I'm going to just one last point.

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:43.300
I'm so sorry, you guys.

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:47.080
But Brent can attest, this has been eating me alive, hasn't it?

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.220
Only for about a week.

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.640
I want to give Colonel a chance to jump in.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:51.680
Colonel, you had a few thoughts on the lightning network.

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.920
This is like an area I'm pretty new on.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.440
So I'd love any insights you have.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:54.920
Right.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.120
So it was actually less of the lightning network,

01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:01.340
but almost adapting what they're doing for the podcasts

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:05.240
into funding some of these core technologies that

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.160
are being developed by people in their spare time.

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:13.520
So maybe instead of having a paper while you're listening,

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.920
maybe it's every time somebody does a poll

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:20.520
against that repository, they can send a few Satoshis.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.200
Or something like that.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:25.840
So again, it's value for value, but it's based

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:29.160
upon people using that software.

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:31.360
There's so many ways you could do this, really.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.960
It could be as dumb as a GNOME extension

01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:36.380
that you put the name of a process

01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:38.480
in and say, every time I'm running this process,

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.540
send five Satoshis to a free software developer.

01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.180
It could be as simple as that.

01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:46.320
It could be something like the popularity packages in Debian

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.780
that look at what you have installed

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:49.320
and what you use most often.

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.900
It could give you an output, and then you could have a choice.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:54.440
Maybe it's a little GTK app, and you click a few buttons,

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.760
and you send it off.

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.840
And of course, it's written in Rust.

01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.720
They're all written in Rust, right?

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.360
Don't you think?

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.360
It almost has to be, I guess.

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:06.160
All right, we'll just leave it at this.

01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.840
I could really go on and on about it.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.960
Just what really gets me is I talk

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:13.720
to so many of these developers as part of doing the show,

01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:18.160
and so many of them are really on the edge of burnout.

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:21.680
They exist the entire time they're doing this.

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.680
Anytime anything gets any kind of traction

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.140
in this state of perpetual burnout

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:29.500
and tied by obligations between family and work

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.400
and their community and free software.

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.880
And it can be a really strong pull.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.400
And it, A, is a fragile dynamic,

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:44.440
and B, it makes a person old, and they can't do it forever.

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.600
And when you have to juggle feeding your family

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:50.680
and paying your bills and also fulfilling your commitments

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.040
to the free software community,

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.680
it can be really, really difficult.

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:59.680
And a lot of these developers are just one nasty comment

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:04.800
or divorce or marriage or car accident away

01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.760
from abandoning their project.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:14.760
And the ability to solve this in a super efficient way

01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:17.440
that uses free software through and through

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:21.760
with no middleman has existed since 2015.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.520
But bigotry and, honestly, misinformation

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.880
and uninformed opinion about potential

01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:32.000
planet-incinerating power use has led to a block of adoption.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.480
And that's why I get so worked up about this,

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.480
because some of the things that we use on a daily basis

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:40.080
are just on the precipice of going away

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.280
because they can't figure out a way to make money

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.000
and balance their life.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.080
So that's why it just, that's why it matters a lot to me.

01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:52.080
But I feel optimistic that this stuff lays the groundwork

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:54.840
for us to solve the problem.

01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:58.160
The technology is there, it's sound, it's safe,

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:02.160
and it's being used by millions of people on a daily basis,

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.960
some of which are just using it to buy bread

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:08.520
in a market somewhere, and some of which people

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.400
are using it to fund content creators

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.600
or invoicing for a banana.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.840
I mean, it's a huge range, and it is happening.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:20.520
It just is gonna require a mindset change and adoption.

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:24.840
And looking past things like ape NFTs that are silly,

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.960
it's just gonna take a little time.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.680
But I hope that maybe we're taking the first step

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.720
with this episode, because I think it can make

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.000
a big difference, and it's something I'd love

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.960
to know more about, I'm still learning.

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:36.040
So let us know what you think at linuxunplugged.com

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.120
slash contact.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.560
Don't forget, we do have that Luplug.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:41.000
We're getting together on Sundays and Tuesdays now

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.720
at noon Pacific.

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:44.560
And don't miss Linux Action News.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.040
Now at a new prime time for the news,

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.640
busting it out towards the end of the week

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.560
with all the stuff that happened

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.480
with Wes Payne and myself.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.960
Brent, thanks for sitting in Wes's seat.

01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:56.120
Oh yeah, he's got some nice butt grooves in this thing.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:56.960
It's real nice.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:57.800
I know it.

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.720
He's worked it, you know?

01:13:58.720 --> 01:13:59.560
He works it.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.840
Every time he sits there, you can just see him.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:01.680
You can tell because he sits there

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.280
and he bites his lip while he does it.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.240
So you know he's working it.

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.440
That's how you know.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.120
Links to a lot of what we talked about today

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:10.960
at linuxunplugged.com slash four four zero.

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.280
We'd love to have you go through there, peruse it,

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:16.640
learn a little something today,

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:19.240
including that power usage from Cambridge

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.080
and more information like podcast index

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.520
and some great apps.

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:26.960
And you can actually use the podcastindex.org itself

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.320
as a podcast player.

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.160
That's interesting.

01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:30.200
Yeah, they got a player just built right in.

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:31.040
Of course they do.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:32.480
If you want a web player, that's pretty awesome.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:33.680
And we have, I think,

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.040
I think we have the Lightning Network set up

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:35.880
for Linux Unplugged now.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.280
It's a bit of an experiment.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:39.480
Test the waters, if you will.

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.080
Thanks so much for joining us on this week's episode

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.440
of the Unplugged program.

01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.640
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:15:03.640
This is Unplugged, and we'll see you next week.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:23.920
All right, we need a title.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:24.920
We gotta title this thing.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.080
We gotta get it out there,

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.560
let people know about the good things

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.840
coming to the world of podcasting.

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.600
So everybody head on over to jbtitles.com.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.600
JBtitles.com.

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.080
And get your boat in.

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.800
Come on now, y'all.

01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:38.960
Come on in.

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:41.720
Did we get any ideas in the chat room for our new toy?

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.240
I didn't see any scroll by.

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.400
So for those of you who joined us

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.080
a little bit into the show,

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.760
we got a little piece of hardware

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:51.400
that came into the studio that we assembled ourselves

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.160
called the Clockwork Pi.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.600
And we talked about it in the pre-show,

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.840
so I figured we'd end with the post-show with it

01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.040
with a little bit of info.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:00.520
So like Brent said, it has Armbian.

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.600
The display is running at 480 by 1280.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.800
So it's a real wide and narrow display.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:06.960
Which I think for gameplay,

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:09.080
because it has these gameplay buttons,

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.680
I think might be actually really interesting.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:11.520
Maybe.

01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:12.360
I don't know.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.200
As long as I'd be playing it,

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:16.720
I'll be a four by three Super Nintendo game.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.280
It's got two gigs of RAM in there,

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.880
three USB-A ports like you alluded to,

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.640
a USB-C and a micro HDMI.

01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.920
Not to mention a thermal printer.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.120
Well, yeah, of course, which...

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.320
But the nice thing about this, I think,

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.720
is that there's an opportunity for a lot of expansion.

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.080
I know when I was putting the thing together,

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.920
there's a whole lot of expansion.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.040
What do you call those?

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:35.920
Connectors and things? Modules?

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.760
Modules, sure.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:37.680
Sure.

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.680
So there's a lot of possibility.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:43.680
I know they have a game-specific add-on to it.

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.640
The name of it is passing me now,

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:49.000
but I think there's a lot of opportunity here.

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.800
I think it's just that we've run out of ideas

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:52.680
for what to do with it.

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:56.160
Oh, Dan, you've got an updated version with more RAM?

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.000
Oh, there's already...

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:57.840
Yeah.

01:16:57.840 --> 01:16:58.800
We just got this.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.760
Tell me about it.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:02.120
Yeah, well, it's about the same device,

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:04.200
except that it's just a little more powerful.

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.040
Duh!

01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.240
That sounds exactly the kind of thing I like.
