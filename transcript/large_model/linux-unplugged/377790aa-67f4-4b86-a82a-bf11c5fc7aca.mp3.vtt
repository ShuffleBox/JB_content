WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.260
Sounds like you managed to have yourself

00:01.260 --> 00:04.300
an actual positive experience with Anaconda.

00:04.300 --> 00:06.620
That makes at least one of us, I think.

00:06.620 --> 00:07.460
Yeah, all right.

00:07.460 --> 00:08.900
Well, I wanted to play with GNOME 42,

00:08.900 --> 00:12.460
and I thought, why not try it on the upcoming Fedora 36?

00:12.460 --> 00:15.460
So I grabbed a nightly, went to go install it,

00:15.460 --> 00:19.300
and, well, it started with a less than positive experience.

00:19.300 --> 00:20.940
I didn't have a mouse cursor.

00:20.940 --> 00:21.780
Oh.

00:21.780 --> 00:24.060
Yeah, so that was daunting at first.

00:24.060 --> 00:25.820
My positive note is, turns out,

00:25.820 --> 00:28.500
Anaconda works all right without a mouse.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.340
Hey, there's that.

00:30.340 --> 00:33.100
I got to say, though, the disk partitioner,

00:33.100 --> 00:35.460
when you've got a lot of disks in your system,

00:35.460 --> 00:37.820
and you're trying to put your home drive over here,

00:37.820 --> 00:41.140
and your VAR over there, I mean, Wes,

00:41.140 --> 00:42.780
let's just say I'm still restoring data.

00:42.780 --> 00:44.300
It went real bad.

00:44.300 --> 00:49.300
Hello, friends, and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

00:56.020 --> 00:56.860
My name is Chris.

00:56.860 --> 00:57.700
My name is Wes.

00:57.700 --> 00:58.700
And my name is Bren.

00:58.700 --> 01:00.100
Hello, guys.

01:00.100 --> 01:00.940
Great to have you here.

01:00.940 --> 01:02.920
Coming up on the show today,

01:02.920 --> 01:07.300
we have a game changer release of GNOME just on the horizon,

01:07.300 --> 01:09.340
around the corner, as they say.

01:09.340 --> 01:11.060
We're going hands-on with GNOME 42.

01:11.060 --> 01:12.660
We're going to report what's new,

01:12.660 --> 01:14.700
and what we are so damn excited about.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.420
Plus, the first official alpha

01:17.420 --> 01:21.200
of Asahi Linux's M1 installer is out,

01:21.200 --> 01:23.140
and we're going to try and get that installed

01:23.140 --> 01:25.060
on a MacBook live during the show.

01:25.060 --> 01:26.580
How you feeling, Wes Payne?

01:26.580 --> 01:27.460
Ooh, I'm excited.

01:27.460 --> 01:29.620
I've been looking forward to this for a long time.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.020
Now, picture it, audience.

01:31.020 --> 01:31.860
Wes is here.

01:31.860 --> 01:33.620
He's got his ThinkPad in front of him.

01:33.620 --> 01:36.020
And then off to the side, he's got a card table,

01:36.020 --> 01:37.500
you know, like something you might maybe eat,

01:37.500 --> 01:39.740
like a microwave meal in front of the TV.

01:39.740 --> 01:41.780
I was hoping there was going to be some sort of food here,

01:41.780 --> 01:44.500
but no, no, instead it's a very beefy MacBook.

01:44.500 --> 01:46.820
Yeah, so this is the other thing right now,

01:46.820 --> 01:48.620
is this is all really new.

01:48.620 --> 01:50.280
So I just got this sucker updated

01:50.280 --> 01:51.860
because it'd been neglected for a little bit.

01:51.860 --> 01:53.100
So it just got all updated.

01:53.100 --> 01:56.580
You got to have like the latest Mac OS on there.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.580
And they got a shell script you can run.

01:59.940 --> 02:03.260
Got all that sorted, but I've never really seen anyone

02:03.260 --> 02:06.020
say they have this running on a MacBook Max.

02:06.020 --> 02:07.900
I see a lot of M1 errors.

02:07.900 --> 02:11.060
I believe the dev team has it running on their minis,

02:11.060 --> 02:12.980
but I've seen nobody that's crazy enough

02:12.980 --> 02:15.860
to put it on the MacBook Max.

02:15.860 --> 02:17.700
So this may blow up in our faces.

02:17.700 --> 02:18.660
I'd like to be clear.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.780
I am not guaranteeing that I'm going to return

02:20.780 --> 02:22.660
a working machine to you.

02:22.660 --> 02:25.100
We'll find out coming up here in a little bit.

02:25.100 --> 02:27.140
But before we get into any of that,

02:27.140 --> 02:29.740
before we get into the booths and the pics and all of that,

02:29.740 --> 02:31.780
I got to say time appropriate greetings

02:31.780 --> 02:32.660
to our virtual lug.

02:32.660 --> 02:33.580
Hello, Mumba Room.

02:33.580 --> 02:34.400
Hello.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.240
Hello.

02:35.240 --> 02:37.180
Hello, Brian.

02:37.180 --> 02:38.540
Man, it's good to see you guys.

02:38.540 --> 02:39.780
Powerful voice today.

02:39.780 --> 02:42.440
I was all out of sorts last week.

02:42.440 --> 02:43.740
Didn't even introduce the Mumba Room

02:43.740 --> 02:45.700
because we only had like five, six people in there.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.860
It was weird because of the daylight savings.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.740
And I thought maybe the show was dead.

02:49.740 --> 02:50.580
I wasn't sure.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.120
But then now we've got 25 people in there.

02:53.120 --> 02:53.980
So it's fantastic.

02:53.980 --> 02:55.560
Thank you, everybody, for making it on a Sunday.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.020
We love having you here.

02:57.020 --> 02:58.780
Yeah, you guys.

02:58.780 --> 02:59.940
Good looking bunch too.

03:01.260 --> 03:02.100
All right.

03:02.100 --> 03:02.920
Should we do it?

03:02.920 --> 03:03.960
You want to like officially kick it off?

03:03.960 --> 03:05.220
Because I got a few things I could get into.

03:05.220 --> 03:06.300
I got to buy you some time.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.140
You do got to.

03:07.140 --> 03:07.960
I mean, yeah.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.460
We've got like things to download.

03:10.460 --> 03:11.780
Do you want to officially kick it off?

03:11.780 --> 03:14.340
Now you do have 53 gigs of free space, right?

03:14.340 --> 03:15.860
Um, I think I should.

03:15.860 --> 03:16.700
I don't know.

03:16.700 --> 03:17.780
You tell me, what does it say?

03:17.780 --> 03:19.500
Does it tell you how much I have on there?

03:19.500 --> 03:21.180
Can you do a DF on the Mac?

03:21.180 --> 03:22.400
Is that a thing you can do?

03:22.400 --> 03:23.240
What does it say?

03:23.240 --> 03:24.980
Yeah, 1.3 terabytes.

03:24.980 --> 03:26.300
Does that sound right?

03:26.300 --> 03:27.780
All right, Westpain.

03:27.780 --> 03:28.900
Let's do this.

03:29.900 --> 03:31.280
You get it started.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.300
I'm going to give you time.

03:32.300 --> 03:34.380
I got a few things to talk about.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.020
We got things to get into.

03:36.020 --> 03:37.300
So you kick it off.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.660
You give me the flag if you got any problems

03:39.660 --> 03:40.980
or when you get to a major milestone

03:40.980 --> 03:41.820
and we'll do a check-in.

03:41.820 --> 03:42.700
You know, you'll be happy to know

03:42.700 --> 03:44.120
the first step here recommends me

03:44.120 --> 03:45.900
curling something and piping it to SH.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.900
So thanks for handing me your very expensive laptop.

03:48.900 --> 03:49.940
And don't worry.

03:49.940 --> 03:53.300
I just did a pseudo dash S so you can go to town.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.740
Because that's how we're going to get it.

03:55.740 --> 03:58.260
All right, we'll check back in in a few minutes.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.180
We are just a couple of weeks away

04:05.180 --> 04:06.980
from our meetup on the East Coast

04:06.980 --> 04:10.260
in Raleigh, North Carolina on April 9th.

04:10.260 --> 04:12.100
There is a lot of people coming, Brent.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.060
Have you, Brent, have you seen these numbers?

04:14.060 --> 04:14.900
Have you?

04:14.900 --> 04:15.740
Yeah.

04:15.740 --> 04:17.460
I think we're like at 60 on the meetup now.

04:17.460 --> 04:18.300
It's just going up and up.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.860
I had a look and I browsed through all the names

04:19.860 --> 04:20.820
and I just kept smiling,

04:20.820 --> 04:24.020
but mostly because usually if there's like 60 there,

04:24.020 --> 04:25.420
then there's even more that show up.

04:25.420 --> 04:27.820
So I think it's going to be real exciting.

04:27.820 --> 04:29.380
Yeah, I think we might have like a hundred people

04:29.380 --> 04:30.220
or something.

04:30.220 --> 04:31.880
I think it's going to be pretty big.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.260
And I've heard from people that can't make it too.

04:34.260 --> 04:35.700
We'll always try to do more meetups too,

04:35.700 --> 04:36.980
but maybe you can.

04:36.980 --> 04:38.540
We'd love to see you there on April 9th.

04:38.540 --> 04:39.380
We're going to be at a park.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.540
It's going to be outdoors.

04:40.540 --> 04:43.700
It's a beautiful time of the year to be in North Carolina.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.060
And this is just outside of Raleigh at a park

04:46.060 --> 04:48.340
that has a barbecue on one end

04:48.340 --> 04:49.660
and a brewery on another end.

04:49.660 --> 04:50.700
And I don't think there's ever been

04:50.700 --> 04:52.660
a more perfect meetup spot.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.500
I encourage someone too to bring their drone

04:54.500 --> 04:56.580
because last time we did a meetup in a park,

04:56.580 --> 04:58.780
we got a great drone group photo.

04:58.780 --> 05:01.260
So if anybody wants to do some drone photography,

05:01.260 --> 05:02.100
this is my hint.

05:02.100 --> 05:02.940
Bring it with you.

05:02.940 --> 05:03.760
I think that'd be fun.

05:03.760 --> 05:04.900
If you can make it, let us know.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.580
We try to give the barbecue place

05:07.580 --> 05:08.820
and the brewery a heads up.

05:10.440 --> 05:13.060
We really at this point don't know what to tell them.

05:13.060 --> 05:15.320
So we're going to have to go by that meetup number.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.980
So you could join the meetup.

05:17.980 --> 05:19.700
I know it's a panel, but it's another account.

05:19.700 --> 05:22.060
But if you could join the meetup,

05:22.060 --> 05:23.380
then we could give the barbecue place

05:23.380 --> 05:25.500
an accurate number of the amount of cows

05:25.500 --> 05:26.900
they got to bring in.

05:26.900 --> 05:29.780
So let us know, meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting.

05:29.780 --> 05:32.780
I guess, Brent, we'll be able to deduct your cow quantity.

05:32.780 --> 05:33.900
Yeah, I'll donate mine.

05:33.900 --> 05:34.740
That's fine.

05:34.740 --> 05:35.820
That's really nice of you.

05:35.820 --> 05:38.240
So really our only story this week

05:38.240 --> 05:40.900
is that the Asahi Linux Alpha is here.

05:40.900 --> 05:44.100
And keep in mind, this is an Alpha, okay?

05:44.100 --> 05:47.540
Don't put this on your fancy expensive Mac yet.

05:47.540 --> 05:50.100
One of the big missing things amongst a few others

05:50.100 --> 05:53.000
is there's no GPU acceleration at this point.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.860
However, Asahi Linux comes with a customized remix of Arch

05:56.860 --> 05:58.940
that has the full plasma desktop

05:58.940 --> 06:01.180
that is actually pretty decent

06:01.180 --> 06:03.660
with CPU accelerated graphics.

06:03.660 --> 06:04.740
So we're going to go with that.

06:04.740 --> 06:05.740
We're going to use plasma.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.440
I'm new sizing your APFS partitions right now.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.380
Whoa, really?

06:09.380 --> 06:11.500
Yeah, right here it just prompts you.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.380
It's pretty nice too.

06:12.380 --> 06:13.940
Like it lets you, I can specify,

06:13.940 --> 06:15.840
you can just specify like how big you want to make it

06:15.840 --> 06:16.980
or you can even put a percentage.

06:16.980 --> 06:18.060
So I could just say like,

06:18.060 --> 06:20.220
hey, we're going to leave 90% to the Mac

06:20.220 --> 06:22.660
and then slice off 10% for Asahi.

06:22.660 --> 06:23.980
And it seems like their strategy

06:23.980 --> 06:26.900
is to make this a dual boot thing.

06:26.900 --> 06:31.220
Like I think Hector, the main person behind the project,

06:31.220 --> 06:33.280
I think Hector even kind of frames it as,

06:33.280 --> 06:35.860
you can do a boot and you can still watch Netflix and 4K

06:35.860 --> 06:37.740
and update your firmware via the Mac,

06:37.740 --> 06:39.380
use your file vault encryption,

06:39.380 --> 06:42.380
keep all of your secret stuff on the Mac that you need.

06:42.380 --> 06:43.700
And then you can also put into Linux

06:43.700 --> 06:44.820
and have a full environment over there.

06:44.820 --> 06:46.960
And so they're really designing this as a dual boot thing.

06:46.960 --> 06:47.800
Yeah.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.620
And now if you're like,

06:48.620 --> 06:50.980
I really just want to run Linux on here,

06:50.980 --> 06:52.260
they do have a min options,

06:52.260 --> 06:55.580
which just tries to like safely reduce the install of Mac OS

06:55.580 --> 06:56.740
down to the smallest size.

06:56.740 --> 06:57.980
Minimum viable Mac.

06:57.980 --> 06:58.820
Yeah, exactly.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.720
You know where that'd be perfect?

07:01.720 --> 07:05.040
Is I actually see myself using this,

07:05.040 --> 07:07.460
not so much on the laptop end,

07:07.460 --> 07:10.400
but on a Mac mini running headless as a server.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.580
Sure.

07:11.580 --> 07:14.320
If they could get GPU acceleration working on a Mac mini,

07:14.320 --> 07:16.600
and then I could run things like Jellyfin or Plex

07:16.600 --> 07:19.860
and get GPU accelerated decoding of video,

07:19.860 --> 07:23.300
maybe even using the built-in H264 decoders in the M1,

07:24.540 --> 07:26.380
and you're looking at 20 Watts of power,

07:26.380 --> 07:29.480
I could probably quintuple the load of work

07:29.480 --> 07:30.380
that I have the machine doing

07:30.380 --> 07:32.300
for my Raspberry Pis right now.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.700
I could still run Linux.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.440
And if I could get that hardware accelerated decoding,

07:37.440 --> 07:38.640
that'd be pretty powerful.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.740
It'd be really, and plus with Thunderbolt on there,

07:40.740 --> 07:43.400
you could hook up a large external array

07:43.400 --> 07:44.800
of solid state disks.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.300
Not like with the Raspberry Pi right now,

07:46.300 --> 07:48.180
I'm limited to USB.

07:48.180 --> 07:51.480
I could really see this taking a home server setup,

07:51.480 --> 07:53.520
running Linux to the next level,

07:53.520 --> 07:56.080
especially if you're power conscious like I am,

07:56.080 --> 07:57.960
because I'm trying to run everything off solar.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.160
And so the difference between 60 Watts,

08:00.160 --> 08:03.680
20 Watts or 130 Watts is huge for my family.

08:03.680 --> 08:05.480
It's like the difference between being able

08:05.480 --> 08:07.240
to run an appliance for dinner and not.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.240
Especially since you've kind of already got over the hurdle.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.480
Now obviously there's differences,

08:10.480 --> 08:12.200
but you've already got over some of the hurdle

08:12.200 --> 08:14.880
of adapting your workflow to supporting an ARM platform.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.400
Exactly, I don't have to worry about that.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.520
Yeah, so I want hardware acceleration,

08:18.520 --> 08:20.880
but I actually don't necessarily want it for the GUI.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.320
Although of course I would use that on occasion,

08:23.320 --> 08:25.600
but my actual use case would be the home server setup.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.720
You just want the GPU supported

08:26.720 --> 08:28.040
so you can offload stuff to it.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.360
Yeah, my bet though is the CPU might be fast enough

08:31.360 --> 08:34.440
that I could probably get away with software decoding

08:34.440 --> 08:35.880
and not really notice

08:35.880 --> 08:37.440
because I'd be coming from a Raspberry Pi.

08:37.440 --> 08:38.720
Right.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.320
So it really kind of depends on how viable it is.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.520
Oh no, process execution failed.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.240
Uh-oh, what happened over there, what happened?

08:45.240 --> 08:46.080
Red alert.

08:46.080 --> 08:46.920
Red alert.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.240
What does it tell you Wes, what does it say?

08:52.240 --> 08:55.960
Failed to run process disk util apfs resize container,

08:55.960 --> 08:58.080
process execution failed.

08:58.080 --> 09:02.840
Oh, Python stack trace, turn non-zero exit status.

09:02.840 --> 09:04.840
So it failed during the actual resize?

09:04.840 --> 09:05.680
Let's try it again.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.680
That sort of seems worst case scenario, doesn't it?

09:07.680 --> 09:08.520
You know?

09:08.520 --> 09:09.340
I mean, maybe.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.180
You failed during the disk.

09:10.180 --> 09:14.640
APFS can handle it, it's a robust file system.

09:14.640 --> 09:17.160
Is it getting warm in here or is it just me?

09:17.160 --> 09:19.280
Last time I didn't enable expert mode,

09:19.280 --> 09:20.520
maybe I should this time.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.260
Wes, if anybody should be enabling expert mode,

09:23.260 --> 09:24.680
it is you, what are you doing?

09:24.680 --> 09:27.280
Someone who's never used an M1 Mac before.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.840
Yeah, but you learn quick.

09:31.680 --> 09:32.520
You all right?

09:32.520 --> 09:33.720
I mean, come on, have some confidence.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.600
Brent, you gotta uptalk your boy here.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.400
He doesn't have enough confidence in himself.

09:37.400 --> 09:38.520
Yeah, I know, he's got this.

09:38.520 --> 09:40.320
It seems like if anyone can pull it off,

09:40.320 --> 09:42.440
it's definitely Wes, it's certainly not me.

09:42.440 --> 09:44.760
So Wes, you got this, expert mode all the way.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.400
Yeah, and if you don't get it working,

09:46.400 --> 09:48.240
we're all just gonna be extremely disappointed in you.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.680
Yeah, we'll have to redo the show, but that's fine.

09:50.680 --> 09:51.920
Yeah, you don't wanna wreck the show, right, Wes?

09:51.920 --> 09:53.600
No, no.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.640
Note, your system may appear to freeze during the resize.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.800
This is normal.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.800
Just wait until the process completes.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.000
That's a nice warning.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.720
What is this, some single threaded bull crap?

10:04.720 --> 10:05.600
What is that?

10:05.600 --> 10:07.740
Okay, so you could do the minimal,

10:07.740 --> 10:10.180
which is still gonna be based on Arch.

10:10.180 --> 10:11.820
It's gonna shrink the Mac install down

10:11.820 --> 10:13.940
to just the minimal viable Mac size,

10:13.940 --> 10:15.740
and then use the rest for Linux.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.580
That's pretty nice.

10:16.580 --> 10:17.980
And you know, a lot of the secret sauce in here

10:17.980 --> 10:21.300
is their mini bootloader stuff that they've been working on.

10:21.300 --> 10:25.740
They've been also really good about updating documentation.

10:25.740 --> 10:27.460
They actually had a big, something that Wes noticed,

10:27.460 --> 10:29.180
so they had a big documentation push

10:29.180 --> 10:30.580
right before this alpha release.

10:30.580 --> 10:32.580
That's kinda how we knew this was coming, really.

10:32.580 --> 10:35.140
And the Asahi Linux team has been doing

10:35.140 --> 10:36.940
has been just absolutely stellar

10:36.940 --> 10:39.140
about getting this code upstream.

10:39.140 --> 10:41.220
The idea is, is that eventually,

10:41.220 --> 10:43.860
support for this stuff just comes baked into Linux.

10:43.860 --> 10:46.080
So once we're a few years down the road,

10:46.080 --> 10:48.860
it'll be normalized and gobbled up by most distros,

10:48.860 --> 10:51.620
and you won't even have to worry if that distro has support.

10:51.620 --> 10:54.100
It'll just be built into the kernel.

10:54.100 --> 10:54.940
Wouldn't that be something?

10:54.940 --> 10:55.780
Yeah.

10:55.780 --> 10:56.620
Now, how's it going over there?

10:56.620 --> 10:58.340
Well, we're trying to resize again.

10:58.340 --> 10:59.600
Mm-hmm.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.440
But?

11:00.440 --> 11:01.260
I feel like there's a button up.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.100
I know, I don't know.

11:02.100 --> 11:02.920
Oh, all right.

11:02.920 --> 11:03.760
I mean, it's just doing its business.

11:03.760 --> 11:06.740
We're at 15%, but that's where it was at before, so.

11:06.740 --> 11:08.620
Is that where it failed before?

11:08.620 --> 11:09.460
Man.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.120
I could try giving it less space.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.260
I mean, how much space did you give it?

11:13.260 --> 11:14.580
150 gigs.

11:14.580 --> 11:15.420
Oh, that seems plenty.

11:15.420 --> 11:16.620
No, less space?

11:16.620 --> 11:18.220
What are you, what are you, an animal?

11:18.220 --> 11:19.060
Here's what I'm gonna do.

11:19.060 --> 11:19.900
I'll buy you some time.

11:19.900 --> 11:24.480
Lino.com slash unplugged.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.740
Go there to get $100 in 60-day credit on a new account,

11:27.740 --> 11:29.620
and you go there to support this here show.

11:29.620 --> 11:31.880
Linode is fast, reliable cloud hosting.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.500
You gotta try it for your next project.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.660
It's what we use for anything

11:34.660 --> 11:36.500
that we host up there in the cloud.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.860
Our matrix instance has been growing like crazy,

11:38.860 --> 11:40.640
and this has been a great test

11:40.640 --> 11:42.540
of both Linode's alerting system,

11:42.540 --> 11:45.020
infrastructure, and ability to upgrade.

11:45.020 --> 11:48.060
I mean, I can attest it has really stayed nimble.

11:48.060 --> 11:50.340
We threw it on a $5 system initially,

11:50.340 --> 11:52.020
and it just seemed like that was gonna be fine.

11:52.020 --> 11:54.660
There's only like, you know, a dozen people on there.

11:54.660 --> 11:55.740
Now there's thousands,

11:55.740 --> 11:58.820
and we have scaled that system up using Linode's tools,

11:58.820 --> 12:00.180
and we've been able to use their dashboard

12:00.180 --> 12:01.540
to see what the CPU is,

12:01.540 --> 12:03.940
and what the memory's at, and the disk space,

12:03.940 --> 12:05.040
because they really do a good job

12:05.040 --> 12:06.500
of quantifying those essential metrics

12:06.500 --> 12:08.340
in a really easy-to-read dashboard.

12:08.340 --> 12:10.820
Just pop it right on there when you go to Linode,

12:10.820 --> 12:12.900
and you get an overview of what the system's doing.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.280
And of course, they have tools

12:14.280 --> 12:16.720
to just enable monitoring and managing that thing.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.980
So even though we don't have a big team here,

12:19.980 --> 12:22.380
we can keep something that's kind of expanding

12:22.380 --> 12:24.940
at a pretty rapid clip under control.

12:24.940 --> 12:26.620
And now that Linode has been rolling out

12:26.620 --> 12:28.420
MVME storage on their rigs,

12:28.420 --> 12:32.080
things have just taken a whole new leap in speed.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.880
So they are their own ISP,

12:33.880 --> 12:36.540
so they just have the absolute best peering deal possible,

12:36.540 --> 12:38.380
because they're dealing with themselves.

12:38.380 --> 12:39.780
They got 40 gigabit connections

12:39.780 --> 12:41.700
coming into their individual machines.

12:41.700 --> 12:44.680
They got AMD EPYC CPUs on the high-end CPU systems,

12:44.680 --> 12:49.420
and now they got MVME PCIe storage when you need that.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.180
And you know, maybe you don't.

12:51.180 --> 12:53.700
Maybe you just wanna run like a personal portfolio,

12:53.700 --> 12:56.060
or a blog, or a Minecraft server.

12:56.060 --> 12:58.100
They have systems that are just perfect for that,

12:58.100 --> 13:00.220
and at really great prices.

13:00.220 --> 13:02.700
Linode's 30 to 50% cheaper than the large hyperscalers

13:02.700 --> 13:05.700
that wanna lock you into their crazy complicated platforms.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.420
And they got performance that beats them.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.060
It's just great.

13:09.060 --> 13:10.700
And 11 data centers around the world

13:10.700 --> 13:13.020
means you're gonna have the data centers

13:13.020 --> 13:13.860
where you need them, right?

13:13.860 --> 13:15.860
Like, what do you need more than 11 data centers for?

13:15.860 --> 13:17.420
What are you, a maniac?

13:17.420 --> 13:19.020
What are you?

13:19.020 --> 13:19.860
You Bezos?

13:19.860 --> 13:21.580
Come on, 11 data centers is great.

13:21.580 --> 13:23.180
When they've been doing something like this for 19 years,

13:23.180 --> 13:24.700
you know they're gonna do it, right?

13:24.700 --> 13:26.100
So go see it for yourself.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.100
See why we've been talking about it.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.740
See why we've been using them for two and a half plus years.

13:29.740 --> 13:31.620
And see why so many Linux Unplugged listeners

13:31.620 --> 13:33.780
have been taking advantage of that $100 offer.

13:33.780 --> 13:35.100
Now you can too.

13:35.100 --> 13:38.020
Linode.com slash unplugged.

13:38.020 --> 13:43.020
Okay, I saw some exasperation over there, Wes Payne.

13:43.780 --> 13:44.620
Failed again.

13:46.260 --> 13:47.420
I wonder if it's like,

13:47.420 --> 13:49.980
because we just recently did an update.

13:49.980 --> 13:51.420
Could like another round of reboots, maybe?

13:51.420 --> 13:52.260
That's not a bad idea.

13:52.260 --> 13:54.220
We could, I mean, I'm down for that.

13:54.220 --> 13:56.940
If you wanna do that, we could do a round of reboots.

13:56.940 --> 13:57.980
That's fine.

13:57.980 --> 14:01.220
You know, there is a lesson in all of this though.

14:01.220 --> 14:02.460
When this announcement came out,

14:02.460 --> 14:05.100
when Asahi Linux announced their availability,

14:05.100 --> 14:07.780
I really had to have a think if I even wanted to bother.

14:07.780 --> 14:08.620
Yeah.

14:08.620 --> 14:09.980
I realized it sort of is akin

14:09.980 --> 14:11.380
to putting Windows on the deck.

14:11.380 --> 14:14.220
It just, like it can be done.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.300
This is what the audience has been trying

14:15.300 --> 14:16.140
to tell me for a while.

14:16.140 --> 14:17.580
It took me a little bit to realize it,

14:17.580 --> 14:20.340
but like, there's better ways to run Linux out there.

14:20.340 --> 14:23.700
This is not, I don't think the advice of this show

14:23.700 --> 14:25.980
is ever gonna be go buy a MacBook and put Linux on it.

14:25.980 --> 14:27.900
I think that's just ridiculous.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.620
I mean, I think this is the closest we've come

14:29.620 --> 14:32.020
to maybe that changing, but you're right.

14:32.020 --> 14:34.260
Before, that's kind of always been experimental,

14:34.260 --> 14:36.220
or if you have one that's three or four years old,

14:36.220 --> 14:38.420
then maybe it works decently.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.620
The thing that I find pretty interesting

14:40.620 --> 14:42.900
is there has been a couple of changes

14:42.900 --> 14:45.940
that have happened in macOS 12.3

14:47.060 --> 14:49.460
that have specifically enabled Asahi Linux

14:49.460 --> 14:51.340
to work better on the MacBooks.

14:51.340 --> 14:53.460
Two different changes happened recently.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.820
And the only reason that Hector and the team

14:55.820 --> 14:57.220
can even conceive that they happened

14:57.220 --> 14:58.500
is to enable Asahi Linux.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.780
There's like specific improvements for Asahi.

15:01.780 --> 15:02.620
What do you make of that?

15:02.620 --> 15:03.580
What are your thoughts on that?

15:03.580 --> 15:05.460
You know what my theory is, and I'll explain it,

15:05.460 --> 15:07.260
but what is your theory?

15:07.260 --> 15:09.420
Well, I hadn't seen those comments by Hector,

15:09.420 --> 15:12.020
so I can't comment on that part.

15:12.020 --> 15:15.180
I mean, it does seem like there's some efforts internally

15:15.180 --> 15:17.540
to make a consistent ecosystem

15:17.540 --> 15:20.820
that does support other operating systems booting.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.260
It does seem like there's been multiple avenues

15:22.260 --> 15:24.020
where things could be locked down,

15:24.020 --> 15:25.220
they didn't need to be locked down,

15:25.220 --> 15:27.460
but knowing Apple, and if you compare it to, say,

15:27.460 --> 15:28.860
their mobile platforms,

15:28.860 --> 15:30.940
places where it would have seen some restrictions

15:30.940 --> 15:34.060
that just haven't, and then above and beyond that,

15:34.060 --> 15:35.860
some work on some of this tooling,

15:35.860 --> 15:38.940
making things easier than it might necessarily have to be

15:38.940 --> 15:41.660
to just tie up loose ends, make it play nicely

15:41.660 --> 15:43.540
with the existing macOS that's gonna be there.

15:43.540 --> 15:46.300
The other thing that they did, they being Apple,

15:46.300 --> 15:48.420
that I just didn't see coming

15:48.420 --> 15:51.140
when they announced their own hardware platform,

15:51.140 --> 15:53.500
is a lot of the essential bring up

15:53.500 --> 15:56.380
that you traditionally would need a binary blob for in Linux

15:56.380 --> 15:58.860
to get that piece of hardware working.

15:58.860 --> 16:01.220
That's being done at the firmware level,

16:01.220 --> 16:04.740
and then it's presenting itself to the OS is ready to go.

16:04.740 --> 16:08.980
And macOS isn't loading these weird proprietary blobs,

16:08.980 --> 16:11.100
like they even did on the Intel systems,

16:11.100 --> 16:13.940
even though they could more easily now than ever

16:13.940 --> 16:17.100
offload that work to the OS because they write the OS

16:17.100 --> 16:20.180
and the OS is only designed for their own hardware,

16:20.180 --> 16:22.020
they could have had that firmware blob stuff

16:22.020 --> 16:22.860
being done in the OS,

16:22.860 --> 16:24.860
and they chose to do it at the hardware level,

16:24.860 --> 16:26.940
and so that stuff is available and ready to go for Linux,

16:26.940 --> 16:29.540
and Linux doesn't have to have those binary blobs.

16:29.540 --> 16:31.140
Right, we have to figure out how to interact

16:31.140 --> 16:33.100
with their proprietary hardware,

16:33.100 --> 16:35.660
but it's interesting, like it's a different level

16:35.660 --> 16:37.180
of communication and interfacing,

16:37.180 --> 16:39.580
and so far it seems like it's kind of a new paradigm

16:39.580 --> 16:43.380
for supporting Linux on an ecosystem

16:43.380 --> 16:46.860
that is neutral at best to us being there.

16:46.860 --> 16:49.540
Yeah, I actually think they want it there.

16:49.540 --> 16:53.020
That's my theory, so my conspiracy bacon on this

16:53.020 --> 16:56.900
is that they actually want Linux on the M1

16:56.900 --> 17:00.540
and future hardware because once they start shipping

17:00.540 --> 17:03.620
M2-based Macs and all that kind of stuff,

17:03.620 --> 17:06.060
you know, once they work the M2 through the line,

17:06.060 --> 17:08.420
they're not gonna stop building M1s.

17:08.420 --> 17:12.300
They're gonna build their own custom M1-based servers

17:12.300 --> 17:13.940
for their iCloud data center.

17:13.940 --> 17:17.100
You know, racks and racks of M1s just on the shelf,

17:17.100 --> 17:20.060
purpose-built for a data center,

17:20.060 --> 17:21.780
and they're gonna need Linux on those things.

17:21.780 --> 17:22.780
They're not gonna wanna run,

17:22.780 --> 17:26.660
they're not gonna wanna run Mac OS on 5,000 M1 servers.

17:26.660 --> 17:27.780
That's ridiculous, right?

17:27.780 --> 17:30.100
And when you think about what iCloud is mostly composed of,

17:30.100 --> 17:33.900
it's composed of database backends, object storage,

17:33.900 --> 17:37.820
NGINX, right, standard stuff that runs on Linux.

17:37.820 --> 17:40.220
They're not running iCloud on Mac OS,

17:40.220 --> 17:44.340
and why wouldn't they want to use the M1 hardware

17:44.340 --> 17:46.980
that has a built-in neural engine that uses less power

17:46.980 --> 17:48.900
so they could save money at their data center,

17:48.900 --> 17:50.300
it's less cooling.

17:50.300 --> 17:53.180
You think about the economics of an M1

17:53.180 --> 17:55.020
when you're dealing with 5,000 of them.

17:55.020 --> 17:57.580
I mean, we know they love dogfooding when they can.

17:57.580 --> 18:00.500
So I guess, I have to imagine internally,

18:00.500 --> 18:04.340
the engineers have been making small, low-level tweaks

18:04.340 --> 18:07.140
to make Linux more available,

18:07.140 --> 18:08.900
or to make the M1 more available to Linux.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.020
It's been my theory.

18:10.020 --> 18:11.340
We'll see, because we're having trouble

18:11.340 --> 18:13.900
even getting the disk resized at this point.

18:13.900 --> 18:15.180
You could see it also just helping their own,

18:15.180 --> 18:17.060
you know, yeah, they can get internal builds of things.

18:17.060 --> 18:18.020
Maybe it makes it a little easier

18:18.020 --> 18:20.220
to sort of try out experimental Mac builds

18:20.220 --> 18:22.980
or, you know, other diagnostic setups

18:22.980 --> 18:24.660
that you might be running to try out new hardware.

18:24.660 --> 18:26.460
Yeah, yeah.

18:26.460 --> 18:27.900
But let's say you want to avoid all that,

18:27.900 --> 18:31.100
and maybe you just want to get a good old open x86 system

18:31.100 --> 18:33.180
and throw GNU slash Linux on there,

18:33.180 --> 18:36.700
and you want the top-tier Linux desktop experience.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.820
You want the best of the best.

18:38.820 --> 18:39.980
That, my friends-

18:39.980 --> 18:41.220
XFCE.

18:41.220 --> 18:47.860
All right, good night, everybody, that's it, and we're out.

18:47.860 --> 18:53.060
No, I have to say, the GNOME 42 release is looking fantastic,

18:53.060 --> 18:54.860
and since LAN kicked off,

18:54.860 --> 18:57.500
we have been running it a couple of days before then,

18:57.500 --> 18:58.660
and we're running it now,

18:58.660 --> 19:00.620
and Wes has got it on his ThinkPad.

19:00.620 --> 19:02.100
I've got it on my ThinkPad.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.460
We'll talk about Brent's setup here in a moment.

19:04.460 --> 19:08.220
We're both running it right here in front of us right now,

19:08.220 --> 19:09.860
and we're excited to tell you all about it,

19:09.860 --> 19:12.340
so keep in mind, it is not out yet.

19:12.340 --> 19:14.300
The way we worded it in LAN was horrible.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.500
I want to just eat that humble pie right here.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.140
I apologize.

19:18.140 --> 19:21.740
The release day is March 23rd, officially for GNOME 42,

19:21.740 --> 19:24.220
but realistically, if you're listening to this at home,

19:24.220 --> 19:25.460
you're going to get it in a distro.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.180
That's how you're going to hear about it or use it.

19:27.180 --> 19:28.380
That's how you're going to see it, right?

19:28.380 --> 19:30.660
It's going to be like, that'll be one of the headline features

19:30.660 --> 19:34.460
of Ubuntu 2204 and Fedora 36 is GNOME 42.

19:34.460 --> 19:36.340
That's really where you're going to hear about it,

19:36.340 --> 19:38.700
but you could actually get your hands on it early,

19:38.700 --> 19:42.860
various means like GNOME OS and Fedora 36, et cetera, et cetera.

19:42.860 --> 19:45.540
And it's here.

19:45.540 --> 19:47.700
It's glorious, and it is the GNOME release

19:47.700 --> 19:51.260
that we've been hoping would land since GNOME 40.

19:51.260 --> 19:52.900
Big things are in this one.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.500
A lot of apps have made the transition to GTK4,

19:55.500 --> 19:58.540
which has a lot of underlying improvements.

19:58.540 --> 20:01.980
But the other big thing here is this actually ships.

20:01.980 --> 20:02.980
Is it Adwaitia?

20:02.980 --> 20:04.700
Is that how we're saying it, LibAdwaitia?

20:04.700 --> 20:08.220
Which there was a lot of controversy about, or maybe

20:08.220 --> 20:10.140
misunderstanding is probably the way to put it.

20:10.140 --> 20:13.020
A lot of misunderstandings about originally,

20:13.020 --> 20:16.300
and we're seeing the fruits of that work now land in 42.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.460
We're seeing a global dark theme that is actually

20:18.460 --> 20:20.060
supported by upstream GNOME.

20:20.060 --> 20:22.740
All of that lands here.

20:22.740 --> 20:29.540
And it truly makes for a remarkable version of GNOME.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.100
40 was a big one.

20:31.100 --> 20:35.380
42 is arguably just as big, if not bigger, in my opinion.

20:35.380 --> 20:38.060
And so of course, I'm very, very comfortable and familiar

20:38.060 --> 20:38.980
with GNOME.

20:38.980 --> 20:41.620
So Brent, I know this is one of your first experiences

20:41.620 --> 20:42.220
with GNOME.

20:42.220 --> 20:43.540
You're a plasma guy.

20:43.540 --> 20:46.060
So I'm curious what your GNOME 42 experience was,

20:46.060 --> 20:48.820
because we sort of just threw you in the deep end.

20:48.820 --> 20:50.580
I got to say, it looked beautiful.

20:50.580 --> 20:53.060
I didn't expect how gorgeous it was,

20:53.060 --> 20:54.860
and maybe that sounds a little silly.

20:54.860 --> 20:59.060
But the thing that really hit me was the dark mode.

20:59.060 --> 21:03.180
And I know there's been a lot of work going on behind the scenes

21:03.180 --> 21:05.980
almost for years about this.

21:05.980 --> 21:08.140
And it just worked flawlessly.

21:08.140 --> 21:10.300
I would imagine, Chris, that was one of the first things

21:10.300 --> 21:12.580
you changed as well.

21:12.580 --> 21:13.900
Yeah, I had to try it.

21:13.900 --> 21:15.180
You know what?

21:15.180 --> 21:17.540
Much like Breeze recently, though,

21:17.540 --> 21:21.340
the recent improvements to the theme are so great,

21:21.340 --> 21:22.980
I decided to stick with the light mode.

21:22.980 --> 21:23.820
What?

21:23.820 --> 21:25.580
I don't even know you anymore.

21:25.580 --> 21:26.220
I know.

21:26.220 --> 21:28.980
I'm going to have to pull the dark theme off of the website.

21:28.980 --> 21:29.780
It's a new era.

21:29.780 --> 21:31.700
I'm going to have to implement that standard.

21:31.700 --> 21:33.400
This is actually one of the great things

21:33.400 --> 21:37.820
about using dark mode now in GNOME 42 is the websites that

21:37.820 --> 21:41.220
support this standard will also detect if you have dark mode

21:41.220 --> 21:41.940
or light mode.

21:41.940 --> 21:44.020
And it's just so slick.

21:44.020 --> 21:45.580
It's so slick.

21:45.580 --> 21:46.300
It's so slick.

21:46.300 --> 21:50.060
So if you want, you change it in GNOME Appearance

21:50.060 --> 21:51.140
to either light or dark.

21:51.140 --> 21:54.620
And then a lot of websites now just automatically detect it.

21:54.620 --> 21:55.300
Anyways.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.780
I mean, I think that's one of the things

21:56.780 --> 21:59.140
about the recent releases of GNOME,

21:59.140 --> 22:01.460
and particularly this one, that it just

22:01.460 --> 22:03.500
feels like a first class environment because it's

22:03.500 --> 22:05.500
something that you might be used to or have seen

22:05.500 --> 22:06.480
on other platforms.

22:06.480 --> 22:09.060
And the more of those that land on the Linux side of the fence,

22:09.060 --> 22:11.820
it just means people won't be complaining or missing

22:11.820 --> 22:13.900
those features when they come on over.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.060
Another thing, Chris, you suggested that I play with,

22:16.060 --> 22:20.680
since you knew I was a deep KDE user, was the extensions.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.940
And I had a deep hesitation there.

22:23.940 --> 22:27.740
And you seemed really excited about it and suggested a few.

22:27.740 --> 22:31.500
But my hesitation was that it felt as though extensions,

22:31.500 --> 22:34.140
if they were needed to get a desktop running, that

22:34.140 --> 22:37.300
was helpful, that maybe there was something missing

22:37.300 --> 22:39.280
in kind of the vanilla offering.

22:39.280 --> 22:41.580
I think Brent's been listening to Michael Dominic again.

22:41.580 --> 22:42.940
Oh, no.

22:42.940 --> 22:45.340
Yeah, this is definitely a soapbox of Michael Dominic

22:45.340 --> 22:45.900
on Coder Radio.

22:45.900 --> 22:46.460
Is it really?

22:46.460 --> 22:47.500
This is definitely.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.980
Yeah, well, this is actually kind of a sensitive issue.

22:49.980 --> 22:52.460
This is kind of a touchy topic, I feel like.

22:52.460 --> 22:55.020
And it's one that the GNOME community is still kind of

22:55.020 --> 22:56.980
sorting out, in my opinion.

22:56.980 --> 22:57.900
That's just my opinion.

22:57.900 --> 23:00.540
Well, it's kind of a different way to do extensions, too.

23:00.540 --> 23:02.660
There's not like a tight-knit extensions

23:02.660 --> 23:04.660
API that provides this set of capabilities.

23:04.660 --> 23:07.060
It's sort of like, well, you can do a lot

23:07.060 --> 23:08.340
with these GNOME extensions.

23:08.340 --> 23:11.100
And that means sometimes they do too much or are written poorly

23:11.100 --> 23:13.820
and can therefore impact the stability of the system.

23:13.820 --> 23:16.140
But they can also transform the desktop in a way

23:16.140 --> 23:18.100
that you don't always see on other platforms.

23:18.100 --> 23:21.500
It's pretty common to say you install four or five

23:21.500 --> 23:21.980
extensions.

23:21.980 --> 23:24.780
It's pretty common for one of them just to not even work.

23:24.780 --> 23:26.580
That's not too unusual.

23:26.580 --> 23:29.900
We all know of one that I tried that didn't work,

23:29.900 --> 23:31.180
so I just had to disable it.

23:31.180 --> 23:32.540
We were talking about it this morning.

23:32.540 --> 23:35.340
And that happens, and that's not a great experience.

23:35.340 --> 23:39.860
But Brent, I think your core argument or question

23:39.860 --> 23:41.660
is one that a lot of people raise is,

23:41.660 --> 23:43.540
should I even need to add this stuff,

23:43.540 --> 23:44.900
or should I even add this stuff?

23:44.900 --> 23:49.220
And I think that's a decision that ultimately each user has

23:49.220 --> 23:50.140
to make.

23:50.140 --> 23:53.060
And ultimately, I'm grateful that we still have the choice.

23:53.060 --> 23:54.500
I think that's where I fall on it.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.540
I think I kind of agree with you.

23:56.540 --> 23:57.960
Now, since we're talking about it,

23:57.960 --> 24:00.580
it reminds me of extensions, say, in Firefox.

24:00.580 --> 24:03.340
And it's much the same.

24:03.340 --> 24:05.740
There are a few that I can't live without

24:05.740 --> 24:09.460
and that are amazing and that need to kind of earn your trust

24:09.460 --> 24:11.220
from using it for a bit.

24:11.220 --> 24:13.660
And the one you suggested that I install right away

24:13.660 --> 24:15.540
was the app indicator support.

24:15.540 --> 24:18.500
And that actually did make me feel right at home.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.260
So thank you.

24:19.260 --> 24:23.220
And I think I would need that to use GNOME 42.

24:23.220 --> 24:26.700
And it seemed well supported and well used.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.960
I kind of scrolled through the list of other extensions.

24:28.960 --> 24:32.940
And some of them felt, hmm, suspect maybe.

24:32.940 --> 24:36.300
There were some that were trying to, anyways.

24:36.300 --> 24:41.700
There were some that just, my red flag bells ringing

24:41.700 --> 24:43.820
sort of kept coming off, and there was no way

24:43.820 --> 24:44.900
I was going to install those.

24:44.900 --> 24:45.980
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

24:45.980 --> 24:47.460
Yeah, I'd follow you on that.

24:47.460 --> 24:52.580
I'd say for someone who's, I consider myself adventurous,

24:52.580 --> 24:53.660
but also cautious.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.100
So I'd say just kind of do some reading

24:56.100 --> 24:58.420
and maybe play with them on a system that's not

24:58.420 --> 25:00.100
your production machine at first.

25:00.100 --> 25:02.100
Altair, you just made a great point in the IRC.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.260
And that is, it's sort of a double-edged sword.

25:04.260 --> 25:07.180
Having no API means that extensions

25:07.180 --> 25:08.780
can kind of do anything, right?

25:08.780 --> 25:11.900
There's no limit, which is not necessarily maybe

25:11.900 --> 25:13.380
a great thing.

25:13.380 --> 25:15.820
Yes, it's like a weird thing because part

25:15.820 --> 25:17.140
of the reasons they're so powerful

25:17.140 --> 25:18.620
is like they can touch anything.

25:18.620 --> 25:20.460
But also, it's damn cool.

25:20.460 --> 25:22.980
If we're like, it's kind of similar to how

25:22.980 --> 25:26.740
the old Firefox extensions used to work,

25:26.740 --> 25:28.820
where they could do amazing things

25:28.820 --> 25:32.020
and all kinds of awesome stuff.

25:32.020 --> 25:34.700
But once they started migrating things over

25:34.700 --> 25:37.700
to web extensions, a lot of the functionality was removed.

25:37.700 --> 25:42.780
And having to maintain an API is a really, really hard thing.

25:42.780 --> 25:44.620
And coming up with the boundaries

25:44.620 --> 25:48.780
and the capabilities of what you're allowing to do

25:48.780 --> 25:53.620
is a very hard thing that requires lots of resources.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.340
That makes sense.

25:54.340 --> 25:55.260
Yeah.

25:55.260 --> 25:57.460
Yeah, and I could see there being some pushback

25:57.460 --> 25:58.740
if there was an effort around that

25:58.740 --> 26:02.300
because this super popular extension would break.

26:02.300 --> 26:04.660
But at the same time, you have to think maybe long term

26:04.660 --> 26:06.180
that would be the best, right, Brent?

26:06.180 --> 26:08.580
Because I think you're kind of coming at this as a plasma

26:08.580 --> 26:11.500
user, where plasmoids are built into the desktop experience

26:11.500 --> 26:12.620
and you can pull down more.

26:12.620 --> 26:16.260
And it sort of feels maybe, is safer the right term?

26:16.260 --> 26:17.500
You know, I was toying with that.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.700
I think at first I felt it was safer.

26:19.700 --> 26:22.080
But then I was like, well, maybe it's just more familiar.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.620
And it felt like it was more integrated as well.

26:24.620 --> 26:28.020
Like for instance, the GNOME extensions application

26:28.020 --> 26:29.500
wasn't even installed by default.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.300
So I had to kind of install that stuff

26:31.300 --> 26:33.340
and go browse and find some on the web.

26:33.340 --> 26:35.900
So maybe it was the process that felt a little different

26:35.900 --> 26:37.620
or just that it wasn't familiar.

26:37.620 --> 26:39.980
But Chris, I know you've basically

26:39.980 --> 26:42.820
used extensions on your GNOME desktops for years.

26:42.820 --> 26:46.340
And I wondered how you felt about it in this new version.

26:46.340 --> 26:49.180
I always start with the absolute minimum possible

26:49.180 --> 26:50.940
whenever I do a new GNOME install.

26:50.940 --> 26:53.840
And I just kind of incrementally add the ones

26:53.840 --> 26:55.300
that I'd like to have.

26:55.300 --> 26:57.340
Although I admit I have a low threshold.

26:57.340 --> 27:00.460
Like I like having all my virtual desktops displayed up

27:00.460 --> 27:01.580
in the top bar.

27:01.580 --> 27:03.280
So I have a visual indicator where I'm at.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.740
So I'll turn that kind of stuff on.

27:04.740 --> 27:05.860
So it's kind of a low bar.

27:05.860 --> 27:08.860
But I also find that pretty much consistently

27:08.860 --> 27:12.620
with every GNOME release, I have less and less extensions

27:12.620 --> 27:14.740
that I find myself actually installing.

27:14.740 --> 27:16.780
Either they've made some improvement

27:16.780 --> 27:19.620
or I've just learned to kind of adjust my workflow

27:19.620 --> 27:20.800
and we kind of met in the middle.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.240
And that seems to be pretty common.

27:22.240 --> 27:24.980
Like I'll give you, here's an example.

27:24.980 --> 27:29.980
I used to install this really handy screenshot extension

27:30.060 --> 27:31.460
that I thought was great.

27:31.460 --> 27:33.300
And I take screenshots all the time

27:33.300 --> 27:35.420
so I can send Wes stuff and bug him during the day.

27:35.420 --> 27:36.840
Like I gotta have a good screenshot tool

27:36.840 --> 27:38.400
so that way I can spam Wes.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.600
And I would install an extension for that

27:40.600 --> 27:41.980
right out of the box every time.

27:41.980 --> 27:45.040
And now in GNOME 42, they have this new screenshot

27:45.040 --> 27:47.420
experience, in my opinion, it's the best

27:47.420 --> 27:49.300
on any modern desktop out there.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.280
It's so clean, it's so quick.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.900
And I think like Spectacle on plasma

27:53.900 --> 27:55.380
is really great for screenshots

27:55.380 --> 27:57.460
and it has a lot of cool power options.

27:57.460 --> 28:01.100
But this is so simple and straightforward and smooth.

28:01.100 --> 28:01.920
Yeah, right.

28:01.920 --> 28:03.940
I mean, the UI is kind of just the right science

28:03.940 --> 28:07.860
without being in the way and video built right in.

28:07.860 --> 28:08.900
That was impressive.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.020
Yeah, that's so great.

28:10.020 --> 28:11.940
And that kind of stuff has just gotten better and better.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.700
Over the years, the other thing that landed

28:14.700 --> 28:16.440
that we used to have to do a little extra setup

28:16.440 --> 28:20.540
that's just now built in is the remote desktop stuff.

28:20.540 --> 28:23.320
We talked about this with GNOME 41

28:23.320 --> 28:25.460
and the bits were there, all the server,

28:25.460 --> 28:27.140
all the backend bits were there,

28:27.140 --> 28:30.580
but the front end UI bits to turn it on weren't there.

28:30.580 --> 28:35.080
And this remote desktop setup is a really great experience

28:35.080 --> 28:37.940
because it's taking essentially a Wayland session

28:37.940 --> 28:40.140
and piping it over RDP.

28:40.140 --> 28:41.980
And so you use an RDP client

28:41.980 --> 28:44.480
to connect to your GNOME desktop.

28:44.480 --> 28:49.480
And the GNOME desktop is depending on your RDP client,

28:50.660 --> 28:53.700
extremely responsive in that remote session.

28:53.700 --> 28:57.140
And so I have used this combined with tail scale

28:57.140 --> 29:00.600
as like my go-to remote solution for Dylan's laptop now.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.460
And it's just great.

29:01.460 --> 29:02.300
Oh, really?

29:02.300 --> 29:03.420
That's your go-to, wow.

29:03.420 --> 29:05.600
Yeah, cause he's always on the tail scale network

29:05.600 --> 29:08.620
and you and I figured out how to turn on the RDP stuff

29:08.620 --> 29:11.460
before the bits were exposed and it was too late.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.620
We'd seen everything, so I just got it going.

29:13.620 --> 29:15.180
And now that this is just built in

29:15.180 --> 29:17.460
and you can just check the boxes available to anybody.

29:17.460 --> 29:20.240
So you go in there now to the sharing section

29:20.240 --> 29:21.940
where you maybe in the past would like turn on

29:21.940 --> 29:23.740
a VNC sharing stuff,

29:23.740 --> 29:26.020
but now you can take advantage of RDP,

29:26.020 --> 29:27.780
which is Microsoft's remote desktop protocol.

29:27.780 --> 29:29.740
Fine, I'll give you access.

29:29.740 --> 29:32.020
It's so nice.

29:32.020 --> 29:35.120
And it's just another example of a feature

29:35.120 --> 29:38.120
that I'd never really thought was gonna get integrated.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.700
That's just now built in and it solves that problem

29:40.700 --> 29:43.420
of how am I gonna get remote access

29:43.420 --> 29:46.660
to this desktop session that's on Wayland, right?

29:46.660 --> 29:48.900
Because when we switched to Wayland,

29:48.900 --> 29:52.900
we lost a lot of the remote desktop features of X

29:52.900 --> 29:55.920
and this is bringing it back in kind of a modern way

29:55.920 --> 29:57.740
that you can run on anything.

29:57.740 --> 30:00.140
You can get an RDP client on an iPad, right?

30:00.140 --> 30:02.500
And you can have your GNOME desktop on an iPad now.

30:02.500 --> 30:03.780
It's so great.

30:03.780 --> 30:05.020
Mini Mac, now you've got a question

30:05.020 --> 30:07.420
that has plagued GNOME users for a long time.

30:07.420 --> 30:09.860
Indeed, so what about the SysTray?

30:09.860 --> 30:11.980
Is there still an extension for that?

30:11.980 --> 30:15.180
Because I have some, I don't know, do you have a VPN?

30:15.180 --> 30:17.540
If you have a VPN and you have that VPN icon

30:17.540 --> 30:19.980
in the SysTray that you could just click on it

30:19.980 --> 30:22.040
and then you have a VPN connection.

30:22.040 --> 30:25.340
Or I have a Flameshot, which is a screenshot editor

30:25.340 --> 30:27.460
with a beautiful SysTray and everything.

30:27.460 --> 30:28.940
Is there an extension for that?

30:28.940 --> 30:31.100
There's a couple of SysTray extensions.

30:31.100 --> 30:33.720
If you have an app that still uses that older API,

30:33.720 --> 30:35.060
there are a couple of options.

30:35.060 --> 30:36.740
And the one that we've all been,

30:36.740 --> 30:38.060
I don't know if you tried this one, Wes,

30:38.060 --> 30:39.580
but Brent and I were using the one

30:39.580 --> 30:42.260
that essentially just implements the Plasma Desktop API.

30:42.260 --> 30:43.100
Oh, nice.

30:43.100 --> 30:44.020
Yeah, it works, right?

30:44.020 --> 30:46.340
And thankfully, that extension's already available

30:46.340 --> 30:47.940
for GNOME 42.

30:47.940 --> 30:50.900
There's actually a fair amount that are good to go

30:50.900 --> 30:51.820
before it's even final.

30:51.820 --> 30:53.700
Right, and I think that maybe is one thing you can,

30:53.700 --> 30:54.540
you'll learn a little,

30:54.540 --> 30:56.180
if you spend a little while in the ecosystem,

30:56.180 --> 30:58.580
sort of figuring out what extensions,

30:58.580 --> 31:00.580
A, are more sensitive to being broken,

31:00.580 --> 31:01.420
release to release,

31:01.420 --> 31:04.140
and then also which ones really stay on top of things.

31:04.140 --> 31:06.860
All right, boy, I feel like this Libidwadia topic,

31:06.860 --> 31:09.500
we could really, we could spend a whole episode on,

31:09.500 --> 31:11.500
but GNOME 42 is the first version

31:11.500 --> 31:15.300
that puts it at the heart of what defines the look.

31:15.300 --> 31:18.500
And it's an updated toolkit that brings just,

31:18.500 --> 31:21.380
I think the final level of polish that I was waiting for.

31:22.260 --> 31:24.140
There was a lot of misunderstanding

31:24.140 --> 31:26.300
about the direction of theming on GNOME.

31:26.300 --> 31:30.180
And during the kind of heat of that moment,

31:30.180 --> 31:32.220
I kind of had the realization that

31:32.220 --> 31:34.580
if GNOME's default look,

31:34.580 --> 31:37.020
the upstream look of GNOME,

31:37.020 --> 31:38.900
was just good enough,

31:38.900 --> 31:41.700
maybe we wouldn't wanna theme anymore.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.860
And as someone who has literally themed

31:44.860 --> 31:47.420
every version of GNOME since two,

31:47.420 --> 31:49.660
and every version of GNOME three,

31:49.660 --> 31:50.980
and I themed GNOME 40,

31:50.980 --> 31:53.940
and I re-themed GNOME 41,

31:53.940 --> 31:55.980
I am here to tell you,

31:55.980 --> 31:58.180
starting with GNOME 42,

31:58.180 --> 32:00.300
I'm going with the default theme from now on.

32:00.300 --> 32:01.660
They've really nailed it.

32:01.660 --> 32:04.700
The default theme is polished.

32:04.700 --> 32:06.420
It's so well done.

32:06.420 --> 32:07.980
And with the global dark mode

32:07.980 --> 32:11.060
that is now just supported by the entire project,

32:12.100 --> 32:13.940
there are aspects to the UI

32:13.940 --> 32:16.540
that are more visible and usable

32:16.540 --> 32:19.220
than they were with previous dark mode themes.

32:19.220 --> 32:20.820
It really does make a difference

32:20.820 --> 32:23.380
to have the entire desktop environment supported,

32:23.380 --> 32:25.500
and to have the app start updating to support it.

32:25.500 --> 32:28.620
And we're starting to see a lot of apps in the ecosystem

32:28.620 --> 32:30.620
try to target GTK4 now.

32:30.620 --> 32:34.900
And that combined with Libidwadia and the global dark theme,

32:34.900 --> 32:37.740
it really comes together to a level of polish

32:37.740 --> 32:39.780
that I've never seen before on the Linux desktop

32:39.780 --> 32:41.860
in 20 plus years that I've been using it.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.420
It's a remarkable release for that version alone,

32:44.420 --> 32:49.420
so much so that even though you could get Ubuntu 22.04

32:49.620 --> 32:51.700
with the triple buffering patch that we'll talk about

32:51.700 --> 32:54.980
that would probably make it a slightly faster experience,

32:54.980 --> 32:56.540
I still am really suggesting

32:56.540 --> 32:58.660
that perhaps you try Fedora 36 instead

32:58.660 --> 33:01.620
because they're shipping the default theme.

33:01.620 --> 33:03.420
And the default theme is so good

33:03.420 --> 33:04.940
that I don't think you should miss out

33:04.940 --> 33:06.580
on the GNOME 42 experience.

33:06.580 --> 33:08.260
That's my advice now,

33:08.260 --> 33:13.140
is go with Vanilla Gnome because it looks the best.

33:13.140 --> 33:16.060
That's a huge change.

33:16.060 --> 33:17.060
That's a huge change.

33:17.060 --> 33:18.020
Yeah, wow.

33:18.020 --> 33:19.060
I mean, you-

33:19.060 --> 33:19.900
They've nailed it.

33:19.900 --> 33:21.100
That's kind of like one of the first things you would do

33:21.100 --> 33:24.060
is sort of get things looking decent.

33:24.060 --> 33:26.180
It's a huge change.

33:26.180 --> 33:27.180
It's so great.

33:27.180 --> 33:29.580
It really is great to be able to say that now.

33:29.580 --> 33:31.340
We do have some applications that have changed

33:31.340 --> 33:32.260
like G edit's gone.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.260
There's a new text editor.

33:33.260 --> 33:35.980
And Carl, you saw a note about the new terminal app.

33:35.980 --> 33:36.820
I missed that.

33:36.820 --> 33:37.660
What was that?

33:37.660 --> 33:40.460
Yeah, it looks like there's a new GNOME console app

33:40.460 --> 33:41.860
on the Fedora 36 nightly.

33:41.860 --> 33:44.700
It's not installed by default, but it is in the repos.

33:44.700 --> 33:46.300
And from what I'm reading about it online,

33:46.300 --> 33:49.980
this looks to be a simple terminal emulator,

33:49.980 --> 33:51.460
not really to replace GNOME terminal,

33:51.460 --> 33:53.860
just for it's a console app

33:53.860 --> 33:56.380
for people that don't use the terminal that often

33:56.380 --> 33:58.140
is its own description.

33:58.140 --> 33:59.180
It seems really limited.

33:59.180 --> 34:01.780
It doesn't even have a settings that I can find.

34:01.780 --> 34:03.340
But one cool feature that it has is that

34:03.340 --> 34:04.860
when you elevate to root,

34:04.860 --> 34:07.380
the header bar turns a shade of red,

34:07.380 --> 34:08.900
which is pretty neat.

34:08.900 --> 34:09.900
That is console.

34:09.900 --> 34:10.740
Yeah, yeah.

34:10.740 --> 34:11.700
Danger.

34:11.700 --> 34:13.500
Danger, you're in the root zone.

34:13.500 --> 34:14.460
Oh yeah, look at that.

34:14.460 --> 34:15.300
Neat.

34:15.300 --> 34:17.940
Yeah, it's very similar to the feature

34:17.940 --> 34:21.060
that used to be present on SUSE Linux distributions

34:21.060 --> 34:23.980
way back with their customized GNOME 2 and KDE 4,

34:23.980 --> 34:26.820
where if you did privilege escalation,

34:26.820 --> 34:30.540
the terminal app itself changed to indicate very strongly

34:30.540 --> 34:32.100
that you were running as a super user

34:32.100 --> 34:33.140
and you should be careful.

34:33.140 --> 34:34.260
That's a good idea.

34:34.260 --> 34:35.100
That is a good idea.

34:35.100 --> 34:37.500
So I really liked Fedora 36.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.540
And last night or this morning,

34:39.540 --> 34:42.420
RC1 of GNOME 42 landed on my box.

34:42.420 --> 34:43.500
So that's been really nice.

34:43.500 --> 34:44.700
Brent, did you try it on Ubuntu

34:44.700 --> 34:45.860
or did you try it on Fedora?

34:45.860 --> 34:47.620
I tried Fedora, come on.

34:47.620 --> 34:48.460
Try something new.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.500
Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.060
Well, I'm not that familiar with Fedora,

34:52.060 --> 34:56.100
but our last foray into that was a good experience.

34:56.100 --> 34:57.380
So I thought, why not?

34:57.380 --> 35:00.380
Plus you were championing it quite strongly.

35:00.380 --> 35:02.860
So I figured I should go that way.

35:02.860 --> 35:04.820
And yeah, it was flawless.

35:04.820 --> 35:05.740
I didn't have any issues.

35:05.740 --> 35:06.940
I loved it, the whole thing.

35:06.940 --> 35:07.780
Wow.

35:07.780 --> 35:08.620
I know.

35:08.620 --> 35:09.780
Jeez, it's pretty- That's high priority.

35:09.780 --> 35:12.700
This is actually the smoothest Fedora beta I've ever run.

35:12.700 --> 35:16.220
Usually if I run the Fedora raw hide beta stuff

35:16.220 --> 35:17.660
for like more than two weeks,

35:17.660 --> 35:20.220
I usually, something crashes and burns.

35:20.220 --> 35:21.260
So I mean, it may still happen.

35:21.260 --> 35:23.740
Fedora 36 isn't final yet, so I may still get bit,

35:23.740 --> 35:25.980
but there is an argument to be made

35:25.980 --> 35:28.980
to try this on Ubuntu 2204 LTS when it ships

35:28.980 --> 35:32.340
because it was canonical staff

35:32.340 --> 35:33.780
that originally created this

35:33.780 --> 35:35.340
GNOME triple buffering support.

35:35.340 --> 35:39.100
And this triple buffering patch is nice

35:39.100 --> 35:41.060
for those of us maybe around Intel GPUs

35:41.060 --> 35:43.580
that are struggling a little bit to keep up

35:43.580 --> 35:45.860
with certain aspects of the GNOME desktop.

35:45.860 --> 35:48.080
And it causes the GPU to bump up

35:48.080 --> 35:49.380
into a higher performance state

35:49.380 --> 35:51.900
during this additional bursty work,

35:51.900 --> 35:54.220
and then kind of scale back down transparently.

35:54.220 --> 35:56.860
And I guess currently that's not happening.

35:56.860 --> 35:59.100
And you put this triple buffering patch in there

35:59.100 --> 36:01.860
and it's a noticeable improvement

36:01.860 --> 36:03.220
in the smoothness of the interface

36:03.220 --> 36:05.460
for those of us that are on integrated GPUs.

36:05.460 --> 36:06.700
I think I saw this mentioned something

36:06.700 --> 36:07.940
about Raspberry Pi is too,

36:07.940 --> 36:10.580
if you happen to be trying it on there.

36:10.580 --> 36:12.060
Hmm, hmm.

36:12.060 --> 36:13.780
So Canonical's decided they're gonna just go ahead

36:13.780 --> 36:15.860
and ship it in Ubuntu 2204

36:15.860 --> 36:19.020
because the patch just didn't land in time

36:19.020 --> 36:20.940
for 42, it seems.

36:20.940 --> 36:22.500
That's at least my current understanding.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.100
I'm very sad about this.

36:24.100 --> 36:26.380
I really, really wanted that to land.

36:26.380 --> 36:29.740
If it had landed, this truly would be the GNOME release

36:29.740 --> 36:31.740
that has everything we've been waiting for, right?

36:31.740 --> 36:33.540
Because even when 40 came along,

36:33.540 --> 36:35.420
like that was a big update,

36:35.420 --> 36:38.420
but we were like, okay, well, the transition to GTK4

36:38.420 --> 36:41.900
and we knew that Libido was in the far off distant future.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.020
And so it was like, okay, 40 is a big release,

36:44.020 --> 36:45.860
but there's like more coming.

36:45.860 --> 36:48.140
And basically everything is in 42

36:48.140 --> 36:49.940
except for that triple buffering patch.

36:49.940 --> 36:50.780
So it's like, okay, well,

36:50.780 --> 36:52.740
now I'm gonna be waiting a little bit for an update,

36:52.740 --> 36:54.900
but I actually really have no complaints

36:54.900 --> 36:57.580
performance-wise, so it's not really a big deal.

36:57.580 --> 37:00.460
Now I'm wondering how to put my own janky build together.

37:00.460 --> 37:01.300
Jeez.

37:01.300 --> 37:02.340
I'm a little concerned

37:02.340 --> 37:04.060
that you're in the recovery environment right now

37:04.060 --> 37:05.340
on the Mac over there, Wes.

37:05.340 --> 37:07.500
I take it that the old Asahi Linux install

37:07.500 --> 37:08.820
has hit yet another bump in the road.

37:08.820 --> 37:12.180
Yeah, it's not quite going so well yet.

37:12.180 --> 37:13.220
It is alpha.

37:13.220 --> 37:14.060
Ugh.

37:14.060 --> 37:16.780
So why are you in the recovery environment?

37:16.780 --> 37:19.060
Well, we were having some issues

37:19.060 --> 37:21.220
shrinking the partitioning

37:21.220 --> 37:22.860
so that we can make some room for Linux.

37:22.860 --> 37:24.020
And so I thought,

37:24.020 --> 37:25.460
maybe if we try it from this environment,

37:25.460 --> 37:26.300
it might go a little better.

37:26.300 --> 37:30.060
Of course I can inspect the APFS volume and make sure.

37:30.060 --> 37:30.900
Oh yeah.

37:30.900 --> 37:32.100
Make sure there's no issues there to start with.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.940
Do one of them verifies that they do there, right?

37:33.940 --> 37:34.780
Right.

37:34.780 --> 37:36.420
Do a verify of the old file system

37:36.420 --> 37:39.380
and then you could resize it in the Disk Utility app

37:39.380 --> 37:41.140
and that probably won't lose all my data.

37:41.140 --> 37:42.180
So that's the way I think.

37:42.180 --> 37:43.980
I'm not actually sure how to resize it.

37:43.980 --> 37:45.140
I did copy the command.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.940
So we'll, you know, one way or another.

37:46.940 --> 37:48.540
All right, here, I'll buy you a few minutes.

37:48.540 --> 37:53.220
Hey, I got a live stream coming up on March 31st.

37:53.220 --> 37:55.500
So join me for a live Q&A

37:55.500 --> 37:57.700
and I'm gonna give away some Satoshis

37:57.700 --> 37:59.340
to help people set up their Boost wallets

37:59.340 --> 38:03.020
because I really think we have a window of time here.

38:03.020 --> 38:05.340
And so go grab yourself a new podcast app

38:05.340 --> 38:06.620
at newpodcastapps.com.

38:06.620 --> 38:08.620
We recommend the Fountain app.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.740
Cast-O-Matic on iOS is really great as well

38:10.740 --> 38:11.820
and BlueWallet's available.

38:11.820 --> 38:14.580
But I think Fountain is the best experience

38:14.580 --> 38:15.980
and I wanna help you get started

38:15.980 --> 38:17.140
by giving away some stats

38:17.140 --> 38:19.100
that have essentially been sent in by the audience.

38:19.100 --> 38:19.940
We'll pull them all together

38:19.940 --> 38:24.180
and I'll give out some of them hot Satoshis.

38:24.180 --> 38:25.940
I hear you're even using Fountain

38:25.940 --> 38:28.020
for some of your day-to-day podcasts listening.

38:28.020 --> 38:29.540
I have, yeah, I've switched over now

38:29.540 --> 38:31.020
because here's what my thinking is,

38:31.020 --> 38:33.460
is I think we have an opportunity

38:33.460 --> 38:35.340
to build out a peer-to-peer network

38:35.340 --> 38:37.980
of Lightning connected Linux users.

38:37.980 --> 38:39.620
We start by, you know, obviously,

38:39.620 --> 38:40.900
I have some skin in this game.

38:40.900 --> 38:41.860
This benefits me,

38:41.860 --> 38:44.500
but we start by supporting independent media.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.300
I'm saying the podcast audience, right?

38:46.300 --> 38:48.420
We build out, okay, so let's just say like,

38:48.420 --> 38:51.300
let's say the show has tens and tens of thousands,

38:51.300 --> 38:55.220
five tens, maybe six tens of thousands of listeners, right?

38:55.220 --> 38:56.780
And let's just say in theory,

38:56.780 --> 38:58.500
I can talk a thousand of you

38:58.500 --> 39:00.900
into supporting somebody who's been making content

39:00.900 --> 39:02.500
for you for 15 years.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.180
And let's say I can get a handful of you

39:04.180 --> 39:07.180
who see the value in how hard we've been working nonstop

39:07.180 --> 39:09.340
every single week for 15 years straight.

39:09.340 --> 39:12.460
And I can convince maybe 2000 people to switch over

39:12.460 --> 39:14.460
and start getting on the Lightning network

39:14.460 --> 39:18.100
and supporting the shows through value for value and boosts.

39:19.020 --> 39:22.100
So what happens when the next Linux podcaster realizes

39:22.100 --> 39:26.100
that 2000 people who listened to the largest Linux podcast

39:26.100 --> 39:28.100
are all now wired up to the Lightning network?

39:28.100 --> 39:30.140
Well, that new Linux podcaster that comes online

39:30.140 --> 39:33.180
is gonna immediately start also getting boosts.

39:33.180 --> 39:35.020
They're gonna have a built-in audience already, right?

39:35.020 --> 39:37.340
So there's an immediate network effect amongst me

39:37.340 --> 39:39.980
and my friends once they figure it out.

39:39.980 --> 39:42.500
But then what happens when we've got three,

39:42.500 --> 39:45.380
5,000 people now on this network

39:45.380 --> 39:48.820
and the first free software project that we care about

39:48.820 --> 39:50.300
comes on the network.

39:50.300 --> 39:53.460
That's 5,000 Linux loving users

39:53.460 --> 39:54.900
that are already on the network

39:54.900 --> 39:56.660
and ready to support that project.

39:56.660 --> 39:59.460
And all they have to do is set up a Lightning node.

39:59.460 --> 40:01.300
I think it all starts here.

40:01.300 --> 40:03.420
We have the network effect to generate this.

40:03.420 --> 40:04.740
Like this is actually something

40:04.740 --> 40:06.100
the show can move the needle on

40:06.100 --> 40:08.300
for the first time in what feels like forever now.

40:08.300 --> 40:10.300
So let's get together,

40:10.300 --> 40:13.940
join me on the live stream, jblive.tv, March 31st,

40:13.940 --> 40:15.140
and I'll send out some stats.

40:15.140 --> 40:19.020
I mean, I'm not like Elon Musk over here,

40:19.020 --> 40:20.380
but I wanna help you get started on this.

40:20.380 --> 40:22.980
And I recognize that actually getting something

40:22.980 --> 40:26.340
in that wallet is like the barrier to entry right now.

40:26.340 --> 40:27.180
It just is.

40:27.180 --> 40:28.620
And I really believe in this.

40:28.620 --> 40:31.380
So I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is on this.

40:31.380 --> 40:32.620
And so just imagine a day

40:32.620 --> 40:34.340
where this starts to take off, right?

40:34.340 --> 40:37.660
So go grab a new podcast app at newpodcastapps.com,

40:37.660 --> 40:39.460
get in on the boosts, send the show some boosts.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.020
Let's start playing with this.

40:41.020 --> 40:42.460
Also, I think the other thing I wanna do

40:42.460 --> 40:44.460
during that live stream is I'd love to help anybody

40:44.460 --> 40:46.740
who's had trouble getting on our matrix server.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.620
If you've been trying to like get on matrix

40:48.620 --> 40:50.220
or you've been thinking about setting up matrix

40:50.220 --> 40:52.340
and joining the Jupiter broadcasting matrix,

40:52.340 --> 40:54.380
I wanna help you do that during this live stream as well.

40:54.380 --> 40:58.980
So it's a Q and A, anything goes, ask me anything.

40:58.980 --> 41:01.260
I'd love to get my friends to come hang out with me guys.

41:01.260 --> 41:03.660
And also I'm gonna be giving out some stats

41:03.660 --> 41:05.980
to people who are setting up a new podcast app wallet

41:05.980 --> 41:08.540
and wanna help do some boosting.

41:08.540 --> 41:11.580
And last but not least, we'll just hang out and chat

41:11.580 --> 41:13.460
and maybe get some people on our matrix system as well.

41:13.460 --> 41:15.620
So it's gonna be 4 p.m. Seattle time,

41:15.620 --> 41:18.980
7 p.m. New York time, 11 p.m. London,

41:18.980 --> 41:22.420
March 31st at jblive.tv.

41:22.420 --> 41:23.580
I'd love to see you there.

41:23.580 --> 41:27.620
We got a little bit of feedback

41:27.620 --> 41:28.740
and a whole bunch of boosts.

41:28.740 --> 41:32.600
So first for the feedback, we got a listener asking,

41:32.600 --> 41:35.060
I'm interested in exploring the Fedora ecosystem

41:35.060 --> 41:38.020
and I would consider moving my Arch jellyfin Docker

41:38.020 --> 41:41.900
NAS Frankenstein machine to a more stable platform.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.900
Sounds like they've been listening to us too much.

41:43.900 --> 41:44.740
Amazing.

41:44.740 --> 41:47.540
Is CentOS Streams something that one can let run

41:47.540 --> 41:50.940
with automated updates and get away with monthly updates

41:50.940 --> 41:53.700
like a big Pac-Man upgrade?

41:53.700 --> 41:54.940
I think that's a great question.

41:54.940 --> 41:56.180
It's one that I, of course,

41:56.180 --> 41:57.820
everybody's gonna have an interpretation on,

41:57.820 --> 42:00.060
but Neil, you wanna put your name on the line

42:00.060 --> 42:02.140
and give an official recommendation,

42:02.140 --> 42:04.180
quote unquote, official.

42:04.180 --> 42:06.060
As official as unofficial gets?

42:06.060 --> 42:07.180
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

42:07.180 --> 42:08.360
Go ahead.

42:08.360 --> 42:11.860
So I've actually been doing this now for a year.

42:11.860 --> 42:15.780
I've been running CentOS Stream on a couple of boxes

42:15.780 --> 42:18.220
with DNF automatic configured using Cockpit.

42:18.220 --> 42:21.100
Like there's, you can activate Cockpit, install it,

42:21.100 --> 42:22.980
and from within the web UI,

42:22.980 --> 42:24.420
you can configure automatic updates.

42:24.420 --> 42:27.580
I have it update every Sunday at 3 a.m.

42:27.580 --> 42:30.420
and it reboots itself and brings everything back online

42:30.420 --> 42:33.340
every Sunday, every week without fail,

42:33.340 --> 42:34.460
no problem at all.

42:34.460 --> 42:35.900
And it's been doing this since, okay,

42:35.900 --> 42:37.940
when did I actually set this machine?

42:37.940 --> 42:39.180
June, late June.

42:39.180 --> 42:40.860
And nothing's blown up in your face yet?

42:40.860 --> 42:42.380
No, it's been totally fine.

42:42.380 --> 42:45.920
It's been phenomenal and the experience is pretty good.

42:45.920 --> 42:49.340
Like I can't say the same thing about the desktop.

42:49.340 --> 42:53.140
The desktop experience really only solidified in the fall,

42:53.140 --> 42:58.140
but the server experience has been bang up awesome

42:58.820 --> 43:00.180
pretty much since June.

43:00.180 --> 43:04.380
And I mean, even the new Podman 4.0 is there.

43:04.380 --> 43:07.860
The Cockpit management of containers through Podman

43:07.860 --> 43:10.840
is present, Cockpit machines is there.

43:10.840 --> 43:12.580
So if you wanna, if it's a bare metal server

43:12.580 --> 43:14.240
and you wanna also manage a mixture of virtual machines

43:14.240 --> 43:16.940
and containers, that's all present.

43:16.940 --> 43:19.420
It's super solid, works great.

43:19.420 --> 43:22.380
And I really have no complaints about it.

43:22.380 --> 43:25.820
Of course, I'm working on CentOS Stream 9 Hyperscale.

43:25.820 --> 43:28.440
And once I've got more of those pieces laid down,

43:28.440 --> 43:31.700
I plan to migrate that machine to Hyperscale,

43:31.700 --> 43:33.380
but that's because I like to eat my own dog food

43:33.380 --> 43:35.160
and I think my stuff is awesome,

43:35.160 --> 43:38.340
but I've been running vanilla CentOS Stream 9

43:38.340 --> 43:40.980
for almost a year now and it's been fine.

43:40.980 --> 43:42.100
All right, that's great.

43:42.100 --> 43:45.300
I also think it would be more than fine,

43:45.300 --> 43:47.180
especially he's coming from Arch, right?

43:47.180 --> 43:50.400
So Fedora would even be like a scale back

43:50.400 --> 43:51.660
in the terms of changes,

43:51.660 --> 43:54.600
but I actually think CentOS strikes the right balance there.

43:54.600 --> 43:56.820
If you think of CentOS Stream 9

43:56.820 --> 44:00.420
as a continuation of the Fedora 34 code stream

44:00.420 --> 44:04.420
for many more years, then you will be fine.

44:04.420 --> 44:07.680
Like if you liked what Fedora Linux 34 offered

44:07.680 --> 44:10.920
from Fedora Workstation 34 minus the Butterfest stuff,

44:12.420 --> 44:15.380
and having some of the light touch enhancements

44:15.380 --> 44:18.800
and backports of enhancements and neat things

44:18.800 --> 44:23.000
that Red Hat and the community have worked on in 35 and in 36

44:23.000 --> 44:25.380
and you just want a stabilized platform

44:25.380 --> 44:28.100
with a good balance between feature enhancements

44:28.100 --> 44:30.640
and stability, then you're gonna have a nice time

44:30.640 --> 44:31.740
on CentOS Stream 9.

44:31.740 --> 44:35.020
And if you want to, and CentOS Stream 9 is supported

44:35.020 --> 44:38.740
for the quote unquote full support phase

44:38.740 --> 44:41.460
of the RHEL lifecycle, which is five and a half years.

44:41.460 --> 44:42.540
That's pretty good, yeah.

44:42.540 --> 44:43.900
That is, especially for free.

44:43.900 --> 44:46.660
Right, and once you're past that,

44:46.660 --> 44:49.420
you could either use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9

44:49.420 --> 44:52.740
genuine article to get a full 10 year lifecycle,

44:52.740 --> 44:54.300
and there'll probably be RHEL rebuilds

44:54.300 --> 44:56.820
like Alma Linux or whatever that you could use

44:56.820 --> 44:58.620
if you want to go that route instead.

44:58.620 --> 45:00.100
Sure, yeah, yeah.

45:00.100 --> 45:02.100
Now I want to make it clear,

45:02.100 --> 45:03.700
because he is coming from Arch, Carl,

45:03.700 --> 45:05.160
we should probably make a little disclaimer

45:05.160 --> 45:08.380
that he shouldn't expect this to be a rolling distro.

45:08.380 --> 45:11.860
Right, yeah, we're still seeing misconceptions

45:11.860 --> 45:13.420
in the community.

45:13.420 --> 45:16.100
Some of it caused by the own CentOS messaging,

45:16.100 --> 45:19.300
but CentOS Stream is not a real rolling release.

45:19.300 --> 45:20.700
Like most people think of it,

45:20.700 --> 45:23.380
it's gonna stay on the same major version nine,

45:23.380 --> 45:25.180
and the updates you see are going to be

45:25.180 --> 45:28.420
the same updates you'd see within a RHEL major version.

45:28.420 --> 45:32.160
So really the big change is that there's no minor versions,

45:32.160 --> 45:33.760
but you're not gonna wake up one day

45:33.760 --> 45:35.620
and have RHEL 10 content on there.

45:35.620 --> 45:38.260
It's still gonna be what you see in RHEL 9,

45:38.260 --> 45:40.020
and only the kind of updates you'd see

45:40.020 --> 45:42.680
going from say 9.0 to 9.1

45:42.680 --> 45:44.620
are the updates you'll see on that system.

45:44.620 --> 45:46.260
Yeah, yeah, thanks for making that clear.

45:46.260 --> 45:48.220
I think that's good for people understanding.

45:48.220 --> 45:49.420
And you'll know when that's coming,

45:49.420 --> 45:50.840
because we'll be talking about it here on the show,

45:50.840 --> 45:53.020
so you'll have plenty of a heads up.

45:53.020 --> 45:58.020
And now, as the French say, it is time for Le Boost.

46:01.660 --> 46:03.800
Samuel Blair wrote in with a boost.

46:03.800 --> 46:06.140
Been listening for years, already supporting the show,

46:06.140 --> 46:08.540
but figured I would give this boost thing a try.

46:08.540 --> 46:09.840
Keep up the good content.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.420
Slow down a little if you need.

46:11.420 --> 46:13.500
The community is not going anywhere.

46:13.500 --> 46:15.400
Aw, well that's nice.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.340
Pew!

46:16.340 --> 46:19.860
Six days ago, 5,000 sats, thank you freak.

46:19.860 --> 46:21.860
Sadly, the lightning system does not work

46:21.860 --> 46:24.740
with the core contributorship.

46:24.740 --> 46:25.860
It'd be very cool, for example,

46:25.860 --> 46:27.420
to get access to an ad-free feed

46:27.420 --> 46:30.340
at greater than X sats per minute.

46:30.340 --> 46:31.160
What I'm going to do is play

46:31.160 --> 46:32.180
with the sats per minute settings

46:32.180 --> 46:34.160
and the occasional boost to get to around

46:34.160 --> 46:38.420
10 to $20 per month over all my podcasts that support it.

46:38.420 --> 46:39.940
Yeah, you know, there's a lot there that,

46:39.940 --> 46:41.800
A, we're not happy with with our current setup,

46:41.800 --> 46:43.500
because, well, this stuff's all new

46:43.500 --> 46:45.020
and not all of the various pieces

46:45.020 --> 46:46.220
that we've had to bolt together

46:46.220 --> 46:49.860
to make the membership stuff work supported right now.

46:49.860 --> 46:52.060
And then also just like, oh, this is kind of new stuff.

46:52.060 --> 46:54.860
And yeah, you could see a whole SAT powered,

46:54.860 --> 46:57.940
you know, lightning based membership system, maybe?

46:57.940 --> 46:59.060
I don't know, what do you think, Brent?

46:59.060 --> 47:00.580
Yeah, we've had a few people write in

47:00.580 --> 47:03.160
about this very problem, and I think they're totally right.

47:03.160 --> 47:05.360
Despite it being a little bit of an edge case,

47:05.360 --> 47:08.420
I think just wait and see.

47:08.420 --> 47:11.420
Like, this is progress that we're sort of

47:11.420 --> 47:13.100
in maybe some transitional phases.

47:13.100 --> 47:15.620
So, I mean, Wes, you've done a ton of work

47:15.620 --> 47:17.460
on the back end to try to like,

47:17.460 --> 47:19.380
literally, like you said, bolt things together.

47:19.380 --> 47:21.140
So, I think it's been working great,

47:21.140 --> 47:23.340
but there's always progress to be made.

47:24.220 --> 47:27.020
All right, well, Mollusk sent us a boost saying,

47:27.020 --> 47:30.780
great show, guys, been listening for over 10 years.

47:30.780 --> 47:34.320
And I'm glad to see you guys in Bryce Podcasting 2.0.

47:34.320 --> 47:36.680
Keep up the good work.

47:36.680 --> 47:38.540
Our next one, DG Wolf writes in,

47:38.540 --> 47:40.820
thanks for revisiting Jellyfin, guys.

47:40.820 --> 47:44.080
I tried it years ago, but it was a little rough.

47:44.080 --> 47:45.860
But he gave it another go after we talked about it,

47:45.860 --> 47:48.820
and it's now replacing his Plex server.

47:48.820 --> 47:49.660
How is that awesome?

47:49.660 --> 47:50.820
Wow, dang.

47:50.820 --> 47:52.100
Yeah, from North Carolina, too,

47:52.100 --> 47:53.700
so hopefully we'll see him at the meetup.

47:53.700 --> 47:54.540
We'll see him.

47:54.540 --> 47:56.300
Always good to hear some Jellyfin love, too, you know?

47:56.300 --> 47:57.800
I mean, it's maybe not for everyone,

47:57.800 --> 47:59.300
but it's come a long way.

48:00.160 --> 48:02.580
Scuba Steve, Scuba Steve, who's in the Mumble Room, too,

48:02.580 --> 48:04.700
so like getting double points today,

48:04.700 --> 48:06.840
four days ago sent us a boost that said,

48:06.840 --> 48:08.020
can't wait to see you guys in Raleigh.

48:08.020 --> 48:10.960
Oh, Scuba, you're gonna be in Raleigh, that's great.

48:10.960 --> 48:11.800
That's great.

48:11.800 --> 48:15.140
So, he asked what we think about Substack,

48:15.140 --> 48:16.660
which is, I think I'm gonna punt this question

48:16.660 --> 48:17.500
to Koda Radio.

48:17.500 --> 48:20.580
So, tune into Koda Radio for that one,

48:20.580 --> 48:22.580
because I think that's gonna be a good discussion

48:22.580 --> 48:23.780
between Mike and I.

48:23.780 --> 48:26.220
Hudson said five days ago,

48:26.220 --> 48:27.580
you know, the thing about value for value

48:27.580 --> 48:28.700
is that it gives you skin in the game.

48:28.700 --> 48:30.660
It incentivizes people to create quality feedback.

48:30.660 --> 48:32.240
Unlike a YouTube comment,

48:32.240 --> 48:34.900
if I send you guys 1,000 sats to make a comment,

48:34.900 --> 48:36.180
I'm gonna make sure it's thoughtful.

48:36.180 --> 48:37.940
Otherwise, I'm just wasting my money.

48:37.940 --> 48:42.140
Imagine this concept, but throughout all of the internet,

48:42.140 --> 48:45.240
it may be a potential way to clean up a lot of the junk

48:45.240 --> 48:47.820
and the noise on the internet.

48:47.820 --> 48:50.940
I am of a really mixed opinion on this, Hudson.

48:50.940 --> 48:54.340
I definitely have witnessed what you're saying firsthand.

48:55.340 --> 48:57.020
And yet, at the same time,

48:57.020 --> 49:00.020
I hate the idea of creating financial barriers

49:00.020 --> 49:02.660
to participate on the web.

49:02.660 --> 49:06.060
But I guess that's a little of an extreme view.

49:06.060 --> 49:07.980
That's probably not what would happen, right?

49:07.980 --> 49:10.100
You'd just get some places

49:10.100 --> 49:13.220
that ask for a little bit of value to participate

49:13.220 --> 49:16.780
to reduce the cost of harassment and spamming.

49:16.780 --> 49:21.660
And I'm watching this play out in real time at stacker.news.

49:21.660 --> 49:23.980
I mentioned this to you guys a couple of weeks ago.

49:23.980 --> 49:27.460
stacker.news is like Reddit,

49:27.460 --> 49:31.140
but you have sats, there's an incentive system

49:31.140 --> 49:34.740
around quality posts and quality comments.

49:34.740 --> 49:36.300
They're incentivized by a couple of sats,

49:36.300 --> 49:37.740
kind of like the boosts are.

49:37.740 --> 49:41.720
And I've been checking this site for about three weeks.

49:41.720 --> 49:43.420
And what's interesting is,

49:43.420 --> 49:46.340
you could cut out Reddit and Twitter altogether,

49:46.340 --> 49:48.760
avoid both those dumpster fires.

49:48.760 --> 49:52.100
And I'd say you'd still get 80% of the value

49:52.100 --> 49:55.180
without all of this stuff that sets you in right there.

49:55.180 --> 49:58.100
So it's like, if you're willing to miss out on some things,

49:58.100 --> 50:01.620
but still get most of the value of Twitter and Reddit,

50:01.620 --> 50:03.380
stacker.news has been really great.

50:03.380 --> 50:06.380
And I have to think it's because there is an incentive

50:06.380 --> 50:09.800
for quality content, but even more importantly,

50:09.800 --> 50:11.700
there's an incentive for high quality comments.

50:11.700 --> 50:15.980
So it's not just these crappy fights that happen.

50:15.980 --> 50:19.100
It's like people are providing additional source material

50:19.100 --> 50:19.940
and references.

50:19.940 --> 50:22.460
And yeah, that's been really cool.

50:22.460 --> 50:24.120
Yeah, it seems like it could still be vulnerable

50:24.120 --> 50:26.940
to sort of group think or other problems,

50:26.940 --> 50:27.780
higher level problems,

50:27.780 --> 50:29.620
but maybe you could address some of those lower level,

50:29.620 --> 50:32.460
just posting that, yeah, is it relevant?

50:32.460 --> 50:34.460
Or yeah, as you say, is fighting or-

50:34.460 --> 50:36.300
I think it's a nice social experiment.

50:36.300 --> 50:38.940
I don't know if I'm ready to see something like that be,

50:38.940 --> 50:41.240
like the concept be adopted everywhere.

50:41.240 --> 50:42.820
But I think it is an interesting experiment

50:42.820 --> 50:45.800
to watch a group do and see how it goes.

50:45.800 --> 50:47.820
That's stacker.news, if you want to check that out.

50:47.820 --> 50:48.960
I've been kind of following it.

50:48.960 --> 50:51.460
And I mean, it's definitely Bitcoin heavy

50:51.460 --> 50:52.280
and lightning heavy,

50:52.280 --> 50:53.740
but that happens to be things I'm interested in,

50:53.740 --> 50:54.820
but it's not just that stuff.

50:54.820 --> 50:56.680
It's like the stuff that would normally kind of be

50:56.680 --> 50:58.900
circulating that's popular and trending,

50:58.900 --> 51:01.260
but without all of the garbage.

51:01.260 --> 51:03.140
Anonymous sent us a boost six days ago,

51:03.140 --> 51:05.460
says it feels very good to be listening to your podcast

51:05.460 --> 51:08.300
and streaming in and streaming some stats back.

51:08.300 --> 51:09.980
It's quite literally value for value.

51:09.980 --> 51:11.580
I love it, and I could see doing it

51:11.580 --> 51:12.580
for free software one day.

51:12.580 --> 51:15.180
And I completely agree, Anonymous.

51:15.180 --> 51:17.900
I think that's going to be, that's where I see the shift,

51:17.900 --> 51:18.900
but we'll see.

51:18.900 --> 51:20.500
We'll see if we get there.

51:20.500 --> 51:21.340
It may happen.

51:21.340 --> 51:22.180
It may not.

51:22.180 --> 51:23.000
You know what?

51:23.000 --> 51:24.380
I may just be wasting my breath.

51:24.380 --> 51:25.220
We shall see.

51:27.820 --> 51:28.660
All right.

51:28.660 --> 51:29.480
Thank you for boosting everybody.

51:29.480 --> 51:31.500
But with the boost all boosted,

51:31.500 --> 51:34.500
Wes Payne, let's do a check-in on that MacBook Max.

51:34.500 --> 51:36.660
I know you've been in disk utility for the last few minutes.

51:36.660 --> 51:37.500
How's it going?

51:37.500 --> 51:38.980
Bad news.

51:38.980 --> 51:39.820
Uh-oh.

51:39.820 --> 51:42.420
It seems like you've got some kind of disk corruption

51:42.420 --> 51:43.260
going on here.

51:43.260 --> 51:44.580
Oh, I like how it's my problem all of a sudden.

51:44.580 --> 51:46.300
Well, I found it this way.

51:46.300 --> 51:47.860
At least you think I've already corrupted it somehow.

51:47.860 --> 51:49.340
I'm surprised you haven't fixed it already.

51:49.340 --> 51:50.180
That's all.

51:50.180 --> 51:51.000
That's all.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.180
Yeah, well, I've rebooted it into the recovery environment,

51:53.180 --> 51:55.820
running first aid on it from disk utility,

51:55.820 --> 51:59.820
and all I get is this pop-up here with the error sign saying.

51:59.820 --> 52:02.020
So a file system, now I don't even understand

52:02.020 --> 52:03.620
how that's possible considering

52:04.660 --> 52:07.020
what if the resizing stuff that failed partway through

52:07.020 --> 52:07.860
with that error caused the error?

52:07.860 --> 52:08.940
It's possible.

52:08.940 --> 52:10.340
Because this is like a fresh.

52:10.340 --> 52:12.500
It failed because it found an error.

52:12.500 --> 52:14.060
Oh.

52:14.060 --> 52:14.980
So it probably wasn't that.

52:14.980 --> 52:16.340
It's probably already existed.

52:16.340 --> 52:19.500
The volume slash dev slash R disk 3 S5

52:19.500 --> 52:21.900
was found to be corrupt and needs to be repaired.

52:21.900 --> 52:24.920
Unable to perform declared repairs

52:24.920 --> 52:27.320
without full space verification.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.120
Well, it looks like we won't be getting

52:32.120 --> 52:34.180
Asahi Linux on there today.

52:34.180 --> 52:36.600
We may just have to nuke and pave the thing.

52:36.600 --> 52:38.380
I mean, it's pretty fresh install.

52:38.380 --> 52:39.980
It's like browsers installed.

52:39.980 --> 52:42.180
There's telegram installed.

52:42.180 --> 52:44.580
Yeah, I was gonna say how much junk do you have on here?

52:44.580 --> 52:45.860
I mean, it must've been edge.

52:45.860 --> 52:47.180
It must've been putting the Microsoft edge on there.

52:47.180 --> 52:48.580
I can't trust it.

52:48.580 --> 52:49.740
It's gotta be it.

52:49.740 --> 52:50.580
That's gotta be what it was.

52:50.580 --> 52:51.980
But we're gonna put it on Asahi as well.

52:51.980 --> 52:54.060
We just can't get that far.

52:54.060 --> 52:56.700
Yeah, I got a login on my Microsoft account and sync it up.

52:57.700 --> 52:59.140
All right, well, let's do a couple of picks.

52:59.140 --> 52:59.980
I don't know.

52:59.980 --> 53:00.800
The whole show's ruined now.

53:00.800 --> 53:02.220
We gotta redo the whole show now.

53:02.220 --> 53:03.500
We have two picks for you.

53:03.500 --> 53:04.620
First one is Fountain.

53:04.620 --> 53:06.940
That's the podcast app that I like.

53:06.940 --> 53:10.060
Version 0.3.10 just came out this last week.

53:10.060 --> 53:12.340
And you can now opt to have your boosts public,

53:12.340 --> 53:13.900
if you like, in the Fountain app.

53:13.900 --> 53:17.100
And the second pick is Antennapod 2.5,

53:17.100 --> 53:20.700
a really cool release because this one lets you be a cool guy

53:20.700 --> 53:22.980
with your own Antennapod sync setup.

53:22.980 --> 53:23.800
Really?

53:23.800 --> 53:26.420
Yeah, using G Potter for Nextcloud, which is a thing.

53:26.420 --> 53:29.460
You can load that up on your own Nextcloud instance.

53:29.460 --> 53:30.300
Back up a little bit.

53:30.300 --> 53:31.780
Uh-huh, G Potter for Nextcloud.

53:31.780 --> 53:32.620
Okay.

53:32.620 --> 53:33.460
It's an app now for Nextcloud.

53:33.460 --> 53:34.280
Sweet.

53:34.280 --> 53:35.120
Yeah.

53:35.120 --> 53:36.460
If you think about it, it's genius

53:36.460 --> 53:38.580
because then the G Potter folks aren't responsible

53:38.580 --> 53:41.020
for like paying out for massive, massive infrastructure

53:41.020 --> 53:41.860
all the time, right?

53:41.860 --> 53:42.680
Yep.

53:42.680 --> 53:43.820
And it gives you a backend sync

53:43.820 --> 53:45.780
that you can self-host on Nextcloud.

53:45.780 --> 53:47.320
So if you've already got an Nextcloud,

53:47.320 --> 53:50.900
why not go install the old G Potter app?

53:50.900 --> 53:53.060
And then you can take Antennapod

53:53.060 --> 53:55.520
and point that at the G Potter app.

53:55.520 --> 53:56.620
Are you following me, Wes?

53:56.620 --> 53:57.460
Right, yeah.

53:57.460 --> 53:58.660
And now you have like a sync backend

53:58.660 --> 53:59.900
and then you take your mobile app

53:59.900 --> 54:01.420
and you say, hey, sync over here.

54:01.420 --> 54:03.660
It's just Antennapod doesn't get enough love on this show

54:03.660 --> 54:07.460
because it's A, a popular app amongst our audience,

54:07.460 --> 54:11.860
B, a great podcast app, and C, open source.

54:11.860 --> 54:15.940
I just wish that they also supported Boost, you know?

54:15.940 --> 54:17.780
Why don't you file a PR?

54:17.780 --> 54:19.040
You're right.

54:19.040 --> 54:20.780
I should file a PR.

54:20.780 --> 54:22.240
That's a great idea.

54:22.240 --> 54:23.780
I have a sense they're probably aware

54:23.780 --> 54:25.420
of the whole Podcasting2 spec.

54:25.420 --> 54:26.340
I'm sure.

54:26.340 --> 54:27.620
I would hope so.

54:27.620 --> 54:30.780
If they're not, they should probably do a little research.

54:30.780 --> 54:32.860
But we'll have links to both the new Fountain release,

54:32.860 --> 54:34.220
which is a great looking release too.

54:34.220 --> 54:37.100
I mean, I mentioned Public Boost,

54:37.100 --> 54:39.580
but there's a bunch of other nice stuff in there.

54:39.580 --> 54:41.500
One of the other cool things about Fountain

54:41.500 --> 54:44.060
I'm just gonna mention real quick

54:44.060 --> 54:47.940
is that has the coolest clipping system that you can,

54:47.940 --> 54:50.180
it'll combine the album art with a waveform

54:50.180 --> 54:51.260
that it'll auto-generate

54:51.260 --> 54:52.940
and then you can make a YouTube video out of it

54:52.940 --> 54:55.500
or an MP4 or just an audio file.

54:55.500 --> 54:58.380
And I really feel like a more popular clip sharing.

54:58.380 --> 55:00.620
And then it has like a discover tab inside the app

55:00.620 --> 55:02.620
where you can see other clips that people have made.

55:02.620 --> 55:04.700
I really feel like that'd be a great way to grow podcasting

55:04.700 --> 55:05.900
and help people discover good shows

55:05.900 --> 55:08.820
cause you get a real taste of the flavor, as they say.

55:08.820 --> 55:11.560
Also Fountain is working on transcription,

55:11.560 --> 55:12.620
which is such a cool feature.

55:12.620 --> 55:15.860
It can transcribe each episode.

55:15.860 --> 55:17.780
So you can, it'll help do the edit.

55:17.780 --> 55:19.140
You'll work with the edit too for that,

55:19.140 --> 55:21.800
which is such a neat feature to take the transcription

55:21.800 --> 55:25.020
and use it to help cut the clips down and stuff like that.

55:25.020 --> 55:26.140
I mean, it's pretty cool stuff

55:26.140 --> 55:26.980
they're building in this app.

55:26.980 --> 55:28.780
At some point we're gonna be making our podcasts

55:28.780 --> 55:30.580
in the Fountain, that's what it sounds like.

55:30.580 --> 55:31.420
I know, right?

55:31.420 --> 55:32.260
I know, geez.

55:32.260 --> 55:34.340
Anyways, links to them in the show notes

55:34.340 --> 55:38.200
at linuxunplugged.com slash four five zero.

55:38.200 --> 55:40.140
Over there you'll also find our contact page.

55:40.140 --> 55:43.120
We'd love to hear from you via the contact page as well.

55:43.120 --> 55:45.500
And you'll also get, what Wes?

55:45.500 --> 55:49.340
Subscribe links, matrix info, mumble info.

55:49.340 --> 55:50.180
That's right.

55:50.180 --> 55:51.140
That's all over there.

55:51.140 --> 55:52.940
Easy ways to send us email.

55:52.940 --> 55:53.780
Yeah.

55:53.780 --> 55:55.660
If you wanna send us your pics or your thoughts.

55:55.660 --> 55:57.580
That's fine, that's fine.

55:57.580 --> 55:59.220
And of course you're welcome to join us live.

55:59.220 --> 56:00.460
We do the show on Sundays,

56:00.460 --> 56:02.540
get together at noon Pacific, three p.m. Eastern.

56:02.540 --> 56:04.220
jblive.tv.

56:04.220 --> 56:05.500
See you next week.

56:05.500 --> 56:07.860
Same bat time, same bat station.

56:07.860 --> 56:10.220
And of course, don't miss Linux Action News.

56:10.220 --> 56:12.140
If you're in the industry,

56:12.140 --> 56:13.980
you gotta catch Linux Action News.

56:13.980 --> 56:16.100
It's almost a mandate.

56:16.100 --> 56:17.700
Just not yet, not yet.

56:17.700 --> 56:19.560
Yeah, you know, Congress can't get anything done.

56:19.560 --> 56:20.780
No, we're working on it though.

56:20.780 --> 56:22.280
We got a lobby group.

56:22.280 --> 56:24.540
We're paying them with Dogecoin.

56:24.540 --> 56:27.140
In the meantime, just go to linuxactionnews.com yourself

56:27.140 --> 56:28.740
before you're compelled to do it.

56:28.740 --> 56:32.220
And, you know, listen to it.

56:33.340 --> 56:35.380
That's my worst pitch ever.

56:35.380 --> 56:36.920
But I think you get the idea.

56:36.920 --> 56:38.620
Anyways, we just appreciate you listening.

56:38.620 --> 56:40.500
Nothing else, just thanks.

56:40.500 --> 56:41.340
You're great.

56:41.340 --> 56:44.020
We really do thank you and everybody out there.

56:44.020 --> 56:46.100
And we'll see you right back here next Sunday.

56:46.100 --> 57:06.100
I'm your host, I'm your host, I'm your host, I'm your host.

57:16.100 --> 57:27.860
Last-minute update to the show here, Wes Payne.

57:27.860 --> 57:29.900
It appears that Antennapod is working

57:29.900 --> 57:31.980
on value-for-value support.

57:31.980 --> 57:35.640
We have a PyCrash update with a link to a GitHub issue

57:35.640 --> 57:38.420
that was opened up on November 8th, 2020.

57:38.420 --> 57:40.600
And it even includes a diagram

57:40.600 --> 57:43.100
of how the value-for-value flow model works.

57:43.100 --> 57:44.380
Look at this.

57:44.380 --> 57:46.260
If you were wondering what the hell we've been talking about

57:46.260 --> 57:48.460
and you wanted a visual, this is it.

57:48.460 --> 57:49.740
We'll put a link in the show notes to this.

57:49.740 --> 57:51.500
And it's exciting to see that Antennapod

57:51.500 --> 57:53.140
is indeed working on this.

57:53.140 --> 57:54.020
How about that?

57:54.020 --> 57:55.340
Yeah, I don't know if it's, right now,

57:55.340 --> 57:57.460
there's some discussion on the forum.

57:57.460 --> 57:59.420
Been a little while since there's an update.

57:59.420 --> 58:00.420
I mean, it could happen though.

58:00.420 --> 58:01.260
It could happen.

58:01.260 --> 58:03.100
Like we have a thread to tug on now.

58:03.100 --> 58:06.900
But it is, maybe it needs a little bit

58:06.900 --> 58:09.260
of a demonstration of interest, perhaps.

58:09.260 --> 58:10.100
That never hurts.

58:10.100 --> 58:10.920
I mean, you know what?

58:10.920 --> 58:13.220
You build out the network, the bigger the network gets,

58:13.220 --> 58:15.340
the more everyone's incentive aligns, right?

58:15.340 --> 58:18.340
Like, of course, JB stands to make some money,

58:18.340 --> 58:20.580
but of course, so does every other podcaster

58:20.580 --> 58:22.340
and so does open source projects

58:22.340 --> 58:23.860
and pretty soon individuals.

58:23.860 --> 58:26.060
Like, that's how a network effect works.

58:26.060 --> 58:27.240
And the more people on the network,

58:27.240 --> 58:28.900
the more valuable it becomes.

58:28.900 --> 58:31.300
And why not go with something that's decentralized,

58:31.300 --> 58:34.360
it's open source, and it's completely sovereign

58:34.360 --> 58:37.140
so people can self-host their own nodes if they want to.

58:37.140 --> 58:39.860
Just make it real easy for us to all shoot some payments

58:39.860 --> 58:40.940
for us being cool to each other.

58:40.940 --> 58:41.780
Pew, pew!

58:41.780 --> 58:42.740
I like what you're doing over there.

58:42.740 --> 58:43.780
Yeah, hey, good job.

58:43.780 --> 59:12.780
Here, here, have some.
