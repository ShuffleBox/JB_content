00:00.000 --> 00:03.220
Alright, I had a little pre-show topic that I didn't think was going to make it, mainly

00:03.220 --> 00:08.980
because I'm still trying to figure out this whole thing, but it seems to be, in the last

00:08.980 --> 00:14.000
couple of weeks, we haven't talked about it on the show, but there has been another resurgence

00:14.000 --> 00:16.940
of anti-System D sentiment.

00:16.940 --> 00:20.060
People are everything now.

00:20.060 --> 00:22.460
System D is a monster that's eating Linux.

00:22.460 --> 00:25.720
System D is a division between the young and the old.

00:25.720 --> 00:30.640
System D is a division of core fundamental philosophies of the Unix way versus staying

00:30.640 --> 00:32.680
competitive in the cloud, blah blah blah.

00:32.680 --> 00:37.840
It's all of this stuff, and producer Eric here, who's in studio today, linked to an

00:37.840 --> 00:43.320
article in the subreddit that was written up on infoworld.com by Paul Valencia, and

00:43.320 --> 00:45.320
he says, choose your side on the Linux divide.

00:45.320 --> 00:49.580
The battle over System D exposes fundamental gaps between the Unix old guard and the new

00:49.580 --> 00:53.160
guard of Linux developers.

00:53.160 --> 00:56.520
Is this really a young versus old thing, guys?

00:56.520 --> 00:57.520
Doesn't feel like it to me.

00:57.520 --> 00:58.520
I don't think so.

00:58.520 --> 01:00.000
I can see where they're coming from.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
All right, lay it on me.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
Go ahead, Rod.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Go ahead.

01:03.000 --> 01:07.400
I was just going to say, it feels like they're just going, no change.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.400
Exactly.

01:08.400 --> 01:09.400
Yeah.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.400
Okay.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.080
What do you think, Colonel Linux?

01:13.080 --> 01:14.080
I feel the same way.

01:14.080 --> 01:21.120
I think that it comes down to a lot of people that have dealt with Linux for years and say,

01:21.120 --> 01:25.120
I mean, we have this in its system, and it worked, and everything was there, and if we're

01:25.120 --> 01:32.120
going to modify things to go to this top-down approach, all-inclusive approach, rather than,

01:32.120 --> 01:36.600
you know, it goes against the fundamental Linux philosophy, and at the same time, there's

01:36.600 --> 01:42.360
people like me or a couple other people in our generation that look at it and say, well,

01:42.360 --> 01:43.360
who cares?

01:43.360 --> 01:44.360
If it's better, let's go with that.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.360
Yeah, I mean.

01:45.360 --> 01:46.360
Progress train coming.

01:46.360 --> 01:48.680
I just, I feel like, so here's his fundamental argument.

01:48.680 --> 01:52.080
He says, fundamentally, I think it exposes a separation of the Linux community between

01:52.080 --> 01:56.320
those who were deep into Unix before Linux came onto the scene and those who came later.

01:56.320 --> 01:59.760
I can't help but think that a number of the younger developers and admins are missing

01:59.760 --> 02:05.000
key elements of how Unix-like systems were designed, how they function before, say, 1998,

02:05.000 --> 02:09.280
when Unix was for servers and high-end workstations, not for desktop systems or laptops.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.280
And you see-

02:10.280 --> 02:11.280
That was the point-

02:11.280 --> 02:12.280
Are you kidding me?

02:12.280 --> 02:17.080
That was the point that seemed the most questionable to me, because system D, like, the desktop

02:17.080 --> 02:18.640
user doesn't even care about that.

02:18.640 --> 02:19.640
Right.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.640
It is for servers.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.640
It's so much for servers.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.600
That's why it's being driven by Red Hat so much.

02:23.600 --> 02:29.160
That's one thing that I liked about having an openSUSE server at home, is that it has

02:29.160 --> 02:32.240
system D. System D is great for server management.

02:32.240 --> 02:33.240
Right.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.240
Totally.

02:34.240 --> 02:35.240
You can control your mounts and stuff.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.240
I mean, it's awesome.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.240
Yeah.

02:37.240 --> 02:43.360
I just, okay, so here's what I recognize, is we are sort of consolidating a lot of functionality,

02:43.360 --> 02:48.360
but it seems like a lot of times it's functionality that it hasn't been, maybe it's been left

02:48.360 --> 02:50.360
to sort of wane over the years.

02:50.360 --> 02:55.000
And so nobody's really picking up the slack in a lot of these cases, or times have changed.

02:55.000 --> 03:00.400
You know, having the ability to have your mount system be aware of when your network

03:00.400 --> 03:05.480
connection goes inactive and active, almost seems like just kind of fundamentally basic

03:05.480 --> 03:08.520
functionality that a modern operating system should have.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.520
Absolutely.

03:09.520 --> 03:10.520
Exactly.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.520
Exactly.

03:11.520 --> 03:19.600
I don't understand the argument that it's not Unix-like, or it's against the Unix philosophy,

03:19.600 --> 03:21.200
because Linux isn't Unix.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.200
Exactly.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.200
It hasn't been.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.200
Exactly.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.380
If you want to be more Unix-like, use BSD.

03:26.380 --> 03:27.800
But Linux isn't Unix anymore.

03:27.800 --> 03:32.240
Well, but isn't some of the things where it is the most Unix are some of the best things

03:32.240 --> 03:33.240
about it?

03:33.240 --> 03:36.560
I mean, isn't that what's made some of us drawn to it over, say, Windows or Mac OS

03:36.560 --> 03:37.560
10?

03:37.560 --> 03:38.560
Is that it has-

03:38.560 --> 03:39.560
Fair enough.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.560
Fair enough.

03:40.560 --> 03:43.760
That you should ignore when other things surpass Unix?

03:43.760 --> 03:44.760
Exactly.

03:44.760 --> 03:45.760
Exactly.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.880
I mean, I think that's actually probably the best thing about Linux.

03:48.880 --> 03:54.320
You know, it's a community-driven, you know, whatever works best is what gets adopted.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.600
Everything else gets forked or abandoned.

03:56.600 --> 04:00.440
You know, and so system D is like the natural extension of everything else.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.640
You know, in the subreddit, I'm looking at tire sees he put in there.

04:03.640 --> 04:08.920
Here I was thinking I chose and built my tools by what they could do for me and not their

04:08.920 --> 04:11.840
inherent philosophical values.

04:11.840 --> 04:17.000
People need to be reminded that the Unix philosophy was grounded in the pragmatic reality of computer

04:17.000 --> 04:25.000
systems in the 1970s and emphatically not deliberately created as a blind dogma to be repeated and

04:25.000 --> 04:26.920
followed without comprehension or context.

04:26.920 --> 04:27.920
Absolutely.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.720
Yeah, I guess that's a good point too, right?

04:29.720 --> 04:30.720
Yeah.

04:30.720 --> 04:34.360
Is we shouldn't take something that was a design philosophy influenced by the time and

04:34.360 --> 04:37.480
then make it a credo, almost a constitution, right?

04:37.480 --> 04:39.520
We should, that would be inappropriate.

04:39.520 --> 04:40.520
Exactly.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.520
That's the way Windows.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.520
It was never meant to be that.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.520
What do you mean?

04:43.520 --> 04:44.520
You mean like what Microsoft does?

04:44.520 --> 04:45.520
Exactly.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.160
Well, and actually I want to underscore that point because I think that's one of the best

04:48.160 --> 04:55.160
things that's kept Linux so nimble is this willingness to re-examine and redo fundamental

04:55.160 --> 04:59.760
parts of the OS that a lot of times there's not an immediate commercial incentive to do

04:59.760 --> 05:00.760
so.

05:00.760 --> 05:03.380
You know, it's not going to make a great bullet point on the side of Red Hat's, Red Hat Enterprise

05:03.380 --> 05:06.040
Linux box, but that still gets done.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.240
And I think that's fundamentally.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.920
We can, we don't want to move away from that willingness to move forward like that because

05:10.920 --> 05:13.560
we don't want to stagnate like the commercial operating systems have.

05:13.560 --> 05:14.560
Yeah.

05:14.560 --> 05:17.480
We don't want to end up with HFS plus as a file system.

05:17.480 --> 05:18.480
Right.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.480
Exactly.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.480
Or actually butter.

05:20.480 --> 05:28.560
But who are we to question our Unix forefathers and try to change their constitution?

05:28.560 --> 05:29.560
Wow.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.560
Wow.

05:30.560 --> 05:31.560
We're.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.560
Trollmugs?

05:32.560 --> 05:33.560
Wow.

05:33.560 --> 05:37.200
Well, you know, all joking aside though, there is a difference in architecting a society.

05:37.200 --> 05:41.640
A society versus architecting a technology solution because a technology, a society is

05:41.640 --> 05:46.160
fundamentally based on human behaviors and in human nature, but a technology solution

05:46.160 --> 05:48.840
is fundamentally based on something that's always evolving.

05:48.840 --> 05:53.360
Something that's capabilities and requirements, needs, demands are always changing from, I

05:53.360 --> 05:56.760
mean, just over five years, technology changes so much.

05:56.760 --> 06:00.480
So it's, it's not really, I think that's probably the biggest thing to pull from this discussion

06:00.480 --> 06:06.520
is this, it really isn't fair to limit today's systems by a philosophy that was designed

06:06.520 --> 06:10.720
like, like you wouldn't, you wouldn't produce a TV series by the same restrictions that

06:10.720 --> 06:14.440
a TV series had in the 1960s.

06:14.440 --> 06:19.860
But the thing is that like the, the best aspects of Linux survive the best, the worst aspects

06:19.860 --> 06:21.160
of it go away.

06:21.160 --> 06:27.440
And so, so in part of that, the core philosophies that have brought us to this point in history,

06:27.440 --> 06:31.120
you know, either survivor or go away, but you know, ideally they survive, you know,

06:31.120 --> 06:36.080
I mean, it shouldn't be like some sort of preservation, it shouldn't be a museum.

06:36.080 --> 06:40.720
Um, so you, you, we were talking about like one of the great things about Linux writers

06:40.720 --> 06:48.560
that, that we have, um, the capability or the, I don't know what the word is, but to,

06:48.560 --> 06:53.320
you know, uh, completely rip out what we have and put in something new, which is true, which

06:53.320 --> 06:56.960
can be a good thing, but we also tend to go too far with that.

06:56.960 --> 06:57.960
Yeah.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.160
Like look at gnome three when it first started, it was awful.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.520
I love, I mean, I'm a gnome user now, I love it.

07:02.520 --> 07:09.560
But gnome three when it first started was awful because we rip out a paradigm or how

07:09.560 --> 07:11.560
I imagined Wayland is going to be right.

07:11.560 --> 07:12.560
Yeah.

07:12.560 --> 07:13.560
Yeah.

07:13.560 --> 07:14.560
Yeah.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.560
Very much so.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.120
And we're going to be reeling these words when we're all switching over to Wayland.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.120
Oh yeah.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.120
Oh yeah.

07:19.120 --> 07:20.120
Now looking for, yeah.

07:20.120 --> 07:24.800
Well, and three years later after we switched, after we make the switch, trust me, it'll all

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
work fine.

07:25.800 --> 07:26.800
Right.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.760
And it will be, it'll be like, oh yeah, we had to, we, we had to, that's exactly the

07:29.760 --> 07:30.760
most logical thing to do.

07:30.760 --> 07:31.760
It was the only way forward.

07:31.760 --> 07:32.760
Yeah.

07:32.760 --> 07:33.760
No breaks on the progress train.

07:33.760 --> 07:34.760
Yeah.

07:34.760 --> 07:39.200
And people, people seem a lot more cautious these days than they did when I first started

07:39.200 --> 07:42.640
using Linux like five, six years ago.

07:42.640 --> 07:43.640
Yeah.

07:43.640 --> 07:45.840
Maybe that's a sign people are using it for more serious things.

07:45.840 --> 07:46.840
Yep.

07:46.840 --> 07:47.840
Yeah.

07:47.840 --> 07:51.960
This is one of those things where it seems like it's a, almost a liberal, liberal versus

07:51.960 --> 07:52.960
conservative argument.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.720
Well, and it also feels a little bit of growing up, like the Linux that, the Linux that we

07:56.720 --> 08:02.280
played with years ago isn't, now Linux is an adult and it's not the same Linux anymore.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.280
It's not a toy anymore.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.280
Yeah.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.280
Right.

08:05.280 --> 08:07.080
It's used in production and we need it for our tool chain and we need it to, yeah, blah,

08:07.080 --> 08:08.080
blah, blah.

08:08.080 --> 08:12.240
It's not, it's not the fledgling little, remember, hey, you guys remember that the number one

08:12.240 --> 08:17.040
phrase that used to be appended before the word Linux in any article was the grassroots

08:17.040 --> 08:19.360
project, the grassroots initiative Linux.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.360
Oh my gosh.

08:20.360 --> 08:21.360
Remember grassroots?

08:21.360 --> 08:22.360
How much we used to hear grassroots?

08:22.360 --> 08:25.160
Well, now Linux is the number one operating system on the planet, right?

08:25.160 --> 08:26.160
So it's not grassroots.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.160
It has roots.

08:27.160 --> 08:32.240
Well, so if it's being used for that, if it's being used for that, you know, art, fundamental

08:32.240 --> 08:38.240
architecture, then continuously ripping out things isn't good because no, I would have

08:38.240 --> 08:43.520
a hard time not being a Linux user, looking at Linux and seeing that, you know, you rip

08:43.520 --> 08:48.020
out, you, you rip out everything and bring in Pulse Audio and then you have audio issues

08:48.020 --> 08:51.600
and then you rip out the display server and now we're going to have display issues.

08:51.600 --> 08:55.720
Well, I would have a hard time switching to Linux were I not, you know, that's why, why

08:55.720 --> 09:01.200
the fork is simultaneously one of the most disruptive things in open source and simultaneously

09:01.200 --> 09:05.120
one of the best things in open source because you can have a company fork something and

09:05.120 --> 09:08.720
they can have an LTS release for a while that rides that out, right?

09:08.720 --> 09:12.840
That just sort of waits it out and then switches over or you can have a company that's delivering

09:12.840 --> 09:17.140
a product on a phone or on a router that can maintain their own fork internally and continue

09:17.140 --> 09:21.240
to, you know, churn out whatever it is they have to bang on for a while and then until

09:21.240 --> 09:22.480
things stabilize again.

09:22.480 --> 09:26.840
So it does mean a little bit of in-house investment, but it's way better than having to invent

09:26.840 --> 09:29.440
the entire operating system from the ground up.

09:29.440 --> 09:33.740
Or to have to recreate your entire tool chain when Windows decides to go to Windows 8 or

09:33.740 --> 09:38.440
whatever and destroys everything else that, you know, you had previously, you know what

09:38.440 --> 09:39.440
I'm saying?

09:39.440 --> 09:40.440
I mean, come on.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.340
And that's where community comes in to Linux.

09:42.340 --> 09:44.960
That's why community is such a, you know, awesome thing.

09:44.960 --> 09:50.720
And hence we finally have a Mate version of Ubuntu.

09:50.720 --> 09:55.680
Thank you very much.

09:55.680 --> 10:00.760
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's powered by delicious smoky

10:00.760 --> 10:01.760
cheddar.

10:01.760 --> 10:02.760
My name is Chris.

10:02.760 --> 10:03.760
And my name is Matt.

10:03.760 --> 10:04.760
Hey there, Matt.

10:04.760 --> 10:06.560
We've got a fun show today, a lot coming up.

10:06.560 --> 10:11.720
And to make it a little extra special, producer Eric is in the studio with us right now.

10:11.720 --> 10:12.720
Hey there, Eric.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.720
Hey, Chris.

10:13.720 --> 10:14.720
How you doing?

10:14.720 --> 10:15.720
I'm good.

10:15.720 --> 10:16.720
Glad to have you here today.

10:16.720 --> 10:17.720
Yeah, thanks.

10:17.720 --> 10:18.720
Thanks for eating my meat before the show, too.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.720
You know, that was good meat.

10:19.720 --> 10:25.000
I'm going to, I'll be honest, right up front, it was really thick and it didn't melt all

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
the way.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Yeah.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
So we had softened smoky cheddar.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Yeah.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.560
It was still good, but it was just a little thick to bite into.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.900
Some of it had to come off, unfortunately.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.680
So you know what I did?

10:35.680 --> 10:40.320
I'm not one to take just a big block of cheddar on my, I mean, I like, but I got to be careful,

10:40.320 --> 10:41.320
right?

10:41.320 --> 10:42.320
And if I'm going to go for it, it's got to be right.

10:42.320 --> 10:43.600
It's got to be worth the pain.

10:43.600 --> 10:49.440
So I took a whole row of sliced hot onion right off the barbecue, 550 degree onion.

10:49.440 --> 10:53.920
Put it down on top of the cheese and that, and that onion melted into the cheese, Matt.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.920
Why am I talking about this?

10:54.920 --> 10:58.720
I guess I'm still, I'm still a little hungry.

10:58.720 --> 11:02.480
Are you going to like Skype message me a burger or how's this going to work?

11:02.480 --> 11:03.480
You know what I mean?

11:03.480 --> 11:04.480
Sorry, Matt.

11:04.480 --> 11:05.480
I know.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.040
I shouldn't talk about it unless I brought one for the whole class.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.960
Although the man does provide bacon of a morning when I come into the show.

11:09.960 --> 11:10.960
That's true.

11:10.960 --> 11:11.960
Yeah.

11:11.960 --> 11:12.960
So I'm okay.

11:12.960 --> 11:13.960
I'm okay.

11:13.960 --> 11:14.960
All right.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.720
Well, hey chat room, please don't forget to bang suggest as we go along on today's show.

11:16.720 --> 11:21.680
We've got a lot to cover, including some more exclusive interviews from LinuxCon 2014.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.920
Noah's also here to give us his impression from the floor and tell us a little bit of

11:24.920 --> 11:26.960
behind the scenes from the trip.

11:26.960 --> 11:32.520
There's an article that also came out that wants us all to just shut up about Linux on

11:32.520 --> 11:33.520
the desktop.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.520
Just shut up.

11:34.520 --> 11:35.520
Stop talking about it.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.440
And I think we're going to have to talk about it a little bit.

11:38.440 --> 11:42.920
And as well, we also are going to do, it is something new we're doing at least once a

11:42.920 --> 11:44.580
month for a little while.

11:44.580 --> 11:48.240
We're going to take a little look back at Linux from years ago and this is our last

11:48.240 --> 11:49.480
chance to do it for the month of August.

11:49.480 --> 11:53.200
So we'll take a retrospective look back at Linux from five and 10 years ago.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.040
Some interesting stuff in there for you guys.

11:55.040 --> 11:59.480
But first I want to start with our feedback as is something we like to do on the unplug

11:59.480 --> 12:00.480
show.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.520
And a Texas Linux user wrote in.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.320
You guys might remember Texas Linux user.

12:03.320 --> 12:08.080
He wrote in a couple of weeks ago about switching from a Linux box to a Mac.

12:08.080 --> 12:10.880
He says, hello Chris, Matt, Arcee and of course the mumble room.

12:10.880 --> 12:15.400
Well I didn't realize that my email would cause such a stir even across multiple shows.

12:15.400 --> 12:19.680
First let me say I just haven't switched to the Mac yet but I still plan on doing so.

12:19.680 --> 12:23.440
With that said, let me express some thoughts after hearing your discussion going on across

12:23.440 --> 12:24.440
the shows.

12:24.440 --> 12:28.000
In both Coderadio and Linux Unplugged, Chris mentioned I should try out elementary OS.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.440
He says I'm actually already an elementary OS user.

12:30.440 --> 12:31.760
He's been running on a Dell.

12:31.760 --> 12:36.360
The reason I use EOS, don't call it that, was because it solved a big problem that I

12:36.360 --> 12:37.360
had.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.080
Finding a decent desktop that just let me get my work done.

12:39.080 --> 12:43.160
I can't begin to describe how frustrating using any other desktop environment has been.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.000
Elementary OS solved this by a long shot.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.380
No other desktop has even been close for me.

12:47.380 --> 12:50.680
So let me give the listeners a chance for their head to stop spinning.

12:50.680 --> 12:51.680
But I mean it.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.720
No other Linux desktop is even close.

12:53.720 --> 12:57.840
All right, the past several weeks across JB shows, you and Matt have been kind of griping

12:57.840 --> 13:02.280
about how most Linux desktops are kind of missing that special thing that would propel

13:02.280 --> 13:03.880
them into the mainstream.

13:03.880 --> 13:07.560
It seemed as if there was no desktop that was just right and I'm here to say that's

13:07.560 --> 13:08.640
absolutely true.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.880
There is no desktop that fills the dream of Linux desktop.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.440
Because Linux dream is just that.

13:13.440 --> 13:14.440
It's just a dream.

13:14.440 --> 13:20.300
A dream that every Linux user has, but a thing we forget to or we ignore is that no one dream,

13:20.300 --> 13:22.640
no one dream, no one has the same dream.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.800
We all dream different things and want different things.

13:25.800 --> 13:29.040
We as a community have fooled ourselves into thinking we could bring together this group

13:29.040 --> 13:31.660
dream to a life we can't.

13:31.660 --> 13:34.640
Why is elementary OS project doing such a good job of building a decent distro?

13:34.640 --> 13:35.640
Simple.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.920
People dream the Linux desktop ideal and focus on core improvement design ideals like the

13:39.920 --> 13:42.440
human interface guidelines that they have.

13:42.440 --> 13:45.460
The other reason why elementary OS folks stick out so much better is because they aren't

13:45.460 --> 13:47.460
making design choices out of the blue.

13:47.460 --> 13:48.460
They have a guideline.

13:48.460 --> 13:49.460
They stick to it.

13:49.460 --> 13:53.220
And they have a technological underpinning of an OS that can stick to those guidelines.

13:53.220 --> 13:56.640
Before EOS came along, I was distro hopping like crazy because I was chasing that dream

13:56.640 --> 13:58.140
of the Linux desktop.

13:58.140 --> 14:02.120
After a week of using EOS, I realized what an idiot I was for all of that.

14:02.120 --> 14:05.760
In the end, I'll be switching to the Mac, but I won't cease to be a Linux user.

14:05.760 --> 14:08.840
I do have another machine that will run Linux, but switching solves two very big problems

14:08.840 --> 14:09.840
that plague Linux.

14:09.840 --> 14:13.220
A desktop that doesn't get in your way and lets you work and good hardware that just

14:13.220 --> 14:14.540
works out of the box.

14:14.540 --> 14:15.720
Thanks for the great show.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.280
As of yet, still a Texas Linux user.

14:18.280 --> 14:23.100
He had me till the last two things and then he just literally factually gave a single

14:23.100 --> 14:25.520
user experience versus a collective user experience.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.520
Right.

14:26.520 --> 14:27.520
True.

14:27.520 --> 14:31.160
It's just like, um, actually, no, but okay.

14:31.160 --> 14:32.360
Yeah.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.040
So a couple of things I take issue with.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.000
So one thing that I think is kind of a common thing that a lot of Linux users repeat is

14:37.000 --> 14:38.960
there's no desktop gets it just right.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.720
I have to keep switching around because I'm never happy.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.520
And what I, I used to feel that way too.

14:43.520 --> 14:48.600
And then I realized that almost the option of having choice makes you constantly want

14:48.600 --> 14:50.720
to jump around just a little bit.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.200
And when you just settle down and just stick to a desktop and just learn to work with it,

14:54.200 --> 14:58.160
because this is what elementary OS and Mac OS present the user.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.800
You have no choice but to use this desktop.

15:00.800 --> 15:05.440
So therefore your choice is I will then learn how to modify this desktop in just the slight

15:05.440 --> 15:08.520
ways that I need a granted, I'm not, I'm not dismissing it whole cloth.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.800
They have to start somewhere really reasonable.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.080
That's really well done.

15:12.080 --> 15:15.840
And then they move then as the user, you then just move that to the, to the position you

15:15.840 --> 15:18.640
needed to be in and you just, that's the only choice you have.

15:18.640 --> 15:19.840
So therefore you make it work.

15:19.840 --> 15:21.120
You learn one desktop.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.120
There's not a lot of options.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.000
You're not constantly considering the grass on the other side of that fence.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.400
It's not that kind of scenario.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.400
You just double down.

15:27.400 --> 15:30.280
If I pretended like there was no other desktop environment in the world for Linux except

15:30.280 --> 15:34.240
for Gnome, if we all did that, like if just one day we all woke up and there was no other

15:34.240 --> 15:37.440
desktop except for Gnome, we would all just figure out how to make it work for the most.

15:37.440 --> 15:40.280
A lot of people would leave, but I think a lot of people would just stop their hopping

15:40.280 --> 15:41.800
around or Katie or whatever.

15:41.800 --> 15:42.800
What do you think, Eric?

15:42.800 --> 15:47.520
Well, I'm thinking, I see different desktops as different tools.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.920
You know, you have your Gnome desktop, which I spend most of my time in, especially if

15:50.920 --> 15:55.300
I'm leisurely using my computer, but if I need to do anything developmentally or if

15:55.300 --> 16:00.300
I need to, say, mass upload a whole bunch of pictures that I have in a folder to Facebook

16:00.300 --> 16:05.120
or wherever, then I'm going to grab and get into KDE because I've got skipping colors.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.160
So you switch just based on the workload of the day.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.160
That's correct.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.720
One's like your work desktop, one's your play desktop.

16:09.720 --> 16:10.880
Yeah, exactly.

16:10.880 --> 16:14.720
And depending on the situation, heck, I'll even use Windows if it warrants a need.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.880
So do you feel like you have the sensation that no one desktop is quite doing it for

16:17.880 --> 16:18.880
you?

16:18.880 --> 16:19.880
Yeah, absolutely.

16:19.880 --> 16:25.800
Because the different desktops have different focuses and different tool sets.

16:25.800 --> 16:26.800
Well, okay.

16:26.800 --> 16:31.360
But, or is it that you have learned workflows in those other desktops and so to you it feels

16:31.360 --> 16:35.200
that way, but if you learned the workflow under Gnome, for example, like I'll give you

16:35.200 --> 16:40.280
an example, like this is just a small example, but under KDE you can modify the KDE screenshot

16:40.280 --> 16:43.200
application to upload right to Imgur.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.880
Under Gnome, not so much.

16:44.880 --> 16:45.880
There's ways to do it.

16:45.880 --> 16:46.880
So I switched to Shutter.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.400
On the Mac, it would be the same exact thing.

16:48.400 --> 16:52.120
You're never going to build in Imgur upload directly into Mac OS X.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.240
So on the Mac, I get a screenshot tool that just uploads to Imgur.

16:55.240 --> 16:58.560
Therefore my workflow works on either desktop.

16:58.560 --> 17:02.040
One requires a little more work, but at the end of the day, I can accomplish the same

17:02.040 --> 17:03.720
task on either one.

17:03.720 --> 17:08.820
So sticking with the Mac, I would have no option but to go the Imgur app route.

17:08.820 --> 17:12.800
And so I wouldn't see that as a, oh, well, Gnome can't do something that KDE can.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.340
I see that as a, well, that's not built in, so I just got to go find something that does

17:15.340 --> 17:16.340
it.

17:16.340 --> 17:21.080
So I guess what I'm saying is, to me, it seems like not having a choice of desktop forces

17:21.080 --> 17:24.320
you to rethink the way you look at a problem.

17:24.320 --> 17:32.820
And it's not that the Mac interface is some amazing development of design and user interface.

17:32.820 --> 17:36.760
It's that it's good enough, it does essentially what it needs to do, and you really have no

17:36.760 --> 17:37.760
other choice.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.960
Yeah, and then you just add options and tools on top of that to make it do what you need

17:40.960 --> 17:41.960
it to do.

17:41.960 --> 17:46.400
And I could say you could do that with just about any Linux desktop environment.

17:46.400 --> 17:51.800
Yes, granted, I do use Gnome most of the time, but like I said, I will jump into KDE if I

17:51.800 --> 17:56.160
need Dolphin to do its thing or what have you.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.520
Let us know how it goes, Texas Linux user.

17:59.520 --> 18:05.040
Next email comes in from XY, and this is maybe one we could get the Mumble Room's thoughts

18:05.040 --> 18:06.040
on.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.480
He says, Dear Chris and Matt, I'm a Windows user that switched to Arch Linux.

18:08.480 --> 18:11.640
It took me, I love this, as a Windows user, here's what I hear.

18:11.640 --> 18:15.160
It took me two days to set up a proper install with encryption and LVM.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.680
I installed a minimal version of Gnome 3.12 and all seemed great.

18:18.680 --> 18:24.560
But then I discovered Gnome's geolocation package, GeoClue, and it's not removable because

18:24.560 --> 18:26.540
it's integrated into Gnome.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.440
This makes me so mad.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.640
Do you trust the disable option in this?

18:30.640 --> 18:33.280
So I thought, who better to ask than our gurus, Chris and Matt, and I'm going to also throw

18:33.280 --> 18:38.240
the Mumble Room in on this, how can I remove the geolocation feature from Gnome?

18:38.240 --> 18:40.240
Thanks in advance, Mike.

18:40.240 --> 18:46.240
Well, if it was me, I would just try XFCE.

18:46.240 --> 18:50.000
I would flip this around like, why did it not bother you in Windows?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.200
You know, like the Windows has the same thing.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.600
All the NSA tagging and all the other stuff going on, that was fine, but oh no, Gnome.

18:55.600 --> 19:00.800
So I'm sure this is there for like time zone functionality and things like that, right?

19:00.800 --> 19:01.800
That's pretty much it.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.960
I mean, I'm looking at the option right now.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.480
Right now I have location disabled.

19:06.480 --> 19:07.480
Yeah.

19:07.480 --> 19:11.440
I do trust that and here's why, because that code is open and if that code didn't do what

19:11.440 --> 19:13.720
it's supposed to do, eventually somebody would say that and go, hey, a minute, this is not

19:13.720 --> 19:14.720
disabling anything.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.720
Yeah.

19:15.720 --> 19:16.720
And it'd be a big controversy.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.720
Oh yeah.

19:17.720 --> 19:18.720
Useless button, red flag.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.920
So by default, I kind of have a little more trust, but I don't know.

19:21.920 --> 19:22.920
Yeah.

19:22.920 --> 19:23.920
I agree.

19:23.920 --> 19:27.480
I think we should just suggest that he go and audit the code if he's really that concerned

19:27.480 --> 19:28.480
about it.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.480
For real.

19:29.480 --> 19:30.480
It's an option.

19:30.480 --> 19:31.480
Or have somebody he trusts audit the code that can.

19:31.480 --> 19:32.480
Or hire someone.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.480
Yeah.

19:33.480 --> 19:40.720
I mean, to me, think about what would be the motivation to put a button in an open source

19:40.720 --> 19:45.160
UI that controls open source software on an open platform where anybody has access to

19:45.160 --> 19:46.160
the code.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.160
Exactly.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.760
What would be the motivation to make a button that doesn't do what it says to do in that

19:49.760 --> 19:57.020
scenario because it's not like it takes some decompiling and some super secret hacker investigations

19:57.020 --> 20:01.160
to sniff packet captures and compare it with time and date stamps and geolocation.

20:01.160 --> 20:02.440
No, it doesn't take any of that.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.920
It just takes somebody to look at the code and go, yeah, this is bullshit.

20:04.920 --> 20:08.760
So there's a middle ground though, because remember when Canonical had the little turn

20:08.760 --> 20:14.320
off online search results, it was doing what it said it was going to do.

20:14.320 --> 20:19.000
It was telling applications that you shouldn't render those search results online.

20:19.000 --> 20:24.680
But if I remember right, it was a flag that the applications had to choose to obey.

20:24.680 --> 20:25.680
That's true.

20:25.680 --> 20:26.680
That's very true.

20:26.680 --> 20:27.680
That's very true.

20:27.680 --> 20:28.680
I don't know.

20:28.680 --> 20:32.080
I think that's a little different because it wasn't a central location lookup service,

20:32.080 --> 20:33.080
right?

20:33.080 --> 20:34.080
I don't know.

20:34.080 --> 20:35.080
Yeah, but that's a great point.

20:35.080 --> 20:36.080
It's worth being skeptical.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.080
I'm not making fun of them for being skeptical.

20:37.080 --> 20:41.880
By the way, one program I know that uses GeoClue in the background is Redshift because

20:41.880 --> 20:47.080
then it determines where you are on the planet and sets your screen temperature accordingly

20:47.080 --> 20:48.640
depending on if it's nighttime or daytime.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.640
Yep.

20:49.640 --> 20:50.640
It definitely is.

20:50.640 --> 20:51.640
That's definitely one of them.

20:51.640 --> 20:52.640
Yeah.

20:52.640 --> 20:53.640
Yeah.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.640
There's a few in there.

20:54.640 --> 20:55.640
And I use it too.

20:55.640 --> 21:00.040
I don't even bother disabling it because this is why I use an open source operating system

21:00.040 --> 21:03.200
to begin with this so I can have some level of comfort in these features.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.680
I think it is good to be vigilant.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.680
Right.

21:05.680 --> 21:06.680
Yeah.

21:06.680 --> 21:07.680
Right.

21:07.680 --> 21:08.680
Absolutely.

21:08.680 --> 21:09.680
Speaking of being vigilant, you know what else you should be vigilant of?

21:09.680 --> 21:10.680
Your mind.

21:10.680 --> 21:14.560
Go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and go educate yourself a little bit.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.560
You want to get into development?

21:15.560 --> 21:17.240
You want to learn how to program?

21:17.240 --> 21:20.840
You want to know a little bit about AWS or just the basics of Linux just to cover in

21:20.840 --> 21:23.120
those gaps for maybe when you self-taught yourself?

21:23.120 --> 21:27.000
You'd be surprised how effective it is when you go over and just use a little bit of training

21:27.000 --> 21:30.680
to fill in some things that perhaps you didn't pick up along the way.

21:30.680 --> 21:34.120
Even somebody like myself who's been using Linux since the 90's, I've taken a couple

21:34.120 --> 21:36.400
of these courses and been really thankful that I did.

21:36.400 --> 21:39.240
I've discovered there's been little things that I could have been doing to make my life

21:39.240 --> 21:40.240
easier.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.360
So go check out linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

21:43.360 --> 21:45.200
Take advantage of the Summer of Learning Savings.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.040
It's just going on for a little bit longer.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.360
And Linux Academy is awesome.

21:48.360 --> 21:52.840
They have step-by-step video courses, comprehensive downloadable study guides, seven plus Linux

21:52.840 --> 21:56.280
distributions you get to choose from, and then they'll automatically adjust the courseware

21:56.280 --> 21:59.600
to match that Linux distribution, which is awesome.

21:59.600 --> 22:04.280
And for me, because I have a horrible memory, I love that they have all of my progress.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.480
Everything's right there in a dashboard.

22:05.480 --> 22:09.520
When I log in, I can check right where I was, pick up, I could go back a little bit, I could

22:09.520 --> 22:16.520
self-test, and they really break down individually how long each little part's going to take.

22:16.520 --> 22:19.320
So for me, who's somebody a little bit OCD about, well, if I'm going to sit down and

22:19.320 --> 22:21.880
do this, I want to make sure I have enough time.

22:21.880 --> 22:25.360
And I love that I say, okay, you know what, I can get 25 minutes in tonight.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.920
And then I walk away really feeling like I've accomplished something and intellectually stimulated

22:28.920 --> 22:29.920
myself.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.640
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, this is a great opportunity to get your skill sets

22:33.640 --> 22:34.640
up on AWS.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.760
They have end-to-end scenario training where you'll actually walk away having deployed

22:37.760 --> 22:42.560
something in a very production-like environment because they're spinning up AWS instances

22:42.560 --> 22:43.560
on the background.

22:43.560 --> 22:44.560
They're using S3.

22:44.560 --> 22:45.560
They're using EC2.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.800
They're having you deploy an application in those scenarios.

22:47.800 --> 22:51.760
If you need to learn OpenStack, they've got a lot of comprehensive guides on OpenStack,

22:51.760 --> 22:55.720
more content all the time, including live stream events where you can ask the educators questions

22:55.720 --> 22:56.720
about OpenStack.

22:56.720 --> 23:00.040
And then to top it all off, they have a community that's packed full of people trying to learn

23:00.040 --> 23:04.040
and people who are experts, and they can give you that little nudge when you need a little

23:04.040 --> 23:05.040
more.

23:05.040 --> 23:09.160
LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged to get the summer of learning discount.

23:09.160 --> 23:10.160
Go check them out.

23:10.160 --> 23:11.560
Go look at all the new OpenStack stuff.

23:11.560 --> 23:13.280
Go look at all the new AWS stuff.

23:13.280 --> 23:16.280
And go look at all of the awesome Linux courses they have.

23:16.280 --> 23:20.300
If you're ready to get your certifications, LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged, and a huge

23:20.300 --> 23:24.040
thank you to LinuxAcademy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

23:24.040 --> 23:25.040
Good stuff.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.920
Great, great, great service for you guys.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.220
I'm so happy to have them as sponsors.

23:28.220 --> 23:32.120
Go check them out, even just to learn a little more to thank them as a way to just say thanks

23:32.120 --> 23:33.120
for sponsoring the show.

23:33.120 --> 23:36.120
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash Unplugged.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.120
All right.

23:37.120 --> 23:40.440
We've got two more emails to get to before we get to our LinuxCon interviews.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.480
And our next one comes in from Alec.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.320
And he's following up on a topic from a while back.

23:44.320 --> 23:45.880
He says, hey, Chris, Matt, chat room, mumble room.

23:45.880 --> 23:49.520
A couple of months ago, you were discussing the usage of open source in schools and had

23:49.520 --> 23:53.720
received a lot of feedback saying that a lot of the IT curriculum is not well designed

23:53.720 --> 23:56.400
and does not really incorporate Linux and free software.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.480
I have found that not to be the case.

23:58.480 --> 24:04.000
I'm 13 and I run Gentoo on my custom-built rig and Ubuntu on my DigitalOcean VPS.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.260
I have found that the IT teachers in my school have been knowledgeable about Linux and have

24:08.260 --> 24:10.360
encouraged its general use.

24:10.360 --> 24:13.640
I find there's a lot of enthusiasm for Linux in younger computer users as well.

24:13.640 --> 24:14.640
Thanks for all the great shows.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.640
Alec.

24:15.640 --> 24:16.640
I'd like to know where this kid lives.

24:16.640 --> 24:17.640
That's some great news, right?

24:17.640 --> 24:18.640
Yeah.

24:18.640 --> 24:21.120
I was going to say, I think Venue plays a lot in it.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.440
I think it depends on where you live.

24:22.440 --> 24:25.280
On certain communities, I certainly think that's the truth, especially in places like

24:25.280 --> 24:26.280
Canada.

24:26.280 --> 24:27.400
I know they're really big in Linux there.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.400
But here in the Northwest, I think it's kind of hit and miss.

24:29.400 --> 24:30.400
Yeah.

24:30.400 --> 24:33.680
I mean, we do have that Microsoft backyard culture that could be influencing our perspective

24:33.680 --> 24:34.680
on it.

24:34.680 --> 24:39.360
You know, I was very lucky that when I was in high school, Linux was very early and my

24:39.360 --> 24:44.200
teacher had heard of it and he was cool with giving it a shot.

24:44.200 --> 24:49.920
In my school, it was just some students, a group of students got together and said, hey,

24:49.920 --> 24:50.920
let's give this a shot.

24:50.920 --> 24:55.280
And then the school faculty who had a contract with Microsoft said, ah, no.

24:55.280 --> 24:56.280
Really?

24:56.280 --> 24:57.280
I had a similar experience.

24:57.280 --> 25:02.680
As a Canadian, I can say that when I went through high school, everything was Microsoft.

25:02.680 --> 25:08.600
And I've talked to members of the local users group here and they've talked about the same

25:08.600 --> 25:12.360
kind of problems with getting Linux into schools that you've mentioned on the show.

25:12.360 --> 25:16.080
So I think it might depend on the province to some extent.

25:16.080 --> 25:19.840
I'm sure it could depend on the district and their, you know, their culture, their deals.

25:19.840 --> 25:20.840
Oh, yeah.

25:20.840 --> 25:21.840
I mean, certainly.

25:21.840 --> 25:25.720
I can at least speak to my own school district.

25:25.720 --> 25:31.040
This year, we all got Chromebooks, which, I mean, the first thing I did when I got it

25:31.040 --> 25:36.720
was install Ubuntu in a CH root and, you know, and then I've been charging my friends $15

25:36.720 --> 25:37.720
to do it on theirs.

25:37.720 --> 25:38.720
Good man.

25:38.720 --> 25:39.720
I like this guy.

25:39.720 --> 25:40.720
Yeah.

25:40.720 --> 25:47.040
The funny thing about it, the funny thing about it is they've had these awful issues

25:47.040 --> 25:50.400
with their web proxy that they send all our traffic through.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.840
And so like in the middle of class, like people will be working on their Google docs or whatever

25:53.840 --> 25:56.400
and it'll just, you know, disconnect.

25:56.400 --> 26:02.800
And so I was in my AP biology class with this other kid that I'd installed Linux on.

26:02.800 --> 26:05.760
And so all of a sudden everyone starts raising their hands and like their stuff isn't working

26:05.760 --> 26:07.600
and like they can't connect to anything.

26:07.600 --> 26:12.080
And only the two of us, it is only the two of us that have a working internet connection.

26:12.080 --> 26:15.160
It was pretty great.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.160
That's a nice win.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.160
I like how he thinks too.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.160
Yeah.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.160
That is, that's very clever.

26:19.160 --> 26:20.160
Are you using Crouton?

26:20.160 --> 26:22.800
What are you doing to install a Ubuntu on there within the church?

26:22.800 --> 26:23.800
Yeah.

26:23.800 --> 26:24.800
Nice.

26:24.800 --> 26:25.800
Oh, that's clever, dude.

26:25.800 --> 26:26.800
Good for you.

26:26.800 --> 26:27.800
And it may, and you know what?

26:27.800 --> 26:28.800
It's a win for the kids too.

26:28.800 --> 26:29.800
15 bucks.

26:29.800 --> 26:34.320
And now they've just turned that computer into a computer and mostly they, they mostly

26:34.320 --> 26:37.880
want it so they can, cause if you do that, it doesn't go through their web proxy anymore.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.840
So you can get to Netflix and get to all that kind of stuff.

26:40.840 --> 26:41.840
Nice.

26:41.840 --> 26:42.840
That is, that is really great.

26:42.840 --> 26:43.840
Ingenious.

26:43.840 --> 26:44.840
That's great to hear.

26:44.840 --> 26:45.840
And you know what?

26:45.840 --> 26:48.380
That makes me, cause that, that makes me happy that Chromebooks are doing so well in schools

26:48.380 --> 26:51.560
because it means every kid that gets a Chromebook potentially has that option.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.560
That's right.

26:52.560 --> 26:56.360
And it just takes a little initiative to do it or a friend that will charge you 15 bucks.

26:56.360 --> 26:57.360
Yeah.

26:57.360 --> 26:59.080
And you know that that's not entirely out of their realm.

26:59.080 --> 27:03.000
I mean, look at what, look at what Linux supporters do every day.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Yeah.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.000
They support Linux in the background.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.000
Yeah.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
Dude's on his way to a contracting gig.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
That's right.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.000
He's going to be an IT consultant soon.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.000
That's right.

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
Exactly.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Uh, okay.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.880
There are the students that, that say, I can't believe you're charging 15 bucks to type stuff

27:14.880 --> 27:15.880
into a computer.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.840
You're like, do you know how to type that stuff?

27:17.840 --> 27:18.840
That's right.

27:18.840 --> 27:19.840
Yeah.

27:19.840 --> 27:20.840
Exactly.

27:20.840 --> 27:21.840
There's people that make millions of dollars a year typing things into a computer.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.520
You say, welcome to the knowledge economy, sucker.

27:23.520 --> 27:26.340
You know, at this conference I was at in Coeur d'Alene a couple of weeks ago, I was telling

27:26.340 --> 27:29.480
somebody about Linux and they're like, well, if it's free, what do you have to pay for

27:29.480 --> 27:30.480
it?

27:30.480 --> 27:31.480
Like the knowledge of the person.

27:31.480 --> 27:32.480
Think about like a doctor.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.480
If you go to the doctor, you pay them for their knowledge, not any product.

27:34.480 --> 27:37.480
I can cut you for free, but knowing how to cut you is what's important.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.480
That's right.

27:38.480 --> 27:39.480
That's right.

27:39.480 --> 27:40.480
That's a great analogy, Alex.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.480
Yeah.

27:41.480 --> 27:42.480
Yeah.

27:42.480 --> 27:43.480
Uh, all right.

27:43.480 --> 27:44.480
So we have, uh, one more email.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.480
It comes in from friend of the show, Stevo.

27:45.480 --> 27:49.920
He writes in from time to time and he says, hi Chris, I came across this and it looks

27:49.920 --> 27:52.080
like something that's right up your alley.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.200
It's a Kickstarter project.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.240
Now you guys know, I don't, I, if we, if we talk about Kickstarter projects all the time,

27:56.240 --> 27:59.160
I could have, we could have a whole show about Kickstarters every week, but from time to

27:59.160 --> 28:04.400
time there's a game that comes out on Kickstarter that, uh, scratches my funny bone in my special

28:04.400 --> 28:08.340
place that makes me, I even decided to back the game because they already out of the box

28:08.340 --> 28:16.920
have got Linux support and it is a old school, uh, platformer looking game, 8-bit style goodness.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.800
Uh, they have 993 backers.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.800
They're trying to get to $50,000.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.920
They're at $28,000 right now with 10 days to go.

28:24.920 --> 28:30.960
This game looks like a cross between Mario, Metroid, um, uh, I'm trying to, I'm blanking

28:30.960 --> 28:34.160
on some other games, but the first thing I thought of was Metroid just straight off the

28:34.160 --> 28:35.160
bat.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.160
Yeah.

28:36.160 --> 28:38.880
And they've got like some great, uh, some great videos and, uh, some great, uh, GIFs

28:38.880 --> 28:42.240
and it looks like a ton of work's already been done on the game and it already has a

28:42.240 --> 28:44.160
working Linux port too.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.000
So yeah, that I did with that.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.200
I decided, you know, if there already has a working Linux port, I'm going to go ahead

28:49.200 --> 28:50.200
and back it.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.800
So I backed it for 15 bucks and you get, you get access to the games.

28:52.800 --> 28:58.320
They're going to release it on Linux, uh, Mac, PC, or I guess Windows and the Wii U

28:58.320 --> 28:59.320
they say.

28:59.320 --> 29:00.320
Via Steam apparently.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.320
Yeah.

29:01.320 --> 29:02.320
Via Steam.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.040
So I'm just going to put a link in the show notes if you guys want to check it out.

29:04.040 --> 29:05.040
Stevo, I recommend it.

29:05.040 --> 29:08.560
He's got good taste and, uh, I watched the video and I decided to back it.

29:08.560 --> 29:15.120
And I, for me, my Kickstarter rule for games is, uh, I don't do games that either if they

29:15.120 --> 29:18.840
have stretch goal for Linux, I don't back them until they've reached it or I don't back

29:18.840 --> 29:21.360
them unless they upfront say Linux support.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.360
Yeah.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.800
Some people tease me with Linux support because they don't, you know, you never know if you're

29:24.800 --> 29:25.840
going to get it.

29:25.840 --> 29:27.520
So at this game, they're staying right out of the gate.

29:27.520 --> 29:28.520
They're doing Linux.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.120
It looks like a cool project too.

29:30.120 --> 29:33.520
So it's, uh, the game by the way is called Hive Jump if you want to look for it directly

29:33.520 --> 29:34.840
on the Kickstarter.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.320
We have a link in the show notes.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.320
Thanks Stevo for sending that in.

29:37.320 --> 29:41.520
If you guys see something that's really awesome in the Linux dimension on Kickstarter, uh,

29:41.520 --> 29:42.520
you can always email it in.

29:42.520 --> 29:46.360
Go over to jupiterbroadcasting.com, click the contact link and choose Linux Unplugged

29:46.360 --> 29:48.480
from the drop down or Linux Action Show.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.480
If I'll leave that to you.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.280
It's based on your timing, your sense of timing.

29:53.280 --> 29:54.680
Earlier in the week, probably should go to Unplugged.

29:54.680 --> 29:56.320
Later in the week, Linux Action Show.

29:56.320 --> 29:57.320
You know what?

29:57.320 --> 29:58.320
I'm not going to put that on you.

29:58.320 --> 29:59.320
I'm not going to put that on you.

29:59.320 --> 30:00.640
You guys can decide.

30:00.640 --> 30:01.640
You guys can decide.

30:01.640 --> 30:02.640
Flip a coin.

30:02.640 --> 30:03.640
All right.

30:03.640 --> 30:04.640
So let's shift gears to LinuxCon 2014.

30:04.640 --> 30:08.080
Uh, in fact, before we do that, I'll stop and I'll thank Ting.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.080
Everybody right now.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.080
Hey, do me a favor.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.080
Do me a solid.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.780
Go to linux.ting.com right now, linux.ting.com.

30:13.780 --> 30:16.080
Everybody do it, linux.ting.com.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.080
And here's why.

30:17.080 --> 30:21.400
Go to linux.ting.com, that's going to get you a $25 credit for your first month of Ting

30:21.400 --> 30:23.320
or more if you bring your own Ting device.

30:23.320 --> 30:27.480
If you don't have a Ting device, they're going to take $25 off your first phone.

30:27.480 --> 30:31.920
Real talk everybody, you got suckered into buying contracts and phones that are really

30:31.920 --> 30:32.920
not good for you.

30:32.920 --> 30:33.920
They're not good for you financially.

30:33.920 --> 30:35.600
They're not good for the soul.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.020
Ting is mobile that makes sense.

30:37.020 --> 30:42.140
No contract, no determination fee, and you only pay for what you use.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.920
It starts at a flat $6 per month.

30:44.920 --> 30:47.040
Then they just take your minutes, your messages.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.040
Then your megabytes.

30:48.040 --> 30:52.720
They add them all up, and that's just what you pay, plus any taxes that might be applicable.

30:52.720 --> 30:55.480
Linux.ting.com, try out their savings calculator.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.640
Ting has such an awesome setup here.

30:57.640 --> 31:01.480
And if you think about if we could go back in time, like if we all had DeLoreans, get

31:01.480 --> 31:05.480
them up to 88 miles per hour, we got those awesome Doc Brown sunglasses that he totally

31:05.480 --> 31:08.200
couldn't see anything out of, and you got your old man makeup on because you're going

31:08.200 --> 31:09.200
back in time.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.200
Right?

31:10.200 --> 31:11.200
I mean, real talk everybody, right?

31:11.200 --> 31:12.200
Real talk.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.200
No BS.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.760
You're going back in time to restructure the mobile industry.

31:14.760 --> 31:15.800
Let's not kid ourselves.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.640
You'd do it just like Ting's doing it, right?

31:17.640 --> 31:21.560
You'd have no hold customer service, 1855 Ting FTW, anytime between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.

31:21.560 --> 31:24.040
A real Canadian answers the phone.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.000
That Canadian isn't just polite.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.880
They're actually empowered to solve your problems.

31:27.880 --> 31:29.280
They're actually Android fans.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.320
Oh, and did you know you can go get the Nexus 5 directly from Ting's website?

31:32.320 --> 31:33.320
Boom.

31:33.320 --> 31:34.360
You own that Nexus 5.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.080
It's no contract, straight out.

31:36.080 --> 31:37.080
It's your phone.

31:37.080 --> 31:40.140
Just like when you go buy a laptop, you own that laptop, and if you just want to use Ting

31:40.140 --> 31:41.600
for the data, you can.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.120
Personally, I'm almost all Wi-Fi calling these days, and it's amazing.

31:45.120 --> 31:49.680
I've currently got three active phones on my Ting account, and I am paying less than

31:49.680 --> 31:52.080
all you fools in the other contracts out there.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.640
Paying less than all you guys.

31:53.640 --> 31:54.640
Linux.ting.com.

31:54.640 --> 31:55.640
How's your Nexus 5?

31:55.640 --> 31:56.640
My Nexus 5 is great.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.600
Yeah, you just got that cool gamepad controller, too.

31:58.600 --> 31:59.600
Yes, I did.

31:59.600 --> 32:02.440
The Mocha gamepad, the pocket one, it just fits right in the palm of my hand.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.440
Yeah, buddy.

32:03.440 --> 32:04.440
You can take it anywhere.

32:04.440 --> 32:05.440
Score.

32:05.440 --> 32:06.440
Yeah, it's really neat.

32:06.440 --> 32:08.880
The HTC phones, the Nexus 5, some amazing phones, Ting's got them.

32:08.880 --> 32:09.880
The iPhones are great.

32:09.880 --> 32:10.880
Ting's got them.

32:10.880 --> 32:13.920
They also have just dedicated hotspot and tethering if you just want to have some mobile

32:13.920 --> 32:14.920
data.

32:14.920 --> 32:15.920
$6 hotspot, you guys.

32:15.920 --> 32:16.920
You buy it once.

32:16.920 --> 32:17.920
You go to linux.ting.com.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.840
They're going to take $25 off, and then you have a hotspot.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.000
You can put it in your bag.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.000
Put it in your MERS.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
Put it in your purse.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.000
Put it in your drawer.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.000
It's a $6 hotspot.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.000
You need data.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.000
You turn it on.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
You've got data.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.000
Come on.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.000
It makes so much sense.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.000
Linux.ting.com.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
Try out the savings calculator.

32:33.000 --> 32:37.160
Just put in your actual usage, not the gimmick you're paying into that you may or may not

32:37.160 --> 32:38.400
be using all of.

32:38.400 --> 32:44.420
Put your actual usage into that savings calculator, and then sit back and go, I could buy a laptop

32:44.420 --> 32:49.760
every couple of years with that savings, linux.ting.com, and a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring

32:49.760 --> 32:50.760
Linux Unplugged.

32:50.760 --> 32:55.620
Okay, so let's get in the Mamba Room, and we'll start.

32:55.620 --> 32:59.320
So Noah, if you're in here with us, I'm going to play a couple of these interviews, and

32:59.320 --> 33:02.460
then after they wrap up, if you have any extra things you want to add to them or anything

33:02.460 --> 33:04.400
like that, you'll have the floor.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.600
I thought we should probably start with the one that seemed to interest you the most.

33:08.600 --> 33:14.040
You seem to really enjoy your chat with Matt from Cumulus Networks about their Linux software

33:14.040 --> 33:15.720
networking infrastructure.

33:15.720 --> 33:19.480
So I teased part one in Linux Action Show on Sunday.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.720
Let's start with part two, where you could see Noah starting to get really interested.

33:22.720 --> 33:23.800
He's like, okay, wait a minute here.

33:23.800 --> 33:26.480
If I was going to implement this, how would that look?

33:26.480 --> 33:28.280
And so that's where this discussion starts out.

33:28.280 --> 33:32.220
If you didn't catch our coverage on Linux Action Show on Sunday, Cumulus Networks is

33:32.220 --> 33:38.560
working on replacing extremely high-end Cisco-type networking equipment with Linux-powered infrastructure.

33:38.560 --> 33:43.080
So when you need to manage an interface on a switch, for example, you use ifconfig.

33:43.080 --> 33:44.080
It's amazing.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.080
It's crazy.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.080
And it's here today.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.080
Okay.

33:47.080 --> 33:50.440
Now, one of the things that I would be looking at from a system administration standpoint

33:50.440 --> 33:54.240
is how difficult is it to move from one infrastructure to the other?

33:54.240 --> 33:56.680
So for example, what routing protocols are supported?

33:56.680 --> 34:02.560
I mean, if I'm coming from a Cisco environment, for example, I'm sure there's going to be

34:02.560 --> 34:07.680
some routing protocols that just aren't open standards, and so they're not going to be

34:07.680 --> 34:09.960
able to be used with Cumulus Linux.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.520
Can you speak a little bit about that?

34:11.520 --> 34:12.520
Yeah.

34:12.520 --> 34:15.680
So we have a partnership with Quagga, which is a well-known open-source routing suite,

34:15.680 --> 34:20.720
and that includes very stable support for both BGP and OSPF.

34:20.720 --> 34:23.040
And so that's both, again, for IPv4 and IPv6.

34:23.040 --> 34:27.080
Now, our focus today is mostly in the data center, and that's in a layer-three-cloth

34:27.080 --> 34:28.080
design.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.840
Essentially, what that means is you have leaf and spine.

34:29.840 --> 34:32.480
It's a very horizontally scalable infrastructure.

34:32.480 --> 34:34.800
It's typically what the big boys do.

34:34.800 --> 34:39.000
If you look at a Facebook or an Amazon, they're pretty much all geared to that infrastructure.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.360
Now, they may run kind of a virtual network on top of that, just as they may use virtualization

34:43.360 --> 34:48.140
for their compute, but the underpinnings are traditionally a large, scalable layer-three.

34:48.140 --> 34:50.760
So those are our two main routing protocols.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.720
We also have a number of protocols supported for layer-two.

34:53.720 --> 34:58.360
So obviously, the very basic would be something like LLDP, which is similar to CDP, a way

34:58.360 --> 35:06.060
of discovering ports on the network, up to things like MLag-like functionality.

35:06.060 --> 35:10.680
So you can have two switches act as one to a particular downstream host.

35:10.680 --> 35:14.320
So we're continuing to add features both in the layer-two and layer-three space, but we're

35:14.320 --> 35:19.360
predominantly in the layer-three side, and BGP and OSPF are our most well-tested protocols,

35:19.360 --> 35:22.080
and that's what pretty much 99% of our customers use.

35:22.080 --> 35:23.080
Perfect.

35:23.080 --> 35:29.900
And what would you consider the ideal green environment for, I want to use Cumulus Network,

35:29.900 --> 35:31.600
how do I implement that?

35:31.600 --> 35:32.960
What would be your ideal customer?

35:32.960 --> 35:36.480
What do you think the best fit for somebody that's maybe looking for your product?

35:36.480 --> 35:42.920
Well, today we focus mostly on Broadcom-based products, and so Broadcom has a huge majority

35:42.920 --> 35:43.920
of the market.

35:43.920 --> 35:47.660
So when you look at a lot of data centers, switches, these are 10 gig, 40 gig, even one

35:47.660 --> 35:51.800
gig switches, again, from Adele or Cisco or Juniper.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.900
They have the lion's share of the market.

35:53.900 --> 35:57.920
And so we focus mostly on the 10 gig and 40 gig spot at this time.

35:57.920 --> 36:03.000
So for smaller businesses, we don't have, I would say, kind of a cheap or affordable

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
one gig switch.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.480
We have a few that we make available, but we're continuing to improve upon that.

36:08.480 --> 36:13.000
So I would say if you're doing 10 gig and 40 gig traffic, it's a great fit there from

36:13.000 --> 36:16.480
a traffic perspective, and certainly on the economic side.

36:16.480 --> 36:17.920
All of our pricing is transparent.

36:17.920 --> 36:18.920
It's on our website.

36:18.920 --> 36:21.600
It's very clear what the pricing model is.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.360
It's very similar to Red Hat.

36:23.360 --> 36:27.920
It's basically a license that you have to utilize the software for a year or three years

36:27.920 --> 36:29.720
in different support levels.

36:29.720 --> 36:34.360
We don't have any time bomb in the product, so it's not as if after a year it just stops

36:34.360 --> 36:35.360
routing your packets.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.640
We don't do anything like that.

36:36.640 --> 36:37.640
We try not to be evil.

36:37.640 --> 36:42.560
But I'd say really the third most important thing in that list is really just the philosophy.

36:42.560 --> 36:46.280
So if your organization has already switched to using some automation software and has

36:46.280 --> 36:51.120
strong Linux knowledge, particularly on the networking side, or that team is kind of hip

36:51.120 --> 36:53.480
to that environment, it works out really well.

36:53.480 --> 36:58.360
We see this a lot with customers where virtualization was seen as kind of a scare, where well, when

36:58.360 --> 37:01.440
we deploy virtualization, we're going to lose all these help desk folks.

37:01.440 --> 37:05.120
But really it just grew capacity for that part of the organization.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.120
This is the same thing.

37:06.120 --> 37:10.520
So a lot of times networking teams have struggled because they have to use something like Tickle

37:10.520 --> 37:15.480
or XSLT or some sort of proprietary programming language that's not well adopted or just never

37:15.480 --> 37:17.120
got mainstream interaction.

37:17.120 --> 37:20.360
What's great about Cumulus Linux is that that knowledge that you already have in-house can

37:20.360 --> 37:21.760
be immediately applied.

37:21.760 --> 37:25.840
So if you've written everything in Go or CornShell or PopIt or Ansible or whatever the case may

37:25.840 --> 37:28.200
be, that can now immediately apply to your network.

37:28.200 --> 37:32.820
So if your networking team is very much Linux savvy, it's a great fit.

37:32.820 --> 37:39.000
And speaking of actual in-production environments, you find a lot, every large organization,

37:39.000 --> 37:40.520
they have a ton of system administrators.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.120
They don't necessarily have a lot of network engineers.

37:43.120 --> 37:47.640
So how does Cumulus Linux cater to that evolving market dynamic?

37:47.640 --> 37:49.360
Well, that's a great question.

37:49.360 --> 37:54.600
So on the sysadmin side, we've tried to be very open about the software that we support.

37:54.600 --> 37:58.080
So we just announced a customer that developed actually Chef cookbooks.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.160
The customer's name is Uyala.

38:00.160 --> 38:03.960
And they actually published on their GitHub account cookbooks that support both Quagga

38:03.960 --> 38:09.480
generation and the Excedra Network Interfaces file, which is the Debian-style file for configuring

38:09.480 --> 38:11.960
both physical and logical interfaces.

38:11.960 --> 38:16.320
And so that was a customer-driven adoption of a particular tool.

38:16.320 --> 38:20.360
And on Cumulus itself, we've actually done development for both Puppet and Ansible for

38:20.360 --> 38:22.320
modules there that you can utilize.

38:22.320 --> 38:27.240
So we try to adopt the tools that system administrators are already using as much as we can.

38:27.240 --> 38:32.800
And when you do have to make changes to a code base or when you do have to get an update,

38:32.800 --> 38:37.440
is that something that stays in Cumulus or is that something that gets pushed back upstream?

38:37.440 --> 38:38.440
Yeah.

38:38.440 --> 38:45.920
So I would say about 99% of the software that we maintain or modify or change, we push upstream.

38:45.920 --> 38:50.760
There's a website called OSS.cumulusnetworks.com, and that lists all of our patches or all of

38:50.760 --> 38:51.760
our diffs.

38:51.760 --> 38:56.680
Since we're based off of Debian, all of our diffs are against a Debian-based package.

38:56.680 --> 39:00.400
So it's kind of two levels of diffs, if you will, from the original upstream code.

39:00.400 --> 39:04.840
There's the Debian-style package, whatever it's changed, and then our diff against that.

39:04.840 --> 39:10.640
So anything like Quagga, LDP, libraries, the kernel, Netlink, we've pushed that all upstream.

39:10.640 --> 39:14.400
The only component that's proprietary at this time is something called SwitchD, which is

39:14.400 --> 39:18.960
both kind of a driver and a user-land process that replicates any of the Netlink events

39:18.960 --> 39:20.000
in the hardware.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.880
So again, if you were to add a route with, say, IP space route or with Quagga or your

39:23.880 --> 39:28.020
own routing protocol, it intercepts those events and pushes it down in the hardware.

39:28.020 --> 39:30.680
So again, you get a performance of a traditional switch.

39:30.680 --> 39:33.680
It also does other events like, say, firewalls, for example.

39:33.680 --> 39:38.720
So if you write rules and IP tables syntax, we will parse those, make sure they're valid,

39:38.720 --> 39:39.780
and then push it in the hardware.

39:39.780 --> 39:43.340
So SwitchD is something that unfortunately is not open at this time because the code

39:43.340 --> 39:45.400
it's compiled against is not GPL.

39:45.400 --> 39:46.400
Okay.

39:46.400 --> 39:51.520
Well, the bottom line is, that's one package out of the entire project.

39:51.520 --> 39:55.960
I would consider you guys to be a very, very good community member, and I think that's

39:55.960 --> 39:56.960
really fantastic.

39:56.960 --> 40:02.200
Like I said, one of the companies that is actually using Linux and contributing to the

40:02.200 --> 40:07.280
community and believes that Linux can succeed in your respective space, and I think that's

40:07.280 --> 40:08.280
really fantastic.

40:08.280 --> 40:12.080
Now, if somebody wanted to play, maybe they're not in an enterprise, they're just a home

40:12.080 --> 40:15.240
user, and they just, because it's such an interesting project, they wanted to play with

40:15.240 --> 40:16.240
it.

40:16.240 --> 40:20.280
Is there a way to obtain Humulus Linux and try it and see how it works?

40:20.280 --> 40:21.280
Yeah.

40:21.280 --> 40:24.280
So today, we don't currently offer a VM that's available for customers.

40:24.280 --> 40:27.320
The main difference there is that the VM is not going to represent exactly what you'd

40:27.320 --> 40:28.320
get on hardware.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.980
Certainly, the performance would be night and day difference.

40:30.980 --> 40:34.120
Other things that are different, so for example, on a VM, you may not get certain telemetry

40:34.120 --> 40:38.320
or environmental data like, say, SM BIOS fields, like a serial number, stuff like that.

40:38.320 --> 40:41.880
So we are working on packaging a VM for the end of the year that will be available for

40:41.880 --> 40:43.080
folks to trial.

40:43.080 --> 40:46.920
But today, we have something called the Humulus Workbench, which basically allows prospective

40:46.920 --> 40:50.820
customers to register time on an actual real environment.

40:50.820 --> 40:55.280
So we have a number of switches in the data center that have a console server, a PDU,

40:55.280 --> 40:56.520
and a management host.

40:56.520 --> 40:59.820
And so that allows customers to experiment with a number of different software suites.

40:59.820 --> 41:04.760
So we have Ansible, and CF Engine, and Puppet, all available there, and you can literally

41:04.760 --> 41:11.340
run an apt-get command and say, okay, I want to build a two-leaf spine architecture with

41:11.340 --> 41:15.200
two leaf nodes and two spines, and they're already physically cabled up, and it will

41:15.200 --> 41:19.160
actually blast out all the conflicts for that and walk you through all the steps.

41:19.160 --> 41:21.120
So the Humulus Workbench is available to anyone.

41:21.120 --> 41:22.720
You just have to schedule time.

41:22.720 --> 41:27.320
Again, we have roughly around 40 or so switches in a data center that's made available for

41:27.320 --> 41:28.320
that.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.320
We feel that's more representative of kind of the real-world environment.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.320
That's fantastic.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.680
What's the cost involved with doing that?

41:33.680 --> 41:35.400
The Humulus Workbench right now is free.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.760
We don't do any charge for that.

41:36.760 --> 41:40.360
But typically, you always have to fill out a form and talk about what your use case is

41:40.360 --> 41:42.400
and what you're planning to do.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.400
That's fantastic.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.240
Now, how about, you said that the pricing structure is very open.

41:45.240 --> 41:47.880
Can I ask what a copy of Cumulus Linux costs?

41:47.880 --> 41:48.880
Sure.

41:48.880 --> 41:50.160
So it depends on two factors.

41:50.160 --> 41:53.000
Basically, what is the dominant line share of the ports?

41:53.000 --> 41:57.200
So is it a mostly one-gig switch, meaning it's got probably 48 ports of one gig and

41:57.200 --> 41:58.800
a couple ports of 10 gig?

41:58.800 --> 42:01.120
Or is it a 10-gig switch, or is it a 40-gig switch?

42:01.120 --> 42:05.400
So the physical infrastructure dictates the pricing.

42:05.400 --> 42:14.560
Also, there is either standard business support or more rapid support in terms of like a 24-7

42:14.560 --> 42:15.560
coverage.

42:15.560 --> 42:18.720
Roughly, it's around $5,000 when you're looking for a 10-gig switch.

42:18.720 --> 42:23.000
Again, it depends on the support levels and all the pricing on the website.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.280
I think the difference with us is that you're basically getting a full operating system

42:26.280 --> 42:31.480
with support, by the way, for the cost of traditionally a support contract.

42:31.480 --> 42:32.920
And so that's really powerful.

42:32.920 --> 42:36.640
And all of our support engineers today are based out of Raleigh, and so we have a good

42:36.640 --> 42:41.540
pool of both ex-Red Hat folks, ex-Sysco folks, and other vendors.

42:41.540 --> 42:43.800
So the amount of knowledge there is pretty high.

42:43.800 --> 42:48.480
So it's very common for us to respond back to a customer very promptly and say, here's

42:48.480 --> 42:53.080
a Python script, or here's a one-liner, or here's a patch to solve your problem, versus

42:53.080 --> 42:55.520
we have to wait to get a new build out to them.

42:55.520 --> 42:56.620
That's fantastic.

42:56.620 --> 42:59.880
That's really great to have that one-on-one direct connect right to the people that can

42:59.880 --> 43:02.420
actually provide you the help that you need.

43:02.420 --> 43:08.000
How much, if you know off the top of your head, would it cost to get one of the actual

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
switching hardware?

43:09.000 --> 43:11.680
Well, again, that's really dependent on how you're acquiring hardware.

43:11.680 --> 43:15.680
So if you're going to something like a CDW, or indoor micro, versus a Dell, versus kind

43:15.680 --> 43:19.480
of a local mom and pop bar, the pricing can be pretty dramatic there, just as it would

43:19.480 --> 43:22.880
be with a super micro server or a Dell server.

43:22.880 --> 43:27.760
Typically, we'll see 10 gigabit switches, meaning that there's 40 ports of 10 gig, and

43:27.760 --> 43:29.860
usually four 40 gig ports.

43:29.860 --> 43:32.440
Those are all SFP and QSFP based.

43:32.440 --> 43:37.120
Typically, we see that for about five grand US quantity one, and again, that's kind of

43:37.120 --> 43:38.800
standard MSRP pricing.

43:38.800 --> 43:44.280
So it can be dramatically cheaper, or a little bit more depending on your acquisition method

43:44.280 --> 43:45.280
of getting hardware.

43:45.280 --> 43:46.280
Right, right.

43:46.280 --> 43:48.720
Well, I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with us.

43:48.720 --> 43:52.960
If people wanted to find more about Cumulus Networks, more about Cumulus Linux, and perhaps

43:52.960 --> 43:56.080
get in contact with you and make a sale, where could people go to do that?

43:56.080 --> 43:57.080
Yeah, certainly.

43:57.080 --> 44:00.880
So cumulusnetworks.com is the website, and it has data sheets, information on how to

44:00.880 --> 44:04.480
sign up for the customer workbench, and then a contact form.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.560
You can also reach out to myself.

44:06.560 --> 44:13.200
It's Matt, M-A-T-T, at cumulusnetworks.com, and I'd be happy to answer any questions.

44:13.200 --> 44:14.680
That was a lot of info.

44:14.680 --> 44:16.400
Noah, did you walk away?

44:16.400 --> 44:19.240
Are you thinking about maybe deploying that for clients, or at least playing with the

44:19.240 --> 44:20.240
tech?

44:20.240 --> 44:21.240
Oh yeah, for sure.

44:21.240 --> 44:23.920
So let's, if you don't mind, I'll take a minute and go through a couple things.

44:23.920 --> 44:24.920
Sure.

44:24.920 --> 44:28.280
So one thing he left out in the interview that I thought was so interesting, and he

44:28.280 --> 44:31.360
just didn't mention it, so I didn't know if they wanted to go on camera with it or not,

44:31.360 --> 44:35.920
but I heard him mention it a couple times after that at the booth, so it doesn't seem

44:35.920 --> 44:36.920
to be private.

44:36.920 --> 44:42.560
But the guy that started Cumulus Networks originally worked for Cisco, and then came

44:42.560 --> 44:46.960
over to Google to help design and build a large portion of their infrastructure.

44:46.960 --> 44:49.000
So they know networking.

44:49.000 --> 44:54.080
It's not like they're beginners.

44:54.080 --> 45:00.760
So walking around LinuxCon, as we saw at OSCON, was people are interested in how we can make

45:00.760 --> 45:06.160
money off the backs of the community, not necessarily how do we improve the community,

45:06.160 --> 45:08.720
how do we improve Linux, or how do we get Linux adoption.

45:08.720 --> 45:11.700
And a lot of people really want to marginalize Linux.

45:11.700 --> 45:15.680
They want to say Linux is really only good on the server as far as anything else, embedded

45:15.680 --> 45:16.680
and server, that's good.

45:16.680 --> 45:18.760
And it's an implementation detail.

45:18.760 --> 45:19.760
Right.

45:19.760 --> 45:21.640
So, and this company is doing the exact opposite.

45:21.640 --> 45:23.480
They're saying, listen, we're doubling down.

45:23.480 --> 45:25.720
We think that Linux is actually good enough.

45:25.720 --> 45:30.280
Everyone wants to go towards Cisco and Juniper and HP, and really, we have all the tools

45:30.280 --> 45:33.480
we already need, and it's already backed by the community, and we're already making

45:33.480 --> 45:38.260
all of these developments and forward progression in the server space.

45:38.260 --> 45:42.320
So why not take all that information, why not take all of those trained individuals,

45:42.320 --> 45:46.220
and instead of paying a network engineer to manage the switches, and a network administrator

45:46.220 --> 45:51.040
to manage the servers, I can pay one person to manage both, or at least have, you know,

45:51.040 --> 45:52.040
people are cross trained.

45:52.040 --> 45:56.480
And just being able to take my Linux system administration skills and apply them to manage

45:56.480 --> 46:00.600
a switch, it sounds very valuable to me to repurpose that skill set.

46:00.600 --> 46:03.760
Did you get a chance at their booth to see any of the actual hardware, like did it look

46:03.760 --> 46:04.760
good?

46:04.760 --> 46:05.760
Yeah.

46:05.760 --> 46:12.040
Well, it's, so what it is, is it's generic, it's the, it's essentially the same piece

46:12.040 --> 46:16.040
of equipment that Cisco buys when they put Cisco IOS on and then painted a different

46:16.040 --> 46:18.440
color and stuff, right.

46:18.440 --> 46:25.120
But so the other thing too, and I think that he didn't, as far as, you know, maybe this

46:25.120 --> 46:30.680
is a little too technical, but when I was asking him about implementing it, essentially

46:30.680 --> 46:36.040
what I was getting at was, I know that their router supports like OSPF, and I know they

46:36.040 --> 46:40.380
do RIP and RIPv2, what I wanted to know is there's a lot of environments that are stuck

46:40.380 --> 46:43.320
on Cisco devices because they're using IGRP.

46:43.320 --> 46:48.280
And up until last year, IGRP was a proprietary protocol that only Cisco devices could use,

46:48.280 --> 46:51.280
but now in 2013, they actually released it as an open standard.

46:51.280 --> 46:55.600
So I was interested in seeing if, cause if that's a possibility, if that, if, if they

46:55.600 --> 46:59.840
are planning on implementing it, or if they have already implemented it, there's a huge

46:59.840 --> 47:04.960
market for people that want to jump off of Cisco hardware, but need to be able to adapt

47:04.960 --> 47:07.960
to EIGRP.

47:07.960 --> 47:09.400
And I didn't quite get that answer.

47:09.400 --> 47:11.120
I didn't get the answer I was looking for, and that's okay.

47:11.120 --> 47:15.680
And the other thing I was a little disappointed with is I was hoping that there would be like

47:15.680 --> 47:18.980
some sort of a community edition or a free edition that I could download and put it on

47:18.980 --> 47:24.440
to just a regular x86 box and just put two network cards in.

47:24.440 --> 47:25.800
Yeah, you can't do that?

47:25.800 --> 47:26.800
No, you can't.

47:26.800 --> 47:27.800
Unfortunately, no.

47:27.800 --> 47:28.800
Oh yeah.

47:28.800 --> 47:30.560
That would be extremely useful.

47:30.560 --> 47:33.200
So the thing is, how does, how does stuff like this get adopted?

47:33.200 --> 47:36.320
Stuff like this gets adopted because everyone starts using it or everyone starts playing

47:36.320 --> 47:37.320
with it.

47:37.320 --> 47:39.680
Or you know, a lot of times you inappropriately put something into production that you probably

47:39.680 --> 47:41.880
shouldn't and then you decide, you know what, this is worth it.

47:41.880 --> 47:44.240
Let me go ahead and just buy the commercial version or whatever.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.240
Exactly.

47:45.240 --> 47:49.440
I was kind of hoping that, that he would say something like that and he didn't, but overall,

47:49.440 --> 47:51.840
they were one of the, and I don't know if I, you know, I think it was on the other part

47:51.840 --> 47:57.560
of the interview, but all, except for one package, every other development or every

47:57.560 --> 48:00.240
other improvement they make, they contribute back upstream.

48:00.240 --> 48:04.720
So the Linux community is benefiting from everyone that buys one of these routers or

48:04.720 --> 48:05.720
switches.

48:05.720 --> 48:06.720
That's awesome.

48:06.720 --> 48:09.000
I mean, it's, that's, this is one of the things I love about when commercial companies get

48:09.000 --> 48:11.160
involved with Linux and they do it the right way.

48:11.160 --> 48:13.240
And I think that's what Cumulus is doing here.

48:13.240 --> 48:16.240
And one of the reasons I wanted to spend some time on this, this episode is because I think

48:16.240 --> 48:20.000
this is one of the most fascinating areas of potential growth for Linux that we could

48:20.000 --> 48:21.920
see in the next few years.

48:21.920 --> 48:25.360
And it's something that it's hard for us, unless you're deploying this kind of stuff

48:25.360 --> 48:27.080
all the time to really kind of talk about.

48:27.080 --> 48:30.720
So that was a great insight from Matt and I'd be really curious to know if you do end

48:30.720 --> 48:32.280
up playing with it, how it goes.

48:32.280 --> 48:33.280
Yeah.

48:33.280 --> 48:34.280
Interesting stuff.

48:34.280 --> 48:35.280
All right.

48:35.280 --> 48:36.840
So we, I, we got two more interviews to play.

48:36.840 --> 48:38.120
That was our longest one.

48:38.120 --> 48:41.400
I I'm looking, I haven't watched this all the way through yet cause I was saving it

48:41.400 --> 48:42.400
for the show.

48:42.400 --> 48:45.040
So I stopped by and had a chat with Frank from own cloud.

48:45.040 --> 48:47.040
We've talked to Frank before in the Linux action show.

48:47.040 --> 48:49.800
This might be Frank's first appearance on Linux unplugged.

48:49.800 --> 48:52.760
I'm really curious to see what he had to say.

48:52.760 --> 48:58.160
So back in the media lounge yet at Linux con 2014, I ran into Frank and of course you guys

48:58.160 --> 48:59.160
remember Frank.

48:59.160 --> 49:01.720
He's been on both the Linux action show and I believe Linux unplugged.

49:01.720 --> 49:02.720
How are you doing today, Frank?

49:02.720 --> 49:03.720
Not sure.

49:03.720 --> 49:04.720
Very good.

49:04.720 --> 49:05.720
It's a great event here.

49:05.720 --> 49:06.720
It is.

49:06.720 --> 49:07.720
It's fantastic.

49:07.720 --> 49:08.720
And it's fantastic too.

49:08.720 --> 49:11.120
Um, as I'm walking around, I'm finding more and more people that are, that are using Linux.

49:11.120 --> 49:16.320
Um, and of course one of the big hurdles to that is having services and products that

49:16.320 --> 49:17.320
work on Linux.

49:17.320 --> 49:21.640
And of course own cloud is right at the front of making that happen.

49:21.640 --> 49:22.640
Yeah.

49:22.640 --> 49:24.640
I mean that's, thank you.

49:24.640 --> 49:25.640
That's our goal exactly.

49:25.640 --> 49:29.840
I mean, our goal is not to provide like a service or software doing open source project.

49:29.840 --> 49:33.720
There's something esoteric, but something that's really useful for people that can run

49:33.720 --> 49:36.200
at a machine and it's really bring some value to them.

49:36.200 --> 49:37.200
Yeah.

49:37.200 --> 49:40.600
So you guys recently came out with the latest version of own cloud.

49:40.600 --> 49:43.680
So I'm still on six, but I understand there's a newer version and that there's some really

49:43.680 --> 49:45.880
compelling reasons to upgrade.

49:45.880 --> 49:46.880
That's true.

49:46.880 --> 49:47.880
Yeah.

49:47.880 --> 49:48.880
Yeah.

49:48.880 --> 49:52.120
We released own cloud seven, the community edition, like six weeks ago or something as

49:52.120 --> 49:53.400
a huge step forward.

49:53.400 --> 49:59.520
I mean in several areas, the user interface, the front end is really completely redesigned.

49:59.520 --> 50:01.160
It's a, it's a lot faster.

50:01.160 --> 50:05.460
I mean, you mentioned me before that the speed is, uh, could be better in six.

50:05.460 --> 50:06.800
We actually did it for seven.

50:06.800 --> 50:08.960
So seven is really significantly faster.

50:08.960 --> 50:13.040
And then we have a lot of exciting new features with server to server sharing.

50:13.040 --> 50:16.360
So if you have an own cloud server, I have an own cloud server, we can have a shared

50:16.360 --> 50:21.040
folder that I put something in my folder that appears on your folder, even as different

50:21.040 --> 50:22.040
machines.

50:22.040 --> 50:26.900
And then we support object store back and we support lots of polishing.

50:26.900 --> 50:30.600
And one of the, another big things I want to mention is actually the quality and the

50:30.600 --> 50:35.680
stability of the software really significantly improved and we closed, I don't know, hundreds

50:35.680 --> 50:36.680
of bugs.

50:36.680 --> 50:39.960
It's really, really nicely polished and faster now.

50:39.960 --> 50:45.440
One of the things that I have always looked for in, um, in a project and I think own cloud

50:45.440 --> 50:50.600
is the closest I've ever seen to delivering this is, you know, when I log onto the internet,

50:50.600 --> 50:54.200
one of the first places I head over is to my, like my social networking site and I click

50:54.200 --> 50:58.420
on that because it's like this hub that I can get like a dashboard view of what's going

50:58.420 --> 50:59.420
on in life.

50:59.420 --> 51:00.420
I can get news there.

51:00.420 --> 51:01.420
I get updates with my friends.

51:01.420 --> 51:04.600
I have the contact info, all the stuff that I want to see pictures, all that stuff comes

51:04.600 --> 51:05.600
into that hub.

51:05.600 --> 51:09.320
And one thing that I think has always been missing from computing in general is a hub

51:09.320 --> 51:10.400
for other things.

51:10.400 --> 51:14.680
So for example, like I need a hub that tells me what tasks I'm doing today and a hub that

51:14.680 --> 51:18.800
tells me what my calendar is and a hub that tells me where my notes are and, and messages

51:18.800 --> 51:19.980
and people send me messages.

51:19.980 --> 51:23.800
And I have been able to, cause the nice thing about own cloud is you can almost craft it

51:23.800 --> 51:25.320
to do those things.

51:25.320 --> 51:28.160
And I'm wondering, is that kind of the same vision that you guys are seeing?

51:28.160 --> 51:34.240
Are you looking to essentially replace things like Google services?

51:34.240 --> 51:38.000
I wouldn't say that the goal is to replace Google services because there are lots of

51:38.000 --> 51:39.000
them, right?

51:39.000 --> 51:41.440
And some of them are actually very good.

51:41.440 --> 51:45.720
So it's, I would say, Hey, we want to replace everything like tomorrow.

51:45.720 --> 51:47.000
That's a big task.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.600
But what we want to do is everything that actually contains sensible data for you, something

51:52.600 --> 51:59.400
that you consider private, your files, your emails, your calendar, your notes, something

51:59.400 --> 52:00.400
like that.

52:00.400 --> 52:04.280
So that's the mission of own cloud, that you can host it yourself, that you can protect

52:04.280 --> 52:05.280
it.

52:05.280 --> 52:10.400
If it moves more into like the social area where you have like a news feed of your friends

52:10.400 --> 52:14.480
and then it's like, I mean, then it makes more sense for centralized services.

52:14.480 --> 52:17.720
So we don't want to replace Facebook or Twitter or something, right?

52:17.720 --> 52:22.920
Because it's actually useful to have it in a central server because it's social, right?

52:22.920 --> 52:27.320
But the stuff that's actually very important for you, private has to be protected, encrypted

52:27.320 --> 52:29.680
perhaps that's own cloud, yeah.

52:29.680 --> 52:30.680
That's fantastic.

52:30.680 --> 52:35.520
Now I know that own cloud, one of the, one of the huge advantages is that I can, if the,

52:35.520 --> 52:39.840
if own cloud itself doesn't provide me with a functionality, I can go out, find an ad

52:39.840 --> 52:44.000
and put it in and I've had that, that functionality and I've noticed that over the revisions,

52:44.000 --> 52:48.460
it seems like some of those things that were previously add-ons have gotten, maybe not

52:48.460 --> 52:52.020
exactly in their current form, but they, they get integrated into the actual own cloud.

52:52.020 --> 52:54.000
Have we seen that from six to seven?

52:54.000 --> 52:55.000
Yeah, partly.

52:55.000 --> 52:58.840
I mean, there are some, let me think about examples.

52:58.840 --> 53:05.000
I mean, the picture gallery, for example, it was relatively basic for own cloud three

53:05.000 --> 53:07.040
and four and so on.

53:07.040 --> 53:13.400
And there were like third party picture galleries with more nicer slideshow features and so

53:13.400 --> 53:14.760
on.

53:14.760 --> 53:19.940
And now the newest gallery application that's in own cloud seven actually has all the features.

53:19.940 --> 53:22.320
So what you say is partly true.

53:22.320 --> 53:27.520
And the reason for that is obviously because own cloud is a fully open community driven

53:27.520 --> 53:28.600
software.

53:28.600 --> 53:32.440
So everybody can contribute and we see a lot more contributors.

53:32.440 --> 53:35.060
I mean, our numbers are really, really going up.

53:35.060 --> 53:40.240
So a lot more people that put their stuff in, they have their ideas, submit patches,

53:40.240 --> 53:41.240
pull requests.

53:41.240 --> 53:43.440
So that's the nice thing about open source.

53:43.440 --> 53:46.400
So lots more polishing all over the place.

53:46.400 --> 53:52.540
Now you mentioned that as these features rise and of course your need for funding is going

53:52.540 --> 53:53.540
to rise.

53:53.540 --> 53:57.440
One of the ways I think that that could work is if own cloud was to succeed in a corporate

53:57.440 --> 53:58.440
environment.

53:58.440 --> 54:01.120
So right up until this point, we're talking about private data.

54:01.120 --> 54:04.880
But what happens if a company wanted to essentially establish their own cloud?

54:04.880 --> 54:08.160
I mean, I've actually seen firsthand that work at a couple of different places.

54:08.160 --> 54:11.240
They've rolled out own cloud and it worked very, very well in a corporate infrastructure.

54:11.240 --> 54:14.580
Is that something that you guys catered to or is that just a happenstance that happens

54:14.580 --> 54:15.580
to work out?

54:15.580 --> 54:16.580
Absolutely.

54:16.580 --> 54:21.800
I mean, this is the core reason why own cloud as an open source project and own cloud as

54:21.800 --> 54:26.160
a company work so well together because the requirements are actually very similar.

54:26.160 --> 54:30.360
I mean, companies want to protect their data and individuals at home want to protect their

54:30.360 --> 54:35.480
data and want to host it themselves and integrate it with other customization and extend it

54:35.480 --> 54:36.560
and so on.

54:36.560 --> 54:41.000
So the general idea is really similar and because of that, we are actually, we are able

54:41.000 --> 54:42.880
to found a company around own cloud.

54:42.880 --> 54:48.160
As you know, we have own cloud Inc startup and we sell exactly what you asked for like

54:48.160 --> 54:50.480
an enterprise optimized version of own cloud.

54:50.480 --> 54:52.360
We provide this for, sell this to companies.

54:52.360 --> 54:53.360
Yeah.

54:53.360 --> 54:54.360
Perfect.

54:54.360 --> 54:57.560
Is there anything else you'd like to tell us about own cloud, the project, or if people

54:57.560 --> 55:00.680
are interested in finding out more, is there a place they can go to find more information?

55:00.680 --> 55:05.680
Well, there's owncloud.org for the community site, owncloud.com for the company site.

55:05.680 --> 55:06.920
But it's actually good that you asked.

55:06.920 --> 55:10.440
There's one more thing I want to talk about is if you're really interested in own cloud

55:10.440 --> 55:16.200
and you want to contribute, want to be part of the community, then we have the very first

55:16.200 --> 55:22.320
own cloud developer conference coming up in Berlin, actually next week in Berlin.

55:22.320 --> 55:26.320
So you can go to owncloud.org slash conf.

55:26.320 --> 55:31.040
And we have already way over 100 people signed up and these are not users, right?

55:31.040 --> 55:33.720
These are the people who want to contribute, developers.

55:33.720 --> 55:38.200
So if you want to be part of this open community, just come there.

55:38.200 --> 55:40.720
It's absolutely free, of course.

55:40.720 --> 55:45.760
And just work with us on building the next big thing for own cloud.

55:45.760 --> 55:48.040
Man, I'll tell you what.

55:48.040 --> 55:52.480
I am an own cloud believer, too, as of version 7.

55:52.480 --> 55:54.480
Noah, have you played with it yet?

55:54.480 --> 55:56.240
Have you done any own cloud deployments?

55:56.240 --> 55:57.240
I know you mentioned you had a 6.

55:57.240 --> 56:00.560
Are you just experimenting or is it something you're using all the time?

56:00.560 --> 56:01.560
Yeah.

56:01.560 --> 56:08.520
So I put 6 to use personally and then I actually, we had a clinic that came and what they were

56:08.520 --> 56:12.800
asking for was it seemed like own cloud would fit and I showed them a demo.

56:12.800 --> 56:13.800
It was actually, it was funny.

56:13.800 --> 56:17.280
I was sitting in a meeting room and I'm like, usually I would have a demo set up.

56:17.280 --> 56:21.920
I had no idea you guys were looking for this, so I can show you my personal one and if you

56:21.920 --> 56:22.920
like it.

56:22.920 --> 56:23.920
Yeah, sure.

56:23.920 --> 56:24.920
So it was on the screen for a little bit.

56:24.920 --> 56:27.560
After 15 minutes, the CEO of the hospital said, yeah, we're going to go to this.

56:27.560 --> 56:32.680
Man, that makes so much sense for hospitals or companies like that.

56:32.680 --> 56:33.680
And so I got back.

56:33.680 --> 56:38.280
I didn't get back to Grand Forks until Friday and I had to catch up on work Saturday, Sunday

56:38.280 --> 56:39.280
and Monday.

56:39.280 --> 56:43.040
So I haven't really had a chance to do a whole lot, but I'm definitely going to upgrade my

56:43.040 --> 56:44.200
instance to 7.

56:44.200 --> 56:47.640
And of course, Frank, somebody said in the chat room, you know, Frank is a super nice

56:47.640 --> 56:51.680
guy and a great guy to talk to and somebody who's really dedicated to his projects.

56:51.680 --> 56:53.840
Yeah, I like both him and Joss a lot.

56:53.840 --> 56:54.840
They're both really great guys.

56:54.840 --> 56:59.060
You know, let me tell you how I've done my own cloud instance and this is really how

56:59.060 --> 57:00.240
I recommend you do it too.

57:00.240 --> 57:01.240
It's amazing.

57:01.240 --> 57:05.560
First, go to our sponsor, digitalocean.com and keep in mind, you can use the promo code

57:05.560 --> 57:06.920
unpluggedaugust.

57:06.920 --> 57:10.720
Keep unplugged August in the back of your mind while I tell you a little bit about this.

57:10.720 --> 57:14.800
Digitalocean.com is where I set up my droplet running Ubuntu 14.04.

57:14.800 --> 57:16.400
Then I went over to the own cloud website.

57:16.400 --> 57:19.560
I followed a extremely simple step-by-step guide.

57:19.560 --> 57:21.160
It sets up a repo for own cloud.

57:21.160 --> 57:23.560
So now I'm getting updates to my own cloud installation.

57:23.560 --> 57:24.680
I've already had one update.

57:24.680 --> 57:26.600
It went brilliantly, no problem.

57:26.600 --> 57:30.720
And I have a VPS that's on DigitalOcean right now and all it does is own cloud.

57:30.720 --> 57:31.720
And it's awesome.

57:31.720 --> 57:34.600
I went out and registered a great domain that I love for it.

57:34.600 --> 57:35.600
That's super funny.

57:35.600 --> 57:38.560
I'm going to use it for our production staff and I switched over.

57:38.560 --> 57:42.840
I have a test iOS 8 device and I'm going to try this on the Sailfish OS device that I

57:42.840 --> 57:46.640
have too because I noticed it also has support for CarDAV and KelDAV.

57:46.640 --> 57:51.600
And now all of the backend syncing infrastructure for my mobile apps is going to my own cloud

57:51.600 --> 57:52.600
instance.

57:52.600 --> 57:53.600
I'm not syncing off Google anymore.

57:53.600 --> 57:56.680
I've moved off Google on my phone and it's amazing.

57:56.680 --> 57:59.880
It really does feel incredible because I haven't lost the functionality.

57:59.880 --> 58:04.840
I'm using my DigitalOcean droplet with own cloud 7, syncing to my phones.

58:04.840 --> 58:05.840
It's amazing.

58:05.840 --> 58:06.840
And you can do it too.

58:06.840 --> 58:12.240
I have a local sync right here on my, in fact there's my own cloud sync client right there.

58:12.240 --> 58:13.240
I just fired up.

58:13.240 --> 58:17.760
It's connecting to my DigitalOcean droplet, keeping all of my desktops in sync.

58:17.760 --> 58:18.760
I love that.

58:18.760 --> 58:19.900
Who needs Dropbox?

58:19.900 --> 58:25.400
And that just right there, just that is worth $5 and that's not all I'm using it for.

58:25.400 --> 58:27.320
So here's a little bit about DigitalOcean.

58:27.320 --> 58:31.740
It really is a simple cloud hosting dedicated to really the most intuitive and easy way

58:31.740 --> 58:32.960
to spin up a cloud server.

58:32.960 --> 58:36.420
I'm getting emails from folks that are spinning up servers in under a minute all the time.

58:36.420 --> 58:39.040
But they say you'll probably get one going in about 55 seconds.

58:39.040 --> 58:41.280
And here's where it's gold.

58:41.280 --> 58:46.000
Pricing plans start at $5, $5.

58:46.000 --> 58:51.440
And you get 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU and a terabyte of transfer connected

58:51.440 --> 58:56.960
to tier one bandwidth DigitalOcean as data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore,

58:56.960 --> 58:58.880
Amsterdam, and a brand new one in London.

58:58.880 --> 59:01.000
They just turned on IPv6 in another data center.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.200
They've got an announcement about that on their website.

59:03.200 --> 59:04.680
Let me tell you about their interface.

59:04.680 --> 59:07.000
It is so simple, so intuitive.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.560
The control panel, if you're watching the video version, I'm pulling it up right here.

59:10.560 --> 59:12.120
It's really what it looks like.

59:12.120 --> 59:16.480
You can use it and it's not just about how fast you can spin up a server.

59:16.480 --> 59:18.960
It's not just about how easy it is to make backups.

59:18.960 --> 59:22.360
It's reducing the friction so that when Rekai comes down to me and says, hey, you know,

59:22.360 --> 59:25.840
there's something I wanted to test, but I'd really like to have a fresh Linux installation

59:25.840 --> 59:26.840
to test it on.

59:26.840 --> 59:28.640
And I'd really like it to be publicly accessible.

59:28.640 --> 59:32.480
It's not no matter, it's no matter like a, well, I guess I could create a VM, open up

59:32.480 --> 59:38.120
a port on the firewall, forward that traffic in, set up DNS, install all the, no.

59:38.120 --> 59:42.120
I went over to DigitalOcean and under a minute, I had a droplet ready to go for him to use

59:42.120 --> 59:44.120
to deploy the software he needs.

59:44.120 --> 59:48.100
It's so easy to scale up my infrastructure just on demand as I need it, and when we're

59:48.100 --> 59:50.480
done with the project, we spin it back down.

59:50.480 --> 59:54.660
You need to add capacity for your backend for a little while, baby got back over DigitalOcean.

59:54.660 --> 59:58.040
Go over there, use our promo code, get the $10 credit.

59:58.040 --> 01:00:01.400
If you just need to scale for a launch for a couple of days, go over to DigitalOcean.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.360
They even have hourly pricing.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.580
Just use that promo code, Unplugged August, and here's the best part.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:09.780
If you forgot to use Unplugged August when you checked out earlier, they'll let you go

01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:11.120
back and apply it again.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.240
That's how awesome DigitalOcean is.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:16.080
DigitalOcean.com and use the promo code, Unplugged August.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:21.200
If nothing else, go play with some own cloud, own cloud and DigitalOcean, two great things

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.200
that go together.

01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:24.120
You know, I was just looking at our subreddit.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.000
We have somebody who spun up a droplet in 20 seconds.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Unbelievable.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
I believe it too.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Unbelievable.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
20 seconds.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Unbelievable.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Was that the London data center?

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
That's got to be the, right?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I don't know.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.200
I've heard the London, I mean, they're all amazing, right?

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.960
They're all amazing, but that London data center is just such a firecracker.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:41.960
It's really awesome.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.960
And I hope he used Unplugged August so he got a $10 credit when he did it too.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:47.200
All right, we got to cover the SUSE interview.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:51.360
So a great group over at SUSE, and of course they had a booth at LinuxCon, and they're

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.080
part of the Linux Foundation, all of that, so they're in tight.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:57.520
So Noah stopped by and had a chance to talk with George and Michael.

01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.360
They talked about SUSEcon, which is coming up.

01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:00.360
They talked about servers.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:03.560
They talked about desktop, and all of it in a great chat.

01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:07.720
We're here continuing coverage of LinuxCon 2014, and we're here with George and Michael

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.960
from the SUSE Project.

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:09.960
How are you both doing today?

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.960
Pretty good.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:11.960
Thank you.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:12.960
Doing great.

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.960
Glad to be here.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.360
So I want to start with you, Michael.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.680
You guys both were kind enough to sit down and speak with us, and I really appreciate

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:23.000
that, particularly at this conference, as I'm finding it very difficult to get people

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.920
to come on camera and talk about their project.

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:28.600
It's good to know that it says something about the openness of the SUSE Project that you

01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:31.800
guys are so willing to come on camera and talk with us, so we appreciate that.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:36.400
Now I understand there are some big changes, some big things happening with the SUSE Project.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.800
Could you tell me a little bit about that?

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.640
Yeah, a couple things.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.460
We're working hard in a couple different areas.

01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:47.320
OpenStack, of course, we're investing quite a bit there, distributed storage.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:53.680
We've got our flagship product, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, coming out later this year.

01:01:53.680 --> 01:02:00.080
We just released our SUSE Cloud OpenStack distribution based on IceHouse just recently.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.440
We have a live kernel patching technology that's going to come out in conjunction with

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:10.040
SLEZ12, and we have a Ceph-based storage product coming out early next year.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:15.240
So we're working in all kinds of different areas to bring technologies that people are

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:20.980
looking for primarily within an enterprise IT environment.

01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:24.920
Now when you say enterprise IT environment, are you looking more at the desktop side or

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:26.260
the server side?

01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:29.800
Primarily the server side, but we have a desktop as well, of course.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:34.840
In fact, one of the other things that I wanted to talk to you about is I understand that

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.520
you have a conference that you do every year.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:45.400
Yeah, we have what we call SUSECON, and that is our conference for customers and partners.

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.560
This year that'll be in Orlando, November 17th through 21.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:52.280
Okay, outstanding.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:57.240
Now Michael, I understand that, am I understanding correctly, that you are on the more technical

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.080
side of the SUSE?

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:02.800
I'm a product marketing manager for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:07.200
Okay, so tell me a little bit about what it is that your position offers and what it is

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.200
that you do.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:16.160
Yes, I am in charge of the messaging and positioning for the new upcoming SLEZ12, and actually

01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:21.160
we are going to release the official release of the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 with

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:27.460
other solutions later this year.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:31.040
One important area we're going to focus is downtime.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:36.240
We are tackling this problem from many levels.

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:43.440
For example, when we talk about downtime, there are different kinds of downtime, planned

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.360
downtime and unplanned downtime.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:50.600
We're tackling both, for example, from the hardware side, we are collaborating with different

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:56.920
hardware partners to fully exploit the RAS reliability, availability, and serviceability

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.020
features in the hardware platform.

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:05.480
You might take a look at the background and the chameleon sitting on top, the big IBM

01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:06.880
System Z machine.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:12.480
Actually we are the most popular Linux distribution in the IBM System Z.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:20.320
We are also including the high availability in the IBM System Z.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:27.480
No matter what platform like Intel, like IBM customer choose, SUSE Linux Enterprise is

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:36.680
their safe choice to build additional level of availability and reliability into the hardware.

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:44.480
Also from the service level, we are offering solutions and features like high availability

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:51.000
and live kernel patching like Michael just mentioned, KGraft, to build up the service

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:58.840
uptime to ensure your service is okay, like you can easily set up a high availability

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:07.040
cluster or even you can set up the geoclustering to connect your two data centers in different

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:12.560
locations so that in case one location goes down, the other location can back up.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:18.220
Also KGraft is a big thing, a big innovation from SUSE which allows you to do the live

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.520
kernel patching.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:26.000
You don't imagine a situation where you run a mission critical workload, you cannot afford

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:33.760
to shut it down, or you run a virtualization host with like 40 or even 50 virtual machines,

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:36.600
you cannot even afford the host to go down.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:41.400
Live kernel patching is a technology for you to do the kernel patching without shutting

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:47.540
down the system, a fantastic technology to boost your service uptime.

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:54.220
Also we offer some other tools and services like we can allow you to do the full snapshot

01:05:54.220 --> 01:06:00.400
and rollback for the full system, including kernel files so that when you do some kernel

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:06.200
patching, lots of complicated interdependence of the kernel patching, you don't have to

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.360
shut down.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:12.440
You can just snapshot and rollback just in case you did anything wrong by operational

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:14.400
mistakes.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:20.060
There are many, many other things coming into the Celestial, like we have features in cloud,

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:26.160
we have features in the management and interoperability and more features anticipated at the state

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:27.160
to do.

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.160
Outstanding.

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:32.940
Well we look forward to hearing more about what SUSE is doing and upcoming things that

01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:33.940
are happening in SUSE.

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:36.680
If people wanted to find more information about SUSE or if there's anything else you

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.980
guys wanted to mention, where would people go to find that?

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:44.400
So you can of course go to SUSE.com and find all kinds of information, but I also wanted

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.080
to mention a couple other things.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:51.760
I want to mention our community, OpenSUSE is our community project that we sponsor and

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.520
mentor, not mentor, but we sponsor and facilitate.

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.720
OpenSUSE is a very independent community.

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:01.360
OpenSUSE is a great community distribution.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:05.880
In fact, I run OpenSUSE as my production OS.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:11.400
So I use OpenSUSE for all the work I do at SUSE all the time and if you're looking for

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:15.880
a Linux community to get involved in and you're looking for a community that's really open

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:21.720
and welcoming and looking for contributors, whether it's coding, whether it's packaging,

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:26.680
whether it's documentation or anything, OpenSUSE is a great community.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:33.120
So check them out, OpenSUSE.org if you're looking for a Linux community to engage with.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.780
Outstanding and I want to thank you and give props to you for using your own dog food so

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:39.780
to speak.

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:43.860
You know, in a conference like this, it's becoming a very rare thing to see somebody

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:47.800
actually running Linux on their computer, which you think would be very prolific at

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:53.040
a Linux convention, but actually no, it turns out that's not the case.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.040
I think that's great.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:57.200
That really says something about how much you guys believe in your own project that

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:01.320
you guys are using essentially the same thing that you're selling.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:02.600
It's a great thing about the job, right?

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.600
I love Linux.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:07.680
I've loved Linux for 15 years I've been a Linux user.

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:12.800
Many of those years I had to be a Linux user at home and I had my secret Linux box under

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:17.880
the desk at the office, but now Linux is what I do and I love it.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:23.360
So I run Linux at home, I run it on the office, I run it on my laptop and I get to immerse

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.160
myself in a great community and a great operating system.

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.160
Outstanding.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.360
Well that's the project to go to then if anyone's looking for something that they can apply

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:37.840
both at home and at work and to be with a project where the people that work for it

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:40.920
really believe in the goals and the future of Linux.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.920
Absolutely.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.560
Thank you all so much for taking time to speak with us, we really appreciate it.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.240
Thank you.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:52.640
So no coincidence I'm guessing, Noah, that the SUSE booth was right next to the IBM booth?

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:53.640
No?

01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:58.440
Sorry, I forgot to turn on my microphone.

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:03.280
So no, I don't know if this came out real clearly in the interview, but yeah, so essentially

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:07.080
SUSE is what's powering that really super cool glowing blue computer.

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:10.560
Hey man, it's got blue lights.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:16.960
And SUSE was extremely proud of the fact that when IBM looked for an enterprise solution,

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.200
they went to SUSE.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:24.120
And IBM is going to be starting doing VPS hosting and stuff like that and for that,

01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.760
that's all getting again on the back end powered by SUSE Enterprise Linux.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.760
And SUSE is, they have the right model going and it's kind of the model I hope to see that

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:38.240
Red Hat follow is they have SUSE for the enterprise that you can pay for and then OpenSUSE, but

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.760
everyone at SUSE is actually using OpenSUSE.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:45.600
Like a little Red Hat CentOS combo there, CentOS on the desktop.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:46.600
Or Fedora.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.920
Or Fedora, I don't know, I feel like Fedora may work, Fedora workstation if that goes

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:50.920
well.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.920
Yeah, exactly.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.560
That's right, because Fedora really isn't what OpenSUSE is in the enterprise world,

01:09:55.560 --> 01:10:00.040
but you know, a couple of things, this is at the conference in general, but it speaks

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:03.760
to again, SUSE's dedication to this.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:07.600
So first off, a huge thank you to the Linux Foundation for having us there, for being

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:08.600
so accommodating.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:13.080
You know, a lot of the things, a lot of the interviews and the streaming was only possible

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.600
because they had to twist some arms to make that happen.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:18.720
So I really appreciate that.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.360
But you know, you walk around, there was one of the guys at the conference that I walked

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:30.440
into and actually that was my favorite interview was the guy from Hastexa, Adolfo.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:33.200
He was actually, he was one of my favorite guys and I can't remember if it was him or

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.920
somebody that overheard the interview and started talking to me afterwards.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.520
But he asked me a question and I didn't have an answer for him then, but I do now.

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:45.960
And his question was, why is it I'm railing on everyone for purchasing MacBooks, but not

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:49.800
all of the people that are running, that are purchasing Windows computer, aren't they both

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:54.400
proprietary hardware with proprietary software coming installed?

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:58.240
And again, I couldn't answer that then, but as I thought about it the rest of the conference,

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:02.580
when HP, Lenovo, Dell, Acer and Gateway, when they're making computers, they're packaging

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:06.440
Windows because they believe that's what's going to help them sell the machines.

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:11.920
And if tomorrow users decide that they want Linux to be that operating systems, those

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.080
manufacturers should be happy to ship with it, but Apple has a vested interest in not

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:19.960
only selling the hardware, but getting people into their software and cloud infrastructure.

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:25.560
And so the, and that's why I, so like you look at OpenSUSE as a perfect example.

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:30.240
They bought ThinkPads, but they're not running Windows on them.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:35.000
And if tomorrow it became, if tomorrow IBM, this partnership grows or whatever, and all

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.760
of a sudden they decide they're going to branch out and Lenovo is going to partner with them,

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:43.000
they're going to, I can see Lenovo shipping SUSE on ThinkPads.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:46.520
I can't see Apple shipping any version of Linux on a MacBook.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.520
Never, never, never.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:48.520
That was my answer to that.

01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.520
Good point.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.520
Good point.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.520
Yeah.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.920
Well, anyway, so, so SUSE and Stexa and, and, and Cloudera were, you know, and obviously

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.200
and of course Red Hat, were the ones that really stood out at the conference because

01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.840
they were shamelessly running Linux on everything I saw.

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.760
I mean, every piece of, of hardware that they had was proudly running Linux.

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.600
So would you say, was your impression of the usage of Linux similar to our takeaway from

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.600
OSCON?

01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:12.600
It's pretty much all MacBooks?

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:13.640
It was, it was better actually.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:20.320
So, so, so aside from, aside from our, aside from our, that one discussion that we had

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:27.480
during the stream, most of the presenters, most of the people that were there, I'd say

01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:32.680
it was probably a 50-50 split between PC, well, hold on, but between PC and Mac and

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:39.400
then of the 50% split of PC, a certain, you know, a sliver of them were running Linux.

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:42.560
But there was a lot more, I didn't see, I don't think I saw a single Windows box at

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.560
OSCON.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:46.720
I saw tons of Windows boxes at LinuxCon.

01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:47.720
Maybe more of the workforce?

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:48.720
Yeah.

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:49.720
Yeah.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:50.720
That's probably it.

01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:52.280
Workforce proximity to Silicon Valley.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:57.240
Well, so what you have is OSCON, you have a lot of, a lot of marketing people, like

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:01.720
for instance Rackspace will only let you talk to Rackspace if you talk to one of their marketing

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:02.720
or PR people.

01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.240
And that's who was manning the booth there.

01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:08.440
Whereas here, it's a lot of the people that are, you know, in the, you know, in the, in

01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.440
the trenches.

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:10.440
So it's the engineers.

01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:14.000
Is that why, is that why you were experiencing resistance about going on camera, do you think?

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.000
Oh yeah.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Huge.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Yeah.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.000
In fact, so yeah, there were tons.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.360
There were, so suffice to say, there are a lot of really cool and encouraging things

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:26.720
happening at big companies that you've heard of that are really, really, really pushing

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.040
to support Linux.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.360
They're just not willing to go on camera and talk about it.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.200
Because they don't want to say something wrong.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.640
I don't know what it is.

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:37.120
The thing is, it's one of those things where, where there, there were, there was a specific

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:41.120
example where I was like, this is a huge vote for Linux.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.240
This is a huge vote, not only for Linux, but the Linux desktop.

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:47.080
And the company would not go on camera and acknowledge that.

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:50.000
And I'm like, I don't understand how that could possibly go wrong.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.880
That's a big name that kind of would carry a lot of weight in the community, right?

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:54.880
Sure.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:55.880
Sure.

01:13:55.880 --> 01:14:00.200
But the thing is that it would single-handedly persuade me to purchase their product, having

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:01.200
that piece of information.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.200
If I were to walk into Best Buy and I was going to buy a computer, I would say the fact

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:09.760
that the company is making this decision is, it's hands down, it tells me that this hardware

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.840
is likely going to work with Linux because they care about Linux and Linux specifically

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:14.960
on the desktop.

01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:18.560
So I was, I was super disappointed and I badgered them to death to get me to talk to me.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.560
But no.

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.280
Perhaps they feel strong armed by Microsoft.

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:24.200
Yeah, that, that could be, yeah, that could be.

01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.960
Red Hat did eventually come on camera and talk about how they're essentially going to

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:34.080
come out with a Linux desktop that's geared for, you know, for the enterprise desktop.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:38.040
So it's not just a server that we're using on a workstation, but it's actually meant

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.880
for people to sit down and work at and get work done on.

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:41.880
And they're going to do that.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:43.760
That's essentially how they're going to position CentOS.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.760
That's exciting.

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.140
Yeah, it was.

01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:50.040
When you go to these things, Noah, does it make you discouraged about desktop Linux?

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.040
Sometimes.

01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.040
Yeah.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:56.960
When I was working on, I was, I was extremely, in fact, the whole flight back I had, I can

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.680
honestly say I lost sleep over it.

01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:03.440
And it's one of those things that I look at the world that's evolving and I'm like, man,

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:08.140
we are, the Microsoft battle was bad because they were so prolific.

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:11.740
But what we had going for us was at the end of the day, we had a better product.

01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:15.940
And what scares me about Mac is I still believe we have a better product than what, than what

01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:17.280
Apple offers.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:21.440
What I don't know is if other people will ever accept that or if anyone cares about

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.840
the advantages that we offer.

01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.840
That's my thing about it.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:24.840
Yeah.

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:26.880
Is I'm not sure about that last part.

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:32.800
And I look at this too, as kind of like one of these things where we go into these events

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:36.520
and it's kind of, it's hard not to come away with a little bit of localization bias.

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:40.740
Like we might go to Ohio Fest and find it a completely different, a different scenario.

01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:44.980
The Linux Fests are drastically different from the conventions and I mean drastically

01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:45.980
different.

01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:49.240
I think if you show, so the email and I asked Q5 to forward it to me and he never did get

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.520
to me, but there's an email that the guy sent out for self and the email said, projectors

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:59.320
will be provided for presentations and we'll have VGA, we'll have VGA cables.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:03.200
HDMI is available, you know, if you tell, let us know ahead of time.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:07.680
If you have a freedom hating laptop that requires a special adapter, you are on your own to

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:11.420
provide that adapter and use it and no troubleshooting will be provided to you.

01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:15.400
And I was, so that's the mentality that you get at, at, at, at Linux Fest.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.520
And I think that's what we're going to see in Ohio.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.520
Yeah.

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.000
And frankly, that's where I have more fun.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Yeah.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Because that's where I fit in better.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.720
Well, here's what you're, here's what we're kind of getting to.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:28.640
This is going to be our last main topic for the day, but it's, I feel like I'm working

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:32.080
on a bigger soapbox that I want to get onto about this, but I'm still trying to put it

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.080
all together.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:36.600
Maybe you guys can help me coagulate it like some dirty old grease.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:41.400
Matt Assay, Matt Assay wrote a piece for Tech Republic saying, Hey, can you please shut

01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.960
up about the Linux desktop?

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:43.960
Just shut up.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:44.960
Stop talking about it.

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:45.960
All right.

01:16:45.960 --> 01:16:50.520
Yeah, I know Linus was at Linux Con and I know Linus said he still wants the desktop,

01:16:50.520 --> 01:16:51.520
but I don't.

01:16:51.520 --> 01:16:54.360
The briefest glance at market share data suggests that I'm not alone either.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.040
While hundreds of millions of people want Linux powering their smartphones and millions

01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:01.600
of businesses are content to let Linux run their servers, virtually no one wants to run

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.280
on their laptops and desktops.

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:08.040
He says Apple's been successful in part because it's reduced the complexity of personal computing,

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:13.060
but even Apple has largely failed to overcome the PC's clunky interaction with human experiences.

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.560
Could Linux do any better?

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:15.560
Probably not.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:20.560
Linux developed historically by and for geeks may be the least likely candidate to improve

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.240
the consumer experience.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.840
I love how he acknowledges how it's all over smartphones and devices like that, but then

01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:26.840
says it can't be done.

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.560
He says, so let's move on just like the rest of the Linux world or let's just, everybody

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.360
move on like the rest of the world.

01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:35.800
No one outside geeky events like Linux Con pines for the desktop anymore.

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:40.000
We should be content that they're pining for something even better, the Android smartphone,

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.200
which makes Linux desktop relevant for the next 20 years, even if it wasn't relevant

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.120
for the last 20.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:50.280
So the 1990s called, they want him back.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:51.280
Yeah.

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:53.480
I mean, God, where do I begin poking holes in this?

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.080
It's like, it's just so full of misinformation.

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:59.720
And also like, hello, did you know there's countries outside the United States like India

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.680
and China that are seeing incredible adoption of Linux right now?

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.680
Yeah.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.360
But that doesn't count because it's not in his living room.

01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:06.360
That's what matters.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.360
Yeah.

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.360
How about Nevada?

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:09.360
Geez.

01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:10.360
Yeah.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:13.480
I find this so, I've been finding more and more of this like, Oh, everybody just give

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.480
up already.

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:15.480
The Mac is one.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:18.280
The windows, windows is, windows is, this is the new narrative.

01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:19.320
Windows is fading.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.200
The Mac is escalating.

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.200
Linux never won.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.440
And I think it's so, when I hear people say this, it sounds so self-centered.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:30.480
It's like there, it's impossible for them to consider that the year of the Linux desktop

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:35.160
is not like this grand year where everything, all of a sudden everything switches.

01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:38.580
It's more like, well, this is the year it was good enough for me to switch over.

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:41.360
That might be 2016 for one person.

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:45.040
It might've been 20 or it might be 2002 for another person.

01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:46.040
Right?

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.040
I mean, who knows, right?

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.080
Year of the Linux desktop is whatever year you switch over.

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:51.080
Yeah.

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.080
Yeah.

01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.080
Go ahead.

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.080
Sorry.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.080
Go ahead.

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.280
I was going to, I was going to say that one of the, you know, one of the other things

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:59.560
that, that one of the things that is truly encouraging, cause I've started, I used to

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:02.880
be, I used to be afraid of asking this because I didn't want to offend people and I didn't

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.680
want to step on toes, but I asked basically everyone I interviewed, I'm like, do you use

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:06.680
Linux on the desktop?

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.000
And if so, why or why not?

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:13.760
And one of the things that was really encouraging is you find a lot of people that are leave,

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:16.120
that leave Mac or Windows to come to Linux.

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:19.600
I haven't talked to a whole lot of people, you know, obviously this is a bad segment

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.600
to bring that up.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:24.160
And after this guy wrote in at the beginning of the show, but there's not a ton of people

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:26.080
that are jumping off of Linux to go to Mac.

01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.480
At least not that I've talked to.

01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:28.480
Not anymore.

01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:31.640
I mean, I think there was a big exodus originally, VR Mac, I want to give you a chance.

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:35.280
You think it comes down to education, right?

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.720
Not only education in the classrooms where they're taught to use windows because it's

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.720
the thing to have.

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:44.400
But because, you know, as we frequently bring up in this show and our other shows, we really

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.320
don't have one big company to really shout out our name.

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:54.040
You know, our best chances, you know, may be canonical, but they don't care about really,

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.880
really mass marketing because their big thing is, you know, phones now.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:00.420
I think this is the other, I think this is the other logical fallacy that we fall into

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:02.600
and why we see gloom and doom.

01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:06.840
Because essentially the line of thought that you just iterated perfectly is this kind

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:11.760
of, this kind of we take the current state of the world and we project it 10 years down

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.720
the road and we say, well, this is never going to work.

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:16.840
But if you would, if you would have gone back five years ago, you wouldn't have seen the

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:17.920
success of Chromebooks.

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:19.360
The idea sounds stupid.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:21.840
The idea of a web browser powered laptop is stupid.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.900
The price is stupid.

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:23.900
The hardware sucks.

01:20:23.900 --> 01:20:25.840
And yet they're incredibly successful.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:29.320
And now after years of iteration, they're going to be respectable devices with actual

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.680
use case scenarios.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:33.040
And now it's a huge growth for Linux.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:34.120
We never would have called that.

01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:36.640
Like there, we have no idea what's coming.

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:40.560
We have no idea who's going to take Linux and package it up and make it presentable.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.240
It doesn't have to be the current form.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:46.280
I hope the current form exists for people like us forever.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:49.800
I want to be able to just run my own cobbled together version of the general technology

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:50.800
platform.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:52.200
That's what I think Linux is.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.200
And I hope that that continues.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.200
I think it always will.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.800
I don't think that'll be the number one desktop.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.040
I don't think that's likely.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:01.480
I don't think that's even maybe necessary, like what we want to happen.

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.800
I think we want a product to do it.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:03.800
I think we want something with support.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.880
Well, even OS X is the number one desktop.

01:21:06.880 --> 01:21:08.800
Oh, you're totally right.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:13.080
I mean, the thing is, it's really just the desktop though.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.280
It's the lack of advertisement, really.

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.280
I'm not saying that.

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:19.280
I'm not by any means trying to predict the future at all.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:23.860
But you can't blame that it's by geeks for geeks.

01:21:23.860 --> 01:21:28.560
Because the reason that it exists in the other environments is because there are people like

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:30.160
us who care about having a better system.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:33.480
If I'm going to build a server, I know that GNU plus Linux is better.

01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:37.020
So of course, I'm going to put maybe Red Hat or whatever on it.

01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:38.960
But for the desktop, it's just not marketed.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.640
Well, and it's impossible to market, really.

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.360
I mean, because it's like, OK, yeah, here's a platform that you can do whatever the hell

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:46.520
you want with it.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:50.800
It can totally adapt to whatever your needs are, almost, except for video editing.

01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:56.160
But you know, I mean, that's simple to come across in terms of capturing a headline or

01:21:56.160 --> 01:21:58.880
some sort of snappy advertising copy.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:03.200
But you know, the best marketing it gets is word of mouth from people like me and you.

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.040
Daredevilin proposes we don't need to market at all.

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.040
Go ahead, Daredevilin.

01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:12.760
Yeah, the reason I say this is because Linux has been successful in so many places, and

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.760
it's just natural progression.

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:20.920
Yes, companies that want to take tackle, like Canonical, they should go and market their

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:22.360
distribution.

01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:27.000
But the consumption of Linux on the desktop doesn't need, in my perspective, market as

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000
it needed.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.880
First of all, people already know how to use basic computing, which was something big in

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:37.840
the past and required a lot of marketing to get attention.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.640
Just that was entry, barrier entry.

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:40.640
Yeah, exactly.

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:46.160
And the other part is, just look, if it works for your government, how hard is it for people

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:47.880
to tackle that it works for them?

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.080
I mean, once they start using these government tools, and the governments are switching because

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:56.280
of the multiple reasons we know, it's just natural progression.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:04.200
And I look at it this way too, like eventually it's going to be so damn good that it would

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:08.240
almost be crazy for somebody not to make it into a product.

01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:12.000
Once system D is no longer a new thing, and it's well integrated and fully functional,

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
and everything that it's going to gobble up is gobbled, it's been nommed, once Wayland

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.240
is ironed out and we have excellent drivers from the vendors, and we don't have these

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.240
nightmare problems anymore, and a lot of our underlying technologies that we use for the

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:27.840
applications like QT and GTK3 have really gotten to this excellent maturity point, which

01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:30.080
they pretty much are now.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:35.280
It would be almost financially and fiscally irresponsible for some company to not come

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:39.160
along and turn that into some sort of amazing product, because there's so much incredible

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:42.840
underlying technology there that's already made for them.

01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.460
It's like having a car that's pre-built that all you have to do is slap paint on and sell

01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:46.460
it for $10,000.

01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:47.460
Exactly.

01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:53.640
I'm very optimistic, because it's a good platform, and one of the reasons I played that crazy

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:58.680
long interview with the Cumulus Network guys is because that just is one more area where

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:01.040
running Linux will become the norm.

01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:05.480
When you have more things like on mobile, and on networking, and on servers, and cloud,

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:10.760
and Chromebooks, and mobile devices, and all of these things, it would almost be crazy

01:24:10.760 --> 01:24:11.800
not to do it.

01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:15.020
Not to have it as the underlying technology for desktops, too, because it'll just be the

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:17.640
underlying general purpose operating system for technology.

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:20.640
Well, it's one of those things where you can literally mold it to be whatever you make

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:21.640
it.

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:22.640
Yep.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.640
It's exciting.

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:24.640
That's the whole thing, though.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.640
Go ahead.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:30.280
Oh, well, that's what I'm saying, though, because it can become whatever it is you want

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.280
to be.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.680
For me, the biggest thing, though, I've been using Linux since Mandrake.

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:38.680
I'm not kidding.

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.800
That was when I had to get my mom to write a check to have 78 CDs sent to me through

01:24:43.800 --> 01:24:44.800
the mail.

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:50.360
When I came back to Linux six or seven years ago, I was like, oh, my God, it's what we

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:51.360
always wanted it to be.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.360
Right, right, right.

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:55.600
I think it'll only get better, and better, and better, and better, and better.

01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:58.920
That is the other thing.

01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:03.000
When I look back at old Linux action shows, and I look at what we were talking about,

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.200
I go, oh, wow, we have really come a long ways.

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:07.200
For reals.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:08.200
For reals.

01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:14.320
I think you hit the nail on the head on Sunday when you said Linux has another 30 or 40 years

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:15.320
into it.

01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:16.320
Mac OS doesn't have that.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:17.320
Windows doesn't have that.

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:20.440
When you think about that, if you think of those, especially in the current iteration,

01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:22.640
being around for that long, I don't know.

01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.640
Yeah.

01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:24.640
That was Greg Crow Hartman that said that, wasn't it?

01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:25.640
Yeah.

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:26.640
He said 30 to 50 years.

01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:27.640
Yeah.

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:28.640
30 to 50 years.

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.640
Yeah.

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:30.640
Interesting.

01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:31.640
There you go.

01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.920
For me, the breakdown comes down to this.

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:37.000
I think everybody loses sight of this, at least everyone I've ever talked to.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.320
First of all, we've got a bunch of engineers trying to market stuff.

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.160
That's half our problem right there.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:45.160
On top of it, it comes down to availability and support.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.760
Google's the closest thing thus far to have really nailed that, is that they've got the

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:52.520
support and they've got the whole availability thing down because you can go to Amazon and

01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.240
you can buy these things.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:59.520
Until that happens, it's going to continue to be the AM way of operating systems.

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.520
It really will be.

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.520
That's sad, but it's true.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:03.720
Well, I think it's a current stage of it.

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:08.980
I think it's Google demonstrating that there is a market applicability here that other

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:11.240
companies will eventually start to rip off.

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.240
That would be awesome.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:14.480
When they do that, they're going to want to differentiate from the Chromebook and they'll

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:17.120
probably differentiate by adding more features and more capabilities.

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.120
Exactly.

01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:19.120
That's the thing about freedom.

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:22.800
Once you get a taste, it's very difficult to go back.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:28.000
All we really need is for a company like HP to take a bunch of their money and a bunch

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:32.840
of their time and a bunch of their resources and throw it at these $200 Windows netbooks

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.240
that aren't going to do very well, and then they'll bail on that and say, you know what?

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.120
Let's try the same approach, but let's try a more functional Linux environment.

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:42.920
Maybe let's work with the Mozilla Foundation and have Firefox launch full screen or something.

01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:46.800
We'll have our own version of it, and it'll be like this full Linux operating system because

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:49.640
maybe they want to have a little more enterprise capability.

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:53.560
It sounds crazy at first, but it only takes a couple of things to fall into place and

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:54.880
all of a sudden HP's doing that.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:57.040
To Noah's point earlier.

01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:01.440
And imagine what happens when Red Hat comes out and says, okay, now we've perfected it.

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.420
Now we have a desktop that's more stable than Windows.

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:08.040
It runs a browser, which is basically more and more businesses are moving towards web-based

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.200
software every day.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:14.640
And now HP comes out and says, okay, we'll ship that for $200, and now you have the makings

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:17.120
and a company sits down at the budget and they go, well, we could buy this computer

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:18.120
with Windows 7.

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:21.680
It'll be outdated in two years or three years or whatever.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:26.480
We buy this computer from HP and essentially all it really needs to run is a web browser

01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:30.800
and it's immune from viruses, immune from spyware and malware, and hopefully Matt doesn't

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.280
bite my head off for saying that.

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.840
I actually have a personal anecdote about something like that.

01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:41.200
I worked for a company where I did basically all of my work, actually I worked for a couple

01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.880
companies like this, all of my work inside a web browser.

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:47.480
I did all of my work inside a web browser and we got a virus once.

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:52.120
And we were using Windows 7, we got a virus, and I'm like, this whole thing could have

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.020
been prevented if we were just running Linux.

01:27:55.020 --> 01:27:56.280
Don't even need anything else.

01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:57.280
Exactly.

01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.740
And not only that, but it would run faster, we wouldn't have to worry about our server

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:05.000
crashing as often, because that happened quite a bit.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.280
It was a nightmare as far as the implementation went, but our IT costs were skyrocketed because

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:17.320
of not only licenses, but because the support people just were flaking off doing their

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.320
own thing sometimes.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.320
Yeah, yeah.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:22.000
And then you end up with a revolving door of IT support, which also adds to the problem.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:23.000
It was awful.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.640
We had somebody there at least once a day for two weeks.

01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:26.640
I'm not kidding.

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:28.840
Alright, so that's probably where we'll wrap it up.

01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:32.020
We'll do the retrospective in the post show, so if you're on the live stream, stick around.

01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:35.120
We'll look back at Linux from a few years back, but we should probably run, that'll

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:38.160
bring us to the end of today's show, because there's a lot of show, a lot of interviews,

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:39.840
a lot of stuff to cover.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:43.880
We've got a really special guest lined up for Sunday if all works out, and if not, I've

01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.840
got a great segment planned as a backup.

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.240
So either way, we're going to have a rocking show on Sunday, Matt, alright?

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.360
So have a great rest of your week.

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:50.360
I'll see you on Sunday.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:51.360
See you then.

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.560
Alright, and Eric, thanks for joining us in studio today, buddy.

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:54.560
Well, thank you.

01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:55.560
I'm glad to be here.

01:28:55.560 --> 01:29:00.960
It was fun, and it's good to throw things back and forth, and huge, huge, huge thank

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.920
you to Noah for all of his hard work out at LinuxCon.

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:07.880
I know he had to double down and hustle like a mo, and so I really appreciate him going

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.080
out there and putting everything on hold and all of that.

01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:11.080
No, you did an awesome job.

01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:12.080
It was great coverage.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.080
Alright, everyone.

01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:14.080
Amazing job.

01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.080
Thank you so much for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged.

01:29:15.080 --> 01:29:18.000
If we don't see you on Tuesday, maybe we'll catch you for last on Sunday.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:33.440
Goodbye, everybody.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:52.080
See you on Sunday.

01:29:52.080 --> 01:30:10.560
So like 10 years ago, before I ran Ubuntu, I used Debian on my Pentium 500 MHz Dell laptop,

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:15.160
and I went out to Palo Alto to do some work in an office, and I'd never worked in America

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.160
before.

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:23.880
I sat in a little cubicle on my own, and this guy came over, the office guy, and said, look,

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:29.240
before you can plug your laptop into the network, I need you to tell me what antivirus software

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.240
you use on your laptop.

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:31.240
Yep, I've had that, too.

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:39.760
And I said, well, I run Linux, and he went, oh, fine, and he could get an APS, and that

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:40.760
was great.

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:44.320
That was a great experience, but then everyone in the cubicles around me ran Windows, and

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.600
that happened to be the week.

01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:51.480
I think it was something like Slammer or some Windows virus was doing the rounds, and everyone

01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:53.880
around me, their PC had been completely taken out.

01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:56.560
I was able to carry on working.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:57.880
Everyone around me was wiped out.

01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:01.820
They all went to play golf, so there are downsides to this as well.

01:31:01.820 --> 01:31:02.820
That's true.

01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:06.520
I had to sit there and carry on working while everyone else just pissed off and had fun.

01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:12.440
So there was a bug in Windows 2000, before even any of the major service packs had come

01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:18.960
out in IIS, where if you had a certain type of query to an IIS server, it would crash

01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:23.640
the IIS process, and then it would get into this loop where it would start to restart,

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:28.000
eat up all the CPU, and essentially the box would stop file sharing, stop print sharing,

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.360
and all this kind of stuff.

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:33.120
And it took the network guy a little while, because that was his box, and I had set up

01:31:33.120 --> 01:31:34.440
a Samba server.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.440
And so guess what?

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:37.960
They decided, move everything over to the Samba server.

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:38.960
That's Chris's job.

01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:39.960
So Windows box.

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:41.600
So then Chris had all the work to do.

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:44.920
I had to do a big migration overnight, because the Linux box was working, and I was like,

01:31:44.920 --> 01:32:11.920
no, go figure.
