00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged Episode 43 for June 3rd, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,160
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that has that fresh, minty flavor.

3
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,480
My name is Chris.

4
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,480
My name is Matt.

5
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Hey, Matt.

6
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
So we're going to talk about Linux Mint 17 today.

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,000
It was a release that came out over the weekend, and it's an interesting release because this

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,320
one is the version that will be supported until 2016.

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,000
And technically it will continue to get updates until 2019.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Wow.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,360
So that's a huge, like, they're going to base and continue to push, like, all new versions

13
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,720
of Linux Mint until 2016 off this platform.

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,600
This is maybe the biggest release they've ever had.

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
I don't know.

16
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
I don't know if that's maybe overstated.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,800
It might not be, actually.

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,800
It feels that way.

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,800
I think that's a safe bet.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,800
Yeah.

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
And so I've had it running here.

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,800
I've also been trying out Cinnamon on some of my Arch boxes, and the Mumble Room's got

23
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,880
it installed, so we'll talk with those guys about it.

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:28,400
And then also, if we have time after that, and I think we probably will, Matt wrote up

25
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,160
an article on DataMation about, you know, essentially asking, are Ubuntu derivatives

26
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,500
possibly a bad thing?

27
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,240
And Aaron Saigo on Google Plus today asked the question, what has Mint accomplished in,

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,240
you know, in terms of furthering desktop adoption and things like that?

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,400
And the two questions are kind of being raised at the same time.

30
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,960
Both are valid points, and I think we'll have a conversation on that.

31
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,080
And then last but not least, developers have been complaining about something that I hold

32
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,000
dearly on the desktop, and that's OpenGL.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,200
And I feel like this is one of those cases where sometimes developers just complain and

34
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,640
complain and complain, and they jump on a bandwagon where they're not fully informed

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,680
on a topic, and then it just turns into a giant circle jerk.

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,680
And right now, OpenGL's in the crosshairs of apparently every developer out there.

37
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,920
So if we have time, we'll get to that towards the end of the show.

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,320
But Matt, I want to start with some feedback.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,120
We got something kind of neat going on.

40
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,720
This is more of an FYI heads up for folks in the Jupyter broadcasting community.

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,680
If you're going to Southeast Linux Fest, we have a thread in the Linux Action Show subreddit

42
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,720
where we'd like you to check in.

43
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,480
Our crew is going to be down there, Q5 Sis and Noah and some others.

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,400
I don't know who all is going, officially, I think Blaster might be going too and a few

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
others.

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
Nice.

47
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,760
And they'll be taking interviews and getting clips for Jupyter broadcasting shows at Southeast

48
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
Linux Fest.

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,240
So if you're going to go and want to meet up with the guys and say hi, go over to the

50
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:57,360
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com subreddit and check in in the Southeast Linux Fest 2014 sign-in

51
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
sheet.

52
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,360
That way they can kind of coordinate.

53
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,000
That's how they're kind of getting everything put together.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So that should be fun.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I kind of wish I was going.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,680
We won't be making it to that one ourselves.

57
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,040
Matt and I, we had a good time at Linux Fest, but we can only go to so many in a year.

58
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
So true.

59
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,040
So true.

60
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Okay, Matt.

61
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,680
So speaking of Linux Fest, Jared writes in about Texas Linux Fest.

62
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,680
He says, hey, Chris and Matt.

63
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,800
I'll soon be attending my first Linux Fest right here in Austin.

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,680
After watching your coverage up north, I decided to look for one near me.

65
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,680
I'm new to the Linux fun and I want to have the most enjoyable time possible while I go.

66
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,240
My brother and father will be along for the ride as I've come from a long line of thinkers.

67
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,660
Please check out the link if you have some time and let me know of any recommendations

68
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,660
on talks.

69
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,760
Additionally, I just started watching a few months ago and I'm hooked on the Jupyter

70
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,720
broadcasting program.

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,920
This network is a real treat.

72
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Thank you.

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,400
And he said he's got his four-year-old daughter on Edubuntu for her first machine and it totally

74
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
rocks.

75
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,240
So let's go take a look over at texaslinuxfest.org.

76
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,240
And they have it in slash content slash event dash schedule.

77
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,120
And I'm looking at this right now.

78
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,520
This looks like a pretty good lineup.

79
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,080
They've got Wellware and Red Hat and Golden Frog and HP and Linux Foundation as sponsors.

80
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
Yeah.

81
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,640
I don't know, man.

82
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,560
The graphical ZFS tools would be one for my interest.

83
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,440
And also Linux shaping the future of network file systems would also be one that I would

84
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
find to be pretty interesting.

85
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,480
This looks like a pretty solid lineup.

86
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,720
OpenStack for beginners might be good if you've heard a lot about OpenStack but you

87
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,020
don't know where it is, what it is.

88
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,360
This is one of the things that fests are great for is you can go in and sit in on talk that

89
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,080
you might not have originally gone to but since you're there and it's got a good time

90
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,860
and you can always get up and leave.

91
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,760
But I have done that a few times where I'm like I think I might be kind of interested

92
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,600
in this but I'm not sure and I'll go sit in and it's always been a good experience.

93
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,200
So go through that list and check it out.

94
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:50,040
And if you're going to be at Texas Linux Fest, say hi to Jared, a fellow Linux Unplugged

95
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,040
listener.

96
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,160
We got a few people that wrote in about Manjaro again, defending it.

97
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,760
We talked about Manjaro last week and a little bit the week before.

98
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,760
And I got to say, hats off to pretty much everybody who wrote in some really well-stated,

99
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,320
well-reasoned emails defending Manjaro and why it works for them.

100
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,320
Sam wrote in one of them.

101
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,960
It's a bit long but I'll go through some of these.

102
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,200
Hey, Chris and Matt, just a quick response to the conversation about Manjaro in Unplugged

103
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,480
42.

104
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,960
I use and enjoy Manjaro on all of my laptops and I've installed it for new Linux users.

105
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,680
I think that the benefits of Manjaro's delayed release scheme have recently been proven with

106
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,040
the release of Cinnamon 2.2.

107
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:32,000
And see, the reason why I wanted to read this one is because Sam, I specifically called

108
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,940
out can anybody tell me a use case where these delayed packages have actually saved anybody

109
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,940
any trouble.

110
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,320
He says, both Arch and Manjaro update their versions of the UPower package to a new version

111
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,200
that changed its API from the typical OSS fashion.

112
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,440
A consequence of that is a lot of Cinnamon's features relating to power management stopped

113
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,440
working.

114
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,480
It was an easy fix for Arch packagers and it took a long time to get Cinnamon 2.2 in

115
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
a usable place.

116
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,840
Oh, I'm sorry, it wasn't an easy fix.

117
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,240
During almost a month, Cinnamon 2.2 under Arch was in a really rough shape.

118
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,760
Manjaro, on the other hand, pushed Cinnamon 2.2 and the new UPower package into its unstable

119
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,640
branch and later to its testing repos, where testers did find lots of issues and even worked

120
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,760
with Arch packagers who were quite helpful at fixing them.

121
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:14,680
But Manjaro users on the stable branch never had to suffer through that.

122
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,760
Even more significantly, at the time, there was no problem with NDM, the default Manjaro

123
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,920
display manager.

124
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,000
That made it completely, there was a problem that made it completely stop working again.

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,540
Manjaro and stable branch users saw the bugs and stable users of Manjaro were never affected.

126
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,360
As major security patches, Manjaro occasionally releases out of band off package updates if

127
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,040
security issue is big enough to warrant it.

128
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,760
So please be kind to Manjaro.

129
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,240
It's providing a great service to its users.

130
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,240
What a great response, Sam.

131
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
What do you think about that?

132
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,880
Yeah, I think that really nails it because, I mean, you know, most of my computers are

133
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,120
actually, you know, are Arch based.

134
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,360
I mean, they're based, essentially it's just Arch.

135
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,880
However, the machine I call you each week when we do Linux unplugged is a Manjaro machine

136
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,680
because quite honestly, I don't want to roll the dice with Skype every week.

137
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,320
I don't need to, you know, or not just Skype, but any of the backend stuff as well.

138
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,160
I don't need to have an audio library update and potentially have a bug that I didn't catch

139
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,240
when I was combing through various, you know, files and updates and whatnot.

140
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,440
So you know, I like to keep one machine very, very segmented, you know, to where it's like

141
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,160
group updates, nice and clean.

142
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,960
And then everything else I just let roll on Arch.

143
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,960
It's great.

144
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,880
Yeah, very, very well said.

145
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,720
Now speaking of bugs, I know we are actually currently suffering from a little bug in Arch

146
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
that's affecting some of us.

147
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,280
Willie, did you have an update about that X cursor bug?

148
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,280
Yeah.

149
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:38,320
No, right now I'm not actually logged into my Arch box.

150
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,960
I just rolled it back for the mint thing.

151
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,600
But this is a perfect example of where they have the opportunity to fix something that

152
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,560
affects the rest of Arch.

153
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,040
So Matt, you kind of were playing on the pre-show.

154
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,640
You were discovering, we were talking, hey, I just did updates on Arch, Chrome isn't launching

155
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,840
for me, VLC isn't launching for me.

156
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,360
You saw a suggestion in the chatroom about a certain package and you rolled back what

157
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,640
and it did solve the problem?

158
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,400
Yeah, I actually rolled back a libx cursor from dash two to dash one, rather than reading

159
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,080
off the entire version number.

160
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,440
And surprisingly, instantly, no reboot needed.

161
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Everything worked.

162
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Everything was fine.

163
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,720
And so being able to do so, of course, any Arch based distro makes rolling back really

164
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
easy.

165
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,800
But I'm pretty sure this probably won't happen on Monjaro.

166
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Right.

167
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
And this is a good example.

168
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,560
So if you're on Arch today and you're having problems with your Chromium launching or your

169
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:34,120
VLC crashing on you or SMP, whatever, whatever is crashing on you, SMPlayer has done it to

170
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,760
faint in our mumble room.

171
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,440
I haven't, I've had, I actually had Nautilus lock, I'm sorry, files lock up, I don't know

172
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
if it was related.

173
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
So yeah.

174
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,440
It might be.

175
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
It might be.

176
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,200
It was like, it was making everything difficult to use there for a few minutes.

177
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
I was pretty frustrated.

178
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:55,080
Hey Matt, before we jump into the Mint 17 discussion, actually, well, no, we'll start

179
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,320
with Mint 17 before we get to the derivative things.

180
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,640
I want to mention today, episode two of Tech Talk today was out.

181
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,080
I announced it last week on Linux Unplugged.

182
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,680
Second episode's out today.

183
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,560
And I took a few shots at Apple for essentially blatantly ripping off Gnome and Gnome client

184
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
side direct.

185
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,360
I don't know if you've seen the new OS 10 theme, Matt, but it looked exactly like my

186
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Gnome box.

187
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,800
I purposely avoid as much news as possible, but that did leak into my gates and I laughed

188
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,840
and made some comments on it for sure.

189
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,800
I mean, Safari looks identical to Gnome Web.

190
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,520
It's just a little uglier, but it's almost identical.

191
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:34,200
It's got those Mac OS 10 color buttons that I'm not a big fan of.

192
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,480
And other than that, it looks like Gnome Web.

193
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,200
And Xcode looks like a Gnome app and the Maps app looks like a Gnome app.

194
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,640
So I went off on it on episode two of Tech Talk today, which by the way, Tech Talk today

195
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
is on the air.

196
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,400
So check it out over at JupiterPodcasting.com.

197
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:52,140
Okay, well before we get into Mint, I want to thank our first sponsor this week and that

198
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,140
is Ting.

199
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:59,120
It's linux.ting.com, linux.ting.com will take $25 off your first device.

200
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,440
If you already got a device that works on the Ting network, check out their BYOD page

201
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,840
because they're going to give you a $25 credit and if you're like me, that'll pay for your

202
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,280
first month of service, linux.ting.com.

203
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,860
Now why Ting?

204
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,320
Because it's mobile, that makes sense.

205
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,760
No contract, no early termination fee.

206
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,520
Let that sink in for a second.

207
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,920
And you only pay for what you use.

208
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,240
It's a flat $6 plus whatever taxes are applicable.

209
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,000
And then your usage, your messages, your minutes, and your megabytes.

210
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,040
Ting just adds them up at the end of the month and whatever bucket you fall into, baller,

211
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
that's what you pay.

212
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,400
You're not paying into like a $120 contract that maybe this month you got $40 worth of

213
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,760
your minutes and maybe $50 of megabytes.

214
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,440
I don't even, how does that even break down?

215
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,280
How do they even decide what to charge you for that?

216
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,600
Whereas Ting is just flat rate and it's all listed out right on their website.

217
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:47,160
And they have so many great devices now, so many great devices.

218
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:54,000
But if you go to linux.ting.com, go check out the Nexus 5, $350 shipped from Ting.

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,640
This is such a great Android phone.

220
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,000
This is the Android phone where if you're like somebody, either you want the fanciest,

221
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,200
one of the fanciest phones out there right now, this is still a great phone.

222
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,240
But I actually think if you bought this phone, this would be a phone that would last you

223
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,840
for several years.

224
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,020
And I was talking with Fate earlier today and we were talking like one of the reasons

225
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,640
I bought it and one of the reasons he's going to be buying the Nexus 5 is this is also the

226
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,320
phone that all of our favorite alternative mobile operating systems are starting to target.

227
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,360
There's essentially, if you've heard of that operating system, there's either an image

228
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,640
or about to be an image for the Nexus 5.

229
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:32,640
And why not pair that with a great network who respects you as a customer, linux.ting.com,

230
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
go check them out.

231
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,040
They've got no hold customer service, an incredible dashboard to manage your account.

232
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,280
And when you only pay for what you use, the value is incredible.

233
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,040
You might pay a little more upfront for that Nexus 5, although I don't think so.

234
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,520
I mean, that's just what Nexus 5s go for, but you get the example.

235
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,240
You might pay a little bit more upfront for a phone, but because you're not subsidizing

236
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,280
that cost over two years, it's such a great value.

237
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,080
And Rotten Corpse in our mumble room would save almost $4,000 by switching his two lines

238
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
over.

239
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:04,000
So as you add more lines, because again, so if you say you got the nephew on the Ting

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,960
plan over there, well, that's just $6 a month.

241
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
That's all it's going to cost.

242
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,360
And then whatever he uses, and if he's mostly a texter, that's going to be dirt cheap for

243
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
you.

244
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Or if he's on Wi-Fi a lot.

245
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,920
If he's using the Wi-Fi a lot, absolutely.

246
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,240
And a great part of it is that if he gets twitchy and needs to be schooled, hey, you

247
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
know what?

248
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
I can go to the control panel.

249
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
That's right.

250
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
I can pull things down a little bit.

251
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
You got the dashboard hammer.

252
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
That's right.

253
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
Linux.ting.com.

254
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,040
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

255
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,800
I love my Ting phone.

256
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
All right.

257
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,560
So I've got Mint 17 installed here.

258
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,840
I went the Cinnamon route, and I got to say, I think Cinnamon's looking really good.

259
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,400
The new Cinnamon's pretty awesome.

260
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,040
I'll run down a couple of new features, and then we'll talk about it.

261
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,320
So starting with Linux Mint 17, we mentioned this on the Linux Action Show, big updates

262
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
to the Update Manager.

263
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,560
It still holds kernel updates back.

264
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,360
I'll get to that in a little bit.

265
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
But it makes it really clear if you're a little twitchy about what you're updating, Mint's

266
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,960
kind of there to hold your hand.

267
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,000
So that's good.

268
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,180
The other thing that I thought was pretty nice is they've really taken MDM, which the

269
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,800
rest of the community has just kind of abandoned, and they've made it a really nice display

270
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
manager.

271
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,360
System monitor support, animated backgrounds using HTML, high DPI support, all have been

272
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,440
added to MDM, lots of language support, the new welcome screen, which we talked about

273
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
in the last.

274
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,400
They've really kind of made the system settings more refined.

275
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,880
The graphical interface for system settings was refined, and settings now look more consistent.

276
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,880
Settings are better categorized and separated into subsections, which make a lot of sense.

277
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,240
I was able to flow through it really easy.

278
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,880
I also have worked on Cinnamon's snapping functionality, which Cinnamon right now has

279
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,360
one of the best snapping systems out of any desktop environment.

280
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,640
Now they admit that they are a bit challenging, so they cleaned up the hot corners UI, which

281
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,760
I have used a little bit, and I think it's really well done.

282
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,720
So again, another where Cinnamon has taken a power user feature, wrapped a pretty good

283
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,840
UI in it, and not made it overly complicated for basic users.

284
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,180
The hot corner module is also less confusing now, and it's more easier to find than before.

285
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,120
That allowed them to disable top left hot corners by default, which had screwed a lot

286
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
of people up.

287
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,920
So you can go in there and just turn it right on.

288
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,840
And last but not least, you can now shade windows just by scrolling them with your scroll

289
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,680
wheel on the title bar, which is always important.

290
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,200
And they have better integration with GNOME, so if you have GNOME on the same system, your

291
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,920
system settings won't be bumping heads and conflicting with each other like they had

292
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
in the past.

293
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:28,760
Linux Mint 17, in summary, features Cinnamon 2.2, MDM 1.6, Linux Kernel 3.13, and it's

294
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,880
all based on Ubuntu 14.04.

295
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,000
Linux Mint 17 will receive security updates until 2019.

296
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,280
Until 2016, future version of Linux Mint will be based on the same package base as 17 is.

297
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,280
So that's a huge one, in my opinion.

298
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:47,120
And until 2016, the development team won't start working on a new base, and will be fully

299
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,000
focused on this as the base.

300
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,520
I don't know of any other Linux distribution that really does it quite like this at this

301
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,520
point.

302
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,380
Matt, why don't we start there?

303
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,260
What do you think of them saying, you know, we're going to be releasing future versions,

304
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:05,520
but all of the main base packages are essentially going to stay relatively the same.

305
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,160
Is that a good idea?

306
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,280
I think for what they're trying to do and who they're trying to go after, yes, but with

307
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,180
an asterisk.

308
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,320
The asterisk I would put on that is for people that are going straight across from like,

309
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,480
say, you know, the more bleeding edge Ubuntu, specifically to where it's not an LTS release,

310
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,060
they may not find it so awesome.

311
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:28,440
But I think for casual users that are used to upgrading their Windows install, you know,

312
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,680
every 10 years or whatever it is, I think it's fine.

313
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,960
I think it's an interesting approach.

314
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,240
And if nothing else, even if you're not a fan of it, you got to admit that it does differentiate

315
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,820
them from other alternatives.

316
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:44,200
So PCWiz, you consider yourself a power user, but you also like this static base, don't

317
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
you?

318
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,080
I like not having to worry about my system.

319
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,160
I like code.

320
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,000
I like my system to stay the same.

321
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,480
I don't want to have to worry about updating my system or wake up one day and VLC won't

322
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
start or whatever.

323
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
Bromium.

324
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Bromium.

325
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Yeah.

326
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,720
It just needs to work for me.

327
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,760
Okay, Rod and Corpse, tell me, it's all about the implementation.

328
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,240
What do you mean?

329
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,720
Well, there's two potentially massive problems with Mint sticking to an LTS.

330
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,780
The first is the package management.

331
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:18,240
They said they're going to stick to one package base, but are they going to update like the

332
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,720
actual applications or is it just the core structure that's being stuck?

333
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Like how are they...

334
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
They've never addressed that.

335
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,680
Yeah, and like when 14.0.1 or 14.0.1 and 0.2.3 and et cetera, et cetera come out, will they

336
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,680
match that?

337
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,320
Will they follow that or will they stay at 14.0?

338
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,360
They'd more than likely match that in the sense of like the kernel and the structure,

339
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,080
but 14.0.4 Ubuntu doesn't update applications either.

340
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,080
So that's the problem.

341
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,400
They'd have to do it themselves and they haven't mentioned whether they're going to do that

342
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
or not.

343
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,040
Well, I assume they're going to do user land applications like Firefox and Chrome and VLC,

344
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
right?

345
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,520
Yeah, well, I mean the massive packages that Ubuntu does, then they'll bring those in,

346
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:04,040
but like packages that are just open source apps like MyApp or HTOP or TMUX or something

347
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
like that.

348
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,040
That's not...

349
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,040
That's widely used, but not super popular.

350
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:16,520
So if they have a system that would compensate for that, that'd be great, but they haven't

351
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,400
mentioned whether they do or not.

352
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,640
And the other bigger problem is potentially, you know, Cinnamon is built and they release

353
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,320
it two months before Mint ever comes out because the Arch users are going to beat on it and

354
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,640
make sure that it's good.

355
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,640
And then they kind of get like a, I don't know, not a sneaky, but an easier way to test

356
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,760
their stuff.

357
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,000
The problem with it is that the core system of any LTS is going to stay on one version

358
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,920
of GTK and maybe update a little bit, but not a massive version.

359
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,400
And this is 3.10, right?

360
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Right.

361
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Because if Cinnamon is stuck on a particular GTK base, then the next time it's updated,

362
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,040
it might break in Arch and stuff like that because Arch will always be up to date in

363
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,040
GTK.

364
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Well, and it's not just Arch.

365
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Eventually it will be Fedora.

366
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,800
It'll be all the other distributions too.

367
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
True.

368
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,800
Right.

369
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Everybody.

370
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Yes.

371
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
How will that...

372
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Wimpy, do you have any insights on that?

373
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
A little.

374
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:15,240
I spoke to Clem about all of this some months ago when he first sort of fielded the idea,

375
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,440
but specifically around GTK.

376
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:25,720
For example, today I've just built and installed Unity on Arch to do some benchmarking and

377
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:34,040
that's using GTK 3.12 and I'm not sure what version Unity or rather the Ubuntu desktop

378
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,720
is targeting at the moment, but I think it's either 3.10 or 3.8.

379
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,600
But surprisingly 3.12 with a few patches works really well.

380
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Looks a bit odd in places like other desktops that are moving to the common versions of

381
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:55,520
GTK 3, but it's not awful and I think one of the reasons why Clem is choosing to put

382
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,960
a line in the sand here is so that he can just target a stable base so that all of those

383
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:09,000
little features you've just mentioned that are nice evolutions and improvements are what

384
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,080
the Mint team can focus on rather than having to deal with regressions.

385
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,920
Now Heaven's Revenge points out this is already becoming a problem with elementary OS.

386
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,480
Can you elaborate?

387
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,760
Well, only by third-party instances.

388
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,300
Most people or most articles always complain that elementary OS's base is an LTS release

389
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,880
and it diverges from the cutting edge or the leading Ubuntu release.

390
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,360
1204 at that.

391
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
1204.

392
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,600
And there's a lot of incompatibilities in why Pantheon won't work on almost anything

393
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,960
else because it's based on the LTS release of so long ago.

394
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,480
Yeah, I mean and a lot could change.

395
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,920
We see within a few years the entire technological landscape can change and especially in the

396
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,440
open source world where things like GTK get updated and a lot of you know quote-unquote

397
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,960
breaking changes happen all the time.

398
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:14,440
Is it really a good idea to have say a Linux Mint would be based on GTK 3.10 and someone

399
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:22,360
decides to do some GTK application development on Linux Mint 17 and then they want to deploy

400
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,800
it to say Ubuntu 14.10 at that point or 15.04 or whatever.

401
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,520
There's going to be substantial breakages between those GTK versions.

402
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:39,920
I mean there would be a problem with just using Ubuntu first place with the Unity compatibility

403
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,680
with Cinnamon because they use different versions of GTK.

404
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,120
The thing about elementary though is that they have only been around for two years so

405
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,760
they've only technically released one time.

406
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,240
Mint's not doing what elementary does.

407
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,500
They release once every two years every LTS whereas Mint plans to use an LTS base to release

408
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,800
consistently.

409
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,400
So if they consistently update the necessary packages there shouldn't be a problem.

410
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,840
Wimpy do you think we're worrying about nothing when it comes to GTK changes?

411
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:15,040
Well yeah I think the whole point of what Mint is setting out to do here is to pick

412
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:21,160
an LTS release which has a GTK version and they will target that GTK version for the

413
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:26,460
next four years so they don't care about the GTK changes that are happening.

414
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,480
When I discussed this with Clem he did make the point that yes you know the Arch users

415
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:38,720
and the Cinnamon package maintainers for Arch may well find regressions and issues and the

416
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,840
Mint team will address those as it's brought to their attention as they have done for some

417
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,600
time now but it isn't their primary focus.

418
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,920
Their primary focus is going to be revving the Cinnamon desktop environment and bringing

419
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:56,560
new features and improvements to what is a stable underlying platform.

420
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Well and I could see if there's a transition taking place between traditional Unity desktop

421
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,080
and the new Unity 8 desktop and maybe that's not whatever.

422
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,520
Maybe some people won't like some of the new apps or whatever it is and Mint could come

423
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,920
along and say look we've been here for years we're super rock solid and we've just been

424
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,040
polishing and polishing and polishing the Cinnamon desktop.

425
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,360
I mean they could be in a really really good position and plus like the chat room is pointing

426
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,480
out it's not like Clem can't re-evaluate plans if things don't go swimmingly two years down

427
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
the road.

428
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,600
He can look at his outline and go well you know what maybe it's time to re-evaluate or

429
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,040
maybe the Linux Mint Debian edition because that continues on.

430
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,040
Maybe that gets to a point where that's particularly interesting.

431
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,500
Riley I wanted to let you get your point in about Mir.

432
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,640
How do you think that plays in?

433
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,680
Yes because a lot of people a while back were worried about what's going to happen when

434
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:50,560
14.10 and 15.04 goes Mir.

435
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,320
So like what is like all the other issues based off of what you are going to do.

436
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,960
Maybe that's what Clem's thinking is like you know what I'm going to do?

437
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,120
I'm going to sit down for a couple of years.

438
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,800
A lot of people thought they would just stick like they shouldn't stick with Debian and

439
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:10,160
do that way and it's focused on that but this keeps the user base.

440
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,580
So there's just two downsides that I see that I think are primarily worrying.

441
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,180
Number one I still believe the number one users of the Linux desktop are of a technical

442
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,000
variety so package currentness is important to what I believe to be the vast majority

443
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,080
of actual people who use Linux on the desktop.

444
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,080
There's probably lots of people there's probably a great percentage of people who drone-lessly

445
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,320
use their machine and don't even realize what operating system it's running.

446
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,960
But people who are actively engaged and want the latest and greatest I believe represent

447
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,780
the majority of the Linux desktop.

448
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,320
So I don't know if Mint's going to be appealing to those people but there is always that the

449
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,060
people who don't care there there's always people from that really technical crowd who

450
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,520
move themselves into that group as life gets busy or for whatever reason so there you can

451
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:54,960
still you can still satisfy that niche and that user base is always growing as new users

452
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,960
come in.

453
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
So I'm not saying it's a failed strategy but I'm just saying it probably won't appeal

454
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,080
to overly advanced Linux users.

455
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,680
The other thing I'm worried about is it seems like the long-term success of Cinnamon would

456
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,480
be dependent on the adoption of Cinnamon in other Linux distributions.

457
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:13,000
Now maybe that's crazy to me but it seems like if you don't have a relevant desktop

458
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,760
that at least has a large enough user size application developers will never be compelled

459
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,920
to make their applications integrate with your desktop where if you can have like KDE,

460
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:26,800
Gnome and Unity and these guys are managing to suck out most of the air in the room that's

461
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,200
what's going to have a developer's customization attention and they have limited time so they're

462
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,480
only going to spend their time on the desktops that will really net them the most rewards

463
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,560
and I don't see how Cinnamon can achieve that status unless Cinnamon works on lots of distributions.

464
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Am I wrong?

465
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,640
Well I mean Cinnamon technically has a the extension based system for Gnome so most of

466
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,960
the stuff that's in the Gnome extensions could be pretty much easily ported to Cinnamon like

467
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,480
there's been it there's already been about 40 that been ported and they work perfectly

468
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
fine.

469
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
All right.

470
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,480
To that point what doesn't work?

471
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,080
Oh okay go ahead Noah and then Dave go after Noah.

472
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,400
Well my question was what doesn't work in in Cinnamon that works on for example Gnome?

473
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:15,280
Well nothing I mean everything's fine today but as as the GTK desktops move forward and

474
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,480
I mean not that Cinnamon won't be moving forward but if it stays pinned to one version of GTK

475
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,420
eventually you won't it just won't be worth the effort to run it on anything but Mint

476
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,720
it might be possible but it just won't be worth it.

477
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
Sure.

478
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
Okay.

479
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,680
There's extensions that for example Gpaste that wouldn't that the Gnome extension would

480
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,440
not work in Cinnamon but it was ported to Cinnamon so that works now.

481
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,560
Oh so Dave now you go ahead you were kind of going to challenge the general base that

482
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,320
I was making the argument from right?

483
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:45,220
Yes you said that Linux is still used by a more technical audience people who want package

484
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:52,240
currentness and people who are technically inclined to invest in their desktop but I've

485
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,320
been finding that that may not be true.

486
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,480
I mean I went on on a trip a couple of weeks ago and I saw that a lot of people knew what

487
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:05,240
Linux was and a lot of people had seen Linux desktops people who don't know anything about

488
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,720
computers but they knew what Linux was and they were really impressed they had seen this

489
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:17,320
before and there are a lot of people that it's easy to install Linux now they use Linux

490
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:24,320
they know Linux and so I don't think Cinnamon and Mint together are targeting the Arch users

491
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:30,320
or the hardcore Linux users I think they're targeting Ubuntu's place in the desktop Linux

492
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:35,760
world because Linux now has a place there I mean I'm in India and people know this people

493
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,800
know that there's something called Linux and it has it has these issues and whatnot but

494
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,400
it works and people have asked me my sister who's a dentist asked me if I if she could

495
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,600
install Linux yeah so yeah I mean it's the world is different now and I think Cinnamon

496
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,920
is trying to make a place in this world by targeting a stable reliable desktop for people

497
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:03,320
who can install an OS but not do much beyond that.

498
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,080
Well and Wimpy you've noticed at your local Lug that a lot of folks there are using Linux

499
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,920
and it's out-of-date versions at that?

500
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:18,560
Yeah I was really really surprised by this so at the last Lug meet which is predominantly

501
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:26,680
populated by Silver Surfers let's say who are finding Linux as an alternative to Windows

502
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:31,960
mostly because they've heard that it doesn't have the virus problem but they just want

503
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,800
something to install that works that means they can read their email that they can get

504
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,440
on the web and most importantly that they can play solitaire because that seemed to

505
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,120
be the preserve of what they are up to the versions of the Linux distributions they were

506
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,720
running I was kind of amazed what three or four of them were running a version of Mint

507
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,080
and I don't know what the Mint code name was but it was the one that was derived from Ubuntu

508
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,520
Karmic so this is getting on for a five-year-old you know Ubuntu distribution and they're perfectly

509
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,560
fine with it well they installed it and it's got all of the stuff they need and it works

510
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:13,400
and I can't get my head round that they're satisfied with this but that works it's like

511
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,760
a TV you know what in a sense the TV turns on and the channels come on doesn't matter

512
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,040
if it doesn't have a Netflix app built in exactly and and they were talking about you

513
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,120
know upgrading on what version they were going to move to next and I was explaining well

514
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Mint 17s you know just around the corner oh no no no there's this Mint 13 and that's the

515
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,640
long-term support release version and I think that's the one I'm going to use and I'm like

516
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:38,200
but that's two years old and they just don't care it doesn't resonate right and Popey

517
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,520
I know you want to look into the crystal ball and talk a little about future desktops go

518
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:48,360
ahead well it just seems to me that the the the whole rationale for some of these desktops

519
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:57,520
existing like Cinnamon and Marte is there was a movement some time ago that a lot of

520
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,360
the technical users and existing Linux desktop users didn't like the way the desktop was

521
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,000
going they didn't like Gnome Shell they didn't like Unity that they didn't they may not have

522
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,920
liked KDE 4 as well and it seems that I know I know Mark as Mark Shelterworth has said

523
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:22,720
before that you know we tried the Gnome 2 way we tried the the two panel traditional

524
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,400
Linux desktop and it didn't work and for our market which is mass adoption you know everyone

525
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,240
buying it in stores and so that's part of the reason why we forwarded ahead with a different

526
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:42,520
desktop and Gnome have got their own desktop and KDE are working with their new user interface

527
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:49,880
and it's funny that you know you've mentioned that the Apple announcement at WWDC reflects

528
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:54,240
some of the changes that Gnome Shell have done it seems that that there's a in the future

529
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,940
there's these desktops that are moving forward and then there's the ones that are holding

530
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:05,080
back and the ones that are holding back are servicing a requirement from Refuse Nix people

531
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,800
who just flat out don't like that new interface which is fine but they're never ever gonna

532
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:15,680
get mass market adoption if you're sitting there with something that looks like Solaris

533
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:21,800
from 19 whatever I can see that I mean definitely one of the things that gives me a little bit

534
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:27,400
of a chub is the fact that my Gnome 3 desktop looks like it's from the future I used to

535
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:34,280
KDE looks fine with the proper icon themes and everything KDE looks fine you should tweak

536
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,080
it a bit oh yeah for sure yeah what were you gonna say no okay I was I was just gonna

537
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:48,520
say I was a CD developer at Sun Microsystems in the late 1990s so Alan I hate you

538
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:53,040
Myself and Wimpy we're in the same Linux user group so I know I know this group of

539
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,480
people and the Silver Surfers are you know semi-technical and they're the they're the main people who

540
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,120
are still in the Linux user group yeah they're the people who are contributing to the mailing

541
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,680
list and going along because everyone else has moved on and they've got desktops that

542
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:12,100
work and they don't have to futz around with libfu and you know as some SO file in a directory

543
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:18,180
somewhere that doesn't match so I can't run my desktop that stuff is just the past let's

544
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:24,520
move forward I that's kind of how I mean I respect like I guess I'm of two minds because

545
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:31,080
I've worked with so many just basic staff who really the use of the computer is part

546
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,080
of the job requirement but it's not what they're there to do and so you know you start changing

547
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,280
UI on them and to them it seems it doesn't even seem like annoying it just seems literally

548
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,640
unneeded and it's frustrating for them because like well this is for them it's a hammer it's

549
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,500
a hammer with a lot more buttons and you know and why make why change the hammer if I'm

550
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:53,080
just nailing the same nail every day and so I understand where there's where there is

551
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,120
room for cinnamon and things like that rotten corpus why don't you take us out and you said

552
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,600
there might be a way for power users to stay on mint and these and and the same mint base

553
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,680
but keep their packages up to date lay it on us right well I was saying because I as

554
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:14,320
a you know package or a project manager there's a lot of you have to deal with a lot of packaging

555
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,840
for different different distros and one of the easiest thing to do is to build a PPA

556
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:23,680
so you have support for anything based on Ubuntu and with a PPA you can keep up to date

557
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,680
and the the only problem with the PPA is that when as soon as a Ubuntu release is no longer

558
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:36,200
being supported the PPAs are killed by launchpad itself but for the LTS as long as they're

559
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,200
they're being supported you can just continuously get updates and updates so if if mint did

560
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,920
some kind of PPA management solution for their packages they could just do that instead of

561
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,880
having to have a completely separate repo well they do have a PPA manager built into

562
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:56,960
their software sources management it's pretty good I think no I don't I don't mean I don't

563
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,360
I mean I don't mean the user manages oh because that's I mean like the project themselves

564
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:07,140
the team of men managed what is like like they could go in and see this PPA is trusted

565
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,880
this is an official PPA from the project they're they're good to use that we can put it in

566
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,600
our our default repo have you guys ever noticed and I'm pretty sure I have not downloaded

567
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,840
Chrome from the Google website on a in a very long time but always just get Chromium from

568
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,920
the package manager but on Ubuntu if you download Chrome from like the Google website doesn't

569
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:32,600
it add a repo to your sources list to get future Chrome updates through the app system

570
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:39,040
but also Firefox and Chromium have an exception to the package update system in Ubuntu so

571
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:43,400
they're always up to date unlike you know some other random application that doesn't

572
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,000
get updated they have exceptions so why don't more packages do that though why why why don't

573
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,680
why don't they all do that when I download handbrake overhead someone someone has to

574
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:58,200
actually update those packages well that's true yes well I'm asking them to get somebody

575
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:04,240
to volunteer the problem is there's people who would happily like as a project manager

576
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:10,400
I would happily update my app to be continuously you know recognized as an up-to-date feature

577
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,920
but I have to wait until Ubuntu has the time to do it for one of the maintainers and I

578
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:21,320
can my testing is not is not enough I think it's wasted effort well that's what he thinks

579
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,240
so I want to pause right here and then let's talk about the whole derivatives thing and

580
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,680
because that kind of dovetails well with our mint discussion and first I want to thank

581
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:35,080
another sponsor of the unplugged show and that's the awesome folks over at digital ocean

582
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:39,360
are you familiar with digital ocean head over to digital ocean.com right now and go get

583
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,080
started because we've got a brand new promo code for the month of June which is unplugged

584
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:49,440
June unplugged you'll get you a $10 credit so what is digital ocean my friends I would

585
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,200
be happy to tell you a little about digital ocean I've been using them for quite a while

586
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,920
now and I've had absolutely rock-solid performance digital ocean is a simple cloud hosting provider

587
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,840
dedicated offering the most intuitive and easy way to spin up a cloud server users can

588
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:08,160
create a cloud server well often I say about 55 seconds but the it ranges our audience

589
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,840
I think it's actually dipped down down to the 37 second range and I swear that's without

590
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:18,360
scripting that's without scripting 37 something before boy that's crazy I know I know I think

591
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,820
it's even like at 43 seconds when somebody was doing it from their Android phone and

592
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:30,580
here's what you get for $5 a month 512 megabytes of RAM a 20 gigabyte SSD a blazing fast CPU

593
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:34,640
and one terabyte of transfer for $5 and it's all locked in right there you know exactly

594
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,260
how much it's gonna cost and if you want to upgrade it you can if you want to shut it

595
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,760
off you can and the best thing is a digital ocean has data center locations in New York

596
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:48,560
San Francisco Singapore and Amsterdam so I've been able to strategically place a droplet

597
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,320
in San Francisco and a droplet in New York spin up bit torrent sync on both of them and

598
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,720
then seed content from both sides of the United States and it made a noticeable difference

599
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,760
in performance and I think the great thing about digital ocean is that awesome simple

600
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:06,440
and intuitive control panel which power users can replicate on a much larger scale with

601
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,260
their straightforward API I have to say if you haven't tried out digital ocean yet you're

602
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,800
really missing something unplug June to get a $10 credit then you can try it out for two

603
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,160
months on your own to see what you think fire up a bit torrent sync an own cloud set up

604
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,680
a website over there and try out their backup systems with their droplet create a system

605
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,980
get it all configured just the way you want and then deploy it again and again and again

606
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,320
digital ocean makes so many of these functions that used to be really challenging I used

607
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,600
to be able to charge my clients hundreds of dollars an hour to do they now let you do

608
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,120
it in their awesome dashboard all sitting on top of KVM powered by SSD drives connected

609
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:46,040
to tier one bandwidth digital ocean.com use the promo code unplugged June and a really

610
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:53,700
big thank you to digital ocean for sponsoring the Linux unplugged show I have I have endless

611
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,020
uses for this you guys and you can too you'll be surprised once you get it running even

612
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,580
in the first two months how necessary to your life it becomes it's like if you've ever gone

613
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,080
from like not having a car to then getting a car and you're always like how did I live

614
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:10,640
but or the cell phone like like do you ever remember a time with or yeah Wi-Fi like there's

615
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,400
like these exactly there's these technologies that come around like wait a minute how did

616
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:20,220
I ever get any work done without this that's digital ocean for me digital ocean.com unplugged

617
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:26,800
June okay Matt you had a piece that you wrote for a data mation and you said our drew our

618
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,260
Ubuntu derivatives a bad idea that's the headline and it starts out with when most people think

619
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:36,300
of Ubuntu derivatives they usually categorize them into Ubuntu with a different with a different

620
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,620
desktop environment than unity category however according to Ubuntu they refer to Ubuntu

621
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:45,220
based distros with different desktop environments as derivatives as well as distros using their

622
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:50,900
own tools apps goals and customizations I think that's a great point in fact later on

623
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:56,740
you mentioned that that a lot of times mint users will go seek help in Ubuntu forms and

624
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:01,140
the Ubuntu for necessarily very receptive to that so did you kind of make the argument

625
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,240
here that maybe derivatives aren't a good recommendation for new users I think it's

626
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,380
very case-by-case and probably the best use case scenario I have for something is if you

627
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,980
have someone that's let's say they're a Windows XP user and they're looking to make the switch

628
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:18,060
they're very set in their ways they don't give a flying rip about what's bleeding edge

629
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:22,060
they want their launcher where their launchers supposed to be they want their Firefox and

630
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:26,380
they want to get it done that's probably a Linux mint person however if you have a Windows

631
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:31,700
7 user who is fluent in all desktops been using you know Windows forever doesn't really

632
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,500
care about how the desktop looks want something a little more a little more bleeding edge

633
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,260
a little more robust I guess you might say Ubuntu is probably a better option simply

634
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,820
because of better compatibility a bigger user base and they're able to drill down a little

635
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:50,340
deeper that is really my underpinnings of it is that if you're looking at PPAs mint

636
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:55,140
isn't always going to be your best experience I've based that on my own experience and based

637
00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:01,140
that on my own research so on G Plus on G Plus this morning like literally like at 4

638
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:06,020
a.m. in the morning Aaron Saigo posted on G Plus in the comment threads of one of his

639
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:12,060
posts he said that you know he does feel like sometimes these derivatives sometimes are

640
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:17,700
good in some cases and in some cases what they actually do is dilute the talent pool

641
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,100
and reduce our focus as a community and slow us down as a whole from moving forward and

642
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:27,000
I wonder too if maybe derivatives aren't a bit like that if people instead of working

643
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,780
on the derivatives were working on the main upstream distribution would that not have

644
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,660
made that upstream distribution that much better I think it depends on the viewpoint

645
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:39,460
I think from a developer's viewpoint I agree with him I think from an end user's viewpoint

646
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:44,620
I completely disagree so so I think because from an end user's point of view they want

647
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,980
to be able to have choice they want maybe maybe they want to go with the KDE is desktop

648
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,380
in that case you would actually go with a derivative not a customization the customization

649
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,380
would be like elementary OS or Linux Mint with an actual derivative you're looking at

650
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:03,500
like a XBoon2, LBoon2, KBoon2 whatever it may be that way you're getting that true Aboon2

651
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,060
base you know a much more pure Aboon2 base without all the extra stuff put over the top

652
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:13,300
of it so Rotten do you think people show up first as a contributor to a distro and then

653
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:17,780
get put off and go start their own I wouldn't say always but there's a lot of people I've

654
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:22,220
talked to that I asked them why they'd made their their derivative of whatever base it

655
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:27,860
was and they said it was too hard to get the people who were in charge to pay attention

656
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:33,380
to their contributions and then to test them and get them applied for Aboon2 for example

657
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:39,380
it's very hard to put any kind of community contribution to any core systems like if somebody

658
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:46,020
wanted to do to fork the USC and then make it better and improve it in any way they can

659
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:50,220
it's pretty much going to be ignored and Dave I think I agree with you too it's sort of

660
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:55,180
hard to pin down what exactly is a respin versus a derivative or even a distro right

661
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:02,780
exactly see Runcops and I have this conversation often and we'll see when you say it's a different

662
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:07,780
distro like for example say elementary or Pingai is it actually a different distro

663
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:13,220
is there a very I'm asking is there a core difference between the libraries they use

664
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:18,580
or is it just Aboon2 with it is it just Aboon2 with a different desktop because that's not

665
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:26,500
true for Cinnamon, Mint and Cinnamon work very well on a machine where Aboon2 wouldn't

666
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,500
but I think if I put elementary on a machine and Aboon2 on a machine there wouldn't be

667
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,540
too much of a difference except maybe in the Pantheon in how many resources the Pantheon

668
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:41,900
desktop uses so we need to say that okay this is a derivative and this is its own this is

669
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,620
just Aboon2 with a respin there's a difference between the two is what I'm saying.

670
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,260
So Hopi I want to pick on you because I'm sure coming from the Aboon2 side of things

671
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:55,740
you guys must see this come up quite a bit folks are running a derivative of Aboon2 and

672
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,540
they come to get support is it a problem do you think it's maybe and I know you're not

673
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:03,060
speaking on behalf of Aboon2 or Canonical but do you think maybe it's detracted resources

674
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,700
from the upstream project in this case Aboon2 or something like that?

675
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,700
It's tricky.

676
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:14,020
Because I mean Aboon2 itself is a Debian derivative right?

677
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:18,540
Yeah absolutely and we're very grateful for the base that Debian have given us to build

678
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:26,820
upon and just to pick up a tiny nitpick the Kubuntu, Aboon2 and so on are flavors so we

679
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:33,620
consider those blessed derivatives they're called flavors a derivative is something that

680
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,580
is separate from Aboon2 and you can usually recognize that by the fact that the packages

681
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:44,220
that they come pre-installed with don't come from the Aboon2 archive so for example Mint

682
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:50,140
has its own repository with their desktop in it whereas Lubuntu everything that ships

683
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:53,700
on the ISO image came from the Aboon2 archive.

684
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:57,220
I don't want to get stuck in the weeds but let me ask you this if I install...

685
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:00,900
The reason why that's important is because the people who work on those flavors work

686
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:05,020
together they work together for a common goal even though they're working on separate desktops

687
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:09,940
so you've got the Aboon2 guys who are working on their KDE desktop and Lubuntu working on

688
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:14,780
the LXDE desktop but they're contributing to the commons in the archive rather than

689
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,260
creating silos and PPAs all over the place.

690
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,780
So there's some collaboration happening between the projects and notes being passed back and

691
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:24,420
forth and things like that?

692
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:30,700
Yeah and they collaborate in team meetings and so on but there is a certainly I would

693
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:33,980
agree that sometimes you do get people who come along and say I would like to contribute

694
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:39,060
in this way and the project whatever it might be and in this case yeah okay it might be

695
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:43,660
Aboon2 might say well actually we don't need that contribution that bit's done we'd like

696
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:49,700
if you could to contribute in this other way and they say well no and walk away and that

697
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:56,180
has manifested itself in derivatives appearing and then dying and other derivatives appearing

698
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:01,300
and then dying so yeah there is a problem that people want to contribute in their own

699
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:10,460
way and you know their contribution may not be wanted or their eagerness to contribute

700
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:15,140
might be wanted but not in the way that they think they can contribute if that makes sense.

701
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:18,260
But don't you think I mean then we'll go back to the main topic but don't you think man

702
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:24,860
if Aboon2 touch it takes off and a lot of people like it isn't this going to be like

703
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:29,300
such a bigger problem with that because there's so many crazy phones and different carriers

704
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,420
and manufacturers there could be derivative after derivative after derivative of Aboon2

705
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,260
touch right?

706
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:39,260
I'm not sure that would happen I mean it's entirely it's entirely possible for someone

707
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,100
to take the code because it's you know it's free software and you could fork it and create

708
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:48,940
your own your own phone OS but you know is anyone going to run it you know why why would

709
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:53,960
you run random you know let's say there's a mint touch for example why would you run

710
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,660
mint touch if you've got to look at the motivation for why mint existed it's in large part as

711
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:04,500
I said earlier there are a few NICs who don't like unity and and so on so if if mint wanted

712
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:10,140
to make a touch device an OS for touch devices they're gonna have to create a UI that fits

713
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,460
on a five inch device.

714
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,180
I don't know if it's the the USENIX or if it was maybe theming in codecs originally

715
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:23,620
I mean it might have been drivers and codecs or ironically the early adherence to strict

716
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:29,020
free software policies might have actually been what was the original spark for mint

717
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,020
in some ways.

718
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:32,860
Right and I can't remember the last time I had to even bother about codecs.

719
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:36,860
Yeah yeah it's yeah not it used to be a thing yeah it used to be a thing it's not a thing

720
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,220
yeah remember those days old man?

721
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,220
Automatics remember that?

722
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,220
Seven years ago.

723
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:48,420
Wimpy you wanted to touch on the the android when it comes android when it comes to forking.

724
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,980
Well yeah only only with what poppy was just saying about who would fork Ubuntu touch.

725
00:45:53,980 --> 00:46:00,260
We just have to look at all of the OEMs that have effectively forked or customized android

726
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:06,140
with their own skins themes UI enhancements I mean just about everyone releases with their

727
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:14,220
own take on the android user interface so why why would Canonical think that the OEMs

728
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,740
aren't going to do that again?

729
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:22,180
Yeah forking and OEMs that's why all of our mobile carriers just suck for updating android

730
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,340
they are its own fork.

731
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:29,940
It's very difficult for anyone to contribute to android anyone outside of google to contribute

732
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:35,640
to android so it whereas you know we've got people from all around the world contributing

733
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,700
to Ubuntu it's very open everything's free software it's not like android where they

734
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:44,260
throw it over the wall when when there's a release ours is ongoing all the time so there's

735
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,260
certainly it's a lot easier for OEMs to get involved.

736
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,220
Also sometimes some of the android forking like and I would say probably Amazon's case

737
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:55,560
is also a competitive fork they don't want Google to be in control because of the size

738
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,920
of Google and Google's already existing monopoly base which is not really in fact that's sort

739
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,900
of Canonical's advantage we're not Google but we can still pull this off and that's

740
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,520
sort of like that's not a lot of the people gonna answer that so alright but going getting

741
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:13,700
back to the derivative things moving us back I kind of here's the way I look at derivatives

742
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:21,940
is to me it seems like like cars like bicycles like cell phone cases there's not one answer

743
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:26,740
for one person in most cases and so the reason why derivatives come up is because you know

744
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:33,340
like for me let's look at enter gross I I personally prefer installing enter gross rather

745
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:38,380
than regular arch even though at the end I accomplished the same task essentially but

746
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:43,340
for me I prefer going that route because it saves me essentially two days overall set

747
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:48,180
up as I would slowly poke away at installing packages and I'm I'm I don't know if you would

748
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:55,100
consider enter gross a derivative but I'm damn happy it's there and you know I'll tell

749
00:47:55,100 --> 00:48:00,300
you a little behind the scenes thing is Chase and I are you know getting ready to shoot

750
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,140
some some of his first episodes of how to Linux and there's just been this discussion

751
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:08,220
about what distribution does he go with and we've been kicking around a lot of stuff we're

752
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:12,420
gonna make our announcement of the distribution he picked in the first episode and it is not

753
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:18,100
been an easy process it has not been an easy process at all and should he go mint came

754
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:22,300
up several times and we would start at a conversation thread where we'd start at one place and we'd

755
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,660
end up again at mint and I thought that was particularly interesting and I and I think

756
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:31,340
that kind of got this derivatives things churning in the back of my head because they're kept

757
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:36,100
we kept coming up with scenarios where maybe mint would be more preferable for Chase and

758
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:41,000
I don't know I'm not gonna say if we chose mint in the end but to me it does it did illustrate

759
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,420
that when you are genuinely switching somebody over to a new desktop operating system mint

760
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:53,380
does offer a few nice things and I I think in some ways it's sort of showing Ubuntu hey

761
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:57,340
if you did it like this it's might be a little bit better like it's not quite competition

762
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:01,640
it's like hey here's another way to think about deploying this and in some ways having

763
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,900
that having having that to look over their shoulder and go oh that's how these guys are

764
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,620
doing it maybe we'll like the PPA management wouldn't that be great if one day we just

765
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:13,020
saw something like that kind of show up in in a future version of Ubuntu wouldn't that

766
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:17,820
be nice update or two yeah and and maybe that code would just come from the mint repos like

767
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,900
wouldn't that be nice and so I could see how there is a solid argument for derivatives

768
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,340
I do think they do create a bit of a support issue but if you look at the industry at a

769
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:31,120
whole really in most cases there's lots of different derivatives of PCs there's lots

770
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,320
of different derivatives of Android handhelds and and monitors and peripherals I mean we

771
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:40,780
just live in a world full of derivatives and you know I think it's just something that

772
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:45,340
it's just the nature of this beast and it seems to be the nature of open source for

773
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:50,060
better or for worse I think it could be one of our biggest strengths and maybe one of

774
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:55,100
our biggest weaknesses too though because of the time loss well and one thing I wanted

775
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:58,460
to touch on just stick and I'm not trying to split hairs with this by any stretch but

776
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:02,140
I think it's important to mention we were talking a little bit about derivatives versus

777
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:07,820
customizations my information is based on the derivative team wiki from from Ubuntu

778
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:13,500
and according to them it's a it's a customization of it's a derivative customization more accurately

779
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,140
so that's where the where the differentiation comes from and then reverting back to what

780
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:20,460
you were talking about as to whether or not you want to go with just another desktop or

781
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:24,460
whether you want to actually go a mint direction or now elementary direction I think it really

782
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,580
comes down to the tools that are offered by each option and which set of tools is going

783
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:34,800
to work best for you yeah and I think too you can't undersell like the the old way of

784
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:39,340
doing things paradigm you know when you give a Windows user a computer with Linux one of

785
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:42,020
the first things they decide to do is well I need to go install some of my favorite apps

786
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:45,260
and they go down they go to their websites they'd like they look for the downloaders

787
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:51,140
and there's a whole process that they have to become accustomed to and I don't know I've

788
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:55,980
been using Suniman now for for at least just over a week and I think it's I kind of been

789
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:06,020
really enjoying it I I like that it I I honestly like how familiar and fast that old I don't

790
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:10,580
want to call it a start menu but that start menu and taskbar interface is I I don't want

791
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:13,780
to I don't want Popey to yell at me but honestly sometimes I go back and then I realized oh

792
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,060
geez when I needed to get data from this window to that window this just made it so much easier

793
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:21,720
to have these right here and not have to zoom out to a full overview of my entire desktop

794
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,500
or switch virtual desktops if I didn't you know I just I'm just saying I just even even

795
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,940
though using known for a long time and using unity for a long time when I sat down and

796
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:34,140
got in traditional UI I kind of went oh yeah yeah there were some nice things about this

797
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:38,180
and then it starts to feel a little old after a while Christian you sound like you sound

798
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:45,240
like the daughter in Jurassic Park this going back to a system that they know and they recognize

799
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:54,780
and they recognize this yeah I know this it's also very easy to theme cinnamon I couldn't

800
00:51:54,780 --> 00:52:03,060
see or yeah it's fun there's several menus you can get okay you know what I had one more

801
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:07,660
topic I wanted to cover before we get and this one's about gnome and this one just caught

802
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:13,700
my eye because it turns out the gnome foundation board elections are going on and there is

803
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:18,260
a candidate that has caught my attention I want to see what you guys think so here's

804
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,060
the headline a candidate vined to become one of the directors of the gnome foundation has

805
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:27,380
raised issues of red hats domination of development of the gnome desktop project claiming that

806
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:32,420
for the last several years this is a direct quote red hat wants slash needs have trumped

807
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:38,000
what anyone else wants slash needs including the larger user base of gnome this is Emily

808
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:44,660
and I think you pronounce her last name Goyner I'm not quite sure this was in an email thread

809
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:48,720
where she was declaring her candidacy voting for the voting for this board of directors

810
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,620
with its 11 people there's eight posts that are open it's ongoing and will continue until

811
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:58,780
June 8th and then they will declare the elections on June 10th and there's a couple of choice

812
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:03,860
quotes from this in her candidacy statement she wrote it is my opinion that gnome has

813
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:08,900
strode too far towards a corporate driven project and away from its community led roots

814
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:14,260
as of now gnome is in my opinion to beholden to a small handful of large corporations and

815
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:20,580
forces with the project and forces which forces the project to ignore large swaths of users

816
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:25,580
preferences to them the end result being that gnome has lost a tremendous portion of respect

817
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:30,100
and goodwill in the wire free software community as a member of the gnome board of directors

818
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:35,380
I will actively work against this tide and towards the more open community driven project

819
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:40,580
that gnome once was and I hope will be again I have been a gnome I have been a long time

820
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:45,840
user of gnome since the 1.x days and an active contributor for the last two years now how

821
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:51,620
about that she goes on to say yes you are part of the community but you are being paid

822
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:56,340
by a large corporation to work on it and as a result you are beholden to them as least

823
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:01,060
as much to the rest of the community red hat is not the only thing that matters in the

824
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:06,080
gnome world or it shouldn't be but for the last several years red hats wants and needs

825
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,620
have trumped what anyone else wants or needs including the larger user base of gnome which

826
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:15,940
is what I believe has driven it to fracture into so many desktops over the last four years

827
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:20,580
we need to make sure that the people who aren't working for red hat have a say make sure that

828
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:25,060
people who aren't being paid to work on free software have a voice sure those of us who

829
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:29,300
are not currently paid to speak up on mailing lists but we are those of us who are not currently

830
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:34,980
paid do speak up on mailing lists but we're mostly ignored this was driven so many so

831
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:43,180
much of the community apart this is the problem wow I completely agree actually that was really

832
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:50,140
well said she's got my vote so how I mean is is is gnome is known being ran into the

833
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:53,820
ground by the by the red hat why would why would red hat do that is that really what's

834
00:54:53,820 --> 00:55:01,820
going on I would say that happens with most projects yeah does red hat care about a desktop

835
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,660
well they have a corporate desktop that they make a good amount of money on that's you

836
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,860
know a lot of times like when you see people using linux and hollywood production those

837
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:13,900
are sitting on top of red hat desktops so it's a potential issue right when if a company

838
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:18,500
gets involved to the point where their needs come before users but it and some would argue

839
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,940
it's a real issue but in the open source community as long as all their code is open

840
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:26,660
source that you can fork and I don't think forks are a bad thing because in any project

841
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:30,140
when you get too many developers working on the same thing they have different ideas about

842
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:35,260
what you should do so having she argues that having known fracture into I'm guessing she

843
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:39,380
means cinnamon cinnamon is a bad bad thing but I don't think it's a bad thing they're

844
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,180
they're trying to accomplish two different goals that meets two different types of people's

845
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:46,940
needs and quite frankly love it or hate it gnome does something that none of the other

846
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:52,300
desktops really do a way of doing things that they just don't accomplish and there is a

847
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,980
set of users like myself that really enjoys it so to say that they're screwing the pooch

848
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:02,500
on this one just seems a little arrogant like I mean leave some room for some creativity

849
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:06,660
if they're really trying to brandish their corporate might at this issue then that's

850
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:12,660
when you start arguing about it but not until then mm-hmm and we wouldn't have gnome shell

851
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:17,520
if it wasn't for a large part of the efforts done by gnome developers that are backed monetarily

852
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,900
by companies like red hat true exactly and that's I that's what I was going to point

853
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:28,540
out as well as that if before you can before we harp on red hat too much for saying well

854
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,780
their interests come before the users yet they're also contributing a lot more I most

855
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:36,340
users contribute to the development and like it or not developers cost money right I mean

856
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:42,500
we're talking about the same kind of companies that invest you know multi-million sometimes

857
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:47,940
billions of dollars into funding the Linux kernel development we're not talking about

858
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:52,940
you know Microsoft sticking its greedy hands in somewhere and screwing with the UI wimpy

859
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,920
you wanted to point out though that it's not just cinnamon that she's probably referring

860
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,300
to right no there's there's a number of candidates in these known foundation elections that have

861
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:09,940
got similar sort of messages in their manifestos and a common theme is talking about potentially

862
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:18,060
unifying the traditional desktops so Marte's being thrown in there along with cinnamon

863
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:24,420
and to some extent XFC also gets mentioned as well and and one of the candidates is talking

864
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:30,060
about using gnome 3 as sort of the the skunk works they let's go crazy with the design

865
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:38,500
ideas throw it all at the wall and see what sticks and whilst everyone's over there experimenting

866
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:46,780
with new design philosophies then have a something more stable and traditional for the corporate

867
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:52,900
an enterprise market and this is this is really what the discussions about is what's the desktop

868
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,980
that you're going to put in front of enterprise customers going to be what are they expecting

869
00:57:56,980 --> 00:58:03,860
and I think that you know last time around when they they put the the classic extensions

870
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:11,460
into gnome 3 for rel it was kind of a vote of no confidence in a new and shiny that everything

871
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:16,900
has been done in gnome 3 in terms of the enterprise market well Willie what do you think do you

872
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:21,220
think the fact that Apple just pretty wholesaly ripped off gnome 3 design might give a little

873
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:27,060
extra credibility to those pushing the gnome design forward I mean it's not the most used

874
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:33,820
desktop for no reason people like it and if people like it is it really that bad well

875
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,380
I don't know if I don't know if I agree that Apple copying the design validates it but

876
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,620
I think it does give those designers another quiver as these right as these elections are

877
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:46,140
coming up and there's this hey let's integrate more traditional functionality back into gnome

878
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:51,340
right as all that's reaching a peak boom Apple drops Yosemite on everybody's face and they're

879
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:56,380
ripping gnome off and it to me seems like a signal that that is probably a good UI design

880
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:03,100
direction at least another another shop that is well known for its design aesthetics think

881
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:09,220
so and I think that is a at least a quiver in their cap or whatever you call it and I

882
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:17,080
think to them it sort of came just at the right time I think it's just an unfair representation

883
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:24,660
of the break from 2 to 3 and then everybody in 3 is so much better no shell 3.8 was was

884
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:29,660
getting so much better and then now at 312 it's quite awesome but people are still with

885
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:34,860
the stigma of when it broke at the first time yeah exactly it feels like it's the unity

886
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:40,660
thing all over again like you wrong them once and there's no going back from that well it's

887
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:45,340
not well the weird thing is there's basically every D has done that like a KDE for example

888
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:50,460
when it switched to 4 and so it hate me and so many people hated it and now everybody

889
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:57,220
loves yeah I but they they very carefully manage that over time and I unity I feel like

890
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:01,180
that I'm same amount of time now has passed and unity hasn't fully recovered from the

891
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,420
public perception I'm not saying whether it's right or not but the put the perception of

892
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:11,300
it I think they should like if they could figure out a way to make the extensions universal

893
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:20,700
to not break between updates yeah then unity work nobody would be the best that stop yeah

894
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,500
there's still a design phase right now so as soon as they have that that the global

895
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:29,620
aspect is they're changing so much between every version that that global aspect can't

896
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:35,460
really work yet but when they get the foundation solid to where they want it to be they their

897
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:40,020
goal is to have those global right yeah I'm not really hearing anything from board members

898
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:45,380
about you know having some sort of plan of like introducing some sort of compatibility

899
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:51,700
layers for you know extension developers and you know widening it to you know a wider developer

900
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:57,060
community it just seems to be you know shame or monetary backers and the people that you

901
01:00:57,060 --> 01:01:02,500
know pay us money to work on this desktop environment so is it weird that I kind of

902
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:09,900
feel like that the manifesto was more like a politician style no I mean yeah it does

903
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:13,500
kind of feel like it and I kind of agree with the chat room to I I don't follow it super

904
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:18,620
closely I I haven't I haven't been there to witness the you know the push that red hat

905
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:24,820
might give I I don't doubt that that is a real thing though I just I'm not totally sure

906
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:28,100
if it's a bad thing if it is a real thing and how and how bad it is it does feel like

907
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:32,940
maybe it's a little bit of a politician spin too I mean hey politicians got a spin that's

908
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:37,580
their job and something I'll be watching so they'll announce the elections on June 10th

909
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:42,280
it would be interesting a if the elections happen and some of these folks calling for

910
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,860
let's call it a more conservative desktop do get elected will gnome change or will it

911
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:52,060
continue on its current course and if what depending on what we see that might be the

912
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:57,900
long answer to this question is red hat really behind what the gnome desktop is doing because

913
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,140
if nothing really changes and things continue on even though these folks get elected then

914
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:05,460
it probably would indicate the red hats really the ones pulling the strings we'll just have

915
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,980
to watch and see what happens right Matt like everything else I think so I think so and

916
01:02:08,980 --> 01:02:13,580
I mean if you actually have like a Star Wars moment where you know the democracy falls

917
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:17,820
to a sound of applause or something then I might be more concerned about it yeah but

918
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:21,340
I think at this point it's too early to tell I think at this point we're basically armchair

919
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:24,580
quarterbacking what we don't really know I think there's some strong candidates that

920
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:28,980
are going for it and we'll just have to wait and see absolutely and that music means it's

921
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,900
time for us to go right there Matt I think I think we'll put a put a feather in our cap

922
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:36,940
right there oh boy oh boy listen to that it's getting us out of here fast it's like the

923
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:40,500
Oscars like hey guys get off the stage it's time for you to go go get out of here all

924
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,520
right well listen we want you to show up on Sunday we've got a great Linux action show

925
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:46,540
