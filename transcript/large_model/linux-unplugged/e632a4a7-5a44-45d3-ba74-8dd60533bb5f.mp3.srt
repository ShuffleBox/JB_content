1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
Okay. Well, we love to talk up Chris's hair and rightfully so I'm here. It's quaffed. It's lovely

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,520
I want to get a little closer to it, but I'm sad to say I think I've discovered one hair based competition

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,480
I don't think you'd win. I don't know Wes don't count the hair out. What do you got?

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:33,640
All right. Well, maybe you want to throw down in the USA mullet championship. I'll do it for the show. Hello

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,400
friends and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is was my name is

6
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,520
Brent. My name is Alex. Hello gentlemen. Well, we have a really fun show today. We took on a challenge

7
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,680
could a demanding Linux user someone who demands excellence live with a reasonably low cost Linux

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,320
box. We take a look at a couple of surprising budget Linux PCs. I bet you've never even heard of and

9
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,680
we'll see how they hold out. Plus, we've been challenged to put Linux Mint to the test is the

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,560
freshest mint the best Linux for a low end PC. We'll give that a shot and tell you our opinions as

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,400
well. Then we'll round out the show with some great boosts, some pics and a lot more. So before we go

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,800
any further, you know, it's our duty. We got to say time appropriate greetings to our virtual lug.

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:31,920
Hello, Mumble Room. Hello, Chris. So many names today. A very strong Mumble Room. Wow. So great.

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
Hello, everybody. And hello, all of you up there in the quiet listening as well. Very nice to have

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,120
you along for the show today. I also want to say good morning over to our friends over at tail

16
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:47,200
scale. tail scale is a mesh VPN protected by wire guard. We love it. And it's going to change your

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,520
networking game. It's going to blow your mind. Go see what wire guard is capable of. Oh, it's a good

18
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,800
morning to go over there. I don't care what time of day it is. Say good morning from Linux unplugged

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:03,040
at tailscale.com. Go try it up to 20 devices free. You can wish them good night too. I suppose I just

20
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,160
like the idea of it's always morning at tailscale. You know, it's always a good morning over at

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,760
tailscale. Okay, so we got to start the show off with the meetups. You know, we've been talking

22
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,080
about meetups, we've been talking about meetups. And I know I've listened to podcasts where I'm

23
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,400
like, well, that meetup doesn't apply to me. I wish they didn't talk about it all the time. But

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,440
here, here's the thing, buddy, here's the thing. These meetups are a bigger deal than I think you

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,640
appreciate until you can attend them. And that's kind of why we continue to talk about them is

26
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,560
because once you go to a meetup, you experience the kind of connection that I think is, I don't

27
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,120
know, it's almost like built into us that we need that kind of social connection with our with our

28
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,280
tribe. And so it can be re energizing, it can be profound in a lot of ways. And so we just had a

29
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,640
couple of them wrap up. And that's one of the reasons Alex is here today. How you feeling, Alex?

30
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,080
Good morning. I know you just woke up a little a little bit before the show, you just got back

31
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,680
home. How was the meetup and everything? How was your flight and all that stuff?

32
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,640
Well, I'm not gonna lie, Chris, you're probably hearing my voice. I'm a little tired right now.

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,760
Yeah, I can hear it. Well, yeah, you got a little bit of that frog flight was fine. You know, 18

34
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:14,720
month old toddler on a nine hour fart tube flight, what could go wrong? We only had one meltdown

35
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,400
that was I don't know, like if anybody that's listening is a parent and has been in that

36
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,880
situation where your kid is just hyperventilating from the crying on the plane. You just feel

37
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,600
helpless in that moment. Like you want the child to be okay. You want all the people to not be

38
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,640
there. It's just Yeah, that was that was a fun moment. But the meetup made it all worthwhile.

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,440
And we got a clip from the meetup from our buddy Joe Resington to just give us a quick flavor of

40
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,160
the event.

41
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:52,320
Hello, and welcome everyone to late night self hosted after dark in the park. So great. You can

42
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,440
hear the whole thing in late night Linux 190, which is going to come out on August 15. But I

43
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,560
think it's pretty great that Joe joined. And so you've got the late night Linux crew there. You've

44
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,640
got the JB crew there. It's a big conspiracy to make us as jealous as possible. Yeah, I was

45
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,480
watching some I was looking from afar watching some of the pictures come in thinking, man, I

46
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,240
wish I could have been there. It was a beautiful evening. So to set the scene, we're in this

47
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,560
Jubilee Park and gardens just underneath the London Eye down by the River Thames on the South

48
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,360
Bank. And it's just you know, groups of people peppered around on the grass, you know, having a

49
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,080
little picnic and stuff. You know, mid 20s in the temperature, a little bit of sunshine. It was

50
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,320
just the perfect evening to be outside with a group of friends. And a pretty good crowd too. It

51
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,120
looks like you got what nearly 100 folks there. So almost as many people that signed up or more.

52
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:51,440
Well, I took with me 75 stickers, 150 stickers, sorry. And I had two packs and I came back with

53
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,640
one unsealed pack. So by my count, there were 74 people plus a random lady that decided to come and

54
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,280
sit behind Joe and I whilst we were recording. And we there was this moment where we were in the

55
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,760
middle of this show about 20 minutes in and this just random lady comes and sits like, you know, a

56
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:15,440
foot behind me and I'm like, Oh, this is going to go south. She what is was because I could see the

57
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,960
cider in her hand. I was like, Hmm, is she drunk? Is she going to cause problems? And no, she

58
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,240
didn't. She sat there the whole time. And then after we finished, I was you know, a shout out to

59
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,000
anybody as anybody not got a sticker because I was very insistent that everybody got a sticker

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,320
because it was basically my counter for attendance. Good idea, Alex. And she she went,

61
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,280
Yeah, I'll take a sticker. I'm like, Sorry, who are you? And she went, Do you need to know? I was

62
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,800
like, Hmm, no, I don't actually.

63
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,160
Man, this location is just so beautiful. It's got the Ferris wheel. Of course, you can see the

64
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,440
rivers right there. A huge crowd. It looks like actually, look at that crowd.

65
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,560
Yeah. So the thing about the South Bank down by the Thames there is you get a lot of street

66
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,400
performers and they they gather crowds of 2300 people at a time and this shows last 10 minutes

67
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,560
and then at the end, you give them a couple of quid to say thank you. And so it's just this

68
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,080
really nice family relaxed vibe down by the river, which is exactly what I was going for with the

69
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:20,400
location. So well, it's out great. And, you know, the fact that we had 75 or so people show up as

70
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,880
well, you know, it was I was very, very pleased. And we had people from all over we had some, I

71
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,600
think the furthest that, you know, by myself, the people came was the Czech Republic. We had two or

72
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,440
three Norwegians there. There was a couple of Dutch people there. I know bites in the mumble

73
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,120
room today. I met bite at the meetup as well. That was nice.

74
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,480
I spent some money to be there for one day.

75
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,960
Did you? Was it kind of expensive to get there?

76
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,400
Yeah. Even taking the train is enormously expensive. I found one of the cheaper flights. But

77
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:57,240
then I made a little mistake by taking a train back to the airport and paying 40 pounds for a one

78
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,800
way trip and some other little mistakes that made the trip a bit more expensive than I would like.

79
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,160
But yeah, it's not it can't be beaten by something else.

80
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,440
Lessons learned for next year. Right. So that way, if Wes and I make it out there next year,

81
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,080
you can be our tour guide. Yeah. But you get what I'm saying, too, right, Alex, you get that kind

82
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,640
of that charge by being around people that want to talk about the same stuff or excited about the

83
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,520
same stuff. Follow the shows. It's really fun.

84
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,600
It's very surreal meeting a group of complete strangers that know a lot about you and you know

85
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:35,760
nothing about them because this medium is a very one way, for the most part, a very one way

86
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,600
medium, you know, very weird people like, Oh, how's your mother in law's internet work? And I'm

87
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,240
like, Oh, yeah, we talked about that in self hosted, didn't we? That's that's how you know

88
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,160
that. Yeah. Yeah, you do get a few things like that, for sure. They might know more than we know

89
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,440
about ourselves at times. And then you want to know how you know that Alex is truly a party animal

90
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,760
is that Brent managed to talk him into going to another meetup when he got back to Raleigh. Yeah.

91
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:05,960
Yeah, they got back at about 2pm here local time in Raleigh. And since I'm you know, to give a

92
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,120
little context, I was house sitting while Alex was away. So but I organized a little sneaky little

93
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,360
micro meetup here in Raleigh. Thanks to our matrix room. It was amazing.

94
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,000
Hi, this is Brent from Raleigh. I found an Alex. Apparently he's doing two days, two continents

95
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,360
and two JB meetups. Hi, Alex. And I even have some stickers left for this one that is planning. It's

96
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:40,560
true. They've been re imported for this purpose. And I found a few people. Hi. Hello. We've got

97
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,960
what how many are we six, six of us and we're having a great time. A Raleigh rabble. Raleigh

98
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:53,760
Raleigh. Sounds like you're really enjoying yourselves. Yeah, we had a great time. I think it

99
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,280
was probably a very different energy than the London meetup, right? Well, I think I was awake

100
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:07,160
for like, our 16 when we sat down. 18. By the time we left, I was a little bit drunk with tiredness,

101
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,680
wasn't I? Not even from the beer I've had. Yeah, easily. But you made it. It was a great time. We

102
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,520
probably laughed more than anything. We had some good food. And it was a nice low key thing. And I

103
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:26,200
hope the whole idea with these sort of regional based matrix rooms is that some of these meetups

104
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:32,280
can happen on a regular basis. And maybe even without JB folks. So we hope that I think we can

105
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,000
facilitate that for listeners. Right. That does seem to be happening that we have a listener that

106
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,920
emailed into office hours that wants to start organizing meetups on their own with just other

107
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,640
JB listeners. I love it. I think we'll cover it a bit more in self hosted as well, no doubt talking

108
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,440
about the meter. But for anybody that's listening to this show that was in London or in Raleigh last

109
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:58,160
night, huge thanks for showing up. I got a huge amount of energy from you all to continue doing

110
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,680
this for a lot longer. You know, it's it's, it's weird sitting in your own room, just talking to a

111
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,360
microphone. It feels a little bit disconnected from reality sometimes. And to actually connect

112
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,800
in meat space with real human meat bags that have been listening. It's it's hard to describe

113
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,680
really, but thank you all for coming. It means a lot. Yeah, yeah, I'm really looking forward to

114
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,200
them to more meetups, too, because it's just you want to keep it rolling. I kind of loved it, too.

115
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,520
You know, I was a little distracted, but I could see the various channels and matrix just just

116
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,040
exploding with little pics. And it made me feel like I was I was almost there. Yeah, it was nice

117
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,000
to watch the London meetup and then the Raleigh group later. And like, you know, happens often

118
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,160
at these events, some gifts were given as well. My name is Philip, and I brought some retired

119
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,400
raspberry pies that have been collecting dust and I thought maybe you could put them to good use.

120
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:53,320
That is super generous. Now when you say retired, what exactly do you mean? And how old are they?

121
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:00,680
And what have they been used for? They are several years old. Actually, I can't remember how old they

122
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,160
are. One is a Raspberry Pi three, which is quite a bit older. And one is a Raspberry Pi four.

123
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,440
They started out as a home assistant, of course. And then I kind of moved on from home assistant

124
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:24,200
to home kit and had grand designs to do other projects with them and never got around to.

125
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,920
That sounds familiar. Well, thank you for bringing gifts. We didn't ask for gifts,

126
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,080
but this is super amazing. Thank you. You're very welcome. That is so great,

127
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:39,560
you know, and everybody's got a Raspberry Pi these days. They're not using see instead of

128
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,520
feeling guilty about it, you could gift to Brantley, who has been Raspberry Pi short,

129
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,480
you know, not anymore. Thanks. Wonderful listeners. Now you're Raspberry Pi rich.

130
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,800
You know, Philip did also reveal a little later, which I unfortunately didn't get an audio,

131
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,560
but he did reveal that his upgrade that sort of replace these Raspberry Pis is now running Umbral

132
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,160
and he's really loving it. That is great. Boy, he's right in sync, isn't he? Although he went

133
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:11,480
from home assistant to home kit. And my humble opinion, usually you want to go from home kit

134
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,600
to home assistant, but no judgment. Oh, no home automation shame on the show. Come on.

135
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,920
No, no judgment. Now, Alex, we got a little gift from London as well, didn't we?

136
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,400
We did. Listener Thor, who came in from Norway, has gifted the network one of these remarkable

137
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:35,960
e-ink tablets. Remarkable is the brand name of the thing. It's this iPad sized e-ink tablet

138
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,960
display annotation device, note taking device. And so we're going to let Brent put it through

139
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,400
its paces over the next week or two before he comes to see you, Chris.

140
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,880
That's fun. Now, is it a touch screen as well? Yes. You know, I've explored it for about 38

141
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:57,960
seconds so far. So the journey begins now. And I think I'll put it through its paces. It'll see a

142
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,800
few airplanes and cars and hopefully trains as well. So we'll see how it does. Thank you,

143
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,520
by the way. I can't help but think that the best job for that would be a low power home assistant

144
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:13,480
dashboard that's displaying you info. But yeah, buddy, you turn everything into a dashboard.

145
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,600
That's true. I would say please send in your ideas. I would love to find about, you know,

146
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,400
20 different ways to use this thing. So send them in. What OS do we know? Currently, it says

147
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:28,840
out of battery. Is that an OS? I'm wondering if it's a Linux. If anybody knows, send it in.

148
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:33,800
Are you suggesting the poor battery life is a Linux thing? No, it must be Android then.

149
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:43,000
Hey, yo. All right. So the next round of meetups is Nye. We have a whole swath of West Coast

150
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,520
meetups. So go to meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting. Wes, you caught this in the news

151
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:55,640
recently, but it looks like NASA is going all in on the Linux copters. The future plans, I guess,

152
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,800
for Mars exploration are going to include a set of two helicopters for like the next rover.

153
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,400
It's going to come with two of them. They're also thinking of having them pick up samples

154
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,160
for additional missions to return those samples to Earth. So how about that? Yeah. So that's

155
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,320
amazing. Ingenuity has not only, I think, exceeded expectations, but it's clearly set the path

156
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:24,760
forward for future space exploration with Linux copters. That's just so awesome. When we get down

157
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,680
to JPL, I hope to get a chance to talk to Tim about this specifically and just kind of get his

158
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,160
take on this. And if this wasn't kind of the long goal, maybe they didn't want to outwardly say it,

159
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,040
but I got to imagine they were kind of hoping if this all worked out, this is where things were

160
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,520
going. I wonder if we can get any tips to make our own Linux copter. They're not going anywhere.

161
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,040
They're not going anywhere. I kind of want one now. You could ask Tim yourself, dear listener,

162
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,840
just get your name in the hat. Go to linuxunplug.com slash JPL. We have 15 slots available to our

163
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,360
audience to take a personalized tour of JPL. And we'll be pulling names from that hat as the event

164
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,560
gets closer. So that's linuxunplug.com slash JPL. And that's just a simple next cloud form that we

165
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,320
have that you can fill out. And then we also have our West Coast crew matrix room where we are

166
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,640
organizing with locals along the West Coast and figuring out where people are at. We'd love to

167
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,520
have you join us there as well. That's in our matrix colony. And details for all the meetups,

168
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,720
the individual meetups we're stopping at from Oregon down to Southern California at meetup.com

169
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,880
slash Jupiter broadcasting. All right. I think that's everything with that. The meetups take a

170
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,120
big part of the show during the summer, but they're super important to us. So we want to

171
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:36,520
dedicate some time to that. You know what? There's not always a lot else going on. That's true. It

172
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,600
is the summer. A lot of developers, especially the ones outside the US, they do this crazy thing

173
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,320
called vacation. And I think some of them are even taking like six weeks off at a time. I don't know.

174
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,080
They must not get paid for it, I'm sure. And they probably have all their medical coverage suspended

175
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,000
because it's tied to their job, I'm sure. Of course. Yeah. Because otherwise that wouldn't

176
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,560
make any sense. It'd be completely unfair. And that's not how we would do it in the States,

177
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,520
right guys? But it's cool. So development slows down a little bit sometimes.

178
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,560
Are you all right over there?

179
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,080
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.

180
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,760
Extra, extra patriotic today.

181
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,400
Yeah. I just, that's just one thing that, you know, whatever. Let's talk about saving money

182
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,880
because some of us, you know, we don't need to be blowing money right now on expensive computers

183
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,560
that can do the job perfectly fine. This is great too for friends and family, people that just want

184
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,080
a go to Linux machine. And you know, here's one tip that remember to remember tweeted at me that

185
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:36,200
I think is really the key one. It's just got to remember to shop with Linux in mind when you're

186
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,400
looking for this stuff. Just like you would, if you're going to buy something for the Mac,

187
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,320
you got to shop with the Mac in mind. It's a little less of a problem on windows, but let's be

188
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,520
honest, you got to do it on windows too, because you could end up with something that's really

189
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,720
crap drivers. And that just makes your whole system suck. So you really got to kind of shop

190
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,720
careful on windows. Pick which third-party weird driver applications you want running on your box.

191
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,480
Right. Which auto-updater that starts every time your windows box boots, which one do you want?

192
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,120
So, you know, it's to say it's a compromise to have to kind of shop with Linux in mind

193
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,160
and compatibility in mind. I just disagree. I think that's just the state of computing,

194
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,040
but I just wanted to put that up front. Everything we're going to talk about today,

195
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,720
you just kind of want to shop with Linux compatibility in mind. And today I want to

196
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,200
talk about four cheap Linux PCs. And I use that term generously. I don't mean cheap as in quality.

197
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,960
I just mean cheap as in price. And I want to tell you about four I found. And then I,

198
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,880
and if you guys have any suggestions to, I definitely want to hear those first,

199
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,040
first starting with not one that I have tried personally, but I heard about this from Adam

200
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,000
Curry and it just seems like a crazy good deal right now. Brand new from Amazon,

201
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:42,680
160 US greenbacks for a Beelink mini SPC with an 11th gen Intel N5095 processor,

202
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:48,040
eight gigs of Ram and 128 gigabyte SSD. I think it ships with windows 11, but you could put Linux

203
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,840
on there. It's 160 bucks new. And they even have like a $10 off coupon right now. It's crazy.

204
00:17:52,840 --> 00:18:00,840
So 150 bucks for a brand new 11th gen Intel PC or run Linux. That's kind of like just from start

205
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,720
right there, but maybe you want to go even cheaper. Maybe you're really on a budget. Maybe it's for,

206
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,200
you know, maybe it's for your kids, maybe it's for yourself and you just don't want to spend a

207
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,080
lot of money on this kind of stuff right now. I want to tell you about a machine that I got

208
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:21,320
since the last episode. It is the Acer switch one Intel, Adam's Z 8,300, 1.4 gigahertz laptop.

209
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:29,320
And it's one of these that you can flip the screen around and run Linux as a tablet if you have the

210
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,800
right distro. So some people are into that, you know, convertible style. I have it here with me

211
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:41,720
in the studio right now. It's about the size of an 11 inch, you know, or so iPad with the keyboard.

212
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,920
It reminds me back of the days of like the netbook era, you know, kind of that size.

213
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,160
Yeah. And then of course you can flip the screen around and do those kinds of shenanigans. Although

214
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,040
I don't know if I actually would ever try that. Here's the problem. I haven't tried this machine

215
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:56,040
personally because I got it off eBay and the bastard didn't include the power down there.

216
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,800
Oh no. Didn't even, I forget. And of course it's some random barrel one, right?

217
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:09,240
So I'm just mentioning this because $45. Oh my goodness. $45. Yes, it's an Adam, but $45.

218
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,360
That's like, you're in pie prices now. And you could have basically a tablet,

219
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,960
PC with a keyboard and Linux is going to run just fine on there, right?

220
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,560
Chris, what's the age of this thing?

221
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:22,360
Well, the Intel Atom X5 is pretty old. I mean, it's not, it's not a brand new machine. I think

222
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,840
it's like a 2015 model. Again, you're not going to get the latest and greatest for under a hundred

223
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,760
bucks, but you know, to have something under a hundred bucks that you could put Linux on,

224
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,840
it's nice to have that option.

225
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,040
I think this is the episode where you're putting on like the used car salesman vibe. You know,

226
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,400
let me put you in an Intel Atom.

227
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,960
This is a previously loved laptop with a special undercoating.

228
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,280
You're right. It is very tablet-like in that like a bunch of the ports and stuff seem to be

229
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,080
in on the screen side. And then the keyboard is, you know, really just kind of like the keyboard

230
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,640
that's attached.

231
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,920
Right. And it's got a front and back camera on the screen.

232
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,080
Oh, perfect for selfies.

233
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,680
So that's an interesting one. But now I want to tell you about a really practical one.

234
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,040
This is just another hot Chris pick here. This is one that I personally own. I actually bought

235
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:13,560
this machine to run as, to test it as potentially a replacement for JOOPS's home server to replace

236
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,640
my Raspberry Pi 4. But in the end, I decided the IO was too limiting.

237
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:28,440
And so this is the Ideapad 3, 14 IML 5, 128 gigabyte SSD, Intel Pentium Gold, 2.4 gigahertz.

238
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,560
This one came with four gigs of RAM, but the bottom pops right off and you can upgrade

239
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,000
basically all the components, but it's very, it's very serviceable in that regard.

240
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The RAM and the hard drive are accessible in the Ideapad 3. And it's actually a pretty

241
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,200
good little laptop. It's got a decent size to it. It's got a decent trackpad. It's got

242
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,520
a good keyboard for this price range.

243
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,240
Doesn't look bad. I mean, it doesn't stand out, but that's kind of what you want in a

244
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:51,720
laptop like this.

245
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,640
It's just a simple ThinkPad. It's of the kind of older ThinkPad styling because it's a little

246
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,280
bit older. And it has the Intel Gold CPU, which means it has quick sync, which is one of the

247
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,720
reasons I bought it, but that might be useful to you. Check that out there, Wes. So that

248
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,840
one's a little heavier. This one goes for $260.

249
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,040
It's not bad, though. And it's well weighted. It does not feel off-kilter.

250
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:13,240
It does not feel off-kilter or off-access when I'm holding it in here, which I like.

251
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,880
Yeah, it is. It's got a lot of the pros of a well-designed Lenovo. It's a little old,

252
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,760
but I still think that Intel Pentium Gold CPU is actually a pretty good little chip.

253
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,880
So I think overall, that's like, out of all of the list, that's going to be my most practical

254
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,200
recommendation right here.

255
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,640
Now, Chris, I see you have a dongle dangling off that thing. Is there a specific purpose

256
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,600
for that, that you're using it for?

257
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,080
Yeah, you could have taken these off before you handed it to me.

258
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,120
Well, it doesn't have Ethernet built in. So that is an Ethernet dongle, just because

259
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,720
I likes to have it wired sometimes. And that's not too uncommon at this price point, is to

260
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,600
not get Ethernet in there.

261
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,240
Or at the higher price points, too.

262
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,520
Yeah, unfortunately, you're right about that. This next one I'm about to talk about doesn't

263
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,640
have Ethernet, but it's not because they're being cheap. It's because it literally wouldn't

264
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,680
fit on the hardware. This one's a lot of fun, guys. This is something really special. I

265
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:15,440
don't even know how I didn't know about this. It's called the Acer Mini PC. And it was sold

266
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,160
in a Cloud Professor Kit. It's a whole kit that comes...

267
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,480
You could just say Cloud Professor Kit like that and assume we know what that means.

268
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,520
Try it. Open it up here, Wes. I brought it into the studio. This is the Cloud Professor

269
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,720
Kit. And maybe you could describe what's in there. Take a look while I talk about this

270
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:38,760
device. So this device is smaller than a Chromecast in overall size, or about the size of a Chromecast.

271
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:45,400
It has a 1.4 gigahertz CPU, two gigabytes of RAM, 16 gigabytes of hard drive space.

272
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,280
It has an HDMI out. They managed to put USB-A on the thing. And they have what seems to

273
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:58,600
be like a micro SD type slot and a mini USB slot probably for power. The thing fits literally

274
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:06,160
in the palm of my hand. It is absolutely tiny. And it comes pre-installed with Linux on it.

275
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,080
Okay. So it looks like this thing is targeted. Like, is this a PC to use while you're making

276
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
an Arduino?

277
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,080
Yeah, it's for training.

278
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,080
Embedded. Oh, okay.

279
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,320
Yeah. So this kit actually comes with an Arduino in the box, too. So you can connect it.

280
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,360
Yeah. It's got a nice little seed shield here, too.

281
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,660
So you get a whole kit with a book. You get the kit.

282
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,840
Sensor sensor, light sensor. You can make some fun projects with this.

283
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:36,320
Yes. And it is $38 US dollars. $38 US dollars.

284
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,680
Now I think we also, you get to call yourself a cloud professor after you bought this, right?

285
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
So that's also a big part of that.

286
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,720
Well, it's on the thing. So it says-

287
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,280
It also comes with a badge.

288
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
Right.

289
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:53,440
Yeah. And so it's an Atom. It's a fifth gen Atom CPU. So it's an x86 CPU. It's smaller

290
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,320
than a Raspberry Pi in terms of overall width, but it's about the length of a Raspberry Pi

291
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
board.

292
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,840
And you could just slap it on the back of one of these studio monitors. It's obviously

293
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,840
fanless.

294
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,200
Yeah. And with the HDMI out, you could hook it up to anything that takes HDMI. It's totally

295
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,480
silent. This has me rethinking the Raspberry Pi for a lot of things. And that's what I

296
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,040
want to use this for, is what I might use a Pi for, but I want x86 compatibility.

297
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,880
Whoa. Okay. So you kind of undersold this whole segment. You know, interesting, yeah,

298
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,760
but really it's a titanic shift in how you're deploying things.

299
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,120
Well, we'll see. I mean, they're cheaper and more available than a Raspberry Pi. That's

300
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,460
just the reality of it right now.

301
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,360
Hopefully more successful than the Titanic, though, Wes.

302
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,560
Oh, we'll see about that. I mean, that's probably why they're going for 30 bucks or 40 bucks

303
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
on eBay, right?

304
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:41,000
I mean, I do think it's interesting though, anytime you mentioned the Pi and the fact

305
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,080
that you have, you know, you have what, five or six and we had Josh on Self Hosted a few

306
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,400
weeks ago who has 47 or something crazy. Like the first place that my mind goes to has always

307
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,840
been just get a single x86 box and replace all of them and you'll save power, you'll

308
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,080
save money. These days, definitely save money. So it's interesting to see you finally go

309
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
down this path.

310
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,880
Yeah, that's how I actually got the idea, Pat, is I was thinking, well, one x86 box,

311
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,520
a little more powerful. It has quick sync on there, so it'd be great for Jellyfin or

312
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,280
AirPlex. And then I just wasn't really happy with the overall availability and I thought,

313
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,240
well, if I'm really going to go to the extreme, something like a Raspberry Pi that's x86 would

314
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,960
be the way to go. And this thing, as far as I can tell, runs off of a micro USB for power.

315
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,520
So the power consumption is going to be nothing, right? How cool is that? What do you think,

316
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Wes? You're holding it right now.

317
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,640
Yeah, I mean, it's nice. It's a good little form factor. I like that there's a full size

318
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,880
USB 3 on here, right? So it seems kind of, sure, could I have a few more plugins? You're

319
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:47,200
going to need dongles maybe, but what it is for the price, yeah, seems worth a shot.

320
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Yeah. So it's the Acer Mini PC with an Atom CPU, or you could just search for the Cloud

321
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:58,480
Professor. It is what it is, guys. That's just what they call it. I mean, I think you

322
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,600
can find them on eBay without the whole kit as well, but I kind of wanted the kit. I mean,

323
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,600
why not get the Arduino?

324
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,080
You may be able to sell the Arduino for $38 and get your money back.

325
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,680
Well, I think I want to give it away. I think I want to give the whole kit away after I

326
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,680
play with it for a little bit.

327
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
That's a nice idea.

328
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:18,440
Yeah. So I'll keep it all together so that way we can just package the box back up and

329
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:23,200
ship it out to a listener in the future. So I'll put links to all of the eBay listings

330
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:29,380
to these in the show notes if you want to try it out. Do any of you guys have a really

331
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:34,080
just quick go-to budget Linux PC? We've got some recommendations that came in from the

332
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,960
audience that we're going to get to as well, but we'll get to those in a bit.

333
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,560
I do. It's the HP290 Slim. It's one of these old thin client boxes. I think it's 8th Gen

334
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:50,600
Intel CPUs. They used to be available for under $100. I think it's closer to $150 now,

335
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:58,840
but typically these things come with the Celeron G4900, which has very capable quick sync performance.

336
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,800
It's been running my Blue Iris box now for a couple of years. Just does the job. It comes

337
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:09,640
with a 500 gigabyte spinner, I think, from most eBay sellers. I upgraded that to a SATA

338
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:16,320
or an M.2 SATA or an NVMe SSD. I can't remember which. So for under $200, I've got a very

339
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,880
capable box. I know it's running Windows. I know you asked for a Linux box, but it would

340
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,520
run Linux just fine.

341
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:28,960
That's a great recommendation. We got a suggestion too for a Dell Wyze thin client from an anonymous

342
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,480
supplier, the 5070 thin client. They said that it actually works pretty well for them.

343
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,160
$120 shipped. They added a 512 gigabyte M.2 and two 8 gig sticks of RAM. The whole thing

344
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,360
off of Amazon is like $105 after they added the upgrades. Then you buy the thin client

345
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,240
itself for $120. You put it all together. You're under $300 and he says you've got a

346
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:55,320
great or they say you've got a great Linux learning machine. So it's the Wyze 5070 thin

347
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,200
client. So two thin client recommendations.

348
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,520
I have been kind of decently surprised at some of those lower end, you know, the atoms

349
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,520
and the Celeron line even these days. Like if you don't need to do much, you're not doing

350
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,040
serious crunching, it works.

351
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:13,240
Right. The thing is about the Celeron that's in the HP box are recommended. With QuickSync,

352
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:19,240
all of the hard processing is going through a hardware chip. So all the threads are doing

353
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,360
is just keeping the OS going really.

354
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,360
Yeah.

355
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
It's great.

356
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,080
I mean, it works for the iPad. Why not here? Right? You just got to have the right software

357
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,280
hardware combo. And that's where looking for something with QuickSync can make that. We

358
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,680
got a recommendation from Colin, I believe. Was it Brent?

359
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,480
We actually got this recommendation twice. So I think it's probably a good one. Colin

360
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:49,240
and Antal also suggested this one. It's a Minis Forum Desk Mini UM350 Ryzen Mini PC.

361
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:52,400
And this one ships with Manjaro pre-installed on it, it looks like.

362
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,840
Yeah, it's a maybe a little higher budget. It's at the $299. It's currently on sale for

363
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,820
$299. But directly, it's brand new. And so I think you can buy it directly from Minis

364
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,400
Forum and a whole bunch of other places, eBay, you can get it on Amazon as well. And I saw

365
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,360
it, I didn't click into it, but I also saw a link at Walmart. So I don't know what that's

366
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,360
about. But it seems like Minis Forum, which is new to me, has an interesting catalog of

367
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,680
small and not too expensive machines that are worth checking out.

368
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,080
I love this tip. This looks like it'd be a great podcasting machine for doing recordings

369
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:35,080
and whatnot there. What I love about Linux is that you can actually build a really awesome

370
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:40,560
budget machine and not feel bad about it. There's something about the Linux community

371
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:48,120
where it can actually be kind of an awesome cool guy thing to do to go down low end and

372
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,080
make it work with the lowest end PC where it always seems like in Windows, especially

373
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,520
get to the gaming culture, it's always skews towards the biggest graphics card, the fastest

374
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,680
CPU, the fastest machine, all of the lights, all the RGB lighting you possibly can stuff

375
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:06,320
in there, liquid cooling just to the absolute maximum extreme. And that's just like only

376
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,320
accessible to such a small amount of people. But in the Linux community, we also will celebrate

377
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,960
the really low end and try to make that work and try to find these cool little budget machines

378
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,240
that can get a crap ton of work done for you at a great price.

379
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,240
I love that it's the same Linux, too. You know, because couldn't you just imagine on

380
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:25,760
some of these lower end machines like other vendors are going to ship a more limited operating

381
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,600
system. But right. We get the we get the same for doesn't come with like Windows starter

382
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,560
edition. Right. That's a great point.

383
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:37,720
I think what I find really amazing and something that I guess I have lived this lifestyle for

384
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:43,160
the last many years, you know, with my low end hardware that I somehow make productive.

385
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:48,000
We've got our low end expert brand in our low end correspondence checking in here. What

386
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,440
I have really loved and and that was true since the beginning of my Linux journey was

387
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,480
that you can you can throw Linux on some of this lower end hardware and it performs in

388
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,720
a way that other operating systems, at least other popular operating systems, just can't

389
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,840
even match, can't even come close. You know, if you are choosing something like I don't

390
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:17,720
know Joe's XFC favorite or lesser process intensive desktop environments, CPU challenged

391
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:25,400
machines. Right. I think it's kind of amazing that you can run that on really what fits

392
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,400
in the palm of your hand. You know, that's right. I think one of Linux is major strengths

393
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,040
is it can do that and it can be, you know, the top 100 supercomputers as well.

394
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:41,480
I agree. So the question becomes which distribution is the right? You got a lot of choice, but

395
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:46,440
only one can be king.

396
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,560
Linode dot com slash unplugged. Go there to get one hundred dollars and 60 day credit

397
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,320
on a new account. And it's a great way to show your support for the show. Linode is

398
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,040
definitely the Linux geeks cloud. They've got 11 data centers around the world and they've

399
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:04,580
been hard at work at building something awesome for nearly 19 years because they saw the trajectory

400
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:09,720
of Linux almost 20 years ago. I can relate to that. And it's that passion that they've

401
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:13,800
built this business on top of. And if you like to build these systems up from the ground

402
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:19,600
yourself, or have the option to deploy one of their many one click stacks, Linode has

403
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,320
excellent options for you. And the thing I can say confidently is the performance is

404
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,960
incredible. I just wouldn't put all of our J.B. audience facing stuff on Linode if it

405
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,540
wasn't the case. But it's not just me saying that. Stable Point listed Linode as the fastest

406
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:40,680
growing cloud provider and the best fit for low latency based use cases thanks to Linode's

407
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:45,980
high performing MVME storage. But you know this. It's not just the storage that makes

408
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:50,700
it low latency. It's the fact that they are their own ISP, that they've hyper optimized

409
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:54,800
their data centers and they know how to build these things efficiently. And they're always

410
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:58,800
cramming in the latest and greatest hardware, just smoothly and elegantly upgrading your

411
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,120
systems as you go. And they have a bunch of great back end features. S3 compatible object

412
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,360
storage is one of my absolute favorite cloud firewalls, DDoS protection, VLAN support,

413
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,080
Kubernetes support, including now the, you know, Ansible and Terraform too. I mean Kubernetes

414
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,000
is like the go to, but let's be real. Let's be real. I know a ton of people out there

415
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,440
using Ansible to manage their Linode systems. I mean maybe they're doing the whole stack.

416
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:26,160
I don't know. But I hear from the audience all the time. They're deploying stuff on Linode

417
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,840
using Ansible. And it makes sense. Pricing's 30 to 50% cheaper than other major cloud providers

418
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:34,840
out there that want to lock you into their esoteric hyperscaler platform. They've got

419
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,080
the best support in the business. Nobody can touch it because nobody's built their business

420
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,680
model like Linode has. So if you run into any trouble getting set up, Linode comes with

421
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:47,000
amazing 24 seven customer support phone ticket. They'll answer the phone and a human's going

422
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,040
to help you. Linode is dedicated to offering the best in virtualized cloud computing. If

423
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:57,120
it runs on Linux, it'll run on Linode. So go try it today. Learn for yourself. Take

424
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,920
advantage of that hundred dollar offer and support the show. You can do it all by going

425
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:09,200
to linode.com slash unplugged. That's linode.com slash unplugged.

426
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:17,280
It's that time of year again. We've got ourselves a new Linux Mint LTS 21 Vanessa. And you know

427
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:25,800
with impeccable timing, we also got a relevant bit of feedback. A boost from Tim Apple. 2,222

428
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,720
sets. New Mint is out. It rarely gets love from any of the Linux podcasts. It'd be great

429
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,280
to get you guys to live with it for a week or maybe just make Wes do it. That's my favorite

430
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,960
part of the email or the boost. Dang it. I mean, I love you Tim Apple, but throw me right

431
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,200
under that bus. Yeah, I think, you know, he wants to, he wants to hear your thoughts.

432
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:51,440
So could Mint be on a minimum viable machine? Is it the right distribution for that? There's

433
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,720
a lot of choices. And I think for the purposes of these types of machines that we're going

434
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,160
to be talking about today, we should just stick with the cinnamon flavor. I don't, you

435
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,680
know, cause there's a lot of ways you can go, but let's just talk about Mint cinnamon.

436
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,880
Are you, you boys okay with that? Agreed? Let's do it. So Linux Mint 21 is notable because

437
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:16,040
it's been rebased onto Ubuntu 2204 and it will be supported until 2027. So if you invest

438
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,960
now you get some, you get some use out of it. Yeah. And so this, I think if you're a

439
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,120
Mint user today might be worth listening to as well, but it also means if you're going

440
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,160
to buy a machine, you want it to last a few years, which was one of the requirements we

441
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,560
set this install will be good until 2027, which is about the lifetime we expect from

442
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:36,240
some of these budget machines. And so there is a lot of small improvements, but it's not

443
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,000
nothing super major to end users, but to the development team, I think some big stuff went

444
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,240
into this. It is really the release where Muffin, which is the compositor and window

445
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:54,480
manager for cinnamon saw a lot of, a lot of work. Muffin was originally based on Gnome's

446
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,140
Mutter 3.2 release. Gnome 3.2, which is like forever ago. Yeah. Well it's been forked for

447
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:07,360
like 11 years now. That's a long time to maintain something like that. Yes. And they completely

448
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:16,680
rebased it around the Gnome 3.36 code base now. So Muffin has been totally rejuvenized

449
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,120
and completely rebased. And as a result, I think you feel the performance throughout

450
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,520
Mint and there's a lot of nice little visual tweaks and improvements that are also taking

451
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:34,000
advantage of that newer code base. Linux Mint 21 also features improved Bluetooth handling.

452
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,080
They replaced the Blueberry subsystem with Blue Man. Their own Xapps have seen a lot

453
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:43,640
of improvements throughout this printing and scanning have gotten improvements. And then

454
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:46,620
there's just some general artwork and theming improvements because of the advantages they

455
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:52,640
got by updating Muffin. So there's a lot in this one. And I decided to try to get an idea,

456
00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:00,360
try to get my head around how much horsepower does a fully up to date lived in it, you know,

457
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:05,480
for a little bit Mint install actually take. And I went through a process of loading up

458
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,740
on a couple of different systems and trying to get baseline ideas of how much resources

459
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,720
I should expect. I feel like this is kind of perfect timing too because you've been

460
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,000
tweaking yourself a real nice Gnome setup, right? And kind of just, you know, on the

461
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,900
other side of the fence now, checking out how Cinnamon's been doing. Yeah, I've been

462
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:27,640
really deep down the NixOS as my desktop using Gnome. And so this was a bit of a shift going

463
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,840
from NixOS to Mint. I mean, talk about two totally different approaches to Linux, right?

464
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,560
Dramatically, right? Because NixOS is essentially a rolling OS, totally super fresh. And you

465
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,340
just mentioned how Mint went 12 years without really updating the backend compositor to

466
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:47,160
their desktop, right? So it's a real different approach, but different strokes. There's some

467
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:51,320
people who just really like the Ubuntu base and they want a really solid workstation that

468
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,520
lasts for years. And you see stuff like with their improvements to the thumbnail support

469
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:58,560
where because they've kind of been, you know, just incrementally improving, there's some

470
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,680
areas like that where it can be really nice. Yeah, it's polished. And it's interesting

471
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:10,400
to me how you get this true sense of a classic Linux desktop. For those of us who remember,

472
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,200
there are elements of the Cinnamon desktop that strike this balance between Gnome and

473
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:21,980
Plasma and it brings in stuff that was in Gnome 2, which we used to call Gnome. It has

474
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:26,820
applets that you can just like right click and you can add a system monitor to the tray.

475
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,760
You know, these things that are just sort of used to come built into Gnome 2, but then

476
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,840
like Plasma, it'll also let you download new ones and install them. The UI is a little

477
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,280
rough. It could be better, you know, it'd be nice to have click and drag and stuff like

478
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,700
that, but it's fine. It really has like the, that feel of classic Linux, like even the

479
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,340
options, the ones that it makes like a drawer where you can have, you can stack more icons

480
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:52,320
in in your tray and old notes apps that are forked from maps I used to love back in the

481
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,420
day. I don't know if maybe this is only going to make sense to certain people, but if you're

482
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:00,720
a kid of the nineties, it's like when you get an old car of the nineties, it was a car

483
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,080
in transition, right? Maybe you've updated the stereo, so it's got like a newer stereo,

484
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:10,520
but it's got the old components of a nineties dash, but it's got some new modules in it

485
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,000
that like can play MP3s that didn't even exist when the car was built. You know what I'm

486
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,400
saying? Yeah, that's what the mint experiences to me and it's not necessarily bad. It's kind

487
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,600
of a nostalgic feeling. There's a sort of comfort to it and that like I know how to

488
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,520
operate that desktop already, you know, I'm familiar with the pair time and to be honest

489
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,280
with you, there's just things about it that are simpler in a lot, in a lot of ways. And

490
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,840
with this, you know, last couple of versions of mint, they've been doing a decent enough

491
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:39,900
job of integrating flat hub and flat packs, well not flat hub, but flat packs into mint

492
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,100
and they out now with software flat hub and they feel pretty much right at home on the

493
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:48,480
mint desktop. It's very much a fully loaded Linux. So I thought, Oh, it's going to be

494
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,920
too bloated for these low end PCs because they, you know, it comes with like streaming

495
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,240
TV app, the entire LibreOffice by default, you know, at least those things that I just

496
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,240
don't do anymore. But when I, when I put it to the test and I'm talking to like loading

497
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,760
it up, got it all up to date, got logged into my Firefox, you know, got my stuff the way

498
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,800
I like it, like trying to do some work, get some stuff done after about four hours of

499
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,080
average use. Now this is without electron apps, 1.6 gigabytes of RAM being used, just

500
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:20,040
1.6 gigs of RAM. That's impressive. Right. Not bad at all. My lowest end machine had

501
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:24,640
two gigs of RAM and the average is four gigs or above at everything I looked at. A lot

502
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,400
of them have eight gigs and 16 gigs. So using 1.6 gigs of RAM, you're going to get by with

503
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,820
that. You're going to be fine. 13 gigabytes of disk space used. Every machine I looked

504
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:39,920
at had at least 16 gigs. A lot of them had 128 or more. Right. So six, I'm sorry. So

505
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,960
13 gigabytes of disk space, and that includes the kitchen sink. It's pretty impressive.

506
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:51,800
And Cinnamon's performance, it holds up. It really holds up. I actually think Mint may

507
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,320
be one of the top contenders for a low end PC after doing my testing. I didn't really

508
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,180
know how it would turn out, but I was actually very impressed. I think I'd like to compare

509
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:07,400
it to other desktops. Like POP comes to mind. I'd like to see how POP compares. I did play

510
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:13,760
around with a really minimal configured Plasma desktop, but maybe it's just my usage. I

511
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,280
didn't get it that low on RAM and disk. It ended up being more RAM and more disk with

512
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:22,080
a Plasma desktop version. So I just, I was curious. I've kind of found Cinnamon decent

513
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,660
when I'm just casually playing some Steam games and stuff. I feel like I ended up fighting

514
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:30,280
with it less than I do with some other sort of setups where it doesn't understand my full

515
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,520
screen window or wants to steal focus back or just won't hide itself at the right time.

516
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,640
They've done a good job now too for years, but even more so now of integrating Timeshift,

517
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,600
the snapshot management tool. And they've taken it over now as the primary developers

518
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:49,600
of Timeshift. And because I like to be a jerk, I decided to install Mint with ButterFS. I

519
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,720
did the manual partitioning option and then did the ButterFS option just cause they thought

520
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,760
like, well, let's see what happens when I do this. Actually it didn't boot properly

521
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,840
on my dev one that I tested. I don't know if that was why, but then if I, if I use the

522
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,920
dev one, you know, built in BIOS boot menu and manually selected the UEFI file, it would

523
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,120
boot fine. Might've just been a dev one thing. Don't know. So I decided let's try it. And

524
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:17,680
when I loaded up Timeshift, like you'd expect, but it was really good to see. Timeshift goes,

525
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,120
Hey, you've got ButterFS. Would you like me to go with ButterFS mode instead of rsync

526
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,760
mode? And so it just starts working with ButterFS snapshots right then and there. Isn't that

527
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,720
amazing? It is. And then they've built in this backend process monitor to let you know,

528
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,840
kind of like when things are happening in the backend, like a Timeshift backup. So you

529
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,560
get kind of like this really subtle notification thing. Just, Hey, there's some backend stuff

530
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:43,120
happening here. Your machine might be running a little slow. Makes me feel kind of comfortable.

531
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,600
I know I've had Mint machines in the past deployed at like friends and families or that

532
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,040
kind of thing. And you know, I don't need it to be super rock solid necessarily, but

533
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,520
like just this extra layer of protection, peace of mind. Doesn't it feel like, and you

534
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:59,480
guys tell me if you disagree, but doesn't it feel like if your backs up against the

535
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,480
wall and you've got to recommend a Linux distro to somebody who's on a little bit lower end

536
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,320
hardware and you just want it to be one of those set it and forget it things because

537
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,600
you can't help them later. Mint feels like a pretty safe one to recommend. Like it feels

538
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:16,740
like you'd give that to a person that maybe isn't super technical. It seems like with

539
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,400
some of the Xapps with like having like a thought of like, Hey, you should probably

540
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,040
do some backups or have some tools for that. Like they're thinking of a more day to day

541
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,880
user than what I'm typically designing for or designing for myself.

542
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,340
But they've also managed to include some of the retro stuff that I as a long time hardcore

543
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:37,400
Linux user love, you know, like they've got like some of the stuff that made old Linux

544
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,240
desktops the best like screensavers.

545
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,720
You talking about X-Size?

546
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,160
Yeah, X-Size is in there. They've got X screensavers in there. They're not even for better for

547
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,400
worse, right? They're not even dicking around with Wayland, right? It's just, they're honest

548
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,360
about what they are. They are tried and true Linux and they've taken ideas that have worked

549
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,800
in the past and they've kept them integrated into their desktop instead of getting rid

550
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
of them.

551
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,360
And as a team, they've just opted to take on more and more work, more and more responsibility.

552
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,680
And a couple of years ago, I thought, well, this is only going to last for so long. They're

553
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,480
going to burn out. But here we two, three years later, they're still doing it.

554
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,840
It's like you almost said something there. What's like, you know, you kind of get out

555
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:18,200
of like the Linux hipster scene a bit with Mint. You know, they're not necessarily deploying

556
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,840
the coolest thing or, you know, kind of going to shame you about not yet having switched

557
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,720
to pipeline, but, but you get, you get a nice Linux experience still.

558
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,560
Yeah. You get a machine, you turn on and it works. And tomorrow when you turn it on, it's

559
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,320
going to work. And if it doesn't, you got time shift. That's appealing, right? It's

560
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,080
kind of, in a way they're going about a different way of solving what Nix is solving for me.

561
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,240
Okay. Well, you know, as you vary it, you put on various hats and you nebulous think

562
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,480
about what happens to a future studio. What about Cinnamon in the studio?

563
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:52,400
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I what's your hesitation. I like cinnamon.

564
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,640
I just like modern plasma and modern genome more, especially my current implementations.

565
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,800
My current implementation that I've set up both my plasma and my genome setups are so

566
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,600
freaking great. I've never been happier with desktop Linux ever. It's so for me, I it's

567
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,480
not that it's not great. It's just that it's not really my style. And, um, and you seem

568
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,920
to be having a little, um, you know, renaissance with the desktop on it. It seems like you're

569
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,320
kind of back in a mode of it. Oh, I will. I'm gonna spend a little time and like tweak

570
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,440
this and really make it something I want to see again. I am. Yeah, I'm going through a

571
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:31,640
tweaking phase and I love it because there's a real unquantifiable thing that I have struggled

572
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:36,160
for years to describe on this show. And I'm right in the middle of it right now. And it

573
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:43,080
drives me crazy that as a professional communicator, I cannot communicate what this is. But I've

574
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,000
just this weekend because I was going through the mint stuff and I was testing testing different

575
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,980
hardware and I wanted to compare plasma, cinnamon and genome. So this weekend I deployed NixOS

576
00:45:53,980 --> 00:46:02,940
with plasma on the dev one. Oh, and it was good. But modern Linux. There's something

577
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:10,640
that genome shell is doing where it feels like it's all one OS and plasma feels like

578
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:17,240
a desktop window system on top of my Linux box. Like I can feel like there's the plasma

579
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,780
layer and then there's the Linux layer, which is good. In fact, I could even see why people

580
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:28,340
prefer that in some cases, right? Yeah. But when I when I'm using GNOME on modern Linux

581
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:32,560
with the latest like system, the latest kernel, latest Wayland, latest GNOME stack, latest

582
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:39,940
GTK, everything's totally like current. It feels like one cohesive OS like Mac OS does

583
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,520
or even FreeBSD does to a degree. But of course, FreeBSD doesn't once you get into the window

584
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:51,680
manager. But it's all just one smooth, slick experience that it just feels like everything's

585
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,960
communicating in a good way. And I just can't better. I can't describe it better than that.

586
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,240
But do you kind of get what I'm saying? And so I just don't get that with anything but

587
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,240
GNOME Shell right now.

588
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:05,080
Oh, that's fair. I mean, I think you have a particular sensitivity to some of the you

589
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,160
know, just how your desktop, the interactivity that you're presented with when you're sitting

590
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:13,520
at your computer trying to get work done. I wonder if that's would you say the same

591
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:17,040
in like in the studio environment or something else like that? I think it doesn't matter

592
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,640
as much there. Yeah. I think maybe you're talking about like your primary workstation.

593
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:25,400
Yeah. Yeah. So Cinnamon just didn't give me that feeling. And I don't know. I don't have

594
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,200
a great way to describe it, but I just don't get that kind of connection like I do where

595
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,080
it feels like and faster like with GNOME Shell. It feels like I'm closer to the metal. I don't

596
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:37,180
know why. Maybe because everything is running in Wayland and it's just super smooth right

597
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:43,100
now. But that's just my thing. And it wouldn't stop me from using it on a on a budget machine.

598
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:47,600
I think I think Cinnamon would do great on there. I'm curious, Brentley, I know you had

599
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:51,840
a chance to kind of take a look at I think you had a you know, a few thoughts. What was

600
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:56,840
your takeaway from the latest Mint and where you think it kind of fits in? Well, I have

601
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,840
quite a bit of history with Mint actually that I thought would be related to this these

602
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,680
topics and I think that's important to mention just before I get to my experience, my current

603
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:13,560
experience. So you mentioned low end hardware. I put Linux Mint on a piece of machinery,

604
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:21,960
I'll call it, for a friend who had an old laptop that was a four by three screen and

605
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:30,700
was a 32 bit, a machine that I couldn't buy a hard drive for to upgrade. So this thing

606
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:35,720
took an IDE, our drive was that old, but my friend was still using it and loved the thing

607
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,840
and said, hey, is there any way you can like it? It was running Windows. I don't know which

608
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,280
version, but it was extremely slow. So she said, hey, is there any way you can kind of

609
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:49,080
throw that fancy Linux thing you use on here and make it maybe last another year or two?

610
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:55,060
And the hard drive is starting to present some issues. So I ended up somehow she was

611
00:48:55,060 --> 00:49:01,800
OK with this, but we strapped like duct taped literally an external hard drive to this thing.

612
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:07,720
But it was an SSD, right? OK, it was USB, like probably one, but it still ran better

613
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:12,280
than Windows was from the failing IDE hard drive that was in there. This was probably

614
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,660
Linux Mint. I think last time I updated on that machine is Linux Mint 19 at the time.

615
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:24,040
And it just ran forever and it ran great. And she's not technical, but she just loved

616
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,000
the thing so much that when she bought a new machine that she said, no, no, get rid of

617
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:32,120
this Windows thing. I want Linux Mint on there again. And I suggested other things. She's

618
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:39,760
like, nope, I love that thing. So there's there's something to that like stability and

619
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,680
it doesn't change very often. But when it does is just to like tweak a few little things

620
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,360
to make them more stable even. You know, and so I think there's something really nice to

621
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:53,880
that. And for years at about the same time I ran Linux Mint on my ThinkPad X220. And

622
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:57,880
last episode I recommended that as the low end piece hardware that I thought was was

623
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,880
worth looking at. And back then it ran beautifully. I don't see why it wouldn't run just as beautifully

624
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:10,040
now. You have or have not ran Mint on that box on the X220. I have ran Mint. It was the

625
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:15,280
second choice that I put on there. The first choice was XFC, which I ran I think for a

626
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:22,700
year. Oh, I let's call it an upgrade upgraded to Mint. And I loved it for I think about

627
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:27,720
two years. I just love that thing. It was a bit more problematic back then. Wes, you

628
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:33,560
and I were talking about how there used to be a I think it was a right click menu or

629
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:39,360
something for Mint back then that would re reinitialize Cinnamon. Oh, sure. Right. You

630
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,920
could just restart that. Restart that real quick. Cinnamon was let's call it fresh back

631
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,200
then. Good news. Good news, gentlemen. You can actually still find that applet. If you

632
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,280
go add applets, you can still find it and add it back. It just isn't default. Yeah, it's

633
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,520
still there. I like that. I like that as like a nervous tick. You know, you type L.S. in

634
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,120
the terminal and you just hit and refresh. Well, you know, now in the Wayland world looking

635
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,880
back and thinking, wow, I could just restart the desktop and all my applications aren't

636
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,120
affected and my whole desktop remains. That's actually a pretty nice feature. This X thing

637
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:15,460
is neat. It's got some cool stuff in it. So I would say that's like my background with

638
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:21,720
Linux Mint, sort of a love relationship that slowly faded. And then I moved on to other

639
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:26,980
other things. So it wasn't meant it was you and you just had outgrown it. It's not you.

640
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,200
It's me. Yeah. And I don't mean to make it sound like, you know, if you're using Mint,

641
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,680
you're not a pro user, because I think the point the point we're trying to hit here is

642
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:38,800
it's it's it's absolutely a totally usable workstation. And it probably scales very well

643
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,820
on high end hardware as well, I would imagine. And what's really impressive about Mint for

644
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:46,880
me is two things that come to mind right away is one, the users that use it really love

645
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,200
it. And you see that in forums, you see that on Reddit, you see that all over the place.

646
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,440
Some people really love it. And I can see why and I used to be one. The other thing

647
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:01,820
I noticed is that the Linux Mint project gets a lot of donations, like a surprising amount

648
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,840
of donations. If you if you browse to their website, they they kindly list them all I

649
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:12,440
think on a monthly, monthly sort of routine. And it's very impressive how many donations

650
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:18,360
they get on a monthly basis. And I think that's a testament to how much they matter for some

651
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:25,020
people. I like this woodcarver over in our matrix room. Linux Mint is super boring. That's

652
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:30,560
why it's been my daily driver for the last five years. Absolutely rock solid. See what

653
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,920
I mean? Yeah. I don't know, Alex, have you looked at it before? Have you tried Linux

654
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:40,100
Mint before? Yeah, I did. It's been it's been a long time. And I think I agree generally

655
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:46,760
with your assessments here that Linux Mint really is the appliance of desktop Linux.

656
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:54,040
You can just set it up and forget it and just expect it to continue working for a long time.

657
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,640
And that's really an accolade in this day and age. I think one of the reasons I like

658
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,840
recommending it to for a budget Linux machine is not just because it's only for low end

659
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,460
hardware, but because you can recommend it to somebody and it's a full fledged Ubuntu

660
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:13,200
based Linux. It is not a watered down like tiny distro that has some esoteric crazy little

661
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,920
tiny desktop. It is like a proven track record team behind this desktop environment who has

662
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:23,320
been producing and like Brent touched on, clearly as a community that is supporting

663
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:27,520
it that sees a lot of value and it's their contributing value back to the Mint project

664
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,840
and it seems to be working for them. Okay, maybe this is an awkward question, but where

665
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,800
does Ubuntu MATE or something like that fit into this picture?

666
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,640
Right, MATE I think is the other question. I also could see the argument for an XFCE

667
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:45,040
desktop if it's maybe set up kind of more like in a Windows style. I don't know. That's

668
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,160
a good question.

669
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:52,880
I think they both fill a very similar space, don't they? And much like the old Steve Jobs

670
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:59,440
adage, one doesn't have to lose for the other one to win. They can both coexist. They feel

671
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,480
different niches maybe, but...

672
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:02,480
I agree.

673
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:09,680
Chris, you asked about my experience with modern Mint and I think it's much like yours.

674
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:15,600
Comparing to the Mint of yesteryear that I was used to, I just thought it looked super

675
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:22,080
familiar. I jumped in there and I felt right at home in a nostalgic kind of way and it

676
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,800
was really easy to understand where everything still was because it hadn't really changed.

677
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:32,320
I mean, there were some neat options that you mentioned with styling that was presented

678
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:36,920
in the welcome screen that I really appreciated, like highlight color that you could choose,

679
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:43,200
like little things that I think are nice touches but not too involved. You don't have to get

680
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,960
in there and really know what you're doing. So that felt like a really nice experience

681
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,280
and I thought it just felt super polished. I was really impressed.

682
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:57,200
See, that's saying something. I'm curious because I mean, you're our head of QA. I mean,

683
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,600
have you managed to break it in any odd ways yet?

684
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:05,120
I did try to install encryption through the installer because I feel like I've caught

685
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:13,240
a few distributions, not maybe test that enough, shall we say, that presents some weird like

686
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:20,840
edge cases, but I haven't found any bugs yet. And I will try a little harder, but I thought

687
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,520
that was, you know, that's something.

688
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,200
You didn't find any bugs. I don't believe it.

689
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,200
I can't either.

690
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:32,560
I was out late drinking last night, so there's that. But yeah, I thought it was really polished

691
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:41,520
and I was really impressed and I was surprised that that was my take. So there you go.

692
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:46,240
Bitwarden.com slash Linux. Go there to get started with a free trial for yourself, your

693
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:51,640
team or an enterprise. That's Bitwarden.com slash Linux. Bitwarden, quite simply, is the

694
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:57,760
easiest and the best way for you or a business to store, share and sync your sensitive data.

695
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,000
And Bitwarden is fully customizable. You can use it with your enterprise policies. You

696
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,120
can start on your machine. They've got a Flatpak available. It's, of course, available for

697
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:09,540
mobile operating systems. And the beauty is Bitwarden is open source, so you can trust

698
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:13,920
it and it is already trusted by millions of individuals and teams and organizations in

699
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:18,320
their community. It's what Wes and I use to manage our passwords. It's how we also manage

700
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:23,560
our two factor codes and other sensitive data like recovery keys for certain applications

701
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:27,760
and whatnot. It's awesome if you're a matrix user and you want to get a recovery key in

702
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,760
there, just save it right in there with your login information. And Bitwarden has slick

703
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,600
account switching support, so you can jump between a work account, you can jump between

704
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:39,440
your personal account or maybe the free software project you're working on. And things over

705
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,200
Bitwarden are always improving. In fact, rolling out this week is SCIM support. Yeah, that's

706
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,360
I call it SCIM. Maybe it's pronounced S-C-I-M, but you enterprise folks, you know what a

707
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:52,600
big deal this is. And it's becoming available this week for Bitwarden to make it easier

708
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:58,920
than ever to provision and manage users. Bitwarden just made your life so much simpler in the

709
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,240
enterprise. And for all of us out there, that new username generator continues to be a real

710
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:08,120
winner. Why not have a unique username and a unique password for every site and service

711
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:13,680
that you sign up for? Maybe you already know about how important it is to have a great

712
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,600
password manager, but does everyone in your family, to your friends, is your business,

713
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:23,220
your place of work, are they covered here? Are they using the right tool for the job?

714
00:57:23,220 --> 00:57:26,520
Maybe this is an opportunity to try it out for yourself or your business and support

715
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:31,880
the show. You can do all of that by going to bitwarden.com slash Linux. Go check out

716
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:41,360
the brand new features rolling out to Bitwarden this week. Bitwarden.com slash Linux.

717
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,360
As always, we got some amazing boosts and feedback into our email. Thank you everyone

718
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:51,800
for that. Chris and I did touch on, I think what was a little bit of a delicate topic.

719
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:58,720
So if you feel maybe a little rubbed the wrong way by the boosts, well, we hate crypto too,

720
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:03,920
it turns out. And we discussed that a little bit more in Office Hours 9. And we just want

721
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:10,280
you to know that you're still with us. We hear you. Yeah. And we have a rationale. And

722
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:15,680
we explain it. OfficeHours.hair slash 9. Well, hey, speaking of boosts, Noob Steve

723
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:24,600
boosted in with 2,222 sets. I'm a duck. D-U-K duck. Loaded with talent. Couldn't boost Coder

724
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,760
without boosting love. Aw, thanks Noob Steve. Wish I could get to one of those meetups,

725
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:36,400
but hashtag gas for Brent. Gas for Brent. That is great Steve. And I'm happy to report

726
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,600
we were starting to actually get some like details down in terms of dates on when Brent's

727
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,340
going to make it here before the road trip and all that kind of stuff. So it is happening

728
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:50,200
and your boosts are going to put gas in that tank. So we really, really appreciate that.

729
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,880
And you can't have him. He's mine. And you're going to keep him forever. I understand. Ah,

730
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,480
that's why you got that brand. We're going to, we're going to have to mount a Brent rescue

731
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:03,760
operation West. We'll break into the middle of the night. Come on Brent, you're coming

732
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:11,640
with us. And coordinate it all on Matrix. Right, right, right. There you go. Oh, oh

733
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:21,800
gosh. It's, it's a double duck day from Parrish potato. Honestly, if you find a used laptop

734
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:27,120
with at least eight gigs of RAM, you'd be able to do a decent amount of quote, regular

735
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:32,600
computer stuff. I've been playing Skyrim on a laptop I bought for 200 at work between

736
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:37,040
calls and it works just fine. Hey, that's great. I mean, Skyrim is not the most modern

737
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,640
game, but if that's the one you want to play, that's all that matters. Exactly. The golden

738
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:50,080
dragon boosts in with 1024 sets. B O O S T. Coming hot with the boost. Coming in hot with

739
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:56,760
the boost. Back in the day when wifi didn't work, I use Kumbantu and had to go right back

740
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,480
to windows. Ouch. Yeah. Then I tried again here in the last three years and it's been

741
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:08,040
a dream. Sometimes Linux is hard to love, but that tough love forces you to learn new

742
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:13,120
skills and you appreciate computing that much more. You do learn more. There is something

743
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:17,000
to that. And sometimes it's an angry learning. You're all, you're like, this is not what

744
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,160
I wanted to be learning right now, but you still learn. You know, here's my thought.

745
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:23,760
You want anything? Here's what I think. Wes, you want anything? I think I'm going to find

746
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,760
out either way. All right, Wes, I'll tell you what I think. I think it's not necessarily

747
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,880
a bad thing that it's the hard way to learn. I think you need that. You know, it's good

748
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,480
to have that option. There's easy ways to, you can't always take the easy path. That's

749
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:44,360
right. That's good. Mic Mac boosts in with, oh, oh, hey, double 1024. It's 2048 sets.

750
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:49,900
Would love to get your guys take on manage IQ. That's manage IQ.org as I'm looking for

751
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:54,060
an open source single management pain for my local compute management as well as my

752
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:58,220
cloud formation templates for both my home lab, which is a micro. Okay. It's on a three

753
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:04,000
node Raspberry Pi four cluster. And then he, he blames you for that, Chris. Okay. I am

754
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:10,400
aware of terraform. However, I've been hesitant to jump into that world. Thoughts, suggestions.

755
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:16,800
Thanks for all the content. So it's manage IQ.org for this site. And this, okay, so this

756
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:21,680
does have one kind of thing that appeals to me right off the bat. And that is you kind

757
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,640
of use one tool and you're spinning images for your box at home. You're spinning, you're

758
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,480
spinning Docker containers. You're spinning public cloud images. I see a lot of different

759
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:34,720
platforms on here, VMware, Ansible tower Foreman, of course, Kubernetes. Yeah. I've never tried

760
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,240
this though. I wonder, I wonder if our dear Mr. Alex has thought, yeah, I thought that

761
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,660
was my first thought too. So I wonder what Alex thinks of this. So manage IQ is the upstream

762
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:49,040
version of a red hat project called cloud forms. And I was sent on a training course

763
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:57,560
to learn cloud forms as a consultant four or five years ago now. And I spent the entire

764
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:02,340
week with my head in my hands. I know who pays my wages and I should probably choose

765
01:02:02,340 --> 01:02:11,080
my words carefully, but I think it's terrible. I hate it because it's for me, I like infrastructure

766
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:17,960
as code and cloud forms was everything the other direction. Everything in the interface

767
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:23,720
was click, click, click. You know, if you like gooey's manage IQ is for you, but for

768
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:29,720
me, it's just not the right tool for the job. And you mentioned Terraform in your question.

769
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:34,440
And I just think you've got the answer there already. Like the infrastructure as code tooling

770
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:40,160
is there, it's mature. If you combine it with some of the continuous integration tools that

771
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:45,540
are now available as well, you can do a lot of the clever stuff that manage IQ purports

772
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:51,560
to be able to do yourself and not be tied into a specific development cycle of a product.

773
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:57,240
That is great insight, Alex. You know, I have to channel the Nix nerds matrix room right

774
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:02,400
now just for a moment. And I didn't see that coming at all. They would say check out Nix

775
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:09,120
OS generators, one config, multiple output formats. Boys, I installed this last night.

776
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:16,120
It is so fricking cool. So you installed super easy on Nix and then you have this Nix OS

777
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:21,200
generator command and then you tell it what image based on your config on that local box

778
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:25,640
that you want. You want an Amazon EC2 image. All right. Tell it that you want a Docker

779
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:30,680
image. Okay. Hyper V. Sure. No problem. You want just a regular ISO image. You can have

780
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:36,440
that to K exec. Yep. It's got K exec. It'll output all of that different stuff and more

781
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:43,160
Proxmox, OpenStack, just a raw file, VMware file, virtual box file, vagrant file. I mean,

782
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:48,200
it does everything. And what's so cool about it, you just go about setting up your config

783
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:52,640
like you would anyways. And once you get the box just the way you likes it, you run this,

784
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,280
it outputs your image and you can tell it for which public cloud you want or what, you

785
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:59,800
know, what format you want and it's done. It's easy. You sneaky over there and generating

786
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:04,120
a whole bunch of images. Well, I was trying to come up with a way to test and I thought

787
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:08,920
I really like this base and then I can add gnome or I can add plasma. And so that's just

788
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:13,280
what I did is I created a small little base that I could then just add the different desktop

789
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,800
environment on to do my testing. So it was kind of as close to the same machine as possible.

790
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,760
Plus you could generate your own nice little sort of like live Nix environment, but with

791
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:25,760
your setup there, you know, just keep it on, keep it on your little vent toy. I hadn't

792
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:31,040
even thought of that or a VM image even where I could. Oh, that's so cool, Wes. Great idea.

793
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:34,480
You know, if you stay tuned till next week, Chris is going to reveal that he's got his

794
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:40,120
own Nix based distribution that you can download in any format you'd like for no, no, no, no,

795
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,560
it's going to be Jupiter OS. We're going to come full circle from the start of the network.

796
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:51,280
We actually started the podcast network originally was actually a Linux based OS initiative called

797
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:56,000
Jupiter. I did not know this and it was, you know, don't call it a distro. It was a Linux

798
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,720
operating system. We were very Brian and I were really very insistent about that. And

799
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,360
you just like cat slash dev slash Linux action show. Yeah. Well, no, not yet, but we would

800
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,560
have built that in. I mean, come on. We would have definitely had our show automatically

801
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:13,480
subscribed on the desktop. Let's be honest when that's what happened is we started podcasting

802
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,560
and we realized, man, we're way better at podcasting than we are building a desktop.

803
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:23,420
And so we stopped and thankfully the elementary OS guys continued on. And so you got Jupiter

804
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,480
OS and all of that kind of stuff, which was inspired from some of that work that we did

805
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,840
early on. I'm just inspired. I'm not saying just inspired. And yeah, we did the podcast

806
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:34,080
thing. So it all worked out. So it would be full circle now for me to start publishing

807
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:38,800
my own OS. That would be, that would be kind of perfect. You just need to do JP coin next

808
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:43,960
and then you're all set. Oh, how else are you going to donate to get your eyes? Well,

809
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:51,380
you know, I'm a big crypto guy. I love crypto. So again, office hours nine, we, we address

810
01:05:51,380 --> 01:06:00,800
this quite in depth. I like gene being boosted in again. Uh, 1000 sats package formats matter

811
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:05,280
because it's a pain in the butt to deal with all the variety because you can't just pick

812
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,560
one or two. Even when using gooey's like pop as an example, you can't install snaps or

813
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:16,880
things from homebrew via the package pop shop. Yet I want stuff from both so that everything

814
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,920
is installed from somewhere that checks for updates. Sadly, homebrew requires manual updating

815
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:28,800
unless you drop to cron. So this is in response to a topic I kind of just lamented last week,

816
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:37,520
which was why our package management and tooling and application still such a big deal. I mean,

817
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:41,660
I realized stuff never dies in the Linux community. We still debate system D as well. But today

818
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:49,560
as we record the number one post on our Linux with 725 up boats, 282 comments is canonical

819
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:54,240
should ditch snap, embrace flat pack and improve apt. And then of course you can probably imagine

820
01:06:54,240 --> 01:07:05,240
how that discussion devolves nuanced. It is informed. Yes. You nailed it. West. It's so

821
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:10,740
annoying. Like why won't it die? It's funny too, because like, you know, at, at meetups,

822
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:14,000
just hanging out with like people. I know they use Linux. It does not organically come

823
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,480
up hardly at all. You don't fight over packaging. It's totally an internet fight thing, but

824
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,560
gene being is right in the sense that I think it does come up because it clearly is something

825
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:32,080
that matters to people. Gene being also wrote in for a double boost 7,000 sets. Oh, I combined

826
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,700
it cause he had a double send in there. So that is a, but that's a great, that's near

827
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:43,620
baller boost. That's close. Not quite though. Right? Close. They write again, the XPS change

828
01:07:43,620 --> 01:07:48,600
you talked about sounds like how Lenovo does things where you can order many laptops with

829
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:53,920
Ubuntu pre-installed Dell also offers multiple latitude laptops with Ubuntu pre-installed,

830
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:59,120
at least if you go through a rep, I've just taken advantage of this at work for some special

831
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:05,000
use laptops with built in Intel broadband modems that work out of the box. Buying with

832
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:10,240
compatibility is different in Linux. You can't read a box or Amazon description to know if

833
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:16,960
it works with distro X. You can know that for a Mac or windows system. That's a fair

834
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,440
point. You do have a little bit easier time there. I can't argue that. I do have good

835
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:24,720
news though. Just looking at the Dell.com slash Linux page, it does look like they've

836
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:29,200
added the new XPS. At least I think it's hard to tell what the XPS these days, cause I think

837
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:33,800
they make both models available at the same time, the previous one and the current one,

838
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:39,960
but they have one labeled the new XPS 13 plus and it comes with a 12th gen Intel processor.

839
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:45,200
And I think this is it. And they just have three options, windows 11 home pro or Ubuntu

840
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:49,680
LTS. So I think maybe they were just updating the site and we had people sound the alarm

841
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:56,440
bells. I think it's okay. Next up we have gene being with a triple boost.

842
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:06,880
2674 sets. I think that might just be a double leet sets, right Chris?

843
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:07,880
Double leet.

844
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:12,600
They right. I love our clone for getting stuff out of other cloud services and into next

845
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,640
cloud with local disks, AKA not object storage behind next cloud. All the timestamps from

846
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:20,200
Dropbox and other places are preserved.

847
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:24,840
I kind of love the idea. Like maybe you're not a huge fan of the next cloud sinking client,

848
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,640
but you something great like our clone and just, you can still get, you know, benefits

849
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,480
of the next cloud experience, but just kind of take that part into yourself.

850
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,360
Yeah. I'm also going to give a plug for my pick last week that lets you do local encryption

851
01:09:34,360 --> 01:09:37,400
before you upload it to the cloud. Might check that out too.

852
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:42,280
Yeah. Alex, I was for a bit of context here since you were probably flying or doing some

853
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,760
meetups or something in a different continent at the time. I was mentioning how you turned

854
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:50,760
me onto our clone and it's changed my life in a little tiny way. So thank you for that.

855
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:51,760
Very welcome.

856
01:09:51,760 --> 01:10:02,920
Next, we have a great booster, Gene Bean for quad booze.

857
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:07,820
Not only did Gene Bean become the number one supporter for this episode with the amount

858
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:11,360
of boosting that he did, but I think, you know what boys, that's technically a baller

859
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:12,360
boost too.

860
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:17,000
Cause I'm a back home baller. If I want something, I just holler.

861
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,740
Gene Bean writes, I got a little excited sending boosts this episode, which is I think clearly

862
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:26,880
true to make myself feel better about sending so many questions and comments. Here's an

863
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,680
extra bit of leetness for Brent's gas tank.

864
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:35,380
Thank you, Gene Bean. Thank you for your support on this episode. That is, you are definitely

865
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:40,360
our top supporter this week. And also thank you everybody who participated in boosting

866
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:44,280
for Brent to get him down to the studio for some projects that we have. If we can ever

867
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:49,640
save them from Alex's house continued to boost in. We appreciate your support there. Also,

868
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:55,280
we recently were sending some splits to the open stats project, which has been contributed

869
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,640
to free software projects. That money has now been contributed several hundred dollars

870
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,480
there. So thank you everybody. Congratulations. And then also one of the things that's fantastic

871
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:08,040
about these stats that you boost in is we don't sell them.

872
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,360
We kind of consider them maybe as a long-term investment. So it's a way for you to give

873
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:16,520
us something at a small amount of value today that will continue to work for the network.

874
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:21,080
But instead of just sitting there, not doing anything, we actually put them to work. They

875
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:26,760
help us open up bigger channels and they helped me get Brent's node up and going with multiple

876
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:31,440
channels. And just recently, which is a big milestone for me, I was able to open a direct

877
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:36,360
channel to the fountain FM node, which is just a lot more efficient in terms of routing

878
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:42,360
and whatnot. So the boosts also are being put to work today to help us participate in

879
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:46,560
that peer-to-peer network even more. And it's just kind of a great way that we can actually

880
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:51,320
do something with those stats instead of just letting them sit there, which is also fine.

881
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:59,080
But you know, we don't got stuff. All right. We have a boost in from Prozac, a 1999 boost

882
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:05,760
for Brent's gas fund. And he says, I keep independent media alive. Go podcasting.

883
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,600
I think that should be my bumper sticker. And it feels like maybe I might need a bigger

884
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:18,560
gas tank pretty soon. Well, you got to drive back to Brent. Don't remind him. So listen,

885
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,860
we're doing something just as this is a new segment. And again, we talked about this more

886
01:12:21,860 --> 01:12:24,840
in office hours, but we're going to start tightening the segment up just a little bit

887
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:30,320
to kind of keep the show moving. So we will be implementing a 1000 minimum sat to get

888
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:36,080
your boost read on the show. But we do read 100 percent of every boost that come in every

889
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,600
single one of them, which I actually can't make that claim for email just because the

890
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,480
volume difference. But we do want to keep things moving. So we will have a one K and

891
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:46,240
above limit for boost to be read on the show. But every now and then, since we read all

892
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:51,680
of them, we'll pull some forward. Crypto Kyle this week had one of those. He boosted with

893
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,560
five hundred stats. So just, you know, about half under the minimum. But I wanted to read

894
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:01,740
it anyways. He said, I picked up a Lenovo P50 for just under 400 dollars USD. Super

895
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:08,680
powerful with a built in M2000M GPU, a Xeon processor, actually pretty great power and

896
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:14,120
performance. And it runs NixOS great with ZFS on route with KD Plasma. That seems like

897
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:17,760
a nice choice for something like a workstation alternative. You don't need to be super portable

898
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:20,960
necessarily. But do you want to move it around? Those are nice machines. You got to figure

899
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:26,800
West with that Xeon CPU in there to probably do probably some virtualization loads. I mean,

900
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,920
I bet that thing works. I mean, I wouldn't bet it's the best battery life. But if that's

901
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:34,400
not your goal, I think that's fine. And then we got a bunch of thank you boost. Two hundred

902
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:39,160
and ten sats, six hundred sats, fifty sats, ten sats, six hundred sats from Ibuki, Resta

903
01:13:39,160 --> 01:13:45,920
Casta Versta, Burji, User 64 1 and Authorities. You didn't get any of those right. But I know

904
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,000
I did not. I did not. I absolutely did not. Thank you, everyone. Also, who streams in

905
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,160
the sats in the background. We appreciate you. I just had you know, I'm trying to keep

906
01:13:55,160 --> 01:14:00,400
it tight. I love trying to try to keep on moving. I'm doing my best, living my best

907
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:04,560
podcast life. But we really appreciate everybody that came in. And those of you who also just

908
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,720
stream them in the background. Thank you very much. Go get a new podcast app, new podcast

909
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:15,080
apps dot com. We love Fountain, Castamatic and Podverse are our favorites. And then the

910
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:18,480
nerds like to boost in with boost CLI. I don't know if we got to boost CLI. Did we get it?

911
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,600
I don't know if we did this week. But then you've got to change your podcast client.

912
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:27,840
Also Breeze, B-R-E-E-Z dot technology. And one day everyone's going to have this stuff

913
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:31,840
figured out and I won't have to sit here and I won't be the only one talking about this.

914
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:36,680
I do want to mention this is going to be on the longer side. But just to wrap this up,

915
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:41,200
when we started talking about boosts on this show, there were 4000 podcasts on the Lightning

916
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:48,840
Network. Now we are quickly approaching 8000. We've nearly doubled, not saying we did it,

917
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:52,080
but the amount of podcasts have nearly doubled on the Lightning Network since we started

918
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:56,480
talking about it here on the show. It's growing like crazy. So why not grab a new app and

919
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:02,800
try it out? Okay, I'm pretty proud of this pic this week, guys. You ever just need yourself

920
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,880
a little FTP? It's pretty hard to come by these days. I try not to admit it, but yeah.

921
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:13,200
The old file transfer protocol, it got the job done, Wes. It got the job done. But you

922
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:18,400
know, running FTP, that's for your dad and well, me actually back in the day. But now

923
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:25,840
you can do it quickly on your desktop with user mode FTP. And it's just a simple, clean

924
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:31,000
graphical app that you load up, you set things like the username, the password, the directory

925
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,960
you want to share, and which particular protocol FTP, FTPS, or SFTP that you want to use. Then

926
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:42,520
you click start, and you got yourself a little temporary FTP server on your box that you

927
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:47,120
can connect to to transfer apps, files, data, whatever. Super easy and quick.

928
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:51,600
This feels like a weird full circle thing where this is almost like an Android app that

929
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,440
would do this, you know, on your phone, just a quick little FTP server, but now it's a

930
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:59,160
desktop Linux. I mean, yeah, I think there are definitely apps like this for Android.

931
01:15:59,160 --> 01:16:03,600
So I but this is for your desktop. And you know, this is kind of for me strikes the perfect

932
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,800
balance because I don't really need an FTP server anymore ever. And when I do, I don't

933
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,400
really want to set one up. But this is so easy. Why not? And nice to see for the folks

934
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:17,720
who may be your concern. They do have FTP S and SFTP. We'll have a link in the show

935
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:22,560
notes. I think I might just have a bonus pic that I found late last night. You want to

936
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:24,560
hear this one?

937
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:29,200
Bring on us. So I think good ever happens after midnight, dude. Well, it depends. It's

938
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:35,360
always after midnight somewhere. Right, Alex? Yes. What time is it? What day is it? Right

939
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,960
now? Actually, right.

940
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:43,960
As some or most of you may know, our new website is coming along really well. We would love

941
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,560
to get some testing there. So if you can go to Jupiter broadcasting dot net and try to

942
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:52,080
break it or think of some new features, that would be awesome. And there's a little GitHub

943
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:57,400
link there. And that brings me to this new app that I found. I was noticing because we

944
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:02,040
have so many great people who are contributing to the new website. It wasn't enough for me

945
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:07,880
to sit down multiple times a day at the computer and get all the notifications of commits and

946
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:11,640
issues and discussions and things like that. So I needed a mobile app. But as some of you

947
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:17,660
may know, I lean very heavily on after it. And I wanted to see if there were any open

948
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:24,160
source ways to interact with GitHub. And I found an amazing one that I think is worth

949
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:30,600
trying. It's called and Wes, I'll see if you've maybe used this before. It's called Octodroid.

950
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:36,920
The way I chose it was that it's extremely active on its own GitHub page. And it seems

951
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:43,080
like it's got some amazing features. So I'm brand new to it. But it has been working fabulously

952
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:48,000
for me at least in the last 12 hours. So I think people should check it out.

953
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,120
Hey, looks handy. I don't know that I need more notifications in my life. But if I did,

954
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:57,400
this seems nice. I love I love when it's on after it as well. You know, it's easy to get

955
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:02,360
and it's open source. Why not put a link to that in the notes as well. All them notes

956
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:11,760
over at Linux unplugged.com slash 470. Hello. Hello. Remember how we were just planning

957
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:17,240
episode 400? And that seemed like a lot of work. And now should we start fermenting something?

958
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:22,360
Yeah, we better. Yeah, we better start brewing now is what I'm saying. You know, who let's

959
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:26,600
worry about it after the road trip road trip first. Then we'll worry about episode 500.

960
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:32,300
I think we got a little time deal Linux unplugged.com slash JPL to get your name in that hat so

961
01:18:32,300 --> 01:18:37,080
you can come hang out with us. Of course, we'll also meet down there near the JPL area

962
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:41,960
if you can make it a JPL. And we've got road stops, several of them, like four or five

963
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,760
of them along the way. And I'm always kind of putting my feelers out there and hearing

964
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:50,800
where you're all at. Today was kind of a sweet day, I have to say, because within 24 hours,

965
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:55,560
I heard from two long timers that have been listening since the very start of Linux action

966
01:18:55,560 --> 01:19:00,200
show. And one of them I'm going to get to meet on the West Coast tour. But one of them

967
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:04,560
lives in the Midwest. But it was neat to get to connect on Matrix last night. That's lovely.

968
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:08,160
And talk to them. So, oh, man, you guys have really got me, Johnson, for the meetup. So

969
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:12,080
I'm looking forward to that. Meetup.com slash Jupiter broadcasting for all that. You can

970
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:18,120
also just connect with us every single Sunday. We do the show live on Sundays at noon, Pacific

971
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:22,320
three p.m. Eastern over at Jupiter Dot Tube. And we have an open mumble room. You can join

972
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:26,200
our virtual log, hang out with us. We like to chat during the show during the pre and

973
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:30,800
post show. It's a great way to kind of get kind of a taste of the meetup experience,

974
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,000
but from the comfort of your own home. So join us. We have it in your time at Jupiter

975
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:38,960
broadcasting dot com slash calendar. But of course, I know you all can't make it. See

976
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:44,520
you next week. Same bad time, same bad station. So, of course, we do have Linux unplugged

977
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,600
dot com slash subscribe. That way you can get the episode every single week when it

978
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:54,640
comes out like a do. We never miss a week. And of course, go grab Linux action news loaded

979
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:58,620
with deets. You didn't hear tons of things going on in the world of Linux and open source.

980
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:04,200
We cover it every single week. Linux action news dot com. As for us, well, that just about

981
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:09,000
wraps it up. You can find all of our resources over at Linux unplugged dot com and go check

982
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:14,880
out that new test website. Let us know what you think. Jupiter broadcasting dot net. Thank

983
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:18,840
you to our members who helped make the show possible in some plug core dot com. And we'll

984
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:36,280
see you right back here next week.

985
01:20:48,840 --> 01:21:02,720
I enjoyed that I'd still like to get more submissions on budget PCs, so do feel free

986
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:08,320
to still send them into the show at the contact page or or however you likes. I think it's

987
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:13,120
still more we can get to. You know, we did get some some extras that I you know, we couldn't

988
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:18,040
squeeze into the show, but I thought it would be worth mentioning them quickly. Dave suggested

989
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:26,600
an HP MT 20 or MT 21 says my four below and suggestions those they are pro books that

990
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:31,320
were marketed as thin clients. So there's another thin clients recommendation. Hey,

991
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:37,880
I'm a pro. I want a pro book. Yeah, well under $100 on eBay, apparently. And one of the best

992
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:45,920
reasons to choose it was all of the different. My brain is fried all of the different plugs

993
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:51,520
and things like connectivity and ports. Thank you, Chris. Yes, thank, thank, thanks. Cool.

994
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:59,240
And so that's one. We also got a recommendation for a $400 refurbished horizon mini PC, which

995
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:06,720
sounds great. That's that'd be a great machine, right? ThinkPad T for 80s came in hot, which

996
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,200
I'm I'm leaning towards one on the desk behind you. Alex is going to sell his if you want

997
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:15,240
it. Well, it's red. It's red hot property. I might get in trouble if I did that. We know

998
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:19,040
the T for 80 is a solid machine, though. That's one that we've had direct experience with.

999
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:26,200
Yeah, Matt also has a Linux build from a bunch of parts for sub $300, which sounds pretty

1000
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:32,120
sweet. If you want to do it yourself a little, I like it. Turns out if you try hard enough,

1001
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:40,160
you can. And the last suggestion was a ThinkCenter M 91 P Tower PC. I'm not familiar with the

1002
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:44,580
ThinkCenters as much, but I know that they have been certifying the more recent ThinkCenters

1003
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:50,960
with Linux. That's a good sign. I mean, this one sounds pretty great. Actually, I 7 2600

1004
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:58,480
with 16 gigs of RAM and an IPS display and apparently open Sousa. Oh, hey, IPS display

1005
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:01,520
would be nice. You know, I have to say, we didn't talk about it this week, but we covered

1006
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:07,160
it in Linux action news. I think the Lenovo situation was clocked wrong. It sounds like

1007
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:13,440
they had a series of bad events that caused things to go slower than they want with their

1008
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:17,220
Linux initiative last year. You can probably imagine some of its supply chain related.

1009
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:24,380
Some of it was driver issues and other things. But we played the clips in land, but something

1010
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:31,080
like 36 different Lenovo machines are being certified to run Linux this year. Can you

1011
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:37,880
believe that? That's crazy. That seems like a good sign. It's episode 252. If you're curious,

1012
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:41,920
I will put an extra plug. It was a great episode. I really enjoyed it over breakfast the other

1013
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:47,080
day. So thank you to gentlemen. Oh, stop. Thank you. No, I can do that. It was a blush.

1014
01:23:47,080 --> 01:24:14,080
Well, you were already blushing because it's hot. But now you're blushing more. It's so
