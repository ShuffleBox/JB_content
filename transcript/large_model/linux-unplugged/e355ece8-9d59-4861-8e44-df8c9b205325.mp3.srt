1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
We came across a little tool called Sokae, which we will have linked in the show notes,

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,040
that looks at your bash history, goes through everything you've been doing on your box,

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,240
and generates a pie chart or a bar graph, whatever you like, you have some options,

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,480
of your most frequently used commands.

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,920
And we thought, this probably reveals a lot about how we use our boxes.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,520
So we're going to run it on our systems here.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,360
We'll have a link to it if you want to try it on yours.

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,520
And we're going to reveal our top used commands on our Linux systems.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,800
Do you want to go first, Wes?

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,440
Yeah, okay, you can definitely tell that I'm just using the terminal as a file manager,

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,400
because my top three are ls, cd, vim, and then followed by cat.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,640
After that, though, there's git and docker-compose, so it gets a little more interesting.

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,320
Oh, man, mine are so embarrassing compared to yours.

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,040
Okay, all right, well, you can definitely tell I'm into my arch,

15
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,680
because my number one command by like a lot is yay, the package manager.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,120
Well, you have to run it like what, six, 10 times a day to be sure?

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,760
You got it.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,200
And then YouTube DL, which is what I use for clips, and then SSH,

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,640
which is just me logging into everything else.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,840
This is embarrassing.

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,400
Hello, friends, and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,360
My name is Chris.

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,400
My name is Wes.

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,200
Hello, Wes.

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,160
I like the tactical gear, color matched and everything.

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,320
This episode is brought to you by the all new aCloud Guru, the leader in learning for the cloud,

27
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Linux and other modern tech skills.

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,440
Hundreds of courses, thousands of hands-on labs, get certified, get hired, get learning

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,000
at aCloudGuru.com.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,120
Well, coming up on this week's episode, it's our worst idea yet.

31
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,200
I don't know what we're thinking.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,720
We thought we'd have some fun, I guess.

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,400
We're going to hand out the login info to one of our servers to our chat room.

34
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,720
And then whoever owns the box first gets a prize.

35
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,760
We're going to have more details later on in the show.

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,600
We're going to call it the unplugged hacker games just because we're having fun as we

37
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,280
approach episode 400.

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,360
So we have the hacker games coming up.

39
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,400
We have some community news to get into, including how the heck does archive.org actually

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,040
run and manage to archive the entire internet and some feedback.

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,800
But before we get to any of that, I have one line of duty that I must carry out before

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,120
we proceed any further.

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,600
And that is to say time-appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
Hello, Virtual Lug.

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,120
Well, nice to have you all in there.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,640
So I wanted to get into something before we get into the news, and that is just maybe

47
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,920
a call out, a request to the audience, perhaps, as we approach episode 400.

48
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
Stay a while and listen.

49
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,400
If you know us, you know that we like to do something to celebrate the milestones like

50
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:50,800
400.

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,040
We don't do it all the time, but every now and then we like to get we like to have some

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,760
fun.

53
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,960
And we thought, what could be some ways that we could really enjoy ourselves leading up

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,480
to episode 400?

55
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,760
And there's one topic that Wes and I have always wanted to do on the show.

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,320
We've talked about it 100 different times, but we've never really found the right partner

57
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,600
to work with, if you will, quote unquote, using that term loosely.

58
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,360
But we've always wanted to do an episode on Linux and brewing beer.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
We'd really love to go hands on, if possible.

60
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,000
We'd love to make some episode 400 beer that we drink later on at some point and use

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,920
Linux to make it happen.

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,560
It's not required that we go hands on, but it sure would be fun.

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,080
And we're looking for somebody who's actively brewing beer.

64
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,360
I mean, I've heard from people who have brewed beer, but we're looking for somebody who's

65
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,800
actually doing it right now.

66
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,400
Maybe even has a brewery.

67
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,960
Maybe not.

68
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,240
But somebody we could engage with, learn from, and then maybe share their story on the show.

69
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,560
And if we could end up with episode 400 series beer, too, boy, that'd be a lot of fun.

70
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,080
So we got we got five weeks.

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,960
May not be impossible if you or someone you know is actively brewing beer and uses Linux

72
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,840
to make it possible.

73
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,280
Get in touch with us at linuxunplug.com contact or hit us up on Telegram or Twitter.

74
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,760
Or, Wes, I should also mention, if anybody knows how the hell to use the brewery, that

75
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,240
that automated brewing machine, also let us know.

76
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,520
Oh, the brewery.

77
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,600
Yeah, we have it sitting out in the garage.

78
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,280
Technically runs Android, which is kind of Linux.

79
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,640
I've heard that's Linux.

80
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,160
Yeah, it's kind of Linux, right?

81
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,960
Kind of.

82
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,400
So anyways, let us know linuxunplug.com contact or Telegram or the Twitters would be fine

83
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,200
as well.

84
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,640
But looking ahead at something that's also coming just a few weeks out, that's GNOME

85
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:40,400
Shell 40 and one of the things they're launching in GNOME Shell is fully realized gesture support.

86
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,960
And I thought maybe we'd just zoom in on this one feature for this episode with the gesture

87
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,760
support in 40, you can manage running apps, you can change your workspace, you can bring

88
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,480
up the overview.

89
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,120
It's they've taken the gesture support that GNOME Shell has had for a while and they've

90
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,600
really rounded it out and completed it.

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,120
And assuming you're all into that kind of thing, which a lot of people are, there is

92
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
one major problem.

93
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,960
It does not work on X11.

94
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,640
There are technical reasons, but it is a reminder of why X11 just needs to go.

95
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,560
Get that out of here.

96
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,760
Get it out of here.

97
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,400
But one clever developer figured out a way to bring these touch gestures to the X11 version

98
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,760
of GNOME Shell and it really opens up the desktop to a quick and efficient way to navigate

99
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,320
the UI.

100
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,080
And so I've decided as I'm kind of prepping my space right now.

101
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,800
I am I am making way for GNOME Shell 40 because I have been a plasma head for a while and

102
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,200
I want to switch over to Shell 40 when it lands.

103
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,520
So what I have done is I have dusted off and I'm charging it right now an old Apple Magic

104
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,400
trackpad because I guess these work pretty well now.

105
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,080
Oh, look at you.

106
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:50,640
I know, right?

107
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,240
I'm thinking I'm going to do to I'm going to do the two mouse setup.

108
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,320
I'm going to have a regular mouse on my right and then I'll have my trackpad on my left.

109
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,640
It's a setup I've used in the past for video editing and also kind of helps with RSI because

110
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,400
I use my right hand less this way and I can manipulate the UI with my left hand and I can

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
click and point with my right hand.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,840
So you kind of get the best of both worlds.

113
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,520
How well that Apple Magic trackpad is supported.

114
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,480
That's what I'm kind of wondering if anybody in the Mumble room has tried these before

115
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,440
with Linux.

116
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,120
Yes, I have indeed.

117
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,840
So the trackpad one works pretty well.

118
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,480
Number one.

119
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,200
OK, yeah, I've done pretty well.

120
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,520
What about the new Magic trackpad two?

121
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,040
I haven't tried it yet.

122
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,480
Yeah, but the one works well.

123
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,760
The only thing I have from time to time, it does not auto connect.

124
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,800
So you will have to manually connect it via Bluetooth.

125
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,320
So I was thinking I do wired.

126
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,120
I was thinking because I did read that some people get it working with Bluetooth but get

127
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,960
disconnect issues, but it seems to work 100 percent of the time wired.

128
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,680
I'm fine with that.

129
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,560
This is a desktop.

130
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,880
So that's, you know, and this is I just want to try this out.

131
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,080
And I've recently realized that I am very much a desktop guy.

132
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,680
I really like desktops.

133
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,280
And so I thought about it.

134
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,440
It's like, well, maybe I could just do a few things to take what I like about the laptop

135
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,400
experience and bring it to the desktop and make it even better.

136
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,320
So now I have like a full desktop keyboard and mouse, but I also will have the trackpad

137
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,120
gestures and all of that.

138
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,400
Does that mean you're going to buy like a really bad webcam to add on there, too?

139
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:18,560
Nice.

140
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,840
I have like a Logitech C920 hooked up, but it is starting to feel old, but they really

141
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,360
haven't surpassed it much.

142
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,480
But you know what I mean, Wes?

143
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,440
Like I'm preparing the way, like I'm getting myself all set up.

144
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,720
I got my monitors arranged the way I'm going to want them for GNOME Shell.

145
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,600
Getting myself ready.

146
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,720
My body is prepared.

147
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,240
My workspace is prepared.

148
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,040
I don't know if this is like a I mean, obviously, there's a lot of really good stuff.

149
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,360
It seems like GNOME 40 has a lot of nice things.

150
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,920
But does this speak a little bit to the GNOME, you know, riding the edge of GNOME experience

151
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,280
that either have to be upset by it or like you're doing, choose to really embrace it

152
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,240
and plan ahead?

153
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Yeah, I'm wondering, Carl, if your thoughts have evolved at all on the horizontal workspace

154
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,640
layout and some of the recent things that the GNOME project like Alan Day made a post

155
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,600
saying where they're they're going to commit to multi monitor support and they're going

156
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,120
to continue to work on that.

157
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,040
Have you have your thoughts on GNOME 40 and and if you're going to stick with the more

158
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,200
traditional layout stuff, is that evolved at all?

159
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,600
I haven't read through all of the updates yet.

160
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,200
I'm still a little skeptical.

161
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,320
I mean, I know they're going to try and work towards it and they're they're listening to

162
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,440
the feedback, at least.

163
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,600
I'll definitely give it a shot when it comes out.

164
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,600
But we time will tell if it's something I can actually get used to or not with the different

165
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,640
different things.

166
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,040
What I've noticed is that every time I bring up, you know, the spatial relationship of

167
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,160
the desktop, they like that they're focusing on the spatial relationship between elements

168
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,320
on the desktop, like the app drawer and the workspace switcher.

169
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,560
But I've been more focused on the spatial relationship between different workspaces.

170
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,960
And those aren't the same thing.

171
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,960
Hello, Poby.

172
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
Good to see you.

173
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:53,440
I don't think I've gotten your take on the GNOME 40 shell changes.

174
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,160
We've been chatting about them on the show, kind of preparing ourselves for it.

175
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,840
I was just talking about how I'm setting up a rig to get ready for it and I'm going to

176
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,480
jump in and try out the new layouts.

177
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,720
What are your takes on it?

178
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,260
Is this is this the time when the Linux desktop is passing you by or are you on board to try

179
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,280
out the new the new changes?

180
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,800
Well, I'm on Ubuntu, so it's a bit difficult to try it out unless I nuke and pave and go

181
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,120
with some other distro right now.

182
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,320
What are your thoughts on that?

183
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,400
So I could give it a go on one of my other machines.

184
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:28,800
But what I don't think that will help me because what I really need to do is play with it

185
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,200
on my primary machine where I have multiple monitors.

186
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:40,320
Because like Carl, you know, I need to feel what it feels like using it on a daily basis.

187
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,240
And I'm not there yet because I need to use this as a functioning machine.

188
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,520
I can't really use pre-release software on this right now.

189
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,520
Yep.

190
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,920
I thought about doing the pre-release thing myself, been tempted a couple of times.

191
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,960
We did load it up at one point to just kind of get an idea of what was coming so we could

192
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
talk about it.

193
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,840
But I didn't want to I didn't really want to base my whole opinion on it yet.

194
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:07,000
Well, kind of in this same realm, talking about this this hardware, believe it or not,

195
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,720
in kind of a fixing the barn doors after the cow comes home, traditional open source style,

196
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,840
the Apple Touch Bar on MacBooks may actually see at least a glimmer of hope of getting

197
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,520
upstreamed in 2021.

198
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,160
It's actually happening that that that little touch bar, even though I think now it's rumored

199
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,160
it's going away, we may have at least some basic functionality soon.

200
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,280
Released out on Saturday by independent developer Ronald Sklar was the latest reverse engineered

201
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,520
open source driver code that gets the touch bar and the Apple light sensor support working

202
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,320
for MacBook Pro 13 inch 14 inch and 15 inch models.

203
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,440
Yeah, light support light sensor support is particularly interesting because that's part

204
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,820
of the solution that macOS uses to adjust the screen brightness.

205
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:01,000
Now the Apple iBridge that T one security trip driver is also needed for interfacing

206
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,600
with the eyesight web camera and the light sensor and the fingerprint sensor.

207
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,040
At the moment, the Linux driver coverage is focused on the touch bar and the light sensor.

208
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,760
Yeah, so no webcam and no touch ID.

209
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,200
But the driver is coming along.

210
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:25,680
And while it's a slow pace, it means that people who are transitioning to preserving

211
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,920
or archiving these machines or rebuilding and repurposing these machines are going to

212
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
have support.

213
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,000
And that I think is kind of nice because as these are sort of probably being taken out

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,600
of production with the M one over time now, and it won't be all at once, Linux will be

215
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,320
ready to support the systems that want to stay around and stay relevant.

216
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,800
That's I love seeing that kind of thing.

217
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,120
And unfortunately, that seems to be about where our MacBook support is shining best

218
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,400
these days.

219
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Not so bad, though, really, you know, because if you buy a Mac, you're buying a Mac to run

220
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,240
macOS.

221
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,700
But if you're buying a used Mac, it's really nice to be able to run Linux on it.

222
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
It's not an ideal situation.

223
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,280
Obviously, it'd be great if hell, it'd be great if Apple upstream drivers for heck's

224
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,760
sake, Wes.

225
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,800
But you know, as far as a number two, being able to run these machines years after Apple

226
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,640
abandoned them, I think is hugely not only useful from just like an economic standpoint,

227
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,480
but also just from preventing environmental waste.

228
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,640
Now, it'd be very, very entertaining to me if there was somehow a touch bar revolution

229
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:33,880
on the Linux side of things after the Apple ecosystem wasn't so fond.

230
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:40,280
Linode.com slash unplugged go there to get a $100 for 60 days on a new account.

231
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,080
That's, that's really remarkable.

232
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,280
$100 in credit will really let you try out Linode and see what it can do.

233
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,720
That's what's great is that kind of shows some confidence by Linode.

234
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,600
And one of the things I think is great about Linode is all of the distributions they support

235
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,080
in a, in a moment, we're going to open up one of our boxes for the chat room to log

236
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
into.

237
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,960
And we're confident that we'll have the performance necessary to actually make that possible

238
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:10,120
because every machine has super fast SSDs, 40 gigabit connections to the internet, and

239
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,120
one of 11 choice data center locations to choose from.

240
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,000
And one of the great things about Linode beyond just the fact that I trust them with our infrastructure

241
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,080
is I trust where they're going long term.

242
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
They're independently owned.

243
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,880
They have been since 2003.

244
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,900
That's a big deal if you're going to rely on them for your business or for even your

245
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,640
personal stuff.

246
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,520
And they've really honed in what they do well.

247
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,820
They focused on it and they make it just right.

248
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,820
They do it right.

249
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,000
They do the best virtualized Linux computing out there.

250
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,200
You can try it too and see it, see it for yourself, see how them being in this game

251
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,800
for so long has given them a certain head over everyone else.

252
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,960
Get out at linode.com slash unplugged and get that $100, 60 day credit.

253
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,960
They're independently owned and they're founded on a love for Linux.

254
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,440
And I love that about them.

255
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,960
And we run a ton of our infrastructure on there.

256
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:05,320
So I can recommend if you need to build a website or set up a backend for a chat system

257
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,560
or maybe run a real time chat app like mumble, Linode is going to work for you.

258
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,040
But even a static website might be the way to go, maybe for a blog or maybe for a resume.

259
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,360
I will toss a link in our show notes at linux unplugged dot com slash 395 to a really well

260
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,040
done write up in the Linode documentation area on choosing the right static website

261
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,040
for you and kind of the pros and cons, the theme options for the different ones and then

262
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,640
a comparison of things like Jekyll and Hugo and well a bunch of other ones and then how

263
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,100
to use them so you can get an idea of what the flavor would be managing it and what front

264
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,760
ends they have to even manage them if they have them.

265
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,760
It's all just kind of outlined for you beautifully and then of course like one click to get these

266
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,720
things going on Linode and with our hundred dollar credit you could try each one of them.

267
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Why not?

268
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,440
I actually one of the first ways I started using Linode and one of the ways I knew I

269
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,160
was going to be using Linode for a long time was I tried out every different combination

270
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,320
of WordPress just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom on Linode tested each one of them, built

271
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,480
each one of them up.

272
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,600
Not only was it a great way to refresh myself on how to use WordPress because it had been

273
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,200
a while but I really got a sense of what performed the best for me and I just kept that Linode.

274
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
It was great.

275
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
You can do the same thing.

276
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,120
Go to linode.com slash unplugged get that $100 60-day credit and of course support the

277
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,500
show.

278
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,400
We all love archive.org.

279
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,700
It's one of the greatest resources on the internet and it's the home of the internet

280
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,300
way back machine.

281
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,160
It's also a content distribution network of sorts.

282
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,900
You got to imagine it is quite the infrastructure and you've probably imagined if you didn't

283
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,960
know it's running Linux you would be correct on both counts.

284
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,200
I mean don't all the best things run Linux?

285
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
It's true.

286
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
That's true.

287
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,520
Jonah Edwards is the infrastructure manager at archive.org.

288
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:00,960
He joined in the fall of 2016 and this is in his bio quote escaping from the world of

289
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:07,680
online attention optimization to the peace and safety of a techno utopia librarianship

290
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:14,880
which is incredible and he gave a presentation to the internet archive staff about the infrastructure

291
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,600
you know just to kind of tell the employees how things work and like the awesome people

292
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,040
they are they made the whole thing public and Wes and I watched it and we grabbed a

293
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,000
couple of moments to just kind of tell you how they use Linux and how the archive.org

294
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,360
actually works.

295
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,800
So why don't we do this?

296
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,520
Let's start with an introduction from Jonah himself.

297
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,400
Hey everybody for those of you who don't know me or I haven't had the pleasure of meeting

298
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
yet.

299
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
My name is Jonah Edwards.

300
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,240
I run the core infrastructure team here at the Internet Archive.

301
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,160
Yeah and you probably suspected but may not have known that they run all of their own

302
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
infrastructure.

303
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,800
There is no cloud.

304
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,960
So there's no cloud.

305
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,180
It's just someone else's computer.

306
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,360
Most of us have probably heard this sentiment in some form or another but here at the Internet

307
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,000
Archive that's really really there's no cloud.

308
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,720
It's just our computers in our buildings run by our people.

309
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,880
And he gives us a rundown of what those computers are.

310
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,360
We have around 750 operational servers right now.

311
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,120
We run these things way longer than anyone else does.

312
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,520
The oldest systems in our fleet are from back in 2012.

313
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,320
More than a thousand VMs across the fleet which is probably what those of you who interface

314
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,080
with us directly mostly interface with.

315
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:32,100
Tens of thousands of storage devices from high performance NVMe flash, SSDs, the spinning

316
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,480
disks underlying the operating systems on the servers, and over 20,000 spinning disks

317
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:43,400
in paired storage which is the redundant storage layer underlying the Internet Archive's corpus

318
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,720
totaling nearly 200 petabytes of raw storage capacity in the Internet Archive.

319
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
200 petabytes.

320
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,440
I mean I knew it'd be a lot.

321
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,600
I knew it'd be a lot.

322
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,080
But you can imagine the growth rate too is a hell of a thing just to even manage.

323
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,880
We're currently growing the Internet Archive by over a quarter of its size per year.

324
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,880
Per year Wes?

325
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Per year?

326
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
What?

327
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,400
Imagine what that's like to manage from like a server standpoint, a disk standpoint, a

328
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,200
network standpoint.

329
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,760
And they've recently seen a large jump in traffic in general.

330
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:25,200
We've had a huge explosion in outbound traffic over the last year with the pandemic, lockdown.

331
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,080
You can see there in March and April of 2020 how we really flatlined just because demand

332
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,800
increased so quickly and so dramatically much faster than we anticipated.

333
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Yeah.

334
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:43,220
So the pandemic and people at home led to increased use of Archive.org which is interesting

335
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,800
because it led to a big decrease in actual library use but the Archive.org Internet library

336
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
saw a huge uptick.

337
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Yeah.

338
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,320
Well it's the safest library out there.

339
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,640
That's true.

340
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,760
And no mask required.

341
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,640
Then he gave us a bit of an overview of the network traffic they see.

342
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,740
This is hard to actually put in this talk because this was an area where he gave some

343
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,400
visual examples and did an overview that was like put up on maps and whatnot.

344
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,760
So we will link to the video so you can see the entire thing.

345
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,240
It's not that long and it's interesting the entire time.

346
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,440
I think it's one of the best virtual talks I've watched this last pandemic year.

347
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,020
And so if you want to check out the whole thing I would encourage you but here's a little

348
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,680
taste of the network infrastructure and even kind of where they're going with it.

349
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:30,760
We're pushing 60 something gigabits out most of the time right now.

350
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,040
We're currently working on expanding that capacity.

351
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,000
My expectation is that flow will be probably in the 80 gigabit range once we kind of clear

352
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,040
everything out here and then just more from there.

353
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,600
So the inner site links that we do are kind of our current bottleneck.

354
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,200
We run those with a technology called dense wave division multiplexing.

355
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,640
I'm not going to get too into this.

356
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,060
I just think it's super cool.

357
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,580
So I tell people about it whenever it comes up.

358
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,520
We use fiber optics to connect our sites and just like with a prism, if you shine the fiber

359
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,940
optic in different colors, you can prism it together into a single beam of light and deprism

360
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,780
it back at the other end.

361
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,780
Super cool technology.

362
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,440
Anyway, that's my little aside.

363
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,040
What we're moving towards now is actually going to be a full fiber ring between our

364
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,040
sites.

365
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:19,280
We're going to have 100 gigabit links between all the sites.

366
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,240
We are going to be able to utilize both directions of the fiber ring simultaneously, giving us

367
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,680
kind of 200 gigabits of bandwidth in both directions.

368
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,000
Of course, if we use the whole thing, then we're not going to get quite the redundancy

369
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,520
of the fiber ring and that's the reason I'm really excited about it.

370
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:42,120
It's been kind of one of the biggest causes of outages for us, especially long term outages.

371
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,440
I know watching the networking details was your favorite part of the talk with.

372
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,440
Oh my gosh.

373
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,440
I just love the amount of openness here, which I guess sort of makes sense given it's archive.org,

374
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,960
but tons of nitty gritty, tons of nice actual pictures of their somewhat messy networking

375
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
stacks.

376
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,520
You actually get to see some of how this really happens.

377
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
Right.

378
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,680
It's not so much like the PR photos you see from AWS or Google Cloud, but like their actual

379
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,080
infrastructure, the real stuff, kind of like we're going to get to a little bit later

380
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
in the show.

381
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:19,920
Real infrastructure sometimes has issues, but what I appreciated about this talk was

382
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,720
you could tell the staff understood the value that this infrastructure brings an electronic

383
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,840
archive and Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive, wrapped it up with a

384
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,920
real nice moment, actually, where he acknowledged Linux's role in all of this.

385
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,120
And of course, how awesome his team has been at implementing open source technologies to

386
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,960
solve these problems.

387
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,480
We're all built on on Linux and the wonder of open source.

388
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:53,640
And it's just what a sharing awesome, amazing environment, the whole Linux Ubuntu free and

389
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,080
open source software, the sharing that's been going on.

390
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:05,120
And then we built the Petabox infrastructure on top of that, mostly in PHP and Python,

391
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,080
to go and offer our services to the world.

392
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:13,680
It is a really impressive thing that this group has been able to pull off.

393
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,520
Yeah, that was Brewster Kahle.

394
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
That's pretty great.

395
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,000
And it's nice to see them acknowledge Linux's role in that.

396
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,540
Yeah, really nicely put.

397
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,120
And with that, we'll just say thank you to Archive.org for everything they do.

398
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,320
And a big, like, love from the show to them because they helped Jupiter Broadcasting do

399
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,920
some of their early distribution.

400
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,280
And I love, love, love the Wayback Machine, some serious nostalgia, but also just great

401
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,320
to go back and see how things have evolved over time.

402
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,760
Well, yeah, I mean, I think especially as we rapidly evolve what happens on the Internet,

403
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,600
that's documenting the culture that exists or doesn't exist anymore.

404
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,560
All right, Wes, grab your Swiffer.

405
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,040
Time for a spot of housekeeping around here.

406
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,800
I did this last week.

407
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
It's your turn.

408
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,580
No, we're going to both do it.

409
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,320
We both have the broom.

410
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
You know, it's shared.

411
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,560
Gosh, I tell you what, I mean, I don't know where you found this dual handled broom, but

412
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
OK.

413
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
Wait, wait.

414
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Oh, you missed a spot there, Wes.

415
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
Yeah, right there.

416
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
Yeah.

417
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
Come on now.

418
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,560
Get that.

419
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,560
He's going to get upset with me.

420
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,440
So you go to Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash Telegram if you want to join the J.B.

421
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,160
Telegram group.

422
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
All kinds of reasons.

423
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,720
Not only do you see behind the scenes discussion, but you follow up with us directly.

424
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,120
Additionally, show announcements and when events are happening, you'll generally get

425
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,820
info about them in their Jupiter Broadcasting dot com slash Telegram.

426
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:40,000
Every single Sunday, our virtual get together outside the show just to hang out and talk.

427
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,500
Sometimes some of the sessions are recorded.

428
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,200
Sometimes it's just to hang out and talk about things you love about Linux or things you

429
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,720
do with Linux or ways to use Linux or learn.

430
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,480
It's a pretty cool community and it's self-organizing.

431
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,920
Every Sunday in our Mumble Room, we'll have the calendar event at Jupiter Broadcasting

432
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
dot com slash calendar.

433
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,920
And I encourage you to get Mumble set up because then you can join our virtual lug during the

434
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,920
show.

435
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,040
And I was just I was just thinking it's funny how the clubhouse social network thing has

436
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,680
gotten so popular.

437
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,480
It's really Mumble.

438
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,220
The club, what Clubhouse is doing, it's Mumble.

439
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,440
And it's not as good as Mumble and it's not free software.

440
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,060
But the idea, the idea is sound so you can join the lug and hang out in there every Sunday.

441
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:28,840
And while you're over at Jupiter Broadcasting dot com, why not grab the all shows feed?

442
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,280
When we launch new content, you get it there.

443
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,920
But additionally, in that feed, along with this show, you get Koda radio, self-hosted

444
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,200
and Linux action news where Wes and I are breaking down all of the important Linux news

445
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,120
every single week.

446
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,200
That's all Jupiter Broadcasting dot com.

447
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,160
Go get some.

448
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,280
That should be the new slogan, you know, Jupiter Broadcasting dot com.

449
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,280
Go get some.

450
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,680
That'd be really obnoxious.

451
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,280
Although obnoxious is kind of the name of the game because we wanted to be a little

452
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:06,280
tongue in cheek, have some fun with this because, you know, it's the hacker games.

453
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,000
What's even crazier than letting anyone join a virtual lug and speak on our podcast live

454
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,320
on the air?

455
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,160
How about sharing the login information to one of our application servers with our chat

456
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
room?

457
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,000
We've set up an application server with one major misconfiguration.

458
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,480
If you find it, you can own the box.

459
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,760
Whoever gets root first claims the yet to be announced 400 swag.

460
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,160
One box, one hacker, one exclusive prize.

461
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,040
It's the Unplugged Hacker Game.

462
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,800
Oops, we misconfigured one of our systems.

463
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,240
An actual misconfiguration that I've seen in production.

464
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,720
The first who pops root on the box and leaves their name in an email and their email address

465
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,360
in a text file in the slash root home folder wins lup 400 swag.

466
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,440
Also the first who posts a link to the super secret file in the slash root home folder

467
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,960
also will win the swag.

468
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,280
So that's what we're doing today.

469
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:12,520
We have this accidental configuration and it's on a server at rust.rodeo and the login

470
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,440
is backup.

471
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,640
And what was the password, Wes?

472
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Unplugged.

473
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,640
Oh, right.

474
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
Yeah.

475
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,920
So the user account is backup.

476
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,720
The password is unplugged.

477
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,720
Rust.rodeo.

478
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
Go log in.

479
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,140
If you can pop the root first, you win.

480
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,400
And if you can find the misconfiguration that we did.

481
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,720
But this user account backup doesn't normally have a shell.

482
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:43,420
A lot of systems like Ubuntu or Debian, this is a Debian box, will have a backup user pre-added.

483
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:49,200
And I actually have seen in production when the client needed for some reason the backup

484
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,960
account to actually like log in and do something over SSH, I can't even remember what the circumstances

485
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,320
was back then, but it was something to do with backup PC.

486
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,720
And they set a shell for their backup account and set a really basic password.

487
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,520
And that is actually how I got access to the box.

488
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,480
And so we're kind of replicating that setup, but with a modern twist because this is an

489
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,960
application server that we have deployed.

490
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,620
And so it's running amongst other things, container software, and it has net data installed

491
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,480
for monitoring.

492
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,800
It's a common system, pretty minimal install, running on Debian that you'd see with one

493
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,320
or two mistakes that I've actually witnessed in production that have been made here.

494
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,560
Maybe it's not the newest Debian, you know?

495
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,520
Yeah, maybe there's a couple of old packages on there.

496
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:43,560
So go log in to rust.rodeo with the user account backup and the password unplugged.

497
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,220
And whoever gets there first, put your name and email in a text file in slash roots home

498
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,400
folder and then let us know.

499
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,220
And then in the meantime, what we thought we would do is tell you about kind of like

500
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,720
a cheat way that won't work on this box, right, Wes?

501
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
This isn't going to work.

502
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
Like, we're not going to...

503
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,760
I don't know if I want to tell them about it yet because then they could use it, but

504
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,760
I don't think it'll work.

505
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,240
No, I mean, it might work, yeah.

506
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,240
You think?

507
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
You think it might?

508
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Mm-hmm.

509
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Yeah.

510
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
That'd be cheating.

511
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
You know?

512
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
That'd be cheating.

513
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
But I'm going to tell you about...

514
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,280
I'm going to tell you like a cheat code way you can do it.

515
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,080
It's something that kind of inspired this segment.

516
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,840
We're curious to see how long it takes somebody to get access because my thinking here is,

517
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,760
oh, I'm actually seeing a little bit of usage tick up on it too.

518
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,760
Interesting.

519
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,840
I'm watching the system here.

520
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,520
My thinking on it is quite simply, oh, oh, we have some definite...

521
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
People are...

522
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Wow.

523
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Wow.

524
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
Excellent.

525
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,520
It's funny to watch what people are doing.

526
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,280
So we have somebody who is spinning up Docker.

527
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,240
We have somebody who's running Nano on the sudoers file right now.

528
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,640
Look at you guys, you deviants.

529
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
What are you doing to our box right now?

530
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,040
This poor innocent box.

531
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,240
Boy, there's a lot of things happening right now.

532
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,640
Ideally, install some Rust on there because it's got a great domain name, but I don't

533
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,180
think we put anything that was Rust powered on it yet.

534
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,940
This is our Rust application development server, rust.rodeo.

535
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,080
So while people are...

536
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,440
I'm going to tell you a way you can get root, but if you use this, you don't qualify for

537
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
the prize.

538
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,000
But this is what kind of inspired the segment.

539
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,960
It's like, you know in Mario when you get the star and then you're invincible?

540
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
That's what this is.

541
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,440
You can automatically exploit any low-hanging fruit to pop a root shell in Linux with this

542
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,440
app.

543
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,680
And I thought it'd be fun to tell you guys about it because if you wanted to test your

544
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,120
systems and see how they stand up, we actually ran this against a couple of boxes, some of

545
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,120
which it could not exploit and some of which it could.

546
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,940
And it's called Traitor, and we'll have a link to it in the show notes.

547
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,960
It's obviously up on GitHub, like seemingly everything is these days.

548
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,180
And you run this Go app on your system as a regular user, and it will automatically

549
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:55,280
check for all of the known likely vulnerabilities on a box and then pop you a shell using one

550
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,280
of them.

551
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,720
Oh, Neil, you got it.

552
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
You got it already.

553
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
Yep.

554
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,460
I didn't remember exactly what you said I should do, so I just went ahead and dropped

555
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,160
a file in slash root on the host file system.

556
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
That's great.

557
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
I found the super secret file.

558
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,720
I also decided, you know what?

559
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,720
Just whatever.

560
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,560
I'll just drop something in there, too.

561
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,560
I've owned everything.

562
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,840
I access stuff.

563
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,920
You want me to install something?

564
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
I can.

565
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,000
I can upgrade the system to Debian 10 and break everything if you'd like.

566
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,240
Well, that only took a few minutes.

567
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
Well done, sir.

568
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,160
So walk people through how you got root.

569
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,300
Tell us what you found and what was misconfigured.

570
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,120
I don't know if this was the misconfiguration you were going for, but here's the one that

571
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,680
I found.

572
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,120
Docker PS worked.

573
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,560
And that was enough for me to realize this is a Debian system, so this is probably going

574
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,320
to be busted in all kinds of fun ways.

575
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,720
So by default, on most of the non-Red Hat family, and I think this is actually kind

576
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,040
of fixed in the SUSE family now, but at least in the Debian Ubuntu family, if you have the

577
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,960
ability to access the Docker socket and you have a Docker service daemon, you're actually

578
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,320
able to bypass every single protection if you don't have, you know, SE Linux working

579
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,680
on it, for example.

580
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:24,120
And so what I did was I just docker run dactechrm space-it-v slash to slash host and opened

581
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:29,600
up fedora-latest, and that gave me a root of S with a mount point with read-write access

582
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,840
to the host file system, and everything was there.

583
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,000
And I just poked around and did stuff, and it's like, oh, well, you know, whatever.

584
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,920
Man, Chris, you're bad at this.

585
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,240
You just wanted to say that you used Fedora to own Debian.

586
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,720
That's pretty great, yeah.

587
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,080
But I think what's great is it's two issues that you compounded.

588
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,720
So number one is you got access to the box.

589
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,600
Maybe in this scenario, somebody has a backup account on a server, and they're using a really

590
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,540
basic password that you're able to dictionary attack, or for whatever reason, you get shell

591
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,540
on a box.

592
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,540
But you didn't get root shell.

593
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,540
You just got user shell.

594
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,120
He wasn't in the sudoers file or anything like that.

595
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,400
But then you leverage an extremely common docker misconfiguration to own the rest of

596
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,400
the box.

597
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,560
And that was actually exactly the route we thought somebody might take.

598
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
So congratulations.

599
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Well done, sir.

600
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Well done.

601
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,960
You will get the yet-to-be-announced swag item.

602
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,600
And I think that the point we were trying to make with this is it is actually pretty

603
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,520
exceptionally easy to have zero knowledge or experience with a box, and if you just

604
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:34,040
have an understanding of how these fundamentals work, you can get access.

605
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,480
And that was exactly the point we were trying to demonstrate, ah, PyCrash was going that

606
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
route too.

607
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,640
I almost made it, man.

608
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,640
You almost made it.

609
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:46,360
I left a little treat on slash root if you want to go look, Chris.

610
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,180
Technically nobody has posted a link to the super secret file yet, PyCrash.

611
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:55,120
So you could technically still do that and post a link to it in the IRC room, which means

612
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,960
you have to get it uploaded somewhere.

613
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,760
And then you would still qualify for the yet-to-be-announced swag item.

614
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,280
Ah, Gamma was looking at set UID binaries.

615
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,840
Yeah, that's a good idea.

616
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:10,880
Yeah, this was a conversation that I think I had to really convince Wes we should do.

617
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,400
The other thing we did, although it's not super obvious, is we decided to go with kind

618
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,120
of an easy root password.

619
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,960
It does have letters and numbers, so it's not super crazy easy, but it would probably

620
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
be guessable.

621
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,280
Definitely, yeah, dictionary attackable.

622
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
Yeah.

623
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,800
It's not really, everybody knows important passwords, but I just think that it's funny

624
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:38,040
to reach into a past life where I actually saw this scenario and it was using not a super

625
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:42,600
simple password, but a password for this backup account, back with this client.

626
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,600
It was using a password that was in several scripts that multiple people had access to.

627
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,560
So there was many scenarios where you would have an opportunity to see the password, like

628
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,800
if you're on the LAN or something like that.

629
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:59,280
And it was a dictionary word and you could just log in to any boxes backup with that

630
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:03,240
password because they set it up on every single rig for the backups to work.

631
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,920
And then all it really takes, right, is someone's trying to backup something, maybe they're

632
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,400
trying to backup a container.

633
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,640
So they add that user to the Docker group or they fuss with permissions on the Docker

634
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:15,520
socket and suddenly your castle comes crashing down.

635
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,640
Congratulations Neil, you are the winner of the first Unplugged Hacker Games.

636
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,480
I also have been thinking about a version we could do where we leave a box running and

637
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,320
then see if somebody can own it that is in the download audience.

638
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,280
So you don't have to be here live for that too.

639
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
Oh, IRC update.

640
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,880
Yeah, it looks like someone's got the super secret prize linked.

641
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,040
There you go.

642
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,040
There you go.

643
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,320
So that's two people now.

644
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
Good.

645
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:44,080
I was tempted to do both, but I figured, well, one, it's kind of a pain to copy the file

646
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,200
out.

647
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,760
We got you with laziness.

648
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,760
Yep.

649
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,480
And of course, because this is how it works on the Unplugged program, the super secret

650
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,280
file was an adorable picture of Levi playing in the snow.

651
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,280
It was cool.

652
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,280
I loved it.

653
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,280
With his baby tongue out.

654
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,640
You got a little baby tongue sticking out there in the snow.

655
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,680
You need more of those.

656
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
I like Levi.

657
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,680
Levi is, yeah.

658
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,280
I mean, he is the prize.

659
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,640
So put your, okay, yeah, good, Carl, you got, Carl, you got your, all right, great.

660
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
Nicely done.

661
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,640
Nicely done.

662
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
Carl got in there too.

663
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,640
Ha ha.

664
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Carl, which route did you take to get root?

665
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,200
I did the same thing that Neil did.

666
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,960
I knew that there was a way to do that.

667
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,140
I'd seen it blogged about before, but I couldn't remember the exact flags and it was the volume

668
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,220
mounting the root file system inside the container.

669
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,340
Thor leaves his mark.

670
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,580
Thor was here also.

671
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,580
Very nice.

672
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,580
Nicely done.

673
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,580
I think we'll do this again.

674
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,580
I really enjoyed that.

675
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:36,600
But next time, next time it won't be a Docker misconfiguration, but it does show you the

676
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,440
importance of things not running as root, doesn't it?

677
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Right.

678
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,320
And also this is why I use Podman because this kind of stuff isn't actually the default

679
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
setup.

680
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
Right.

681
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,960
That's what stuck with me here is like, you know, honestly, I mean, we probably wouldn't

682
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,200
have used exactly this box, but this is not that far off from just sort of a lazy default

683
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,840
setup of, oh, I just need to run some containers.

684
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,840
I've installed Docker.

685
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,360
I'm setting things up really quickly.

686
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,280
And I mean, the tool we were talking about, Trader, it's able to do this too.

687
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,560
You know, you just have that Docker socket open for it and away it goes.

688
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,240
And Trader is just out there.

689
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,240
Anybody can grab it.

690
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,880
It's not, you don't, you know, you just, she just listened to some silly Linux podcast

691
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,000
and you know about it.

692
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,160
This has been your Unplugged PSA.

693
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,920
Also I want to say thank you to our Unplugged Core contributors at unpluggedcore.com, keeping

694
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,160
the show independent, helping us reduce the ad load needed.

695
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,560
And also when you become a core contributor, you get access to two different feeds, a limited

696
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:39,320
ad version of the feed, same full production, just no ads, or you get the full raw live

697
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,080
stream, all our screw ups, all the stuff that never makes it into the show, the full pre

698
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,600
and post show that's basically an extra show that never gets released.

699
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,120
All of that is available to our members.

700
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:54,360
And we do that as a thank you because it really makes a huge difference and we immensely appreciate

701
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,360
it.

702
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,160
And let's do a little bit of feedback before we get out of here because I really ran my

703
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,200
mouth off a lot at the end of the last episode.

704
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,240
But before we get to that, Thor of Norway, I wonder if it's the same Thor, writes in

705
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,880
about Minecraft Bedrock Bridge.

706
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,520
I was recently listening to the segment on Flatpak and the Flatpak packages for Minecraft

707
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,560
Bedrock Edition that I mentioned last week.

708
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,040
He said, I started looking at a main list of differences and capabilities and I came

709
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:28,040
across a proxy bridge that bridges Minecraft Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Java Edition.

710
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,360
I was linked to this in the Jupiter broadcasting telegram today as well.

711
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,360
It's at geysermc.org.

712
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,360
Geyser MC.

713
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Geyser MC.

714
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:45,200
And it is a middle layer that allows Bedrock at Java Edition to play with each other.

715
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,560
It does the translations in real time.

716
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,960
That's remarkable.

717
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,840
What an incredible bit of engineering and we'll put a link to it in the show notes because

718
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,480
if you have this drugs like I have, then you know what a big deal this is.

719
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,280
And so thank you for everybody who sent that along.

720
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,400
I will definitely take a look into that.

721
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,520
It also gives me another excuse to spin up a Linode.

722
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,600
So there's that too.

723
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
I always like that.

724
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
All right.

725
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,160
Well, moving on to our next piece of feedback from Kai asking about audio hardware.

726
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,480
A long time listener, first time caller, I was wondering if you could talk about your

727
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,000
audio hardware setup in the show.

728
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,360
I'm in the process of building a new PC and was looking for a sound card.

729
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:34,120
It seems that there's no sound card with official vendor support anymore, at least for Linux

730
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:40,960
and lots of, well, use kernel XYZ and this firmware and well, maybe it works, at least

731
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,040
that's the comments I see on Reddit.

732
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,400
So do you guys have any ideas?

733
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,400
Regards, Kai.

734
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,800
I think it's safe to say that we're everybody on the team is a really big advocate of just

735
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,560
getting a USB audio interface for anything that where audio quality matters.

736
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,880
Yeah, so much so that it's been years and years that I've actually had like an internal

737
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,880
sound card.

738
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,000
Yeah, I use one upstairs on my desktop for my speakers, but I would never capture audio

739
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,240
that way.

740
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,440
And additionally, I have just found it super solid.

741
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:20,280
The way this has just worked 100% rock solid for me every time is a name brand USB audio

742
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,280
interface.

743
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,240
They can be a wide range of prices.

744
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,960
We have a couple that we like.

745
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,360
Maybe West, you could mention those here a sec.

746
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:31,840
But what I wanted, the tip I wanted to give you is whichever one you end up getting, you

747
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:38,240
can go into pulse audio, any of the pulse audio control panels like Poova control and

748
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,280
disable the HDMI audio out, disable the built in, in and out, just disable all of those

749
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,800
and leave the only audio interface enabled that you actually use.

750
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,280
For me, it's USB devices.

751
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:54,020
And then you're never really going to have any problems with like zoom meetings, picking

752
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:57,640
the wrong audio interface or an application launching and not playing audio right.

753
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,840
If you disable the sound cards, you don't use improve a control solves the problem.

754
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,400
Yeah, that definitely makes it simpler to sort of disable anything that you don't actually

755
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,160
want to show up to actually be an option.

756
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,440
And probably control sure is pretty handy, even if it's not the not the prettiest.

757
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,800
People are sending broadcast messages on the owned machine.

758
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,600
Do you have any audio interfaces off the top of your head that we recommend besides like

759
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,720
the M audio, you 21 or 22, whatever it is, right?

760
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Yeah, the M audio one, they're not.

761
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,120
It sort of depends on if you like them or not.

762
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,920
But lexicon has some ones like the alpha, I think also the omega line that works just

763
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,920
fine with Linux.

764
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,600
I know there's been some mixed reports on the on the focus right Scarlett's of the newest

765
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,720
Yeah, line maybe which I've not personally tried.

766
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,240
But all their older stuff has always worked really nicely.

767
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,960
That's what I'm talking to you on right now is a two i four, but the two i two works great

768
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,960
too.

769
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:56,080
So my top tip is get a used two i two or two i four Scarlett perhaps a focus right um,

770
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,120
I have tried the newer ones and I don't I haven't really had any problems but I have

771
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,860
had multiple people tell me that the older ones are slightly better with Linux support.

772
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:08,160
In general, though USB audio devices just even the cheap crappy little tiny ones you

773
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,960
buy off of Amazon are better, especially on a laptop than the built in audio interface.

774
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,160
There's just a lot of electronics in a small space and it just kind of makes them sucky.

775
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,080
And so that's why we always always break it out.

776
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:26,240
All right, so let's get into the arch stuff because I had a lot to say in the post show

777
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,080
and Eric writes in this is first of all love the show.

778
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,600
But I wanted to respond to the concern about people making fun of arch users.

779
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,360
I don't like abusing folks for their choice in well, pretty much anything.

780
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:41,620
But you know, it might help the arch case if so many arch users didn't take to Reddit,

781
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,560
the managerial forms and etc.

782
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,440
And question why people use anything but arch.

783
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:53,900
It just kind of begs for teasing regards, Eric, he's kind of right like this all I think

784
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,080
started as a Reddit meme.

785
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:01,800
Yeah, and there are you know, I think it's safe to say arch tracks some strong opinions,

786
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,760
I guess on both sides, but but you know, people who discover it and use it and sort of evangelize

787
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:12,080
it and I think it is fair to point out that there are times where that's not really appropriate

788
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,420
or where the message isn't appropriately nuanced with clarifications around you know, this

789
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:20,960
is why it works well for me, but everyone skips that first part and it's more like well,

790
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,960
this is why it's the best.

791
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,960
Indeed, indeed.

792
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,960
All right.

793
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,760
We got one more that kind of gets to the philosophical side of the arch discussion.

794
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,400
Indeed it does from Mr. Ders.

795
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,520
I just had to write in on love 394s after show arch discussion.

796
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,120
I have a degree in computer engineering, so I get computers, but I don't do anything with

797
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,560
Linux as a career.

798
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:47,860
I've only ever heard about the toxic environment in open source but never experienced it.

799
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,640
Part of that is how I approach life and human human interaction.

800
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:55,040
But I honestly think the vast majority of the community are honest, kind, hardworking,

801
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,040
real people.

802
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,800
A person's self esteem is often wrapped up in their life's work, their value system choices

803
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,720
and preferences.

804
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,680
It can be difficult to hear that another user doesn't appreciate the same things we do,

805
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,280
especially if we are a creator or contributor.

806
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,880
For example, Neil commented that he had failed with all of his hard work on fedora if it

807
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,920
didn't do what Chris needed it to do.

808
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:24,880
I do love Neil's commitment to creating better and better software, but he is far from a

809
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,880
failure.

810
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,960
We only fail when we fail to appreciate the wonderful diversity and how open source tools

811
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:36,160
can be used and everyone's individual rights to choose for whatever reason that is.

812
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,300
For me, I choose PopOS, Ubuntu Server, Arch, Endeavor.

813
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,800
Sometimes it's my perception is the best tool for the job.

814
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,200
Sometimes it just feels good and it looks good and it sounds good.

815
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,800
But at the end of the day, it gets the job done.

816
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,560
There are so many car analogies I could make, but I've already said too much.

817
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,000
Thank you for the show, Mr. Ders.

818
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,680
Good point, Mr. Ders.

819
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,560
And Carl and I were having a conversation in matrix and Neil and I were having a conversation

820
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,800
in matrix after the show.

821
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,680
And kind of what I realized too is part of the factor here is, especially when it comes

822
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,720
to Linux distributions, is how much does community interaction matter to you and what community

823
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,640
does that best for you?

824
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,600
And for me, I realized afterwards, I don't think I have an Arch user form account.

825
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,000
I don't think I've ever posted over there.

826
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:27,920
I've never tried to submit something to an Arch maintainer for fixing.

827
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,040
I've never done any level of community engagement.

828
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,720
In fact, I think I've even commented to you off air that one of the things I've liked

829
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,720
about Arch is I am 100% ignorant for the most part to any politics going on.

830
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,200
I know there's some from time to time, but I'm mostly ignorant compared to what I know

831
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,200
about what's going on with all the other distributions.

832
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,920
And I kind of find that to be a respite.

833
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,820
But others engage fully with the community and have had a different experience.

834
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,220
And so that has factored into one of many factors of choosing a distribution.

835
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:04,080
And I think that was probably what was missing from our conversation last week.

836
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,440
Yeah, we all have sort of different experiences and interactions with even if it's the same

837
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:12,960
organization, the same project, but you can use that, explore that and interact with the

838
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,360
community in totally different ways.

839
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:21,280
I'm just waiting for WSOS, you know, with the pain command line that's all like customized

840
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,280
and looks really cool.

841
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,040
And the pain window manager, the pain programming language.

842
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,680
Then you're just going to come to me for support.

843
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:30,440
I don't want that.

844
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,840
You can find our sponsor Cloud Guru on social media.

845
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,680
They're at just slash a cloud guru just about everywhere online, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube.

846
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,020
It's just slash a cloud guru.

847
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,720
If you do the Twitter thing, you can follow this here show for announcements at Linux

848
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,720
Unplugged.

849
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:47,040
The network for all kinds of news is at Jupiter Signal.

850
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,560
And of course, I'm at Chris Last.

851
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,720
Wes, I think you got a Twitter account, too.

852
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,840
At Wes Payne.

853
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,840
Look at that.

854
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:53,840
That's so easy.

855
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,820
It's actually simpler than what mine is.

856
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,960
It's just my name.

857
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,940
Yeah, that's a lot easier.

858
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:05,280
The entire Jupiter Broadcasting Network of shows, fantastic shows, the best shows, JupiterBroadcasting.com.

859
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,760
And if you work in the tech industry, don't miss Linux Action News.

860
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,360
Every Monday morning, Wes and I break down everything that matters in the world of Linux.

861
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:14,400
You're not going to want to miss that.

862
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:15,400
LinuxActionNews.com.

863
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,120
See you next week.

864
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,760
Same bat time, same bat station.

865
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,360
And do keep the Linux rolling.

866
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:26,480
Tuesdays, join us live, 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

867
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,280
That's a heck of a lot of Linux.

868
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,300
But is it enough Linux?

869
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,920
Only you can determine that.

870
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,240
Links to everything we talked about today and how to contact us, the Mumble server info,

871
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,920
our Matrix server info, all of it, all of it, LinuxUnplugged.com.

872
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,960
It's that simple.

873
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,920
People are still owning our box right now.

874
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,320
I'm seeing the messages come in.

875
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,320
Oh, man.

876
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,320
The poor little machine.

877
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,320
Deviants.

878
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,440
All right, everyone, thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode of the Unplugged

879
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:57,080
program as we build towards 400.

880
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:24,760
We'll see you right back here next Tuesday.

881
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:42,240
JBtitles.com, everybody go boat.

882
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:47,840
I think our Rust application server has turned into a chat server for everyone who has owned

883
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,840
it.

884
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,200
They're just chatting back and forth using broadcast now.

885
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,760
It's our own JB intranet.

886
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,680
Yeah, really, it is.

887
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,680
Look at all these people.

888
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,960
So how many people are now logged into it?

889
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,360
Okay, we've got 11 users currently active, a little bit less than during the show.

890
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,040
I just killed a lot of sessions.

891
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,040
Oh, did you?

892
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:05,040
Thank you very much.

893
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,040
He yanked everyone.

894
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:10,040
Yeah, he has thrown me out, but I'm back in now.

895
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:15,200
So there was 20 people by the time he yanked everything, and I'm not counting the four

896
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,880
separate sessions I was running multiplex through Docker.

897
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,880
Oh, good.

898
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,720
I think the next one we'll try to do something that runs overnight or for a couple of days

899
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,960
to give people a couple of chances.

900
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,960
I think this is so much fun.

901
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,600
All right, we'll do it even bigger and better next time.

902
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,600
It was fun.

903
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:56,720
Look, Chris, you're bad at security.
