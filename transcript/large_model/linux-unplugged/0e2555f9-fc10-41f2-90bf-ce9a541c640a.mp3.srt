1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,920
All right, Eric, you got me to boot into Windows.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,920
Oh, nasty.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:05,920
I know.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,920
I know.

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,920
Blame me.

6
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,920
Blah, blah, blah.

7
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,920
Oh, jeez.

8
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,920
This is a bad sign.

9
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,920
So it's a Broadcom manufacturer.

10
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,120
It says it's a Dell Wireless 1560.

11
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,120
What have you got?

12
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,120
What have you got?

13
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,120
What have you got?

14
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,120
What have you got?

15
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,120
Ayo, it's a Broadcom chip.

16
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,240
It's in a Dell laptop.

17
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,440
It says it's a Dell Wireless 1560 802.

18
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,720
What Dell laptop?

19
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,160
Is it that new sexy, shiny one with no bezels?

20
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,160
Yep, yep, yep.

21
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,640
Oh, you're a bad man.

22
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,640
Is it nice?

23
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,120
Yeah, it's very nice, except for the wireless on the Antigros Live CD isn't getting picked

24
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,120
up.

25
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,520
So I'm trying to work back what I've got to do to make this happen here, because I'd love

26
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,120
to get it installed during the show, but jeez, I don't even know where my USB adapter is.

27
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm willing to bet the Broadcom STA driver will do just fine.

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,280
All right, well, I will be right back.

29
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,600
I'm going to go see if I can find my USB.

30
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,600
Oh, yeah.

31
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,600
Okay, I'll just share this.

32
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,240
So in the Ubuntu documentation, or Ask Ubuntu, or all those various places, it says about

33
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,440
installing the Broadcom STA, bloody, bloody, bloody, and actually what I found worked best

34
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:13,080
is installing the Linux firmware package, and magic happened, and my Broadcom card in

35
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,840
that one laptop that was a pain in the ass just works with the firmware.

36
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,120
So I shipped that in Ubuntu MATE because it works on those machines where it says, oh,

37
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,120
what you really should do is, you know, if you go into the Give Me Additional Drivers,

38
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,000
it recommends that Broadcom STA thing, which, by the way, doesn't work for this particular

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,320
chipset in my laptop, but just lobbing the Linux firmware on does.

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,720
So I'd start there because it does less damage than installing the Broadcom drivers, which

41
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,720
if they don't work are a bit of an ass to then yank out.

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,200
And it has to be compiled with DKMS, yeah.

43
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,840
Okay, so I'll go see if I can find a USB adapter, and maybe by the end of the show I can try

44
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
to get the wireless working.

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Oh, what?

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
Now it doesn't see.

47
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,320
I brought, so I realized I got the Ethernet adapter all set up, but of course, guess what?

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,580
All my Ethernet's in use in here right now.

49
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:10,720
So I went and took a Wi-Fi adapter off of our Raspberry Pi here, but for some reason

50
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
it's giving me a hard time.

51
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
Oh, here we go.

52
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Here we go.

53
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
Now it's prompting me for the password.

54
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,360
So I'll be using an old Wi-Fi adapter, and then once I get it installed, hopefully I'll

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,080
be able to get the drivers installed for the built-in Wi-Fi adapter.

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
So as a-

57
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
I've got-

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Pre-show flight-

59
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
I've got questions for you, Chris.

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
All right, yeah.

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,040
So as a pre-show flight, right now before we go, I'm at the Antigros live CD.

62
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,440
It's updating the installer right now.

63
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,840
I've got a wireless dongle off on the side.

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,080
We'll see if by the end of the show if I have a successful installation.

65
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,960
What was your question, Mr. Whippy?

66
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:44,680
Well, first of all is aside from proprietary Wi-Fi chipsets, is it nice?

67
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680
Oh yeah.

68
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,040
Oh yeah, it's pretty exceptional.

69
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,200
So it has a nice sturdy bottom feel to it.

70
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,640
It's definitely very thin, and it's surprisingly light.

71
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,700
In fact, when I picked it up, I wondered if the battery was missing.

72
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,160
And the screen is indeed touch, and the touch works under Linux, which is nice.

73
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,760
And the glass is pretty much edge to edge.

74
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,000
It's pretty nice.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,540
And the keyboard looks like a good size keyboard, and the trackpad's a good size too.

76
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,120
So hopefully by the end of the show, I'll have working Antigros, and I'll tell you how

77
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
else it works under Linux.

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,960
The main thing right now for me is I'm a little worried about the Wi-Fi, which I'm sure

79
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,600
if folks got the Sputnik edition or whatever they're going to call it, they'd probably

80
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,520
have that worked out.

81
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,960
So do you think you could remove a panel on the bottom and expose the Wi-Fi chip and replace

82
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,520
it with an Intel something works in Linux variety?

83
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,800
Well, it looks like it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight torque screws,

84
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,440
and there's a panel that pops off, and then the bottom comes off.

85
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,480
I can see the motherboard through the ventilation, so it's probably doable.

86
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,480
Okay.

87
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,960
Well, yeah, we don't want to do that yet.

88
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,800
You don't want to bastardize it before you get started.

89
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,760
If the Linux firmware trick works and I can get the driver working that way, that'll probably

90
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
be the way I go.

91
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,320
Yeah, because I'm cheap, I only buy old hardware, and the first thing I do is yank out the Broadcom

92
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,800
things and buy an Intel something from Germany for nine euros, and then install that and

93
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,320
all your problems go away.

94
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,640
So do you want to hear a story from the other side of the fence?

95
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:18,440
You've got this lush new Dell machine, which is felt and is an Apple Mac beta, so at work

96
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,040
my boss has decided that it's time for a new laptop, and it absolutely is time for a new

97
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,320
laptop for him, and he wanted something that was relatively lightweight and super powerful.

98
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:33,320
So he scoured the internet, and he asked me a few questions, and he found the HP ZBook

99
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,680
14 mobile workstation, which on paper is a very competent machine.

100
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:45,680
It's got an i7, and it's got integrated graphics and discrete graphics, and it's got automated

101
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,720
flip-overs and all of that good stuff.

102
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,320
He doesn't care about Linux, so that's not an issue for him, and it just works.

103
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,960
So he said, I want one of those.

104
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Can you get me one of those?

105
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
And I said, sure, no problem.

106
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Of course I can.

107
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,760
So you go to the HP website.

108
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:04,720
The first thing about the HP website is unlike any other PC manufacturer, you can only buy

109
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,640
what they're prepared to sell you.

110
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,440
You cannot customize a system and say, I want this with these modifications.

111
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,200
So that sucks.

112
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,040
So then I say, right, well, we want this one, so order that.

113
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,360
And then he comes back to me and says, oh, no, no, I want the one with the touch screen.

114
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,920
So I say, right, no problem.

115
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,640
So I phone up HP and said, that order that you've placed, we want to cancel that because

116
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,520
we want to order one with the touch screen.

117
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,200
So they cancel the order, and then they tell me, well, there isn't one with the touch screen.

118
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,440
And I say, but your specification document says that there is.

119
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,760
A week goes by, the order that we've canceled arrives, and we have to arrange for it to

120
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,000
be picked up and returned to them.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,920
They then tell us, oh, yeah, actually, we do make that one with the touch screen, but

122
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,440
it wasn't in our sales catalog.

123
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,640
So we're going to add that to our sales catalog.

124
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,840
So another few days pass, it's in our sales catalog.

125
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,440
Would you like to place the order now?

126
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,120
So yes, I'd like to place the order now.

127
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,000
So I order the laptop and all the extra accessories.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,100
And this is last Friday, and today I get an email out of nowhere saying, your order has

129
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,100
been canceled.

130
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,560
And we don't know why, and we're not quite sure what happened.

131
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,160
But could you phone us up and place the order again, please?

132
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
Oh, my God.

133
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,160
I hate that.

134
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,160
HP suck.

135
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,560
If anyone from HP is listening, you suck.

136
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,840
Lenovo and Dell have got you beaten hands down six ways of Sunday.

137
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
You suck.

138
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,920
You have wasted three weeks of my life to buy one fuckmothering laptop.

139
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,480
Waste of my arcing time.

140
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,340
And it's not even that stellar.

141
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,120
I've been trying to talk my boss into getting a Lenovo Carbon X1.

142
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,920
Awful, awful, awful people don't buy HP computers.

143
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,560
It's like they don't want to make money.

144
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,360
Oh, it's just crap.

145
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,840
I actually had a little bit of a bumpy ride with the Dell.

146
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,680
So the Dell is, first of all, the whole buying process on the Dell website is way too cluttered.

147
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,960
I don't mean to make comparisons, but like, and obviously System76 has a lot less parts,

148
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,840
but it's so much more clear what I'm getting and if I'm getting the right one.

149
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,460
On Dell's website, I fundamentally question if I'm ordering the right part under the right

150
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,980
division, et cetera.

151
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:05,980
So that's very confusing.

152
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,640
Then they canceled my order at one point, but none of the accessories.

153
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,960
So they were billing me and shipping me the next day all of the accessories instead of

154
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,260
shipping all as one shipment, they shipped each thing independently.

155
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,920
So I've had the inverse of that.

156
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:24,400
So today we've replaced the order and the order is just for the laptop, but for none

157
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,840
of the accessories that we had previously requested in the original order.

158
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,440
So then I'm like, okay, so I'm getting the, so then I call them up and they had to verify

159
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,880
something about the address.

160
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:42,620
So the studio here is, it's a duplex, so we have a unit A, unit B, and I put the address

161
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,200
in and then the second address line, I put unit A. Well Dell's system wants unit A on

162
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,940
the first address line and the street address on the second address line.

163
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,560
And because I did those backwards, they canceled the order.

164
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
Yeah.

165
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Brilliant, isn't it?

166
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,120
Honestly, it should be buying a computer be this difficult.

167
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,280
And the thing is, is that I'm going to phone them up to, I'm going to put a, cause I was

168
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,920
busy with other stuff today, so I had to ask one of the guys in the office to sort the

169
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:16,320
reorder out, but I'm going to phone them up to her and give them, well, the air will be

170
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,640
blue around my desk tomorrow morning because you know, I order all of the equipment for

171
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,800
all of the people that work in the company and all of our customers, which is not an

172
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:33,360
insignificant amount of hardware and I am not going to buy any HP equipment ever again.

173
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,780
And my purchasing experience, you have to set as a backdrop to ordering some really

174
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:47,080
sophisticated complicated server hardware from IX systems and you cannot, you cannot

175
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,280
even begin to compare the difference.

176
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,440
Right. So much more complex too, which is ironic.

177
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,360
I know, I know a lot more complex. Each individual machine we're talking, you know, $30,000 per

178
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,220
server versus a couple of thousand dollars for a laptop. And you know, it takes weeks

179
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,480
to negotiate the parts and the build and the fit. You remember those mega core systems

180
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,680
that FreeBSD Foundation have got? Yeah, we're buying like those, like they go out of fashion

181
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
at the moment.

182
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Really?

183
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
We think they're great.

184
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,680
Oh yeah.

185
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
I'd love to see pictures.

186
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
Do you ever get to see them?

187
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,720
Yeah. I'll get you pictures. We've got a floor to ceiling rack of those.

188
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Woo!

189
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,800
Doesn't TechSnap have a discount code you could be using?

190
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
No, just the URL.

191
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,720
Don't you, I'll tell you what, I first got the idea through listening to TechSnap and

192
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,480
went off and read about IX, say August, whenever it was. And I didn't actually get around to

193
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,600
calling them and placing an order until about six months later. But in the order code, it

194
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,040
triggered the fact that I'd first visited the website from TechSnap months and months

195
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,000
and months before and attributed the thing to TechSnap.

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Thank you.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,200
Even though a lot of time had passed in between the first contact.

198
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,560
You maybe you're a big part of the reason why IX renewed for 2015 then.

199
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
I hope so.

200
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,560
I hope so. That's really cool.

201
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
But they make stellar.

202
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Aren't they?

203
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,840
Like I really wish when I was doing IT purchasing that I, I think they were around for a big

204
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:21,840
part of it, but I just didn't know about them. And I instead fought with folks like HP and

205
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,520
Dell all the time.

206
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:31,600
Yeah. No, we use IX for all of our server equipment now. And as much as I like love

207
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:42,560
Linux, for firewalls, we use HACOM for their PF sense firewalls. They're pretty great.

208
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,480
So they're active passive PF sense firewalls.

209
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,520
Oh, they are PF sense on the software side though?

210
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:57,240
Yeah. Yeah. So it is dedicated to PF sense. So it's a 1U rack with two blades in it. So

211
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
two firewalls.

212
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Are they loud?

213
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,280
With carp. No, no, no, they're quite quiet.

214
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
Yeah.

215
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
How much does one go for?

216
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,280
I think it's about two and a half thousand, $4,000 I think by the time we'd got all the

217
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
bits and bobs I did.

218
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Of course.

219
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Of course.

220
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,480
So, you know, they're, they're, they're proper, they've got six Ethernet ports on each blade.

221
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,880
So they're, you know, proper, proper job.

222
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,000
So you guys want to see another gadget. So I, with the Dell, I ordered a bunch of accessories.

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,160
This I don't know if you're watching the video stream. It's a, it's about, it's about the,

224
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,280
it's about half the length of a credit card, maybe about a little more than that and thicker.

225
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,280
So it's a, I don't know what to describe it. It's, it's smaller than a Roku. It's a small

226
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,080
little thing. You could probably fit it in your pocket. And what it is, is it has a USB

227
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:43,720
3.0 plug that flips out on one side and on one, on one side it has VGA and HDMI out.

228
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,960
And on the other side it has gigabit Ethernet and another USB 3.0 port. And so you plug

229
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,320
this into the Dell and you get HDMI and you also get Ethernet, which I thought was probably

230
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,840
pretty good because I'd like to have both of those pretty much every time I sit down.

231
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:01,120
And I think it was like 60 bucks or maybe even less than that. So, cause there's no

232
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Ethernet.

233
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
That's a nifty gizmo, isn't it?

234
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,160
Yeah. And I think it's all using standard stuff. So I'm going to find out. All this

235
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,520
is, I mean, I'm going to try to do the full review. I'm going to try to, you know, say

236
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,800
these accessories work and don't work and stuff. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Did you

237
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,960
guys hear about this? This is a great post from Linus over the weekend. Linux kernel

238
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,920
development halted. Linus is pretty upset. Of course he's not on the East coast, but

239
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,760
it's still when it snows on the East coast, it affects Linus pretty bad. He says, you

240
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,120
people on these coasts think you have it bad with snow storms and whatever. That's nothing.

241
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,800
My coffee maker broke and calling the service hotline says we're not open today due to inclement

242
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,720
weather. You guys get a little snow and suddenly civilization breaks down. My coffee maker

243
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,840
is broken and nobody's answering the phone and CNN just keeps talking about snow. What

244
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,600
about my coffee? Priorities people priorities. What am I going to do without my coffee maker?

245
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,080
Am I just going to sit here in a corner crying? That's what I thought that was supposed.

246
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,960
Some of the comments were pretty good too because it's like, well obviously you need

247
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:06,440
your coffee maker in a raid. Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's

248
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,120
installing all its updates and blocking kernel modules right now. My name is Chris. And my

249
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,160
name is Matt. Hey there, Matt. How you doing? Doing pretty good. Doing pretty good. I'm

250
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,960
excited today. I got a new laptop in that I'm messing with right now. I just got the

251
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:27,200
base OS installed during the pre-show. That's exciting. I got that new computer smell. Right.

252
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,200
Also that new computer wireless frustration. So I've got like a, I've got like a wireless

253
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:36,960
dongle that's hanging off the side of the thing that I took from a raspberry pie. Other

254
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:43,160
than that, it's not so bad. So yeah, I got the new XPS 13 in and it came a lot sooner

255
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,800
than I was expecting. And uh, I guess, I guess the big point, I guess they want safe and

256
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,120
assuming there's a Broadcom thing going on. Yeah. It's called Dell wireless, but it's

257
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,520
a Broadcom. And I guess Dell wanted to cash in those Bitcoins before they dropped any

258
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:00,300
further. So they send it quick. And uh, so I'm, I'm, uh, I'm providing you right now

259
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,280
as we do the show with the wireless, I got a few things. I got, I just installed the

260
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,180
before or whatever it is firmware. I got the firmware just installed, but I think I'm like

261
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,480
halfway through there. So we'll see if I get it by the end of the show. I might get distracted

262
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,480
by the show, but I gotta say it's, it's a nice device. So I'll give you a quick update

263
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,920
about the, uh, the laptop and my first impressions, uh, later on in the show and just a little

264
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,520
bit, because I got a few things and then I'll run Linux on it for a little while and give

265
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,800
you the, uh, the final opinion. I've already gotten several emails, people asking what

266
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,960
I think about it. So I'll tell you that. Hey Matt, you know, it's not a, it's not a real

267
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,980
Linux unplugged without bringing in our virtual lug. So let's delay no longer time appropriate

268
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:43,600
greetings. Mumble room. Hello. Hi. Hi. Hello. So we've got a great show today coming up

269
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,800
on today's episode of Linux unplugged. We're going to do the feedback like we always do.

270
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,080
Then there's been a topic that the IRC room has been chatting about all day. It's this

271
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:57,560
new Vivaldi browser. No, not the tablet. No, not the Vivaldi tablet. Stop it. No, it's

272
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:03,080
a browser. And, uh, it's, it's making a lot of waves today. And of course it premiered

273
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,860
on Linux. So we're gonna talk a little bit about that and I'll give you a quick demo

274
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:11,560
of it in the show. Uh, there's also a couple of items to follow up on in, uh, from last

275
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,320
week's show. And then, uh, we have a little surprise for Matt at the end of the show.

276
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,920
Ooh, really? Yeah. Surprise for Matt. Surprise for Matt at the end of the show. So we'll

277
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,800
see what that's about. So let's start with a quick followup sort of errata from a Sunday's

278
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,880
Linux action show crossroads one, one, one, two writes in to say just a quick note on

279
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,520
the Lumina desktop on arch thing. I actually just had to rename the AR package is now Lumina

280
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,320
dash desktop dash get to avoid confusion with the German locale. Uh, so he says, uh, please

281
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,440
stress also on air that it's missing some features. Most of the network management icon

282
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,520
does not show up yet. Uh, probably cause PCB SD has its own network manager. There's some

283
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,120
upstream work to make it work with Debian. When I get time, I'll look into further Linux

284
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,660
improvements. So it's just early, but just a reminder, the Lumina desktop, which we've

285
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,620
talked about on the show, we've demoed it on the show and we've interviewed Chris, Chris's

286
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,480
brother who's working on it on this show. So I just quick follow up to that. You can

287
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,880
get it on the Lumina desktop. It has now moved over to arch, but there's a few pieces missing

288
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,560
in the packages called Lumina dash desktop dash get and Crossroads wanted me to make

289
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,540
a quick mention of that. So there we go. Jed writes in, and I love this email, Chris, Matt,

290
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,720
my son has finally gotten motivated to actually do something more than play flash games on

291
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,260
Linux. He's been using an old Dell lapi with a broken screen hinge. I decided he could

292
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:32,240
have my broken Lenovo T 43. I like it. Just give him die, passing down broken rigs. Just

293
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,260
like I do. Uh, one of the offices, but here's the conditions. He backed up his old computer

294
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,240
home director using our sink. Uh, he does this his, and then his own district install

295
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,240
and then he installs wine. I gave him links to some, to some tutorials about using our

296
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,200
sink and he already knew how to use G edit. He installed an SSH key for his backup. He

297
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,120
installed 1404 Ubuntu and the XFC weather plugin. And then we churn through a play on

298
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,120
Linux and he learned that we needed to move aside his previous post files and restored

299
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,000
his backup from his files from his first laptop. So now my sixth grader runs Guild Wars two

300
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,720
from his own install effort. He made a deal to get on track and fit and, uh, on field

301
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,680
team and the school in the spring as sort of like a tit for tat. Matt, thank you for

302
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,760
all the efforts on last. We cannot wait for your tutorial show listening since episode

303
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,600
one, Jed.

304
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,000
That's awesome. That's so cool. Sixth grade man. And he's already rocking SSHs. That's

305
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,480
so cool. I love that. I mean, that's like, wow, I'm thinking about like what I was doing

306
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,640
at sixth grade and it's like, uh, had that been an option, that would not probably been

307
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,040
what I was doing. So that's really cool. Yeah. I wonder about like, uh, my kids, like I want

308
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,880
to, uh, I have, uh, I started with the, uh, the Chromebook, but it's just such an unreliable

309
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,880
piece of junk when it's running just Linux and I haven't replaced the, uh, the bios that

310
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:49,240
they nuke it from time to time. So, uh, I, I have like this old HP that's falling apart

311
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,360
that they've used for a while. And I have this really old janky iMac that's it's old,

312
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,400
but I was thinking about maybe putting Linux on that, but really what, what, what my son

313
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,440
Dylan wants it for is to play Minecraft. That's what he wants Linux for. Yeah. He wants Minecraft.

314
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,040
Respect that. Respect that. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, I, he also, you know, would probably play

315
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,840
around with it, but I've, I've, I've been thinking a lot about like, what's the right

316
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,720
computer to get for a kid. Something that is powerful enough to play Minecraft and maybe

317
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,260
a few other games, uh, but not super expensive and a really good Linux box. And I keep thinking

318
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,080
of like the NUC and stuff, but even that's pressing the price of what I want to pay.

319
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,160
So this is an area I've been thinking about. Maybe I need to do is just buy myself more

320
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:34,960
computers and give them a hand-me-down. This is what he's talking about. That sounds like

321
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,000
what Jed does too. And you know what, in a way that's kind of what I've done with my

322
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,660
smartphones. Uh, it's, and it's so straightforward with our first sponsor Ting because you only

323
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,480
pay for what you use. So I can actually have them get like a little tablet and then they

324
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,720
just, whenever we go out in the road and they have, they have to do something that has data,

325
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,400
which happens from time to time. I don't, I don't stress about having to have some sort

326
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,600
of data plan. They just pay for it when they use it. Go over to linux.ting.com to check

327
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,740
out our sponsor Ting. I've been Ting customer for over two years now, saved over $2,000

328
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,040
and I still recommend them every single day. I'm really happy. And I got to say almost

329
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,920
every month since I've been a Ting customer, I feel like there's something new for me to

330
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:15,360
be excited about something that Ting is bringing that I'm like, like they read my mind. And

331
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,180
of course the one I'm thinking of right now is the rollout of GSM. They've already sent

332
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,720
out the first SIM cards to early GSM beta testers. You can actually go over and order

333
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,080
one on the Ting store right now. And I got two of them and I'm going to slide one in

334
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,520
the, I'm going to reload my Nexus 5, get it all clean just cause I wanted to start fresh

335
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,160
anyways and we'll have, or I'm going to try to talk Rekai into doing it. And then after

336
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,160
Rekai does it, I'm going to put my new Ting GSM SIM in there. I'm going to rock Ting GSM

337
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,300
for a while. And you only pay for what you use with Ting. They just take your messages,

338
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,400
your minutes and your megabytes. They add them all up. Whatever bucket you fall into, that's

339
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,560
what you pay at the end of the month. It's just $6 for the line. You starting to see

340
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:56,160
how much sense this makes when you can take advantage of CDMA or GSM. Plus you then consider

341
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,200
all the value you get from an incredible dashboard and no hold customer service. And Ting has

342
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,120
a ton of great devices. I wanted to recommend also you check out their blog. They have a

343
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,400
ton of great tips and tutorials over there. Like here's one. It turns out G plus can be

344
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,720
a huge data hog. The app on your phone, the G plus app can be a massive data hog. So they

345
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,600
just have a quick tutorial on how to clean that up so you can keep G plus, but maybe

346
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:22,520
not have it use up as much data. Nice quick tips like that. Here's just an idea of devices.

347
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:28,080
Right now you can pick up an iPhone 4S from Ting for $130. That's it. You own it right

348
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,440
there. No contract, no early termination fee. iPhone 4S, $130. What about the HD Desire

349
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,440
510 Blue? Also $130. Just add it. A great HTC built phone for $130. Or if you want to

350
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:46,140
go get the Cadillac, the HTC One, $340 over at Ting and you own that phone that's yours.

351
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,580
And that is an amazing phone with an incredible screen, unbelievable speakers, and you might

352
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,000
think that the universal remote that it has built in there is kind of gimmicky, but it's

353
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,800
super cool, especially if you have kids and they lose the remote all the time because

354
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,060
you can turn on stuff with your freaking phone and it really feels like the future. Plus

355
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,600
those front facing speakers kind of alleviate the need for external speakers. So if you

356
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,240
like to listen to podcasts on the go or maybe like when you're doing something and you just

357
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,240
want to set your phone down, like I set it down next to me when I'm doing dishes and

358
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:18,280
I can hear podcasts, perfect with the HTC One. $340, you own that phone, it's yours

359
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,780
from Ting. Isn't that neat? They have all kinds of great devices including just SIM

360
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,940
cards if you want to put a CDMA or GSM SIM in your own device. Linux.ting.com, that supports

361
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:32,300
the show and saves you $25 off your first Ting device or if you have one you can bring,

362
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:38,200
get your $25 credit. Linux.ting.com and a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

363
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Great devices, great prices, and great stuff coming up. There's a Wolf writes in and this

364
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,600
one is kind of, I'm going to punt over to our mumble room to see if they have any experience

365
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,200
with this. He wants to know, he says, hey Chris and Matt, but I'm going to ask the mumble

366
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,920
room Matt if you don't mind. He says, I've heard about ArchBSD. The site is an exact

367
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,400
copy of the Linux homepage but with some BSD modifications. It says the project is all

368
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,920
about porting Pac-Man to free BSD, which they did back in 2010, and they say they keep following

369
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,320
the KISS philosophy. I'm not a BSD guy at all but this might actually be worth a try.

370
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,400
He says keep up the great work. He says he's practicing Markdown, he loves all the shows.

371
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,280
So anyone in the mumble room have any experience with this ArchBSD thing?

372
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,560
A tiny bit.

373
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,640
Yeah? And?

374
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,880
It works and it is BSD with Pac-Man on it. It's kind of compelling.

375
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Interesting.

376
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
Is it current BSD?

377
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,840
That I couldn't say because I'm not so familiar with BSD to tell how current the underpinnings

378
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:43,240
are, but in terms of the packages I could install in it, the packages were definitely

379
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
current.

380
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,920
Too bad Alan's not here. I'm sure he'd have something to say.

381
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:48,920
Yeah, yeah.

382
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,680
I'm sure he'd have some mocking to say. He'd say, what's the point? That's what the port

383
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,000
system is for. That's what package add is for.

384
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,080
Well, that's what the AUR is. It's just a kind of portstree effectively, isn't it? Compile

385
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,080
from source portstree.

386
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,080
Yeah, a better one.

387
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,080
Yeah, well said.

388
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,080
Well, now that I have package NG, which I think is a port of Debian package manager.

389
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,400
Well, it's similar, right? Like in functionality, I've only used it very little. So I, yeah,

390
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:19,400
but I mean, it's, I mean, FreeBSD, honestly, in a lot of ways is doing it right. Yeah,

391
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:24,260
you have the core system and then you have the port system. And so I would imagine if

392
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,000
you could add the AUR on top of that, the problem I would imagine, I have no idea and

393
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
having never used this, but it seems like a crap ton of stuff wouldn't build. It seems

394
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,640
like a lot of stuff wouldn't build.

395
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,640
Why not?

396
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,120
Well, because it's like, it's just a totally different system. It's not an arch system

397
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,300
and there's, it's a totally, I mean, I don't know. I don't move a lot. I don't move around

398
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,960
a lot, but it seems to me like it's already a little tenuous sometimes if stuff is going

399
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,520
to build using AUR. It's not super tenuous, but you still have situations where stuff

400
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,560
just fails to build because something's different. I guess, I guess if you had a completely separate

401
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,160
copy of the AUR and you could modify all the package builds and I guess that was, I guess

402
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,840
if you totally had a separate AUR, then I could see it working, but it doesn't seem

403
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,720
like it would be as beneficial because it wouldn't be as popular. Am I missing something

404
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
here?

405
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,200
No, no, no, no. I mean, I don't know about, I think cross-platform compatibility won't

406
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,960
be such a big, big issue for most projects. I think most things all port almost seamlessly.

407
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,520
I think a lot of the upstream developers these days pay attention to making sure their stuff

408
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,360
works on other platforms other than just Linux.

409
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,200
I suppose the problem's getting less and less as FreeBSD gets more and more popular.

410
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:42,040
And if you look at projects like Arch Linux ARM, for example, they pull in the Arch Linux

411
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:52,160
packages and they just replace the I-686 and X86-64 architecture flags for ARM6 hard float

412
00:24:52,160 --> 00:25:02,400
and ARM7 hard float and things just flow in and 99 times out of 100, stuff just works.

413
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:09,080
But why would you have the AUR? I mean, it would take the focus away from ports.

414
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,080
It's not just the AUR. They've actually got the community and extra repositories, you

415
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,120
know, so they're binary distributions of the packages rather than everything compiled from

416
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
source.

417
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:27,600
Yeah, I suppose the way I look at FreeBSD and OpenBSD, because I mainly float around

418
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,920
the OpenBSD world, you're better off getting those resources that want to work on an AUR

419
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,600
to sort of come on board and submit patches into the ports tree and then maintain ports

420
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,000
because then that way it gets a lot more coverage, a lot more visibility and a lot more testing.

421
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,120
You have a lot more people looking over the code that you're submitting as a port and

422
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,040
then that way you've got a better balance of quality.

423
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:57,900
Most of the Arch derivatives just use the AUR without any abstraction though, because

424
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:05,320
by adding a few architecture flags to a package in the AUR, it's applicable to ARM and PowerPC

425
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:14,040
hardware for those architectures and those spin-off projects that support those platforms.

426
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,160
I find it to be interesting, but it to me never seems like it's something that would

427
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
go mainstream.

428
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:24,480
Yeah, it is interesting. It's not for me, but it's kind of fun to tinker with.

429
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,200
Yeah, it could maybe be for somebody, it could be like the perfect setup, or for a lot of

430
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,000
somebodies even.

431
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,080
So I want to talk about... Oh, a couple of quick things I wanted to mention. I have this

432
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:45,320
XPS 13 laptop. I'll give that just a quick overview. And then also, if anybody out in

433
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:52,520
the audience has considerable audio production editing, like with music and creating sequences

434
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,640
potentially even, and laying that down to an audio track and things like that, and multi-track

435
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,960
editing, send in a shout... Just send me a shout, chris at jupitabroadcasting.com. Let's

436
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
talk.

437
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,000
That was one thing I had. And there was another item, but I forget what it was, but I'll think

438
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,840
of it as the show goes on. But there's another topic of business that I need to talk to the

439
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,440
audience about. But why don't I mention while I'm thinking about it, this XPS 13, because

440
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,280
that's what's got my attention right now.

441
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,540
So I didn't actually expect to get this until halfway into February. So when somebody rang

442
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:30,280
the doorbell, my response is, who the hell is that? That was a joke.

443
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,280
Matt came by to troll you.

444
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,640
Right, so I go down there, and of course it's a small box, and I thought, well this can't

445
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,960
be the laptop, because it doesn't come in a box. It's like this small little box. But

446
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:48,080
no, it was the actual laptop. And it came with Windows 8.1 installed. And I normally,

447
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,400
if I was buying this for myself, I probably wouldn't buy a Dell to begin with. That was

448
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,960
a question that came up on the subreddit. I kind of bought this for two reasons. The

449
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,840
first reason is we have a machine that's going to be getting replaced here in the studio,

450
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,440
and this could go there if it meets all expectations. But the real reason I wanted to get this is

451
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,080
I think this is going to be, from a hardware design standpoint, people who love Lenovo

452
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,080
love Lenovo. But if you're not a Lenovo fan or maybe you want something else, I think

453
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,880
this is going to be the laptop to beat Buildwise. I think this is a MacBook Pro killer, really.

454
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,320
This screen is better than what's shipping on the Macs right now. The resolution's fantastic.

455
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,960
The edge-to-edge glass is super nice. It really looks good. Plus it's a touch screen, which

456
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,640
I, you know, it's not like a big deal for me, but it's an augmented way to do input.

457
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,720
The keyboard's nice. The trackpad's nice. The button reach is good. The build is very

458
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,400
sturdy but it's light. I feel like it doesn't give at all when I'm holding it with one hand

459
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,480
and shaking it. And I don't hear any moving parts. Everything's solid, which is really

460
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:54,960
cool. And it's got two USB 3 ports on it. It has a DisplayPort, SD in, and audio out.

461
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,560
It also has a little battery gauge button on the side that you can press. Speakers are

462
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,000
also on the side. I haven't had a good chance to test them yet. And the battery life, when

463
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I took it out of the box, said 14 hours remaining. I didn't leave it unplugged because Andrew

464
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,480
gross bitches at you during the installation. So, and the keys light up and the keyboard

465
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,720
does feel quite nice. The top has this sort of pattern etched into it that it feels good.

466
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,680
It's not overdone. It's not irritating, but it feels good on the hand. It kind of feels

467
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,240
like a carbon kind of stamping. The hinge is very strong. You know, I'm shaking it right

468
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,240
now and it doesn't give at all. So I think from like a portable tiny Linux rig, I think

469
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,480
this could be a killer unit. Right now I'm fighting with the wireless. So, and I think

470
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,320
if you were to buy the, the developer edition is what they're probably going to call it.

471
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,280
When it ships, you'd probably wouldn't have to worry about things like wireless. I'll

472
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,280
probably just put it like an Intel chip.

473
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,400
They'll probably give you Intel or something. Yeah.

474
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,520
So I'll give, I'll give this further, you know, I'll use this more. The things that

475
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,480
really jumped out at me so far is the speed's great. I got an i7 in there with eight gigs

476
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:59,360
of RAM and the display is very vibrant. It really pops. I don't know how things are going

477
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,720
to work high DPI wise. Gnome itself looks real good. I, you know, I, you know what I'll

478
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,200
do here real quick cause I'll fire up Chrome. Cause I'm thinking where I'm going to, and

479
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,160
the terminal looks really good. So that's, that's kind of the only apps I've used so

480
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,520
far is just Gnome and the terminal. But I'm, I'm firing up Chrome right now and we'll see

481
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,520
how that works. Let's see. Oh yeah. Chrome's a little small.

482
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Oh, is it?

483
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,040
Yeah, it's a little small. I think there's some tweaks in the config you can do, but

484
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,760
yeah, it's definitely a little on the small side. Yeah. So I'll have to do some of that.

485
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,080
So I'll experiment with all of that. So I'll have a full report on Linux and high DPI support

486
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,320
and what tweaks I had to do a wireless tweaks I had to do and stuff like that. Hopefully

487
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,760
I'll get it all a straightened out. And then if you guys make the purchase, by the time

488
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,240
you buy it, I'll have a full report on if it's worth your money or not. And that's the,

489
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,280
that's really the reason why I wanted to get it now. Well, and that price of Bitcoin was

490
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,960
totally crashing. So there you go. I'll give you my full impressions very soon. I got the

491
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,840
one with the 3,200 by 1,800 resolution. I did that on purpose because in a lot of our

492
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,280
distro distro reviews, one of the areas I felt like we didn't really touch on a lot

493
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,320
because we couldn't is how it handles a high resolution display. High resolution displays

494
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,840
are here. High DPI is a real thing in 2015 and a lot of laptops across the line are going

495
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,580
to start shipping with it. So it's time for the Linux to really step up and have good

496
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:21,840
support for that. So I think it's time to incorporate that. It's not going to be a deal

497
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,080
breaker for the reviews, but I think it's kind of important to incorporate that in the

498
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,460
review. So, you know, if this is a distribution or a desktop environment or whatever it is

499
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,520
we're talking about, that'll look good on a high DPI display. So that's another reason

500
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,800
I got this too. So I can speak to the audience from that standpoint too. There you go.

501
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,140
It makes sense to come up with some common set of criteria that people could test their

502
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:45,120
laptop against, like a list of all the things you should check.

503
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,880
Because I know that's something that we've tried to come up with for a different open

504
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,800
source operating system whose name I won't say just because. Anyway, the problem becomes

505
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,220
everybody goes and tries to test things, but they always forget to test the thing that

506
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,520
matters to you, right? The thing that like, you know, high DPI, they might not consider

507
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:09,520
that. You know, they didn't consider does this feature work and how granular is the

508
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,680
backlight control or whatever. And it just seems like it would make sense to come up

509
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:18,600
with a big set of common criteria that anyone when they bought a laptop could just run all

510
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,940
their laptops through all these tests and post the results so that, you know, you kind

511
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,200
of crowdsource the information gathering since, you know, you can't buy every model of laptop

512
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,200
to do this with.

513
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,360
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Crowdsourcing reviews would be interesting. I'm looking at the

514
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:39,360
myfixguide.com breakdown and it looks like not only is the bottom pretty removable, but

515
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,920
the wireless LAN card is right there front and center and labeled very, very generously

516
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,920
by Intel.

517
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,960
Yeah, they're usually like mini PCIe, right?

518
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:51,840
Yeah, and it doesn't look like it's too buried. Looks like it's just you take off those eight

519
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,560
torque screws and then there you go.

520
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,400
So if you do get one that doesn't have wireless that works, like I think that's the problem

521
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
you're having with yours, right?

522
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Yeah.

523
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:05,280
The Intel Centrino 6205 is like $19 at Newegg.

524
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,600
Yeah, I might just get that anyways just that way when I reinstall I don't have to fight

525
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,720
it even if I can get it working.

526
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Yeah.

527
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,520
And here's the SSD storage right there too. So the storage and the wireless look like

528
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:20,160
they're really easy to interchange. So I like that a lot. So cool. So I'll give you an update

529
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,480
because I literally just took it out of the box before the show started. I put it into

530
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,920
Windows once. Yeah, there's a better shot of the wireless card right there. Yeah, that's

531
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,040
going to be a really easy swap out.

532
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:35,800
I think that OS that Alan was referring to just a little bit ago rhymes with CDFB.

533
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:42,880
That doesn't ring a bell, Eric. I think he's talking about Haiku.

534
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
Yeah.

535
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
No, BUS.

536
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,560
Yeah. Oh, jeez, gosh, guys. The question, Marky asked, what's the Markdown editor I

537
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,960
use? It's called Herupad. Herupad's really great. And there's other ones too.

538
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
Spell that for us.

539
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:00,280
What's that? Herupad? Yeah, sure. It's H-A, let me pull it up right here. Of course, it

540
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
doesn't just say.

541
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,280
Even Chris doesn't know how to spell it.

542
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:11,400
No, I just want to make sure I get it right. H-A-R-O-O-P-A-D. And this is it right here

543
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,760
on my screen. This is today's episode of Tech Talk Today on my screen. And you see in one

544
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,160
column is my Markdown code, and the other column is the output. But what, okay, you're

545
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,840
like, okay, that's not too neat, Chris. A lot of Markdown editors do that. What's really

546
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,040
cool about this Markdown editor is you can go into the settings and you can pull down

547
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,960
your CSS files from your website and have the stuff in the preview rendered with your

548
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,480
website's real CSS, and you can really see really what it's going to look like on your

549
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:40,560
website. That is really cool because, for example, the Jupyter Broadcasting website,

550
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,160
it renders quotes slightly different than other websites render quotes, just the way

551
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:50,080
the block quote looks. So it's nice to have that. So yeah, it's Herupad, and it's a bit

552
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:57,480
of a monster. It's written on top of Node.js, but it has all of like under the insert menu,

553
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,480
it has all of the Markdown, like all your basic Markdown stuff all ready to go, and

554
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:05,760
these are also hot keyed. You can pull up in the help menu, it has all the key commands.

555
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,040
And so, you know, like, for example, Control Shift I inserts an image. Control Shift Q

556
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:17,520
makes everything a quote. Control 4 is a heading 4. Control 2 is a heading 2. So it's really

557
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,760
nice and makes it really fast to rip through Markdown. So it's Herupad, and we've talked

558
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,360
about it before. I've made it a pic a long time ago on last, so it's probably also linked

559
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:32,160
in the last pics. So there you go. If you can stomach Node.js, you won't even know.

560
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,640
It's all like a self-contained Chromium app.

561
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,760
You know, I think you should do it just for the shortcuts alone, because shortcuts rock.

562
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,760
Yeah.

563
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,760
I love shortcuts. I'm all about the keyboard.

564
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,920
Yeah, and don't forget, if you want to practice your Markdown, we have OpenYourMouth.recipes,

565
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,720
which are open source GPLed community recipes written in Markdown. It's a great place to

566
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,160
scratch that Markdown itch. And Herupad, you could write in there and then post it up on

567
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:57,040
our GitHub page, OpenYourMouth.recipes, open source recipes from the community. Hey, Matt,

568
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,160
you know, if you're going to say maybe you want to have your own GitLab or host your

569
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,200
own Ghost installation, or maybe you want to just mess around with free BSD, well, then

570
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,400
our next sponsor might have something that could interest you. That's DigitalOcean. Yes,

571
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,600
DigitalOcean's a great place to go to get your own cloud server. They're a simple cloud

572
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,600
hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and easy way for you to spin

573
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,360
up your own cloud server. You'll get root access to it, powered by Linux and KVM. You

574
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:26,640
can get started in less than 55 seconds. Jay e-mailed me today. 23 seconds was his spin

575
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,120
up time. He got it all set up in 23 seconds. That is nuts. And pricing plans start only

576
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,960
$5 a month for 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a freaking terabyte

577
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,120
of transfer. Oh my gosh, I cannot even, this just blows my mind. I've been around for a

578
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:45,760
long time. This is just, I cannot, I remember a time in a data center when I had a colo

579
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,240
rig and I spent over $1,500 for a terabyte of transfer in a single month. DigitalOcean

580
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:55,260
has data center locations in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, and London,

581
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,720
and their interface is amazing. It's so simple and intuitive and extremely powerful at the

582
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:04,480
same time. They didn't water it down. You can do your DNS management. You can take your

583
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,800
backup snapshots. You can resize your images. You can add RAM. You can move them. You can

584
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,760
transfer them. You can do console HTML5 level access, even watch the boot up screen from

585
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:19,320
post all the way up to your main Linux rig. It's so, or freeBSD, it's so cool. And they've

586
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:24,680
got core OS as well. And they've got this API that the community has just written a

587
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,880
ton of great stuff for. You could write your own stuff for it and, you know, extend the

588
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,080
functionality of the dashboard, however you like, snap it into whatever you need to snap

589
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,760
it into for management. But me, I just take advantage of all the great apps that have

590
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:43,840
been written. DigitalOcean.com. Go over there. Use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED. DOUNPLUGGED.

597
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,320
And why not just de-cloud yourself a little bit? Take a look at what you have up in the

598
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,360
cloud, what third-party services you're using, and ask yourself, could I easily move that

599
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,440
over? This week's episode of Quota Radio, Mike was giving some tips on ways to save

600
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,040
money for development and primarily a great way to push updates out to your websites and

601
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:33,960
stuff totally for free once you set up the DigitalOcean Droplet. It was a great tip and

602
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,320
it's another great example of things you can use DigitalOcean for. We've got it running

603
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,600
a whole bunch of Ruby. We've got it running our BitTorrent for the backend syncing of

604
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,440
all the unfilter stuff, which is nuts. I mean, we have hundreds of syncs going on there.

605
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,220
It's all running off DigitalOcean Droplets. It's really awesome. It's unbelievably, it's

606
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:54,080
just an incredible great value and the management is so straightforward. DigitalOcean.com, use

607

608
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,840
about and support the show. DigitalOcean.com. DOUNPLUGGED. And a big thanks to DigitalOcean

609
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,160
for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged program.

610
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,240
Now, I want to talk a little bit about this Vivaldi browser because everybody's writing

611
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,920
about it. Everybody's talking about it. Chatter's been going about it. It's not a tablet. It's

612
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,120
a Chromium-powered, multi-platform browser. It's making some waves, if that's still a

613
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:23,760
thing. It's supported by Linux, Windows, and OS X. It's currently offered as a tech preview,

614
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,280
so it's got Chromium under the hood, but another, a bunch of features that sort of remind you

615
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,480
maybe of Opera during its glory days. Among them is speed dial and mouse gestures. Also

616
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,320
new features like allowing multiple tabs to be combined into a single stack. Support for

617
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,740
note-taking within the browser. You know, you need to take notes on a website. And other

618
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:45,980
improvements to the Chromium base. Started by a former CEO of Opera who has not been

619
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:52,720
with Opera for years. They plan in the future to include things like mail built-in, sync,

620
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,320
spatial navigation, greater performance. They want to be the fastest browser in the universe,

621
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,480
they say. Extensions and other community features. And it's available right now for Linux. I

622
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,280
have it installed right here if you're watching the show.

623
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,120
Matt, are you ready for another browser? Oh yes, absolutely. You know what we need?

624
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,260
We need another browser. And preferably one that's based on an existing browser because

625
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:16,760
then we can really hit, geez. You know, I'm going to not be cynical about it. It could

626
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,880
be awesome. It really could. I'm going to just hold my hopes up.

627
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,280
Well, okay, I'll play devil's advocate. I mean, I kind of agree with you, but if we

628
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:29,320
accept that maybe Blink and WebKit are as good as we're going to get for a little while,

629
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,760
then maybe it is good that the innovation's done more at the UI because I think you and

630
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:37,480
I both have lamented, the browsers really suck still. Like, there's not a browser, either

631
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,960
one of us are like totally jazzed up like, man, I just love Chrome. I love Firefox. You

632
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,540
know, like I use Firefox, I use Chrome.

633
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,080
So for me, it's like from a UI perspective, and this is excluding bookmarks because that's

634
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:55,400
a separate issue. From a UI perspective, Firefox makes people want to eat bags of glass and

635
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:59,360
Chromium and Chrome are frankly just more pleasant to use. Now, that being said, Firefox

636
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,720
performance destroys Chrome and Chromium because it sucks on Linux, and then you have bookmarks,

637
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,160
which is a completely separate issue because the problem with bookmarks is, hi, 1995, can

638
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,000
I have my bookmarks, please? I mean, this is stupid. The bookmarking system is what

639
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,120
really needs to evolve, more so than in my opinion. Bookmarks suck. I add stuff. I've

640
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:23,000
got bookmarks from like 2002 in there. I don't even know what they are. What is this?

641
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,320
I do like the UI. I think it's very nice, but they're not bringing a lot of new stuff

642
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:33,120
to the team, you know, and they don't have all of my plugins that I want to use. It seems

643
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:38,000
pretty fast. The UI is okay. It actually does have a few specific features that I've never

644
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
seen in anything else. Alright, lay it on me, sir. One, UI changes. Yeah, chameleonic.

645
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:50,900
If you ever used, what is it? That little fucking text editor, it actually has a little

646
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:55,320
command UI you can press F2 and you can do commands. Yeah, it does support like hotkey

647
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:01,400
navigation and stuff. Yes, that. I've never seen that in anywhere else. Also, since Opera

648
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:08,320
has done a lot of those weird little browser enhancements, it's got little tab UI. You

649
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:12,820
can drag the top down and see previews of your tabs or hover over them, which is what

650
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,560
the old Opera used to do. Oh, that is nice. But it's actually quite interesting. I like

651
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,880
the way it displays your current tab too. It's really easy to see which is the current

652
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:24,500
active tab. Okay, so the first implementation, it's not so bad. This is actually the way

653
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,760
they color the tabs is actually kind of smart. It's chameleonic depending on the... The whole

654
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,960
top bar changes. Yep, take a look at the whole top bar. Everything changes. I gave it a snapshot

655
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:41,240
of Jupiter Blood. Those tab stacks are brilliant. Yeah, that is pretty cool. Oh yes, there is

656
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:47,080
some interesting bits about it. Yeah, so tab stacks in their words, yeah. I think tab stacks

657
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:51,520
I like better because you can see it right by hovering over it. For me, tab stacks is

658
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,720
easier than tab groups because tab groups are put off somewhere else. They're hidden

659
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,200
in a way. Whereas tab stacks are just right here. And the way they demonstrate the lines

660
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,600
so you can see how many tabs are in this stack is really clever too. You can actually drag

661
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:11,740
down right above the URL bar. You can actually have a little thing like the little drag down

662
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:16,480
and you can drag down the top and have visual pieces of tabs right up at the top. And their

663
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,680
settings looks very deep in our progression. Oh, I see. The settings manager is very interesting.

664
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,400
Oh, look at that. You can just get a little peek too. You can just have a little peek

665
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,600
of the... That's really cool. Yes, it's the old Opera. It's coming back. The guys, the

666
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,440
real balls are actually putting their ideas forth again. That's cool. I don't know how

667
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,240
much you guys have used it but I've been using it all today and it is super fast. This is

668
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,680
the first time I've tried it. I mean, after Chrome and Firefox, this is refreshingly quick.

669
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,280
It feels like 2015 on the internet, the speed at which... Oh, and you can put the tabs on

670
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,800
the left side which is really nice for widescreen. Actually, you can remove the tabs. Completely

671
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,840
say none. No tabs at all. There's no other one I've seen which can remove the tabs. Chris,

672
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,640
this is one of the reasons that people that used to use Opera are so passionate about

673
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,800
it is because they do things in a completely fundamentally different way. And when you

674
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:12,540
get used to it, going to a standard Firefox or a standard Chrome browser is just... It

675
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:19,360
feels clunky. I'm digging all the key commands. So Wimpy says it's super fast. I find that's

676
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:24,840
the case on a brand new clean install of Chrome, Chromium, Firefox, or basically insert name

677
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:30,040
of browser here. As soon as you start using it and fill in some... Throw in some extensions,

678
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,640
yeah. Yeah, throw some extensions in there and then all your bookmarks and then you start

679
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:43,680
visiting a load of pages. They all slow down to a bag of crap. All of them. If you take

680
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:51,760
a fresh Chrome or a fresh Firefox and you don't fill it with the shit ton of plugins

681
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,160
that you use, Poppy. You know I don't use shit ton. I have like three plugins on all

682
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:06,560
my browsers and they all run like you're swimming in treacle. If you go for a plugin less Chrome

683
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:12,080
or Firefox and compare the speed that this renders pages and visit pages that you've

684
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:17,440
not been to in any of the browsers, this is very, very quick at rendering pages. Are we

685
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:26,680
doing another browser challenge? I've not been that excited about a new browser since

686
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:33,720
I first started using Chrome in 2008. This is really good. Should I tell you the one

687
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:40,520
drawback? Yeah, sure. Sounds amazing. The user interface is basically Amiga OS 3.5.

688
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:47,480
It's so flat. It's $19.99. But other than that, it's brilliant. I like the loading bar

689
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,080
too. Sublime text. The little command thing. You can press F2 and it'll give you a sublime

690
00:45:52,080 --> 00:46:01,280
text command. Oh my gosh. That is so cool. That is the neatest. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.

691
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:09,120
Oh my gosh. That is so cool. Can you hear that guys? Look at there's all my tabs and

692
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:15,120
then here's all of the commands I could do. Oh my gosh. This is so cool. One of the reasons

693
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,760
why Firefox can slow down over time is because you're building up that SQLite database for

694
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,520
the awesome bar and a bunch of other stuff. So if you feel your browser is slow, try a

695
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,600
fresh profile. It's not necessarily just plugins that make it slow. That's excellent. If you

696
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:36,760
can add this alongside a fresh profile. I'm pretty sure that's exactly what I said just

697
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:42,480
now which is any browser which is super clean is good and then after you use it for a while

698
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,860
it turns to shit. Yeah, but you were saying it was the plugins that were default and usually

699
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:51,160
it's not. No, I didn't. The only thing that I miss is the ad blocker. Have you seen how

700
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,600
the... Is the databases and stuff and maybe we should find something better. Yeah, I noticed

701
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:04,140
this. It's a nice little touch. The navigational buttons, so back home, reload and all of that,

702
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:10,320
as you visit a website it automatically themes those controls to the color profile of the

703
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:16,440
website that you're viewing. For a debut, for a technical preview, this is really polished

704
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:21,900
and very slick. Yeah. And I've already mentioned on this forum to open source this thing as

705
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,800
much as they can because I want them to because this is pretty darn interesting. Yeah, that

706
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,160
is the thing we have to talk about. That's the elf in the room is that it's not open

707
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:34,080
now. Blink or whatever, Chromium or whatever you're going to say it's based on is but the

708
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:40,680
Chrome around it is not. Well, Opera is the same situation. I'm trying to put their balls

709
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:44,960
in a vise to get them to open their code. I guess the question is how do they make a

710
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,680
business out of it then? Donations? Like most open source projects depend unless they're

711
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:58,360
going to sell their code to the Wii again like they used to with the old Opera. So Wimpy,

712
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:01,960
you think it's a bigger deal than we're giving it credit because the browser is the new OS?

713
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:07,080
You think this is a huge thing? Yeah, this is precisely my point. I think that from this

714
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:13,240
point onward the browser is the operating system and Chromebooks have proven that point

715
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:19,320
over the last year more than anything else. And I think having a choice in our browser

716
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:27,000
options is as important as having choice over our operating systems. I would agree. The

717
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,920
only reason internet browsers got better is because we've had competition otherwise we'd

718
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:38,200
all still be stuck. Helpy competition is a good thing. May the best browser win. May

719
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:43,240
the best browser help everyone else. And I think this is one to watch and I like that

720
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,640
they launched with cross-platform support out of the bag. I think that's a really good

721
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,200
sign. I don't think it's going to make me switch. Well, maybe. It depends on where the

722
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,920
plug-in direction goes. I see the thing is that that launcher that it has, I could probably

723
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,400
go get that for any browser with an extension, but I do like that a lot. That is really cool.

724
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,000
So it's the Vivaldi browser. We'll have a link in the show notes if you guys want to

725
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,280
check it out. That sounds like a lot of you have been trying it though. So I'm going to

726
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,240
keep it around for a little bit. I need things like tab sync and all kinds of fancy stuff

727
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:18,360
though. I really am pretty demanding. All I want is a better bookmark handling. That's

728
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,580
all I want. And I've tried the plug-ins and I've tried all these hacks and variations

729
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:27,200
and well, everybody's got the new, what? No, it's crap. It's crap. It's still the same

730
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:33,400
old. What is the problem with bookmarks though? I have 5,000 plus of them and I'd like to

731
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:40,800
make heads and tails out of them. I have Firefox bookmarks because I actually can't not use

732
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:45,320
Firefox because of the bookmark structure is so awesome. With the keywords searching

733
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:52,000
where I can just jump back and forth with just using commands. I need something to automate

734
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,600
bookmarks. I think there's probably a self-help group for Matt. For people like Matt who have

735
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:05,360
thousands of bookmarks. I personally have zero. I just don't use bookmarks. I just

736
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:10,960
use Google really, really well. I have about a thousand. I use Pinboard as a third-party

737
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,120
service I can access from any computer in any browser by logging in. That might be an

738
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:21,040
option. Yahoo failed as an entity because they tried to catalogue the internet by themselves.

739
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:27,600
What would you try? They tried it with humans was the problem. All right, I will give...

740
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:32,040
X marks has some kind of like auditing the stuff. Yeah. I'll give, because Alex has been

741
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:36,160
wanting to say it a hundred times. Alex, you wanted to say something from the perspective

742
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:45,920
of a Firefox user. I've been using Firefox with a lot of tabs and a lot of bookmarks.

743
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:51,680
For me, bookmarks are like my own personal search engine. What I would like one day would

744
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,560
be to have Yacy integrated into Firefox. Sure. A real search engine in my browser. Yeah,

745
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:05,960
that'd be cool. About tabs, the old Operado version 12 and the current Firefox are the

746
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:15,120
only tab browsers that support over 200 tabs. I usually have around 100 open tabs at some

747
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:29,000
point and the maximum I reached is around 600 at some point. That is respectable. I've

748
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,240
heard a few other people, like I had a client that always had a whole bunch of browser windows

749
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:36,240
open a whole bunch. I always get worried. I always get worried that my browser is going

750
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,960
to die on me and that I'll lose all that. I don't have faith in the auto restore system.

751
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,980
That's what I actually use bookmarks for is I use just mainly my menu bar and I just stashed

752
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:51,440
stuff in there. Matt, we have a surprise for you that I want to get to, but before we do

753
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,920
that, I've got something really exciting to talk about. That's Linux Academy, the sponsor

754
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,680
of the Linux Unplugged show. Linux Academy is always rolling out tons of new features.

755
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,120
That's why I want to encourage you to go over to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged and take

756
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,160
advantage of our discount. They just rolled out a new Ruby course, which is perfect for

757
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,640
me because Matt, I'm going to go, I don't know if I'm crazy, but I'm going to go teach

758
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:17,120
myself Ruby. I hadn't decided. I was on the fence and then Linux Academy was like, yeah,

759
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,760
we got a new course on Ruby. I'm like, all right, well now I feel like I've been given

760
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,760
the pathway to follow. I can't really mess it up if I go with Linux Academy. I want you

761
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,560
to go check them out too. Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged. Get your special unplugged

762
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,040
discount. They've got step-by-step video courses for everything you're doing, comprehensive

763
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,520
study guides you can download, getting to break you out time estimates of how long each

764
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,960
stuff's going to take. It comes with your own server as the lab course requires it,

765
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,000
pins it right up, whatever Linux distribution you've chosen. That's what the server OS is

766
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,280
and of course all the courseware just kind of adapts to match that. And I think that's

767
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,300
a pretty nice feature if you're maybe moving from one distro to another, like if you switch

768
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:53,440
jobs from a Red Hat place to an Ubuntu place or Debian to CentOS, something like that.

769
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,360
You get to keep track of your progress as you're going right as you log in the dashboard

770
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,000
to give you a percentage heads up of where you're at with your different stuff, how long

771
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,280
the next section is going to take you. They have learning plans. You go in there and you

772
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,840
say, hey, I've got this much time on Monday, this much time on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

773
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:10,400
Friday, Saturday, Sunday. I can allocate this much time, generate me a plan, and Linux Academy

774
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,240
system will create a custom plan that matches that schedule that you've laid out with reminder

775
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:17,760
systems to keep you going. Plus, as a Jupyter Broadcasting community member, you'll meet

776
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,440
lots of like-minded folks who are there from Jupyter Broadcasting in the community that

777
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,300
can give you a bump when you're kind of slowing down a little bit. Also, go make sure you

778
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,620
check out their new Docker courseware. There's not another technology that's hotter right

779
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:33,680
now in the Linux space and they've got great stuff, great courseware on Docker. Also, vagrant

780
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,480
virtualization options up the wuzang from KVM to Zen. They got it all. You guys should

781
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:42,480
go check it out at Linux Academy. Ruby, Android development, OpenStack, the whole DevOps category

782
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,440
they've got courseware for over at Linux Academy. It's a really valuable service. LinuxAcademy.com

783
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:53,040
slash unplugged. Go check them out and support your favorite talk show, Linux Unplugged.

784
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,440
That's a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring the Linux Unplugged show. LinuxAcademy.com

785
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,800
slash unplugged. Thanks, you guys, and thanks to all the audience members who support Linux

786
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:10,000
Unplugged. Okay, Matt. I think there's probably a portion of folks who watch this show or

787
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,160
listen to this show that don't watch or listen to last. For those who are not current, this

788
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:20,260
Sunday, the episode that just aired, was Matt's last official day as co-host, although I'm

789
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:25,340
sure he'll be back to the show from time to time to visit. He's launching with producer

790
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:31,680
Q5SIS who's here today as well. The rebirth, the raising from the ashes of our How-To Linux

791
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:38,320
show. Better focused, stronger than before. Matt, we thought we'd do a little parting

792
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:43,620
tradition as a send-off for the years of great service on the Linux action show right here

793
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:49,120
on Unplugged for our last segment of the show. I'm going to kick it off. You may have heard

794
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:54,400
there's this great new graphics card that's out there on the market. In fact, Ferronix

795
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,720
just gave it a great review for Linux gamers. It's called the GeForce GTX 960. It uses the

796
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:04,640
latest Maxwell GPU from Nvidia. I, as a thank you to Matt, now it's here at the studio,

797
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:09,720
Matt, but I ordered you a brand new video card, a GTX 960, so you can try out the 960

798
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:13,040
in the Linux rig and give us a report back on how it works here on the Unplugged show

799
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:18,800
because now on Sundays you're going to need to get some gaming picked up. Some folks in

800
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,320
the Mumble Room to kind of sweeten the deal a little bit are going to send some Steam

801
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,400
games that they have available in the library. I want to encourage anybody in the audience

802
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:31,440
too that wants to help Matt put his new Nvidia 960 card to use. I have Matt's Steam profile

803
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:36,560
linked in the show notes. It's ironspankingmatt, which is, I don't know, where does ironspanking

804
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:40,160
come from, Matt? Is that like a metal reference? Oh, that was an unreal, actually a little

805
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,760
bit. No, it was actually an Unreal Tournament thing. Back when I was really playing that,

806
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,840
someone felt like they, there's like a backstory to it, basically long and short of it. It's

807
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,200
an Unreal Tournament ironspanking kind of deal. So I thought a good way to do it would

808
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,620
be to get you to waste a bunch of time. So the audience and I came together and Blaster

809
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:00,840
chipped into on the video card here. So that'll be here in the studio next time when you come

810
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:06,360
down to shoot your first batch of how to Linux, you can leave with the new GTX 960. Oh, that

811
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,400
is awesome. Thanks. I appreciate that. That's fantastic. That's really cool. Then just give

812
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,440
us a report here on Unplugged in the future of how it went. Yeah, for sure. Thanks, Matt.

813
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,000
And watch out for Steam games coming your way. I think a few folks in the audience are

814
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,560
going to send you some. Yeah, I'm still sorting through email and I've actually got a couple

815
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:27,640
thanks to send it out. Cool. And then you'll keep us posted on when how to Linux launches,

816
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,480
which we'll have probably in February sometime. Q5, is there anything you want to jump in

817
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:36,640
at this point before we move off from that topic? You good? Going once? Just that if

818
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:45,200
anybody has ideas for good topics, send them in. That's about it. There you go. Okay. And

819
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:49,200
we'll have ways to do that too. And I think we still have the, we still have the how to

820
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,520
Linux email account you can email as well. Or you can ping us in the subreddit. We're

821
00:56:52,520 --> 00:57:00,000
checking that or email Matt or Q5. Yeah. Either way. There's a lot of ways to get in your

822
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,600
suggestions and we'll come up with some official ways to submit them into the show. I know

823
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:06,680
we've had some, we've had some like spreadsheets in the past, but we'll figure it out. So Matt,

824
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,400
enjoy the new gaming setup. Oh, definitely. You now got like a way nicer video card than

825
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,480
I've got, I think. I was going to say that's really stylin'. That's hard, Matt. I was like

826
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:23,840
no, no, it's a nice parting gift. It's a have fun with this. That's awesome. And then on

827
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:28,640
Sunday show, I actually don't have the full show planned out yet, but Noah is landing

828
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:34,860
in the Pacific Northwest probably Thursday, depending on his work schedule. And he'll

829
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:39,000
be in studio for Sunday's Linux action show. And I'm probably going to take him out to

830
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,720
dinner and stuff like that. So I don't know what all our plans are, but I think it's going

831
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,920
to be a really fun show on Sunday. We'll have some, some shenanigans that we'll probably

832
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,840
have planned by, by Sunday. So we'll have Noah in studio to kick off his new reign as

833
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:54,880
co-host on the show. And we'll update you guys on the how to Linux progress as we've

834
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:58,080
got it. I think it's getting, it's coming along quite well. So we'll probably have an

835
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:03,140
update very soon. Okay. Cool. All right. Well, and thanks to everybody who sent the stuff

836
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:08,000
to, to Matt. We were talking about it on tech talk after today. We were scheming while still

837
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,480
on the air and I wasn't sure if you were listening or not. I didn't think you were. I thought

838
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,280
we were safe. Cause it was, you know, I was obliviously. Yeah, no, I was actually, I think

839
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:21,280
I was picking up dog do at the time. But yeah, my glamorous life as a co-host. I like that.

840
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,280
It's good. I think that's a good way to do that and listen to Chris's other show. I think

841
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,240
that's, you know, you can do both at the same time. You can do both at the same time. Yeah,

842
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,640
you can, you can. Although, although it's an art form to pick up the poo. You just go

843
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:37,140
over to jblive.info on your portable device and we've got a high bit rate and low bit

844
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,680
rate audio streams. Or you can go to jblive.tv if you're on the wifi where you're out there

845
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:45,480
picking up the poop, Matt. So there you go. It's a little tech talk tip. That is the tech

846
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:48,960
talk show. We do that on a, we do that in the mornings. You guys should check that out.

847
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,480
But Hey, don't forget who cares about tech talk. Join us next Tuesday for the episode

848
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,440
78 of Linux Unplugged. Come get it in. If you've never made a live show, get it in before

849
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,680
we had episode 80. You got a little bit of time left. We do the show on Tuesday and if

850
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:27,200
I don't see you on Tuesday, hope to see you on Sunday. Bye, everybody.

851
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:42,680
Matt, picking up poop like a good neighbor should. Well, you know, after a while, you

852
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:46,920
step in it so many times. It's just a sanitary, it's a sanitary thing for the dogs. I don't

853
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:52,160
want to walk through it. Yeah, no kidding. Yeah. No, I'm old school. Get yourself a bag,

854
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:56,280
be a man, bend over, pick that stuff up. I don't understand why we're wasting our times

855
00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:00,720
on Roombas when this is a job that can be done by robots. I don't get it. There's actually

856
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,840
a poop 911 business here in town, you know, for people who don't want to pick up their

857
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:11,080
own apparently. All right. JBtitles.com. JBtitles.com. Yeah, Matt, they have those on the East Coast.

858
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:17,680
It's called Duty Calls. Nice. I like that. The fourth browser, the fourth browser is

859
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,320
not bad. The fourth browser is not bad. All right, you guys go over there. JBtitles,

860
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:25,920
go boat. I had a little shout out. I noticed a thread in the subreddit that needs more

861
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:31,320
of. A day ago, Stofaloaf2 submitted, what does your prompt look like? And he submitted

862
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:36,040
his and we've got a few other folks. There's 12 comments in here, but not a lot of pictures.

863
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,940
So I want to look at people's desktop porn. So if you would go over to that subreddit

864
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:46,000
post and I'll have it linked in the post show notes. Go submit your desktop. I like looking

865
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,080
at people's desktops. I even tried to do an episode of it once. It's in the subreddit.

866
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,480
I'll link to it in the IRC right now and I'll have it linked in the show notes for this

867
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:57,480
episode of Unplugged. But I like looking at people's desktops so much, I tried to make

868
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,840
an episode out of it. It was like a super boring episode. So I don't do it anymore,

869
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:05,280
but I still like looking at them. So go over there so I can, I get ideas. And I just got

870
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:11,280
a new laptop. Just for reference, when Angela did it, it was an exciting show. I know. Because

871
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:18,200
she does it with awards. I don't have awards. I just gawk. But I got a new laptop set up,

872
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:25,120
so I want inspiration. I've actually converted my KDE set up to look like Gnome. Oh jeez.

873
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:31,560
That's where it starts. And by the way, I have 931 unread Reddit messages. So if you

874
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:37,000
message me on Reddit... Good grief. Good luck with that now. Yeah, I'm sorry. I don't mean

875
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,080
to ignore you, but at a certain point I can only respond to so many different communication

876
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:46,920
methods. Same with Facebook. I don't really respond on Facebook either. Okay. JBtitles.com,

877
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,720
Vivaldi, the 4th browser. Is that too long? What about just the 4th browser? It just seems

878
01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:56,720
like it, because it's four words. Yeah, alright. I do like having Vivaldi in the title. Yeah.

879
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:03,400
Alright, we'll go with that. Nicely done, Wimpy. Nicely done. You're welcome. I'm glad

880
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,680
you had a chance to get the tires too, because you guys had some great tips for me to check

881
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:11,800
out, because I literally just installed it before the show. Or during the pre-show. And

882
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:18,560
it's pretty nice. I think I'm going to live with this for a good little while, because

883
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,560
it's really terrific. Well, I'm going to check back in with you then. Oh, geez, Wimpy. Get

884
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:28,280
a room. Well, you know, I'm usually a miserable old curmudgeon. I've found something that's

885
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:34,840
really quite... It's new and it's good. What is it? The Luddites say? This is the antithesis,

886
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:41,560
the opposite of that. Some change is progress. Popey, don't judge. It makes them happy. And

887
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:46,840
I know Alan, don't ruin my mood. You've been super helpful the last two days. Don't make

888
01:02:46,840 --> 01:03:12,960
me all grouchy and miserable, coming in here and bitching at me.
