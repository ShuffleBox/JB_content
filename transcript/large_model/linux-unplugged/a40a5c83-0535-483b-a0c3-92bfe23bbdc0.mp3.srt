1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
I have a really embarrassing story to start with.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,400
Oh, yes.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,700
So, I know I'm going to get crap about this all the time by sharing this, but I have to

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,900
just let you know, so in case the audience out there runs into this, they know what the

5
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:12,900
fix is.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,680
So, you know, last week, Wes, like a champ, you set up a Starbound server during the show,

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,680
and that evening...

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,680
That was fun.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,320
So that evening, I was kind of in a unique position because, you know, when you live

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,080
in a tiny home, when you get offered to house-sit for somebody in downtown Seattle, you take

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
that up.

12
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,080
Hey, that sounds nice.

13
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,960
By the way, that's a little relationship pro-tip too, and that offer comes along, you've got

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
to try to accept that.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
You say, yes.

16
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,960
Yes.

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,960
So, we go down and we start house-sitting Tuesday evening, we were going to, you know,

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:49,240
wake up there Wednesday morning, and I get down there, and I don't have any Wi-Fi access.

19
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,000
The password, they didn't leave it on the notes, we can't get a hold of them, I can't

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
get on the internet.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,200
So, in a moment of panic, because I want to play Starbound.

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Naturally.

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,080
I turn on tethering on my phone, I'm like, I'm just going to use phone data, this is

24
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,080
important.

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
Thank you, Ting.

26
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Yeah.

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,800
And I connect, and I start playing, and I'm wondering, is Wes online?

28
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,320
And I'm playing along, and all of a sudden I notice that I'm having kind of a hard time

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,760
controlling and looking around.

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,760
Okay.

31
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:18,240
I can't really explain why, but I keep seeming to get this intermittent freeze, or pause

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,240
in the game.

33
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
Bop, bop.

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
Bop, bop.

35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
Every three, four seconds.

36
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Maybe every three seconds.

37
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
Bop.

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
Bop, bop.

39
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,600
And it's like, you know, when you're in a battle or something, it's just enough to kill

40
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
you.

41
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
It's just not untenable.

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
And it's really, it was like, really distracting.

43
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,720
And I'm like, well, maybe I have a video driver problem.

44
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
Maybe I have a power manag-

45
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
Sure.

46
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
Sure.

47
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
There's a lot of options.

48
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Yeah.

49
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
I start looking, maybe it's a power management setting, like a CPU frequency.

50
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,800
And I'm chatting with Rekai, and I'm tethered to my phone, and I'm looking up stuff online,

51
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,800
and I'm-

52
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,800
You're in full troubleshooting mode.

53
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,480
This is like, this is not how I was going to use my mobile data, but now I got to know,

54
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,240
and like, we're down, we're house sitting, and of course my lady, she's like, so do you

55
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,240
want to come out on the deck, or-

56
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,240
Yeah, we're going to hang out on the deck.

57
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,240
What are you doing?

58
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,240
Yeah, I got this bottle of wine here.

59
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,240
What are you doing?

60
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
And I'm like, I got to fix this.

61
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,680
This is important.

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,480
And I dig around, and I dig around, and I'm starting, and I'm trying things.

63
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,920
I'm adding kernel boot parameters.

64
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,080
I'm tweaking the X config according to the Arch Wiki for Skylake graphics.

65
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,320
I'm making all these modifications to my system, and I'm rebooting, and I'm rebooting, and

66
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,320
I'm rebooting.

67
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,240
And one of the times I log in, the problem's fixed.

68
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Oh.

69
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,920
That diggity dang, that link Rekai found me about the kernel parameter fixed it.

70
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
Look at that.

71
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,920
And I go to hit one of my keys, and I realize that nothing happens because none of my extensions

72
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
are loaded.

73
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,920
Oh.

74
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,680
So I quickly go remove the kernel boot parameter, reboot again with extensions off.

75
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,240
The game doesn't have the glitch.

76
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,720
I log out of Gnome login with extensions on.

77
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,720
The glitch is back.

78
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
The glitch is back.

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,920
And I start to notice that the glitch also exists in video playback.

80
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,240
It exists sometimes when just moving the mouse really quickly.

81
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,720
I start noticing, like, when I'm dragging Nautilus windows around, I can see that glitch,

82
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,640
and I'm like, what is going on here?

83
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,520
It's interesting that the plugin has the ability to cause so much trouble.

84
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:06,720
So I discovered it was my system monitor Gnome extension, which is a really cool system monitor

85
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,360
extension that puts all of your hardware devices in an icon, just icons.

86
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,880
And so instead of having, like, all of these moving menu meters and stuff like that up

87
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:17,800
in your toolbar, you have an icon that represents your CPU and your disk and your NIC, and you

88
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,160
click those, and it drops down, and you get an expansive dropdown menu of your entire

89
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,640
system resources.

90
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Well.

91
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,000
It sounds nice enough.

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,480
And I've had plenty of these over the years.

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,960
Since Gnome 2, I've used things like system monitor.

94
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,280
I did a little digging around, and it turns out there is actually a current issue on their

95
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,040
GitHub about this.

96
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,720
The extension causes stutter and lag in video players is where they noticed it.

97
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,480
And there are some fixes that have been proposed, but what I did is I just did a purging of

98
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
anything.

99
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,080
So it turns out, by reading through this bug, that what it really comes down to, it's not

100
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,300
actually Gnome's fault, and it's not actually the extension's fault.

101
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,300
That's why this is particularly tricky.

102
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Wow.

103
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,300
This is interesting.

104
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,160
It's just simply an issue in Linux when you have that many open files, and when you're

105
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,860
catting a bunch, a bunch, a bunch of things in proc, at the same time you've got a game

106
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,440
accessing all of its image data and its sound files and all that stuff, you sometimes get

107
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,720
an I.O. stutter like that.

108
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,480
It's just like a problem right now.

109
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,320
And they talk about it here in this thread, and they talk about ways you could alleviate

110
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,080
the problem by making the extension more efficient, and other ways to sort of coalesce some of

111
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,560
the polling and things like that.

112
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,320
So I just did a grand purge of extensions that checked my CPU temps and my GPU temps.

113
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,320
Anything with lots of random access.

114
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Yeah, I just did a purge.

115
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,720
I did a purge, and it has been totally smooth, but it totally interrupted my gameplay.

116
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,760
So I didn't get a chance to jump on the server last week.

117
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,760
There you go.

118
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,240
That is my story of a Gnome extension that turned out...

119
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
That's good to know.

120
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,800
It's gone through exactly the same turmoil as you did.

121
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,680
Such a rabbit hole, because you start with all the obvious things like, oh, it's freaking

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,240
open source graphics, or oh, it's freaking power management, or it's my new Arch kernel.

123
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,920
And you're so used to those icons up there, you don't even think about it.

124
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,840
Yeah, and I've always had system monitor extensions, literally, for ever.

125
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,080
Because I'm often compiling, or not compiling often, but when I'm re-upting my AUR packages,

126
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,200
I like to watch how busy my system is so I know I can do a bunch of other stuff.

127
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,880
Or definitely when I'm encoding video, it's extremely handy to have that.

128
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,240
So it's, yeah, it was a little embarrassing, and I had to share it with you.

129
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,200
And you might want to look into it too, if you have the Gnome system monitor extension,

130
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,040
which is kind of a popular one, or any of those that pull your system a lot for what's

131
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,720
going on, maybe try turning them off for a little while and see if you notice a difference.

132
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,860
That's my lesson.

133
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:43,400
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 156 for August 2nd, 2016.

134
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:51,760
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that was almost running a little

135
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
late.

136
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,200
Because even though it rained so damn much, people still don't let it dry very well.

137
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,480
This is something where Linux will save us all one day.

138
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,160
Linux will be in the cars driving us.

139
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,160
You know it.

140
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,600
And us meat sacks will be busy playing on our phones.

141
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
That's what I think.

142
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,200
But that's not what we're here to talk about on today's episode of the Unplugged program.

143
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,360
We have a huge, huge fun show to get into.

144
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,240
A bunch of really great news has propped up just in the last couple of days from some

145
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,560
of our favorite open source projects.

146
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,400
So we're going to spend a bunch of time at the top of the show digging through some of

147
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,960
those really good stuff there.

148
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:28,120
New version of Mint X F C E is out, and there's some really interesting news in there.

149
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,960
And also, really interesting language and positioning by Clem.

150
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,880
We'll talk a little bit about that in the show.

151
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,280
Then the Googs has the Chromecast.

152
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,960
You guys all know about the Chromecast.

153
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,200
It's sold like hotcakes, but it's really reliant on Google services.

154
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,400
That's got to be its Achilles heel.

155
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,080
This week, we'll talk about ways you can use the Chromecast with tools on your Linux box

156
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,560
to stream to a Chromecast locally.

157
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,360
So you can go pick yourself up one of these cheap streaming little devices.

158
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,840
We'll also talk about some open source alternatives to Chromecast, get the Mumble Rooms tips and

159
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,560
all of that.

160
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,960
Then we're going to transition into some of the Kodi exploits I've been doing.

161
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,240
And by that, I mean adventures in figuring out how to name my files, some of the cool

162
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,240
add-ons and extensions I've found, of course.

163
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,400
In-depth experience here.

164
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,960
And also a tool to help whip my media collection into shape, and I know we'll get some great

165
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,080
advice from that virtual lug, too, on making a really great Kodi installation.

166
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,040
I am really looking forward to what they have to say there.

167
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,760
Plus, we'll talk about some alternative backends that the community has been talking to me

168
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,240
about since I've been talking more about Kodi recently.

169
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,360
And they look really cool.

170
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,760
Some really neat stuff you can do, even if you're not a home theater person or a Kodi

171
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,580
or Plex or MB person.

172
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,400
What we're going to talk about and how these open source projects can interact is absolutely

173
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
fascinating.

174
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,880
So there's just a ton of stuff there.

175
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,660
So to help us get through all of it, and I mean there is a lot of it, let's bring in

176
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,660
that virtual lug.

177
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,660
Time appropriate greetings, mother room.

178
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,660
Greetings, folks.

179
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,660
Hello.

180
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,660
Hello.

181
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,660
Hello.

182
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,660
Hello.

183
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,660
I secretly use Arch Linux.

184
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,660
No, that's fine.

185
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
Poppy, you don't need to...

186
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,660
All right.

187
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:15,160
So anyways, I wanted to start with something that proves a prediction that virtual lugger

188
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:22,480
Daredevil made months ago when Microsoft announced Ubuntu runtime for Windows, whatever they

189
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,160
call that monstrosity.

190
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,580
This he said, and I think he's right, Linux is going to become the new default platform

191
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,320
that you write applications for.

192
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,760
And check out this first story we're going to talk about.

193
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,080
So there's a lot of Docker news this week.

194
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,760
We won't bore you to tears with all of the news, but I'll tell you just a couple of things.

195
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,120
First of all, we're going to start with this post about bringing Linux apps to the Mac

196
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,760
desktop using freaking Docker.

197
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Why?

198
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,040
Well, to access newer versions of software because it usually takes a while for Mac people

199
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,320
to get to our second hand ports.

200
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,600
I can think of a few, like there's some Linux games I like to play where you can install

201
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,560
them on Mac, but a lot of Mac users might not have Xcode installed, all the things you

202
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
need to build it.

203
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,280
Whereas Linux, I can be like, here, run this script in a Docker and bam, done.

204
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Right.

205
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,100
To test versions simultaneously, multiple different versions simultaneously, to use

206
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,680
tools that have been ported over to the Mac, and for sandboxing applications.

207
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,680
So this is really kind of an intense walkthrough of how to get...

208
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,320
Docker is an example of a GTK Slack app to get all these different apps that are Linux

209
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,380
applications running on top of the Mac.

210
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:32,780
And sort of along with this today, Docker has announced that they now consider Mac Docker

211
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:38,120
version production ready, like it's officially been stamped as you can now use Docker on

212
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
the Mac in production.

213
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,280
What do you think about all this?

214
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,520
You know, it is interesting.

215
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,480
It does, I think it really does speak to what Daredevilin said about the Linux runtime being

216
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
everywhere.

217
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah, it kind of worries me a little bit.

218
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,520
Because I'm still not...

219
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:06,540
I haven't seen a container ecosystem where things are being smoothly and routinely updated

220
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,400
and things are being patched when there's security exploits.

221
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,680
And I'm worried that what we...

222
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,840
You know, one of the big things that scares me about the internet of things, quote unquote,

223
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,600
I hate that term so much, but it's just there's so many terms I hate now that I just figured

224
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,080
like I gotta roll with it.

225
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,560
Like I can't hate cloud for the rest of my life or derp learning, you know.

226
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,220
But internet of things devices, what's the big security issue in your mind about internet

227
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,040
of things devices?

228
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,760
Well they never get patched.

229
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,000
Exactly.

230
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,480
And now we're doing the same exact thing in containers.

231
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,240
We're just loading our secure Linux boxes up with containers that never get patched.

232
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,040
Now that's not universally the case.

233
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,640
But it's easy enough that you've pulled that one Docker file one time and it runs and you've

234
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,400
never done anything else.

235
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Exactly.

236
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,040
The handfuls of Docker images that I have done, that tends to be the case for me.

237
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,760
And even if I'm willing to stay up to date on them, it's not always easy because sometimes

238
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,360
you can lose data if you screw things up because...

239
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,960
And also sometimes they just simply don't update them.

240
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,800
That's another problem.

241
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,920
So this is sort of potentially leading us down a path that two, three years from now

242
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,680
could leave a lot of people in a bad situation.

243
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,080
We're going to wish there was some sort of shared common run time among all these or

244
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,080
something.

245
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,320
But hopefully the increased prevalence on other platforms will contribute to an incentive

246
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
for that.

247
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Yeah, I suppose so.

248
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
It doesn't have to be that way.

249
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Boy, that is a silver lining.

250
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,880
I do wonder if there's any work going on to integrate with that Windows, the new Windows

251
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
layer.

252
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,280
I think right now they're using Hyper-V and they're using XHive on the Mac, but I wonder

253
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,640
if they'll be able to do a little bit closer binding.

254
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,600
I don't know, that's weird.

255
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,800
I don't even get me started on containers that use virtualization because that just

256
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,200
sounds like a VM to me, but I digress.

257
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:53,160
This next story, I think a lot of people are going to be excited about it.

258
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,200
I know Noah and I have talked about this quite a bit.

259
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,880
I'm not sure where you weigh in, but folks like Popey, don't worry about this.

260
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
Look at this.

261
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,440
Popey tweeted this today.

262
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,620
He's taking apart a NETGEAR GS116 switch and getting a soldering iron out to fix this thing.

263
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:15,340
But for those of us who want to buy new routers and run open source firmwares, TP-Link might

264
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,800
be back on the list of possible devices that will run Linux.

265
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:25,840
This is after a FCC ruling that's going to force TP-Link to allow open source firmwares

266
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
on the...

267
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
I did not expect this.

268
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
Yeah.

269
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,800
They're also going to pay a $200,000 fine, so that's really kind of something.

270
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,600
The TP-Link settlement was announced in the midst of controversy spurred by those new

271
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,560
FCC rules we've talked about in the past.

272
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,560
The new rules for the 5 gigahertz band require router makers to prevent third party firmwares

273
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,800
from changing the radio frequency parameters, i.e. letting you blast it up and stuff like

274
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,080
that, because they're worried you're going to mess with Doppler radar, I guess.

275
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,080
That sounds legit to me.

276
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,080
TP-Link didn't break any rules by blocking third party firmwares, but it got attention

277
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:02,760
from the FCC's enforcement bureau by selling routers that made it possible for users, once

278
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,940
they load those firmwares, to circumvent power limits.

279
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,880
Other manufacturers that came up with ways to... Links just worked with Marvell and

280
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,960
others to allow open source firmwares, but not allow the firmwares to tweak the radio

281
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
transmitting.

282
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
Right.

283
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,600
Here's the thing that I kind of feel a little icky about.

284
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,760
After admitting the violation, TP-Link halted sales of the offending devices.

285
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
That makes sense, right?

286
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Right.

287
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Yep.

288
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,160
But then they issued a software update so that units already sold to consumers would

289
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,160
comply.

290
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,160
So they just...

291
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,160
Oh, yeah.

292
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,160
That is a little...

293
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
That's a major feature.

294
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,840
If I could control the radio power... I'm way out in the fricking boondocks, dude, right?

295
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,840
If I could control the radio frequency powers and maybe get a little more signal, that would

296
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,400
be the main thing I would want that for.

297
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,960
So that'd be a huge bummer.

298
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,520
And it's interesting because TP-Link's violation related to 2.4 gigahertz band, but their software

299
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,440
update also precludes customers from installing third party software, including open source

300
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,560
software, to meet the new five gigahertz requirement.

301
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,100
And that's kind of where they got in trouble.

302
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,800
It's interesting that getting in trouble for that has then led to a settlement where they're

303
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,360
required to keep working with open source.

304
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Yeah, very much so.

305
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,680
I really like that development.

306
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,680
That's great.

307
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
Yeah.

308
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
So...

309
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,760
And hopefully they can just figure it out on the hardware level and just... Before,

310
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,760
I think people loved TP-Links.

311
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,320
A lot of people were using them because they had great support for OpenWRT and such.

312
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Yep.

313
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
That's why I bought one in the past.

314
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
Also, just kind of a separate thing.

315
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:31,280
Imagination Technologies, which is a chip maker, is working with OpenWRT and others to put

316
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,600
the OpenWRT software into a virtual machine on these devices, which would be isolated

317
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
from the radio controls.

318
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Now, I don't really know if I like that a lot, because what would be the host OS?

319
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,080
Is it something super base?

320
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Or is it their crappy firmware?

321
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Right.

322
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Is it like a very minimal hypervisor?

323
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
Yeah.

324
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Yeah.

325
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
What is that?

326
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
And is it safe and secure?

327
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,820
But that is an interesting approach, and then you can run whichever open source firmware

328
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,720
you want in a VM, and I would think the upgrades on that are going to be pretty rock solid

329
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,440
because it's virtualized hardware, so it's not like that's a moving target.

330
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Right.

331
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Exactly.

332
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
So that's pretty cool.

333
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,960
You guys can check out more in the show notes.

334
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:09,120
So Wes, you found a pretty cool project that we wanted to share with the audience this

335
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,840
week, and this is so perfect for somebody like me who's often trying to figure out ways

336
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,480
to not use mobile data because it's like a personal challenge of mine.

337
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Right.

338
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
Totally.

339
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,820
And when you hear of tethering, you always hear about connecting your laptop to your

340
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,280
phone's internet connection.

341
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Exactly.

342
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
That's the common use case.

343
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
That's the common use case.

344
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:35,360
So what if my freaking laptop or desktop is plugged into a nice, solid ethernet connection

345
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,680
and I got a big update or something like that I want to do on my phone?

346
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:45,720
Wes, here is Simple RT, simple reverse tethering for Android.

347
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,000
So this is exactly that.

348
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,200
It allows you to share your computer's internet connection with your Android device via a

349
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,280
USB cable.

350
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,520
Linux and OS X, it says, are supported.

351
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,520
Windows is not and unlikely to be in the future.

352
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,520
Understandable.

353
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,080
So you've got to plug it in right now.

354
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,080
Is it working?

355
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
Does it work?

356
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
It does work.

357
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
Let's see.

358
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,400
So it must be two pieces, an app on the phone, right?

359
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,400
Yep.

360
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Right.

361
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,480
And then there's software on your laptop.

362
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
Here we go.

363
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
Okay.

364
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
Connect.

365
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Requires Android 4.0 or higher.

366
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,640
And did you have to, was there packages?

367
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,800
Did you have to build something?

368
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
What was that like?

369
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,400
They have a pre-built APK, so I downloaded that on the phone and installed it.

370
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,820
And then it doesn't install an app or anything, it all just runs in the background.

371
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,040
And then on your, so you don't need root on the phone, but you do need root on the computer

372
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,480
that you're using.

373
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,280
Then you would download from GitHub, they have a thing.

374
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,000
You need to install lib USB, but that's the only thing I needed.

375
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,440
A simple make, and then it spits out, it binds to the USB so that you use sudo, you run dot

376
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,400
slash simple RT, and then it waits for you to plug your phone in.

377
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,560
You plug your phone in, and then that triggers the app, which starts a custom VPN, like through

378
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,200
the Android VPN interface.

379
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Oh, smart.

380
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Yeah, it seems to work.

381
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
I'm actually pretty impressed with that.

382
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,640
And it, you know, I tested it earlier at work, and I was able to-

383
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,680
Have you done a speed test?

384
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,600
I have not done a speed test yet, but that's a good question.

385
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,760
Do you have the speed test app on there by chance, because that would be, that'd be really

386
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,920
interesting to know that, because you should be pretty much getting whatever our WiFi could

387
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,920
deliver your, well, of course-

388
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,120
This might be USB 2, though, here.

389
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,600
Yeah, yeah, that would be the limiting factor, but even still, that would be pretty interesting.

390
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,240
Yeah, so that's really cool.

391
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,240
So again, it's called simple RT.

392
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,680
I was really pleased with the Android integration.

393
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,060
I've done a little bit of this with IP tables and a root terminal on my phone, but it's

394
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,400
all very hacky, and this is, it's not quite all the way polished.

395
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,280
Like if you have a lot of custom DNS, for instance, if you're trying to get your phone

396
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,640
onto a VPN through an Ethernet connection only or something like that, then I think

397
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,040
there could be some stuff improved, like maybe how some of the AP scripts set up DNS masks

398
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
for you.

399
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,560
I think something like that might go a long way, but it's already very nice.

400
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Huh.

401
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,520
Yeah, Android N, not too far, I mean, Ham was saying it's three days away, actually.

402
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,400
Then that would be, that might be a way to get that download.

403
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,640
I mean, of course, you'd probably be on WiFi in most cases, but if for some weird reason

404
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,760
you don't have WiFi, but you have the machine you're sitting at has internet access still,

405
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,260
this could be a way to, or doing a whole bunch of Android app updates, or-

406
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,840
Or maybe you're like in a place where you only have Ethernet, but you really want to

407
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,040
make a phone call.

408
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,840
Or hell, even syncing down your Spotify music.

409
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
Yeah.

410
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,760
That could be a way faster way to do that, because I like to do the extreme quality.

411
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,760
So yeah.

412
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,040
And then you're doing this, by the way, on a Nexus 5 running Marshmallow?

413
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Yes.

414
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Okay.

415
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,600
So it works on anything 4.0 all the way up to Marshmallow.

416
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Yeah.

417
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
That's great.

418
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
That's a huge range of devices.

419
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,600
It was really easy to get going.

420
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600
Huh.

421
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Yeah, this is right up my alley.

422
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,240
This is right up my alley, because I'm constantly gaming the system when it comes to mobile.

423
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,280
Yeah, and you never quite know when you might want that, you know, and so it can just be

424
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,280
very helpful.

425
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,040
Or maybe you're on a wired network, but you really want to use the cast from your phone

426
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,920
for a specific thing on your phone that you can't do on Linux.

427
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:50,160
And you know what I just remembered is I have had mobile phones, one, that the Wi-Fi chip

428
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,800
died on it.

429
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,080
And so the only thing you could use was the network, the cellular network.

430
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
Right.

431
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
So there you are paying for that data.

432
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,080
That's no good.

433
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,080
That's no good.

434
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,080
So this kind of thing would be perfect for that.

435
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
That would be perfect.

436
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,080
Huh.

437
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,200
Simple RT, not for retweet, but for reverse tether for Android 4.0 or higher.

438
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,160
You know, while we're talking about mobile, this is probably a great time to mention

439
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,160
Ting.

440
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,240
Ting is my mobile service provider, and I really enjoy using Ting because it's only

441
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,160
pay for what you use mobile.

442
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,560
And because like I know of things like Simple RT, but really, you know, I have Wi-Fi at

443
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,560
work.

444
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
I have Wi-Fi at home.

445
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,720
I have Wi-Fi at families, houses that I go to.

446
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,120
I find that to be really all I need to just keep my bill down to an absolute bare minimum

447
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,240
for three devices talking 35, 40 bucks.

448
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
And that's, you know.

449
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,240
That's crazy.

450
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
That's with three people using their phones.

451
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,340
And of course, Rekai again, Rekai, same thing, on Wi-Fi all the time.

452
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,080
So it's basically like his line is almost free for us.

453
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,080
It's $6 just for the line, and then your usage on top of that.

454
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,080
There's no contract.

455
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,520
There's no determination fee.

456
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
It's pay for what you use wireless.

457
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
See, that's right there.

458
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,240
Like, it's a sell plan for adults.

459
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,360
You know, there's not a lot of rules.

460
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
There's no gimmicks.

461
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
You don't have to worry about some arbitrary Linux.

462
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,920
No pink shirt and leather jacket required.

463
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Yeah.

464
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
They know that you use what you want.

465
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,920
You pay for it.

466
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
It's very simple.

467
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,920
It is.

468
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,400
And you can get started right now by going to linux.ting.com to support this show and

469
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,320
get a $25 discount off your first device.

470
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,760
Or if you're going to bring a device and they have a CDMA and GSM network you can pick from,

471
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,320
which is really cool, they'll give you that in credit in service.

472
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,160
And since your monthly bill on average can be like $23 for a line, that'll pay for more

473
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
than your first month.

474
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,640
They have really great customer service.

475
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,840
I mean, this is like a cornerstone aspect of Ting.

476
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,180
And they have a super nice dashboard as well.

477
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,180
You can check it all out.

478
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:31,160
They give you great controls from your phone, on the web.

479
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,840
I love their blog as well.

480
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,440
They've just recently done a post about the Ting pricing promise.

481
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Check that out.

482
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,840
Just start by going to linux.ting.com.

483
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,960
They have great cord cutting info over there.

484
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,980
They have also extra storage, how to hook up extra storage to your device blog post.

485
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,980
Really good ones over there.

486
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,980
Check them out.

487
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,980
Linux.ting.com.

488
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,800
My mobile service provider for well over two years.

489
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,560
If you want to take the test and just see if it might work for you, go over to the what

490
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,880
would you save buttons right there on the front page when you visit linux.ting.com.

491
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Plug in your information.

492
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
They make it really easy.

493
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,880
You can see how it works.

494
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Linux.ting.com.

495
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Thanks Ting.

496
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,880
All right.

497
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,680
So this next story is a quick mention because I've seen some people talking about it in

498
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
the chat room today.

499
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,600
And I want to give people a heads up because I don't know, I didn't see when this ends.

500
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,200
Oh, oh, they're accepting entries until the 14th.

501
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,200
So we will have time to talk about it in the last, but today System76 announced they're

502
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
giving a laptop away.

503
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,320
Hey, those are nice laptops.

504
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,600
They're doing, they're giving away a Lemure, which is a pretty popular laptop over at System76.

505
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,360
It's going to be preloaded with Ubuntu.

506
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
14 inch.

507
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,500
They're just giving it away.

508
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,480
They're going to do a, yeah, you got it.

509
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
There's a little bit of effort though.

510
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,640
So you have to go read the post in the show notes to find out more.

511
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,400
But it's going to be a 14.1 inch screen with a six generation core i3 processor, four gigs

512
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,840
of RAM and a 500 gigabyte hard drive and an Intel dual band wireless AC card.

513
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
Sweet.

514
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,840
Yersh.

515
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
That would be a nice laptop to give for free.

516
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
And you know it runs great with Linux.

517
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
Yeah.

518
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
So that's really cool.

519
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,840
You can check that out.

520
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,840
It runs Ubuntu.

521
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,840
Ubuntu?

522
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,840
Ubuntu?

523
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,840
I don't know.

524
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
I use Linux Mint.

525
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,320
Linux Mint XFCE Sara has been released and it's a big release because it's going to be

526
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,800
supported until 2021.

527
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:13,560
If you think about it, if you're an XFCE user, you probably don't, you probably don't like

528
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,380
reloading your system a lot.

529
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,400
So being able to install something that is a first class XFCE implementation that is

530
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,320
supported until 2021, that is damn attractive.

531
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
Yeah.

532
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
Yeah.

533
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,040
Think of a lot of like, you know, workshop machines where you just want a nice little

534
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,040
desktop.

535
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Yep.

536
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
That just runs for ages.

537
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Yeah.

538
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Yeah.

539
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
And that would be, I mean, geez, that's great.

540
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,520
So here's a couple of new things in XFCE Sara edition.

541
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,960
I wanted to quickly mention, he talks a lot, Clem does in his post, he talks a lot about

542
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,960
XApps.

543
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,440
And remember those XApps is this new project to produce generic applications for GTK desktop

544
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,400
environments, Forks and et cetera.

545
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,500
And he talks about Zed and XViewer and a bunch of the different ones in here.

546
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,200
But he makes a comment down here that I thought was interesting and it sort of reflects his

547
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,320
attitude about this, which I found refreshing.

548
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:03,560
He says, note that the GNOME apps and MATEI apps and XFCE apps and that these XApps replace

549
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,680
are still available in the repositories.

550
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,980
You can install them side to side with XApps to compare them to decide which ones you like

551
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,980
best.

552
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:16,240
XApps do integrate better, however, with your environment, not only in obvious ways with

553
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,100
traditional interfaces, but also in the way they support desktop environments.

554
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,680
But I do like that he says, you know, you can install them side by side and see which

555
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,680
ones you like better.

556
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Yeah.

557
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,680
That's a good attitude.

558
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,680
You're using a ton of applications and suggesting your users use them.

559
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,240
Which hopefully means like, yeah, they're going to try to compete on their merit, right?

560
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,840
So if they are better than people, people will use them.

561
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
Yeah.

562
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Yeah.

563
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,840
So I thought that was, I thought that was kind of nice.

564
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,720
Anybody in the mumble room an XFCE user by chance?

565
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,920
I find that surprising.

566
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,200
I find that really surprising.

567
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,080
I used to use it when I first tried Arch on a machine, but it doesn't do what I want to

568
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,360
do because I want to, I don't want things really simplified.

569
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,160
I want things more complex and tweakable like KDE.

570
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,440
So I just no longer use it.

571
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,960
I used it for quite a long time after the very first release of Unity and I was still

572
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:05,960
in Ubuntu.

573
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,960
Me too.

574
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,840
I switched over to XFCE and I mean, at the time I think it was in school, so I didn't

575
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,760
have a lot of time for customization and it was, I mean, it still is a fine desktop if

576
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,760
that's all you need.

577
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
Yeah.

578
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,820
I feel like after I looked at this release here, I thought maybe I should seriously consider

579
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,280
the XFCE again for my workhorse machines.

580
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
I love Gnome 3.

581
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,600
I have no complaints, but you know, like I had that weird extension issue right into

582
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
that.

583
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Yeah.

584
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,800
And I just simply need this thing to just work every single time.

585
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,840
Not that it isn't now.

586
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,840
So I don't really have any issues now.

587
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,840
Right.

588
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,920
There's no incentive, but it is certainly a stable platform.

589
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:41,480
But that just thinking, like it just feels like it would be a rock, but yeah.

590
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,600
Still a Raspbian user if that counts for, you know, XFCE.

591
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
That's true.

592
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
That's true.

593
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,600
Yeah.

594
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
I guess maybe...

595
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
So the Raspbian user likes DE.

596
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
Yeah.

597
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Yeah.

598
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,120
I guess maybe that's what it is too, is there's just less excitement on XFCE these days.

599
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,160
I think that's a big part of it.

600
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Yeah.

601
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
That's true.

602
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Yeah.

603
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:04,600
There's also a great Manjaro spin with an XFCE desktop.

604
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,880
Now I enjoyed on my last road trip, Gnome maps a lot.

605
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,880
I thought having...

606
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:16,400
I went from why is Gnome wasting time making a mapping application to, oh, this is why

607
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,360
Gnome's making a map because it's so nice to actually have it in a native desktop application.

608
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Totally.

609
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,360
Totally.

610
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
Yeah.

611
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I hate the web browser.

612
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,840
Waiting for the DOM to up to edge just the web.

613
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,840
Nobody needs that.

614
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Nope.

615
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,600
And plus, I can be doing my search end and looking up stuff in one window and I can be

616
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,780
doing my mapping in my Gnome maps.

617
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:38,440
And I was thrilled to have that along with Fedora 24 on my last road trip.

618
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,520
Then almost the day after I got back...

619
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,020
It really was terrible timing.

620
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:47,120
The map quest API got pulled underneath them, from underneath them, and Gnome maps just

621
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,760
started displaying developer tiles.

622
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,360
It was kind of embarrassing actually.

623
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,920
It looked awful and Ubuntu Gnome announced they'd be dropping Gnome maps and it just...

624
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,760
It felt like what was maps gonna do, right?

625
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,760
Yeah.

626
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,160
Here we had this nice application and just...

627
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
Real shame.

628
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,160
Just a real shame.

629
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
Well, guess what?

630
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
We got good news here, Wes.

631
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,640
Good, good news.

632
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,920
Things are back up and looking better with 3.20.4 release.

633
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,200
They're switching away from map quest, open API for fetching tiles, and instead they're

634
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,720
gonna start using Mapbox's API.

635
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,400
They're using a community API key from Mapbox and Mapbox is a company they say with a commitment

636
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,480
to open source and provides infrastructure that will allow us to do more with maps.

637
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:34,320
We're accessing the Mapbox API through a Gnome proxy that will allow us to easily switch

638
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,560
our tile provider in the future.

639
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
See, that's the way to do it.

640
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,560
A little extraction there.

641
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Also watch everywhere you go.

642
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
What?

643
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Yeah, well, I mean, yeah.

644
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
So there you go.

645
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,080
Are you saying you didn't want to tell Gnome where you are anyway, Chris?

646
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,200
You know what I would like to see Gnome Maps do?

647
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,240
You know the direction I would like to take this?

648
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,880
Imagine Gnome Maps allowing me to configure my own backend so I could point it at like

649
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,120
OpenStreetMaps or something or my own hosted mapping server.

650
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,840
Just the wrapper around a compatible map API.

651
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,840
Yeah, so if it was Canonical, if Canonical had announced that they were shipping a mapping

652
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:14,600
application on Ubuntu Touch that used a proxy, a proxy everywhere you go, wouldn't that be

653
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,160
a huge controversy?

654
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:20,080
A proxy to some, you know, somewhat proprietary service.

655
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,480
Yeah, exactly.

656
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
Exactly.

657
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,920
When they did that with Unity Dash Launcher, like we lost our collective S over that.

658
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,640
Now the Gnome camp goes, yeah, we're going to be proxying all of your map requests through

659
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,600
a central proxy run by us, but don't worry about it.

660
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
It's fine.

661
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
And we're like, okay, cool.

662
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Good idea.

663
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
That's good.

664
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
Thank you for planning for the future, guys.

665
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,840
I wonder how that proxy is set up.

666
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,120
I mean, would it be different if it's a Chef configured server and you can see the Chef

667
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
recipes right there?

668
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Sure, sure.

669
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
That's a good idea.

670
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,520
I mean, you can't actually verify what's on the box, but it's a little bit more transparency.

671
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
Hmm.

672
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,800
NorthRanger, you got a little conspiracy bacon there.

673
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,640
Why don't you share it with the class?

674
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,120
I guess I trust Gnome more to run a proxy that could potentially snoop on my location

675
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:15,920
than both an app, a game developer and Google farming out hundreds of millions of users

676
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,080
with Pokemon having their location shared, basically.

677
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,120
But isn't the issue not about Pokemon and Diantic and all these people, but more people

678
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:31,480
losing their minds on results from Amazon, even though they're going through a proxy

679
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,320
with Canonical?

680
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,700
I think it was both.

681
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,080
They were saying that Amazon was tracking you and all this other stuff and they're letting

682
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,360
... No, they weren't, because the data never went to Amazon.

683
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,320
It went to Ubuntu first.

684
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Yeah.

685
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,000
There could be a flip side of that.

686
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I remember the first question that was asked after Canonical announced the built-in search

687
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,800
was, is it going to be HTTPS?

688
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,160
And the answer was no.

689
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,760
Is this Gnome maps proxy HTTPS?

690
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,920
Why are we not asking the same questions?

691
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,920
Why is that?

692
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
Why is that a thing?

693
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,920
Right.

694
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,160
I'm not saying that Gnome Project is doing anything wrong, and I agree with North Ranger.

695
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:15,640
I trust them 100% implicitly more than I trust Google or Niantic.

696
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,640
But you're right.

697
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,660
We should have a set of standards for how we think maps or other personal sharing services

698
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,320
like that should be run.

699
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:28,140
Is this crazy to say that we need a constitution for hosted services and in the constitution

700
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:35,160
it says if we host something that tracks you or knows where you're at at all times, we

701
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,320
will make sure that it's set up and protected in these ways?

702
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,520
I mean that feels like something that should just be – whenever I'm making the choice

703
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,520
to either self-host or –

704
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,920
Like a privacy pledge for hosted services.

705
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,920
That's a better term.

706
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,920
Yeah.

707
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
A privacy pledge.

708
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
That's better.

709
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Yeah.

710
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
Because it feels – yeah, exactly.

711
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,080
Because it feels like if I'm making the conscious decision to self-host versus use

712
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,080
a hosted service –

713
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,200
A lot of times it comes down to like control of your data and knowledge about where that

714
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,200
will be.

715
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,800
And I can't properly make that determination right now on any service.

716
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:04,480
That's a tough thing to sort out right now.

717
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,480
And the only –

718
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,760
Especially where it's like all the other desktops.

719
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,320
What is left of the desktop experience is becoming a lot of integrated with services.

720
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,200
So it's kind of a question we need to address in the Linux world if even GNOME is doing

721
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,200
it.

722
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Yeah.

723
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
I agree.

724
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Ww, you have a thought on the pledges?

725
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,400
The thing is privacy pledges are pretty much said like off the top of anybody's head

726
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,400
nowadays by whoever.

727
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,960
And they could pledge themselves to whatever.

728
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,560
It's actions and transparency that are more important that people need to see.

729
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,160
They need to see, hey, what's going on with my data?

730
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,320
For me, I don't think we'll – I don't know if we'll ever see this.

731
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:50,000
I want to be able to see how the data was used and what you guys are doing with it rather

732
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,860
than saying – having a marketing person or a social community member of your team

733
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,600
say this stuff.

734
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,560
People need to see concrete evidence that you guys are doing right by the community

735
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
or by them.

736
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
Yeah.

737
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:10,360
You know, so have you guys noticed – I mean, I just today logged in to Google because I

738
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,840
was curious – what was I reading about?

739
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Oh, Mussolini.

740
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,760
I was reading about Mussolini and I was curious how much of that would show up in my Google

741
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
history.

742
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,200
And there's two sets of Google history when you're a Chrome user.

743
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,440
There's your browser history and then there is everything Chrome sends to Google.

744
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,440
And so they actually legitimately make that manageable.

745
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,080
Because I'm so often a skeptic of Google, I do want to give them credit here.

746
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,280
In Chrome, in your history, they say you should also check what Google services know about

747
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,320
you and you click that.

748
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,620
They make it very obvious.

749
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,720
They really do tell you what Google knows about you.

750
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,680
Like they know – and I just showed up right away.

751
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,480
Like it shows that I listen to Pocket Cast on my drive.

752
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:54,840
They know what time I open up Pocket Cast and how long I listen to a podcast.

753
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,480
Every morning I drive into work.

754
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,720
It is something.

755
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,040
Yeah, there is that angle too because there's like I think a certain component of Google,

756
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:08,240
of how we perceive Google's awareness and creepiness, etc. that like even if they are

757
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,000
doing – I'm not saying necessarily that they are, but even if they are doing everything

758
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,520
correctly in terms of prompting you for what you want, they're so much a part of our lives

759
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,900
that even if you've said yes to all these things, you forget about it and sometimes

760
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:22,000
you realize again how much they do know and you're like, oh.

761
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,560
Antonis, you have a tip for users to sort of see what Google knows about them.

762
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
Yeah.

763
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:33,120
So with Google Dashboard, you can go take a look and see what Google tracks.

764
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,960
If you have an Android phone especially, you can see where you've been with the Google

765
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Maps.

766
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,840
It will show your location history and also even if you use Google Now with your voice,

767
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,800
it even shows you previous voice searches.

768
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:49,040
You can listen to them and it's kind of like a diary of all the places you've been.

769
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,480
I hear it back and I'm like, oh yeah, that was when I was in the car with the kids and

770
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,240
they were jacking in the background the whole time.

771
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,760
Yeah, the dashboard is creepy and also a very nice feature.

772
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,520
But it leaves me with this and the no maps thing was also another lesson.

773
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,080
Do I have to be an extremist?

774
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,040
Do I have to be like all self-hosting or bust?

775
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Right.

776
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,000
I mean, because that just seems unrealistic at some point.

777
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,240
There's a lot of services at some point you just, you know, convenience wins.

778
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Yeah.

779
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Yeah.

780
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,820
And you know, that is something we talked about a little bit last week, how sometimes

781
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:29,480
open source loses when your time becomes more precious than your values about software freedom.

782
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,800
I still sort of with every single service have to go through that evaluation.

783
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:39,400
Because there's like a certain amount of, you know, yes, and it can be, I think, okay,

784
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:44,160
if you consciously value here like, well, the thing that these people are offering is

785
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,660
they have their own little layer on top of these open source tools that they do for me

786
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,880
and I like that because I just don't have time to do it.

787
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,920
But you do have to kind of value like, well, do they contribute back to those open source

788
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,840
tools that I might otherwise be using?

789
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,920
Are they good citizen in open source?

790
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
Do I think they're going to vanish?

791
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,920
Are they going to change models?

792
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,720
It's a lot of things to think about.

793
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,200
Minimac, you have a point about once you have privacy settings set up correctly on Google,

794
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,880
they managed to seem to stick with it, right?

795
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah, they stick with all devices.

796
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,280
You see, I also have an Android TV and all that stuff.

797
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,360
So I have a lot of Android stuff now.

798
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:21,760
And once you can figure out your privacy settings, all devices are synced and applied to these

799
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
settings.

800
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
I find that pretty cool.

801
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Yeah, that is nice.

802
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,800
That is nice that they legitimately at least seem to make an effort to make it clear and

803
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,800
coherent.

804
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,720
And you can compare and contrast that to what Facebook does, where it's still not clear

805
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,720
and it's confusing.

806
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:36,720
And they change it all the time.

807
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
Yeah.

808
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,720
Yeah.

809
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,120
Yeah, you really have to dig all these settings once, but there are a lot of settings you

810
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
can change.

811
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,520
It is, you know, it is honestly to say that a hosted service that somebody else manages

812
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,480
for you is maintenance free and doesn't require your time to keep it going and running is

813
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,840
false because when you have services like Google that knows much about you, you do kind

814
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,320
of need to go in there and manage it from time to time and see what they're tracking,

815
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,120
see if you're comfortable with that because they're always adding stuff.

816
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,520
And the thing about hosted services too is they may add stuff, they may remove stuff

817
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,080
and you have no say in the matter.

818
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:10,040
Of course, I think ultimately to decide whether you need to do that evaluation or not, just

819
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,160
ask yourself, are you the product here?

820
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
Right.

821
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
Oh, yeah.

822
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,160
That's an interesting metric.

823
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,160
Yeah.

824
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,520
I think – I read a book that says that as time goes on, more and more average citizens

825
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,720
will start asking themselves that question, but so far I haven't really seen that play

826
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,720
out.

827
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
We will see.

828
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:30,320
I actually – speaking of Google, so the rest of the show – not the rest of the show.

829
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
That's not true at all.

830
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,960
The next segment of the show is going to be kind of Google heavy, but it's actually

831
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,480
sort of using some Google – bypassing some Google services.

832
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,920
It's the Chromecast but not using Google.

833
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,980
So before we get off self-hosting entirely, it would be a good time to mention Digital

834
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,680
Ocean and you can support the show by going over to Digital Ocean and reusing our promo

835
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
code DOUNPLUGGED.

836
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,440
It's one word, it's lowercase, you apply it to your account balance.

837
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,520
Now I think in response to this conversation that you and I were just having, probably

838
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,400
the key thing about Digital Ocean that I think has really contributed to their success is

839
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,040
that it's really fast to get going.

840
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,080
It's simple, it's straightforward.

841
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:13,360
And so the cost of trying something like a project like NextCloud or Rocket Chat or GitLab

842
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,360
is …

843
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,920
Aaron Ross Powell The speed plus the per hour billing kind of

844
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
stuff.

845
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,920
Jason Kuznicki Yeah.

846
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,680
And in like the case of GitLab, the entire application stack, if you just want to just

847
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,720
deploy the entire stack on an LTS distro, is ready to go and you just plug in the details

848
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,020
you need and it's set up.

849
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:35,280
So that is really giving people the opportunity to try out self-hosting in a way that doesn't

850
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,800
mean a huge time commitment.

851
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,200
Aaron Ross Powell You're not provisioning a bare metal server,

852
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,440
you're not worrying about colo.

853
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
Jason Kuznicki Yeah.

854
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,240
And look at this pricing.

855
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,820
And so you can see like you could really, once you get going, you could really have

856
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,840
something that is just running all the time.

857
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,480
I love this middle plan here, three cents an hour, two gigs of RAM, two core processor,

858
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
40 gigabyte SSD.

859
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Aaron Ross Powell That's really what does it.

860
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Jason Kuznicki Yeah.

861
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
That's, I mean, wow.

862
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
Right?

863
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,680
When you have super fast, they're all SSDs, they have really great internet connections,

864
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,920
they have data centers all over the world and when you have all of that on a machine

865
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,680
with two core processors, if it's for you, your business or your family, that is going

866
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,840
to be a screaming machine and it's really easy to step up and upgrade.

867
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,840
And if you want to play with something like Nextcloud and your storage starts to grow,

868
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,360
it's a totally different story now on DigitalOcean than it was even a couple of months ago because

869
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:28,280
they have serious block storage now that is going to make it possible for you to grow

870
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,720
your storage on your droplet as you need at a really nice price.

871
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,160
Highly available block storage, you attach it to your droplet and of course, because

872
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,360
it's DigitalOcean, it's SSD-backed block storage.

873
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Yes.

874
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:44,680
You know, I talk a lot about the DigitalOcean interface and how freaking great it is.

875
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,200
I often will mention their API.

876
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,200
So this week, I thought I'd give you a few examples of why they really just have one

877
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,960
of the best APIs out there.

878
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:57,240
It's well-documented, they iterate on it as part of their entire platform feature set

879
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:02,440
and then because it's so clear and because it's documented, there's a ton of nice code

880
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,000
you can take advantage of already.

881
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,560
I like this Runbook.io project which uses DigitalOcean's API.

882
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:13,080
It's available, it's free, you can grab it and it monitors and automatically resolves

883
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,760
issue with if this, then that style automation for your droplets, which could be neat.

884
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:26,600
Like reactions from anything, like restarting Apache, rebooting a DigitalOcean droplet completely,

885
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:33,360
it is what you get if Nagios and if then, then that had a baby.

886
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:38,000
If those two things came together and had a mad passionate love session, this is the

887
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
child they would produce.

888
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,840
That sounds like a great recipe for not getting woken up in the middle of the night.

889
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,680
It is exactly that.

890
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,000
Also, this is kind of neat, I thought this was kind of cool, a DigitalOcean dynamic DNS

891
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
project.

892
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Okay, that is neat.

893
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,580
Yeah, the script allows you to dynamically update a DO domain name A record like a mini

894
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,040
dynamic DNS update.

895
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,760
See, those are all things that you could write for yourself, but because it's so easy with

896
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,360
DigitalOcean, someone's done it for you.

897
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,360
Yeah, it's cool.

898
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,360
It's right there.

899
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,360
It is really cool.

900
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,720
Check them out, digitalocean.com, use our promo code DOUNPLUG to support the show to

901
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,360
keep us going and get yourself a $10 credit and try it out for a little while, digitalocean.com,

902
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,760
thanks guys.

903
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:18,760
And if you guys see a really cool open source project that uses the DigitalOcean API, please

904
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,060
do tweet it at me.

905
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,720
So before we get into the whole discussion about the rest of the Chromecast stuff and

906
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,000
Kodi stuff, I thought maybe we'd take a moment and talk about why we're discussing this

907
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,080
at the moment because just recently, it was revealed how dramatic the Chromecast sales

908
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
have been.

909
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,720
Google has not traditionally shared numbers on this, but in a conference call, they were

910
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,040
confronted and Sundar Pichai actually answered.

911
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:48,320
When responding to questions, he revealed that the company has shipped 30 million Chromecast

912
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,080
units since its release back in 2013, which includes all the different iterations, even

913
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,080
the Chromecast audio.

914
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
30 million units.

915
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,080
Do you have one?

916
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,080
I do.

917
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,080
I actually have two.

918
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Yeah, I have two as well.

919
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,920
In fact, I've even bought one for friends before because they didn't have anything to

920
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,240
like watch like YouTube or anything on their TV.

921
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,400
And bought it for parents or family or yep.

922
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,600
We have one here at the studio, which has been great when we have people over and we

923
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:14,820
have a big group and people want to watch different YouTube videos.

924
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,680
My Nvidia Shield TV I talked about on Linux Action Show this Sunday has Chromecast support

925
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
built into it.

926
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,500
A lot of apps have Chromecast support stuff for like, you know, lots of stuff for like

927
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,280
having them run displays, Android and I believe has a lot of more a lot more Chromecast stuff

928
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,420
built into the OS level.

929
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:35,140
So I thought, okay, let's talk about ways that us Linux users can get content from our

930
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,200
Linux boxes on the Chromecast.

931
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,060
And maybe if the mumble room knows of some open source hardware replacements or alternatives

932
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,760
to Chromecast, we can talk about those too.

933
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,640
But I want to start with the easy button.

934
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:48,200
So that way, if you're listening and you want something super applicable to you, and you

935
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,480
just and you just want that right off the top.

936
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:54,800
I've used this from time to time, I don't keep it installed in Chrome when I'm not using

937
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,800
it.

938
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,040
But it's video streaming for Google Chrome.

939
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,380
And it allows you to load any local video file on your Linux box.

940
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,600
It opens up as like an app inside your Chrome browser, you can open then you can use the

941
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,380
local file browser to pick any local file.

942
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,360
And it will stream this to your Chromecast from your Linux box.

943
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,260
This is just a quick dirty install in 30 seconds, you can be streaming to a Chromecast.

944
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,360
It doesn't go out to the Google account and servers and send it down, it just goes directly

945
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,080
from your laptop to your Chromecast.

946
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,400
So that's just a that's a Chrome plugin.

947
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,060
But that's not super cool.

948
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,060
And that's not Linux specific.

949
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,880
And you have to pay for some things if you want more features.

950
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,360
Yeah, there is something you have to pay for.

951
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
It doesn't deserve that.

952
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,440
I'm not saying that.

953
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,120
But I can't even remember what it was you have to pay for, because I just use it for

954
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,880
the basic feature set.

955
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,280
But cast now could be another option.

956
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,280
So check this out.

957
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,840
Cast now is a command line utility.

958
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,840
Hey, here we go.

959
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,760
Okay, do playback media files to your Chromecast device.

960
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,920
It supports playback of local video files, videos on the web and torrents too.

961
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,560
You can also reattach a running playback session, which is really nice.

962
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,180
So it's cast now.

963
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,000
And it's just really simple syntax.

964
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,560
You do cast now and then the directory that has the videos in it, you can play the entire

965
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:09,200
directory or the specific file or you drop in a URL to like an MP4 file, or a torrent

966
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,200
file.

967
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,840
You can also do better luck sometimes like persnickety HLS streams, that sort of stuff.

968
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,320
Cast now seems to work pretty well with.

969
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
Yeah?

970
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,320
Nice.

971
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,320
So cast now, just a simple tool to install and you can do that from the command line.

972
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,860
I know how much we love our command line utilities.

973
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,880
So that seemed like a good one.

974
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,880
Then there was this one that came in.

975
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,840
A contender that's getting some update and coverage on web update this week streamed

976
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,860
a Chromecast, stream to Chromecast, the number two, is a command line Chromecast media streamer

977
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:37,860
for Linux.

978
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,640
It can transcode to unsupported formats in real time and play them on the Chromecast.

979
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:44,640
It can also do audio, so it can send audio only.

980
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,480
It can transcode any format not supported by the Chromecast using FFmpeg or LibAV, provides

981
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,960
basic control commands like pause, unpause, stop, and playback.

982
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,760
You can do specific devices when you have multiple Chromecast on your network, which

983
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,760
is nice.

984
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,760
Yeah.

985
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,540
Supports passing custom transcoder parameters to FFmpeg and supports specifying the port

986
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:03,200
to use for streaming media.

987
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,400
For audio only files, no metadata is displayed on the Chromecast at the moment.

988
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,480
So these are two different command line utilities that will take video files or audio files

989
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,800
and send them to your – now, have you tried stream?

990
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,280
I haven't but after this show, I think I will.

991
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,280
Yeah.

992
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,280
That's really nice.

993
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,880
That's really – that is kind of changing my opinion about the Chromecast a little more

994
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,560
especially since I have it built into the Shield 2.

995
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,960
There are like so many of those services where it's a little bit like, well, it works great

996
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,760
and Netflix and YouTube obviously have great support for it but there are some like outliers

997
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,280
where you're like, it is frustrating.

998
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,280
You don't have full access.

999
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,480
You don't have root on it, right?

1000
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,360
So this does help with that.

1001
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:40,560
Irocast, what's this, NorthRanger?

1002
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,640
Actually it was just, you know, me doing a little bit of Googling a few days ago actually

1003
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,160
trying to figure out my Kodi box on a Raspberry Pi to extend some functionality.

1004
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,400
I haven't tried it yet so I'm curious if anybody else has found a similar solution

1005
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,600
for like LibreELEC or OpenELEC type distributions.

1006
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,800
Yeah.

1007
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:04,760
Like so you want to – you want to be able to have Chromecast like functionality with

1008
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,400
Kodi, is what you're saying.

1009
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,400
Exactly.

1010
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,400
Hmm.

1011
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,400
Interesting.

1012
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
Interesting.

1013
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,800
You know, I believe there could be somebody working on such a thing right now.

1014
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:24,560
Dr. Tanel in the Mumble Room, a.k.a. formerly known as Rotten Corpse, sir, could you perhaps

1015
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,720
have something up your sleeve just like this?

1016
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,520
Well, I mean that's convenient.

1017
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,000
That – convenient with a K even.

1018
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Heyo.

1019
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Well, Kast for Kodi is what I'm working on which is a script that does exactly that

1020
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:48,800
and it adds – be able to stream live video through like Twitch or RTMP streams or anything

1021
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
like that.

1022
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:57,440
It also supports local videos through like Samba and I recently fixed some things that

1023
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,440
you can now do torrent streaming.

1024
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:59,440
Oh.

1025
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,720
Yeah, like a MetaLink for some kind of video, it'll – like the torrents that JB has,

1026
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,520
it'll play those through that.

1027
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,520
Cool.

1028
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,960
And it also supports multiple devices so you can have multiple Raspberry Pis with Kodi

1029
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:20,200
on it or OpenELEC even and a lot more features that I'm working on too.

1030
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:27,420
It supports about 15 current add-ons for Kodi including YouTube, Twitch, Dailymotion and

1031
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,420
many more.

1032
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,420
Heyo.

1033
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,420
And of course, YouTube broadcasting.

1034
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,420
Heyo.

1035
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,420
Hey.

1036
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,760
So the interface for this is a command line utility as well?

1037
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,840
It has both a GUI and a command line.

1038
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,020
The GUI is very simple.

1039
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,800
It uses Zenity to provide that.

1040
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,800
Okay, nice.

1041
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,880
And like it's just like a – hey, select the file you want to send to the Kodi machine

1042
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:45,880
and then it's looking?

1043
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,880
Yeah.

1044
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,560
Well, the – it uses the file manager to do the local file sending so you just right

1045
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:57,040
click and send it to the file – send it through the script to your Kodi device.

1046
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,720
So what is the technology behind the scenes that's making my desktop talk to the Kodi

1047
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,720
software?

1048
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:12,400
Well, it's basically just a Bash script on one end, a JSON API on the Kodi end, and

1049
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,400
then whatever file manager you have that supports, you know –

1050
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Send to Actions or whatever?

1051
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
– adding extensions.

1052
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Yeah.

1053
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,400
Yeah, exactly.

1054
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,200
But what I'm trying to get to is like is there like some DLNA standard that Kodi supports,

1055
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,840
universal plug and play like discovery like what is – what's happening?

1056
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,320
Is it a dynamic DNS?

1057
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:34,900
What's happening on the back end to make my Linux box capable of sending a video file

1058
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,560
over the network to Kodi?

1059
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,480
What two technologies or whatever multiple technologies are connecting to make that happen?

1060
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:47,480
Well the actual sending of it is pushing the data – the signal through curl to the Kodi

1061
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:52,240
box and the Kodi takes whatever signal you give it and then applies its effects.

1062
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:58,500
So technically like if you're watching a YouTube video, it's not going through your

1063
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,500
computer first.

1064
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,720
It's just sending the signal to play the YouTube video on your Kodi box.

1065
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,720
Oh.

1066
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,920
So it's just going from YouTube straight to Kodi.

1067
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,360
How does it – so how does it – okay.

1068
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:10,360
So how does it handle the scenario if one time I'm sending it an MP4 file and the next

1069
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,760
time I'm sending it a URL?

1070
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,960
It detects on – it runs scans based on what you're sending.

1071
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,880
Kodi already has – Kodi already has facilities to do that.

1072
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,880
Huh.

1073
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,920
No, Kodi has the ability to take the signal in.

1074
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:24,920
Oh, your script is –

1075
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,360
The script is actually scanning everything.

1076
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,360
So is it possible –

1077
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,480
So if you send it something and it –

1078
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,600
Is it possible for you to send like torrent metadata?

1079
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,920
So like if I'm say pulling down TechSnap and via torrent will it pull down like the

1080
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,880
episode name and all that kind of stuff and show that on Kodi?

1081
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,880
Yes.

1082
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,880
Nice.

1083
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:40,880
Wow.

1084
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,880
Damn.

1085
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,880
That is slick.

1086
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,320
Now what do you think like future way out totally down the road possibilities like to

1087
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,920
have this show up as like – to show up in the share sheet on Android as like an option

1088
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,440
to send a file to when I open up in VLC or something like that?

1089
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,400
I haven't working on – I wasn't working on Android support.

1090
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,520
Basically just Linux desktop support is the only thing I –

1091
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,520
Yeah.

1092
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,080
But there would be anything to prevent that?

1093
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,560
I mean that would be theoretically possible maybe?

1094
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:08,440
Yeah, it would be possible for sure, yes.

1095
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,440
Yeah.

1096
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,440
How do we really –

1097
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,640
There's some features that you can already do that on Android with – I'm pretty sure

1098
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:19,080
the core – the K-O-R-E remote has some features like that.

1099
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,080
Oh, okay.

1100
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,080
Okay.

1101
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:26,280
I'm not sure how well it does it or how extensive it is in comparison but I think it does work

1102
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,880
for like the basics.

1103
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:34,120
So is this – so this requires no changes or add-ons to Kodi at all for this to work?

1104
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,640
No, it doesn't.

1105
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,080
Some things require the add-ons.

1106
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,780
So for example, I mean you're going to add these add-ons anyway so if you wanted to watch

1107
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,320
YouTube on Kodi you got to install the YouTube add-on.

1108
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,320
Sure.

1109
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,160
And then it uses the YouTube add-on to send the signal to.

1110
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,160
Sure, okay.

1111
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,800
So basically what it does is that it takes – it figures out what you want to send it

1112
00:48:52,800 --> 00:49:01,040
to the script then it creates the signal in the syntax that Kodi wants then it says this

1113
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:05,740
is a YouTube URL so send it through the YouTube add-on specifically so that way it just immediately

1114
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:10,840
jumps to the add-on and if you have it – if you don't have the add-on it will tell you

1115
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:14,160
that you can't play this design for this particular add-on.

1116
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,680
Oh, that's nice.

1117
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,960
If you do have it, it will just start playing.

1118
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:22,180
Huh, I can't wait to try it, that's really nice.

1119
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:27,920
I think for me I'm kind of in a position where I don't – I didn't realize this but

1120
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,560
using Android TV, not to make this about Android TV, but by using Android TV my KodiBox natively

1121
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:38,800
already supports Chromecast built into it but it wouldn't be – but then when I use

1122
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,600
that functionality it drops me out of Kodi so this would allow me to stay in the Kodi

1123
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,600
app.

1124
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,600
Yeah.

1125
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,760
Well, that's cool.

1126
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,480
How do we find out more about this?

1127
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,120
I just sent a link to the – into the chat.

1128
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,120
Oh, perfect, there it is.

1129
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,120
Yes, thank you very much.

1130
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,120
Oh, okay.

1131
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:55,520
I will put a link in that there, what I like to call show notes.

1132
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,040
Did you know we have show notes, Wes?

1133
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,040
Yes, we do.

1134
00:49:58,040 --> 00:49:59,040
Yeah, that's true.

1135
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,120
Just one more quick – I wanted to answer Dream's question about Ubuntu Touch.

1136
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,360
It should work in Ubuntu Touch.

1137
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,360
Oh, yeah.

1138
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,360
Oh, gosh.

1139
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,360
Hell yeah.

1140
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,360
That makes sense.

1141
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,360
I like that.

1142
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:11,360
I like that a lot and I like that it already works with Jupyter Broadcasting.

1143
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,360
Boom.

1144
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,360
That's great.

1145
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,360
That's great.

1146
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,200
A bash script tool for creating – for casting media to Kodi Entertainment Center.

1147
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,120
So I want to take a little time now to talk about making Kodi great again.

1148
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:25,040
Not that it's not already great but I want to make my Kodi great again.

1149
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,040
You guys know me.

1150
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:31,160
I love trying to use open source solutions whenever possible but every now and then that

1151
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:37,120
little voice in the back of my head goes, Chris, just set up Plex.

1152
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,120
Just set up Plex.

1153
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,560
It will be much easier because then your kids can stream the files they want.

1154
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,200
It automatically takes care of the metadata problems you've been having.

1155
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,400
You don't have to worry about that.

1156
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,680
Just set up Plex.

1157
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,560
But now that I've moved and I'm resetting up my home entertainment system and I'm going

1158
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:59,120
to be resetting up network storage and I'm reevaluating anything that requires an internet

1159
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,560
connection top to bottom.

1160
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:05,800
And one of the things I don't ever want to have to really deal with is I sit down to

1161
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:09,040
watch TV and I can't because we're somewhere where we don't have internet connection.

1162
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,440
I just want my media to work.

1163
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,440
I just want my TV to work.

1164
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,400
And when you're in that position, you've had a long day, you just want to unwind.

1165
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,240
The last thing you want to do is get up and fix whatever's wrong.

1166
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,400
Likely like if I'm on a road trip, I've been driving all day long.

1167
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,400
Exactly.

1168
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,400
You need to put your feet up.

1169
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,320
And Kodi is fast, it works great with local media.

1170
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,560
It's the best playback interface.

1171
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,920
It just really is.

1172
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:26,920
It's got a great UI.

1173
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,120
It has great support for like tons of good skins.

1174
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,120
IR control.

1175
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,120
Yep.

1176
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,120
Yep.

1177
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,120
Lots of great add-ons.

1178
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,120
Some of those skins are just beautiful.

1179
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:35,120
Yeah.

1180
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,120
There's a new one coming.

1181
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,120
There's a Jupiter broadcasting app.

1182
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:38,120
Whoa.

1183
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,920
Yeah, so I'm going to be migrating from Plex to Kodi.

1184
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,360
And there's a lot that comes with that.

1185
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,360
Yeah.

1186
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,360
It's a different paradigm.

1187
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,360
It is.

1188
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,360
And I do have to rename some of my media.

1189
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,220
I have to change how I've done some of that.

1190
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:52,640
And there's different back ends I can use for Kodi, too, if I want a shared Kodi central

1191
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,860
database, if I want to take advantage of streaming.

1192
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:59,760
So I want to chat about all these different options, plus get some of the virtual lugs

1193
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,920
ideas and takes on some of this.

1194
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,560
It's kind of a new adventure for me, because Kodi is a really cool, super impressive open

1195
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:12,520
source application that I have played with on and off every single release since it was

1196
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,320
XBMC on a hacked Xbox.

1197
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,320
Right, exactly.

1198
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,320
I really have.

1199
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,320
Humble origins.

1200
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:24,360
But I have never really put 12 terabytes worth of media into it and tried to get playback

1201
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:30,040
and metadata synced across three television screens and then remote streaming for people

1202
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,040
on tablets.

1203
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,240
I've never gone that far into it.

1204
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,200
I've never actually really integrated it.

1205
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:40,800
And that's the route I'm taking now, and it does involve sort of reassessing how I have

1206
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,800
things set up.

1207
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,880
And if it's something you've ever considered doing or if you have tips on, I'd love to

1208
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:45,880
get your input.

1209
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,880
I'm going to mention right now our friends over at Linux Academy.

1210
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,780
Linux Academy is where you've got to go to get your basics and then work your way up

1211
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,160
to the advanced topics.

1212
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,960
If you're thinking about getting some certs, this is a great resource for you, linuxacademy.com

1213
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,380
slash unplugged.

1214
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:04,520
They have self-paced in-depth video courses on every Linux, cloud, and DevOps topic.

1215
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:09,720
They have hands-on scenario-based labs that give you experience on real servers.

1216
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,080
They have learning plans that allow you to pick a course and set a timeframe to fit your

1217
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:16,400
schedule and your learning goals.

1218
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:17,760
They have labs that spin up on demand.

1219
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,240
They have instructor mentoring, full-time human instructors happy to advise and answer

1220
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,960
questions, nuggets, tiny little sparks of wisdom that go deep into a single topic, iOS

1221
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,200
and Android apps so you can study on one of your devices when you're on the go, custom

1222
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,240
randomized decks of study cards that can be forked and improved by the community, a community

1223
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,880
that's stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members, study guides, lesson audio, personal

1224
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,400
notebooks and tools that help you study.

1225
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,560
You pick from your distribution to adjust the courseware and the servers and their system

1226
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:52,280
can evaluate you while you perform tasks on their server to give you real-time feedback.

1227
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:57,780
With hands-on guides that give you real-world experience, the feedback system, the study

1228
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:02,520
tools and the learning plans that allow you to pick your availability, nobody can touch

1229
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,400
Linux Academy and they're growing like crazy.

1230
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:13,640
They just announced a major, major partnership with a real actual physical school.

1231
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,120
This is something they've been growing on more and more recently and I think it's kind

1232
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,520
of an interesting way to take the Linux Academy hands-on training experience and offering

1233
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:25,560
it to students at a traditional university level class and they're getting real college

1234
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,560
credits for it.

1235
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,040
It's fascinating they have more information over on their blog.

1236
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,160
They've got the best tools to prepare you for search in a variety of Linux, AWS, OpenStack,

1237
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,480
DevOps, Azure and big data topics if you're searching for those search, it's a great platform

1238
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,480
for this too.

1239
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:45,320
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged and a big thank you to Linux Academy for sponsoring

1240
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,480
the unplugged program.

1241
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,480
Now I want to start with the obvious, this is like the due diligence segment of the show.

1242
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:59,160
I have to mention this part so I'm contractually obligated to reference you to the Kodi Wiki

1243
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,800
on naming video files and TV shows correctly.

1244
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:06,880
So this is the canonical guide by the project that's being updated all the time.

1245
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,140
They give you hierarchy examples, et cetera, et cetera, to follow.

1246
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,880
This is sort of the golden standard.

1247
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:15,520
So that is linked in the show notes right at the top of this segment if you're going

1248
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,520
to get into this.

1249
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,200
Have you any experience like going through and naming this stuff?

1250
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,320
For MB, I've always used FileBot.

1251
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,120
Tell me about FileBot, Wes.

1252
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,160
Tell me about FileBot.

1253
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,120
FileBot is a script that...

1254
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,120
Oh really?

1255
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,560
Yeah, and it has some parameters, specific parameters they call...

1256
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,560
FileBot.net.

1257
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,000
Automated Media Center and so...

1258
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Is this it?

1259
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
This?

1260
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
This is it right here?

1261
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Is this it?

1262
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,000
With a GUI?

1263
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yeah, that looks right.

1264
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I think it's a Java program actually.

1265
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Oh, snap, son.

1266
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,500
And here, let me throw in the Automated Media Center link right there which is kind of around

1267
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,640
a forum but it works very well.

1268
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:53,600
You kind of pull down your torrents or Usenet or however you have your media, you then run

1269
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,600
it on that folder.

1270
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,600
You can set it up to auto run.

1271
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,720
I'm sure you could use something like I notify wait if you wanted to do it that way or system

1272
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,520
D timer or anything.

1273
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:05,520
So this sounds like something that you could plug in with a Usenet downloader and have

1274
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,520
it automatically...

1275
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,520
Yes, absolutely.

1276
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:11,000
Or like some torrent clients support triggering programs to run, that kind of thing.

1277
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,760
So you can also have support for running things so like you can have it use butterfs reflinks,

1278
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,960
you can have it make symlinks when it organizes them.

1279
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,280
This is never really something I ever had to worry about with Plex.

1280
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,800
Like everything I just download or backup and I throw in there and I name somewhat correctly,

1281
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,320
Plex seems to grab it and nail it every single time.

1282
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,840
Like it seems to be really good at that.

1283
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:31,400
I think some people use it with Plex too.

1284
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,880
Alex I know that's what I've heard about it from.

1285
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,800
So I was thinking about trying out Tiny Media Manager which is kind of the same thing.

1286
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,160
Does a scan, it helps you manage the file naming and all that.

1287
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,760
Tiny Media Manager, a multi-OS media management tool.

1288
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,800
So what I'm thinking right is I got to get the original set of media correct first.

1289
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,800
Exactly.

1290
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,920
I got to go through a lot of files.

1291
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:52,160
Lots of seasons of crap and all that stuff that I love.

1292
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:57,800
Just stuff that I treasure but maybe I have sort of let the automated system manage the

1293
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,800
naming of it.

1294
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,040
This looks like a great interface to kind of explore that and make sure everything checks

1295
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,040
out.

1296
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,040
I like that it has a GUI.

1297
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,040
That's great.

1298
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,040
Yeah.

1299
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,040
Yeah.

1300
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,120
And it does look like it's pretty straightforward to use too.

1301
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:15,400
So that's sort of what I've found so far in how to sort of set up and prep my Kodi library.

1302
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,920
I don't know if anybody in the Mumble Room has tips for managing Kodi.

1303
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:25,680
And just to give you a picture here, I have been attempting to sort of move stuff in to

1304
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,760
see what just works without having to just sort of manage it.

1305
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,720
And it's pretty hit and miss so far.

1306
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,120
So it hasn't been perfect.

1307
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:37,000
I think one of the things that I want to sort of transition to is talking about some of

1308
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,600
the backend solutions you can use here.

1309
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:46,640
The ones that I've gotten feedback on are obviously MB backend for Kodi and Plex backend

1310
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,640
for Kodi.

1311
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,520
Wes, have you messed with the MB backend for Kodi?

1312
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,520
And what's the advantage?

1313
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,520
What's the reason?

1314
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,520
Why would I do that?

1315
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,120
Not just use Kodi's built-in database?

1316
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:58,480
Well, I used it to share my MB library with my parents.

1317
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:03,320
So I installed Kodi on a NUC at their house and VPNed our two networks together.

1318
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:06,720
And then I connected the MB plugin for Kodi with my MB server.

1319
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,080
And so I could then have local media there for them if they want, but like the NUC had

1320
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,760
a limited hard drive space, right?

1321
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:15,520
So then anything at my house just looked like it was right in the Kodi database.

1322
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,520
They could play it.

1323
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,960
It was transparent to them.

1324
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:25,040
So for me, it seems like the advantages of using MB on the backend or Plex would be that

1325
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:31,580
I can let MB and Plex scan the media, manage that, set up the libraries.

1326
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:35,440
You also get the web interface to go in and correct mistakes or watch it and stream it

1327
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,520
myself, which is a big deal.

1328
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,160
And I can then sync watch status across my Kodi instances.

1329
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,920
Does that work okay?

1330
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,360
It did seem to.

1331
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,320
I made multiple users.

1332
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:51,000
There was a little bit of an issue, I think, with how you do it.

1333
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,520
And I think if you want to have multiple users, there was kind of some workarounds you had

1334
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,520
to do because I think by default, it syncs it into the info files, but there are some

1335
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,520
options there.

1336
00:58:58,520 --> 00:58:59,520
Interesting.

1337
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:00,520
So that's...

1338
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,520
MB is definitely...

1339
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:02,520
And the nice thing is...

1340
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:07,160
Just with how smoothly it integrated and if you have a good link to your MB backend, playback

1341
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,160
was seamless.

1342
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,760
So the other one I'm considering a lot since I have an existing Plex database, but I probably

1343
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:13,760
would not...

1344
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,760
I'm probably not going to go this route.

1345
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:19,520
But one that I am looking at and it was pretty, pretty strongly recommended in the subreddit

1346
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:23,520
after last this weekend is Plex Kodi Connect, PKC.

1347
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:28,240
It combines the best front-end media player Kodi with the best multimedia backend server

1348
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,240
Plex.

1349
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,280
And I do have like a lifetime Plex pass or something like that.

1350
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,280
So that's also...

1351
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,360
Well, isn't the backend of Plex open source?

1352
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,920
It's the front-end that is closed source?

1353
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,920
Oh.

1354
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,920
So that would be nice.

1355
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,040
I'm not sure if that's still the case, but at one time, wasn't that?

1356
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,520
The front-end and the backend are no longer open source.

1357
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:46,960
The front-end used to be open source and they decided to...

1358
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:47,960
Whack that.

1359
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,480
Basically hire someone to make it closed.

1360
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:58,080
Now the Plex backend for Kodi supports movie and TV shows and pictures and music.

1361
00:59:58,080 --> 00:59:59,920
It automatically downloads the artwork.

1362
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,880
It does all the stuff that you'd expect including the transcoding and the streaming.

1363
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:09,680
There's a few issues like when you toggle the view state of an item, you have to resync...

1364
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:13,280
Kodi has to rescan the library before it sees that change on another Kodi box.

1365
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,760
But it seems like it's sort of the best if you're familiar with Plex, you get the management

1366
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,500
of Plex that does seem to have pretty good metadata matching, at least in my experience

1367
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:27,080
so far, at least for how I have my files named, with the Kodi front-end.

1368
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,360
So that's something else I'm chewing on.

1369
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:36,440
If anybody out there has tried it, I'd love to hear your feedback, linuxactionshow.reddit.com

1370
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,280
and let me know.

1371
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:43,920
Mr. Tonnell, or Dr. Tonnell over there, you're developing Kodi add-ons and things for Kodi.

1372
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,840
You must have a decent Kodi setup.

1373
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:46,840
Can you describe it a little bit?

1374
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:47,840
How do you have it?

1375
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,440
Are you just Samba server shares?

1376
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,320
Are you accessing local files?

1377
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,920
What's been your tried and true method to keep it working?

1378
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:57,200
Yeah, basically a Samba server.

1379
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,720
Here's one of the nice things.

1380
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:04,360
The Plex Media and I think MB server backends support swapping out local file paths if you

1381
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,360
turn it on.

1382
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:10,000
So you can turn on, when you click a file, instead of using the Plex HTTP path to the

1383
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,400
file, you can have it use your Samba share in the background.

1384
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,560
So it'll do a file that way, which is really nice and fast.

1385
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,760
So that's sort of cool, too.

1386
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,880
I use Samba for the storing of the thing, but I use Raspberry Pi to push it to the server.

1387
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:26,720
So it'll open a leg on Raspberry Pi.

1388
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,520
Oh, that's great.

1389
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:34,920
There's also this thing, there's this adapter called the Flirrk, and that is so awesome.

1390
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,040
What is the Flirrk?

1391
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:41,160
It's a little dongle that gives you a regular remote, like a TV remote.

1392
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,160
Oh, okay.

1393
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,800
There, I put it in the RC there.

1394
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,640
Will you drop that in the show notes, too, there?

1395
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:47,640
Absolutely.

1396
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,840
So here's my really dumb Kodi 101 question.

1397
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:56,520
Is a shared back-end database the only way for me to have... Really, the only thing

1398
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,560
I want, truly, is sync to watch status.

1399
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,840
I do like the idea of being able to remotely stream files, but that's secondary.

1400
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,960
What I really, really want is for the TVs to all see what files have been watched.

1401
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:12,860
So if I'm watching Mr. Robot or Silicon Valley, which are my two shows I only watch, really,

1402
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:16,480
but when I watch those, I want to be able to watch them and have them marked as watched.

1403
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,840
Run downstairs, you hit play, and it's the same thing.

1404
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:26,520
And bearing in mind that I'm on both ends, I'm on an Android TV box, it seems like there's

1405
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,800
a lot of effort, unless I want the remote streaming capabilities, it seems like there's

1406
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,600
a lot of effort just to get sync to watch status across them.

1407
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,600
Yeah.

1408
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,600
Anyways, so...

1409
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:41,040
I don't use the sync to watch status, so I mean, I just use the... I only have the one

1410
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,040
device anyway.

1411
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,800
Well, I have multiple devices for testing of making the multi-device work, but I only

1412
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,360
have one that I care about, so I couldn't really help with that one.

1413
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:54,000
The other nice thing having a central back end would be if Kodi misidentifies something,

1414
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,280
I fix it in one spot.

1415
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,280
Yes, that's true.

1416
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:57,280
That is nice, too.

1417
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,960
Yeah, I've played with MB, and so far I like MB for the functionality, what you're talking

1418
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,960
about.

1419
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,360
I haven't rolled it out in a big scale or anything, because I don't need it, but I have

1420
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:10,080
played with it, and it seems to work as advertised.

1421
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,080
Yeah.

1422
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,240
Yeah, I'll second that.

1423
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:21,680
My Kodi on Raspberry Pi 3 plus an MB server back end, and I was even able to stream 720p,

1424
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:30,880
or have MB downsampled to 720p, and stream to a Raspberry Pi box at my dad's house 300

1425
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:36,000
miles away over my Comcast internet with a 10 megabit upload.

1426
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,400
Hey, you know, that's pretty slick.

1427
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:39,400
From a Raspberry Pi?

1428
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,400
Yeah, I love it.

1429
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,400
I'm really leaning...

1430
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,400
There's so many options.

1431
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:43,400
There's so many options.

1432
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,400
It's awesome.

1433
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,920
The other thing it looks like with the MB back end, or to do the MB back end, and Wes,

1434
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,040
maybe you could tell me if I'm wrong, but it looks like all they really have to do,

1435
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:52,360
there's already an existing add-on.

1436
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:55,960
Yeah, you just install the add-on, configure it to point to your server.

1437
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:58,520
Do I have... If I just go in Kodi, is it in the main list right there?

1438
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,520
I believe so.

1439
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:00,520
And then you just have...

1440
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:01,520
It should be in the main list.

1441
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:02,720
It's also created by the MB team.

1442
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:03,720
Yeah, exactly.

1443
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:08,280
And that is also another reason why I really like that long term, and it gives you a GUI

1444
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,200
where you put in the MB server info and stuff like that right there.

1445
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,480
And so I think when I'm working from an Android TV set top box, I don't feel like... I hate

1446
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,480
Android's file system.

1447
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,480
I don't want to dig around on that.

1448
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,480
Exactly.

1449
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,480
It's a mess.

1450
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,480
So that's kind of appealing.

1451
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,520
Plus, MB is open source through and through, and it seems like that's a better match with

1452
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,140
an open source media server.

1453
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:31,040
And I think the MB back end also supports swapping out the local file paths, so I could

1454
01:04:31,040 --> 01:04:32,040
use my Samba shares.

1455
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,040
Yeah, totally.

1456
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,920
I'm getting really excited.

1457
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:38,800
It's been a long time since I've reevaluated how I do this.

1458
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,800
I set this up.

1459
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:44,280
It's kind of a big decision, not because it's that important, but just because you really

1460
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,600
aren't going to come back to it for a long time if it's working.

1461
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:47,600
So get it right.

1462
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,600
There's that.

1463
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:49,600
Once you set it up, you don't want to mess with it.

1464
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:55,360
And two, I am not mature enough as an adult to be over that embarrassment that I feel

1465
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,900
when... So this happened this weekend.

1466
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:04,480
So this weekend, we were in Leavenworth, Washington with no internet connection.

1467
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:12,680
And we have Plex on a set top box in the bedroom, and we have Plex on a set top box in the living

1468
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,520
room of Lady Tubes.

1469
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:16,520
I use these terms loosely.

1470
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:22,360
And the living room, Nvidia Shield, has a Plex media server locally running on it.

1471
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:26,680
That's how I currently do this at home.

1472
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:30,560
And without an internet connection, the Plex front end in the bedroom can't just go out

1473
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,560
and make the roundabout connection and play the local file.

1474
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:34,560
I don't know why.

1475
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,560
It's supposed to.

1476
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:36,560
It is supposed to.

1477
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:37,560
But it wouldn't.

1478
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:38,560
That's really annoying.

1479
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,560
And so there we are.

1480
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,840
And so I'm like, okay, let's watch the movie.

1481
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:44,400
But this is where Noah's voice is in the back of your head, and you're like, ugh.

1482
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,400
So then I'm like, okay.

1483
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,440
From now on, I'm just going to set this up, and I'm going to do local file paths, and

1484
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,840
I'm done with this.

1485
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:50,840
Totally.

1486
01:05:50,840 --> 01:05:55,320
So I think that's going to seal the deal on Envy, and then you just not have to worry

1487
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,320
about it.

1488
01:05:56,320 --> 01:06:00,920
Because when I do watch TV a couple of times a week, it's like my sort of unwind, relax.

1489
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,880
I do it when I'm totally worn out, and there's nothing else more productive I'd be doing

1490
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,880
anyways.

1491
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:05,880
I'm like, all right.

1492
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:06,880
Time to allow myself a little chill out time.

1493
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:07,880
Exactly.

1494
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:10,680
And to get frustrated when that thing just sits there and spins and spins and spins on

1495
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,680
the screen.

1496
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:12,680
It's like, okay.

1497
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:15,560
So the other nice part about using Envy or Plex is you also then get Chromecast support

1498
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,560
if you are somewhere where you're like, well, I really want to do this, but I don't have

1499
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:19,560
my Kodi set up with me.

1500
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,560
But you have a Chromecast.

1501
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:21,560
Boom.

1502
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,560
Yeah.

1503
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:23,560
Hmm.

1504
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,560
I'm excited to set this all up again.

1505
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:25,760
It's been a long time.

1506
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,760
And it makes my-

1507
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,760
Actually-

1508
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,760
Yeah, go ahead.

1509
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:29,760
Sorry about that.

1510
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:38,880
I'm actually looking at the Envy's plug-ins, and it actually has an Envy Kodi Sync Kuli

1511
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:39,880
plug-in built in.

1512
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:40,880
Yeah.

1513
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:41,880
You can just install it.

1514
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:42,880
Yep.

1515
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:43,880
It goes right to it.

1516
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:44,880
Yeah, I know.

1517
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:45,880
It looks really straightforward.

1518
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:46,880
It looks like-

1519
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,880
And then you're using two great open source projects together.

1520
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,880
Yeah.

1521
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,880
So it's just I have-

1522
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:50,880
The only thing that's-

1523
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,520
The only hesitation I have is I have had really great experience with Plex.

1524
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:58,800
I have a Plex Pass, and I have friends that I'm sharing my Plex libraries with already.

1525
01:06:58,800 --> 01:06:59,800
And they're pretty good.

1526
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:02,320
I mean, for being partially proprietary, they're pretty good.

1527
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,800
I mean, they employ that MPV developer.

1528
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,800
That's true.

1529
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:05,800
I mean, they seem like good citizens.

1530
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:06,800
Yeah.

1531
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:07,800
And they have kicked up some upstream code.

1532
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,800
So that's-

1533
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,800
Yeah.

1534
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:10,800
That is-

1535
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:11,800
But they're not Envy, though.

1536
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:12,800
But they're not Envy.

1537
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:13,800
Right.

1538
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:14,800
We live in interesting times, Chris.

1539
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,800
Yeah.

1540
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:16,800
I know.

1541
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:17,800
I know it doesn't-

1542
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,800
For me, I'm not trying-

1543
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,800
This is not some big problem I'm trying to solve.

1544
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:23,040
It's a fun challenge to get to relook at my home storage and now try to do it in a way

1545
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:24,520
that's mobile and low power.

1546
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,080
You get to play architect, sysadmin.

1547
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,080
All these things.

1548
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:33,680
You try to do it in a way that's going to be like long-lasting, sustainable, low maintenance.

1549
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,680
Low maintenance.

1550
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,680
Yes.

1551
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,680
And that's the trick.

1552
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,560
And that's the perfect trifecta if you can pull it off.

1553
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:42,320
And that's exactly what you want for your home media system.

1554
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:48,660
And the thing that I think that really has me fired up about it is just spending a couple

1555
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:54,080
of months in Kodi using local files on the NVIDIA Shield, I have just grown such a new

1556
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:58,200
appreciation for this open source project that that is-

1557
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,640
It's been going for so long and it's very polished.

1558
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,400
And it's like, I really respect some of the decisions they've made recently because I

1559
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:08,840
think they're really following some interesting trends and there's more and more better hardware

1560
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:09,840
out there all the time.

1561
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,840
Yes.

1562
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,240
And then it feels like if this is something I can really get my head around, then down

1563
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:16,440
the road I can start experimenting with Raspberry Pis running.

1564
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,440
Exactly.

1565
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,440
Yeah.

1566
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:19,440
And then it's like-

1567
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,480
Especially with all those things Wimpy was telling us about compiling with better video

1568
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:22,480
support.

1569
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:23,480
Yeah, exactly.

1570
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,880
And I think what makes me think about that is it's a really easy, sustainable, long-term

1571
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,400
way when like a family member wants something like this after they check out.

1572
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,000
Add them right into your network.

1573
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,280
Yes, exactly.

1574
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:38,480
So it could be really nice and it could be a really fun, sustainable home project.

1575
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,320
So I'll give you guys an update when I actually put it all together.

1576
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,640
I'm going to start experimenting with stuff over the next few weeks and then figure out

1577
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,440
how I'm doing the backend storage.

1578
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,360
And then we'll actually probably have to figure that out sooner than later, really.

1579
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:51,320
And then I got to rename all the media.

1580
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,320
But it's a good problem.

1581
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:53,320
It's a good problem to have.

1582
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,320
I'm looking forward to it.

1583
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,480
And we have links to all bunch of stuff in the show notes if you guys want to check it

1584
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:57,480
out.

1585
01:08:57,480 --> 01:09:00,280
And if you have any experience in this area, I would love to hear it.

1586
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,280
LinuxActionShow.reddit.com.

1587
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:02,280
Go chime in.

1588
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,280
Go chime in.

1589
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,000
There's never too many cooks in this kitchen.

1590
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:12,880
No, I've been getting mixed responses, but I've been getting mixed responses.

1591
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,960
Some people are, yeah.

1592
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,040
But a lot of folks have been very helpful.

1593
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,340
So it's really cool.

1594
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:20,340
And it's pretty exciting.

1595
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:23,280
Be all end all, we're very excited about all these open source projects.

1596
01:09:23,280 --> 01:09:30,520
It's neat to rediscover and re-embrace something that I've observed but haven't really fully

1597
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,520
dived into for a long time.

1598
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:32,520
Right, exactly.

1599
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,120
That's sort of a fun aspect of it as well.

1600
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:35,120
Cool it is.

1601
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,120
Yeah, yeah.

1602
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:39,920
All right, that brings us to the end of at least the official part of this week's show.

1603
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,840
Episode 156 wraps up.

1604
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,800
We love your feedback, your responses, your topic ideas at LinuxActionShow.reddit.com.

1605
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,840
Your feedback also is welcome at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash contact.

1606
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:53,680
And a huge part of this show is our virtual log and our live chat room.

1607
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:57,160
Find out our lifetimes at jupyterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

1608
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:02,000
And then just head over to jblive.tv during that lifetime, which is 2 p.m. Pacific.

1609
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,200
And hang out in the chat room, our do-bag mumble, and get the mumble server info.

1610
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,120
Just join us any way you can.

1611
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,120
Absolutely.

1612
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,840
Man, I can't wait till next week.

1613
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:30,120
See you right back here next Tuesday.

1614
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:50,040
You know, in some ways, I feel like the whole media center topic has been done over and

1615
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,360
over and over again.

1616
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:56,080
But in other ways, I feel like it's sort of re-energized in the sense that there is cooler

1617
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,840
hardware available than we've ever had.

1618
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,880
This way, like the stuff is getting, the embedded stuff is getting powerful enough to actually

1619
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:01,880
do this.

1620
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:02,880
I feel like ARM's coming up.

1621
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,360
Intel's getting cheaper and smaller.

1622
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:06,480
It's like there's a lot of those middle range devices.

1623
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,200
And on the back end, like hard drives are getting big for cheap.

1624
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,880
I think, what is it, Seagate now has a 10 terabyte hard drive you can buy.

1625
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,680
And which means, what that really means is their 8 terabyte hard drives are now completely

1626
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:17,680
reasonable in price.

1627
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:18,680
Yes, exactly, right.

1628
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,240
Eight terabytes in a single drive.

1629
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,240
You know, you put three of those.

1630
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,240
That's a lot of Star Trek.

1631
01:11:22,240 --> 01:11:23,240
Woo!

1632
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:24,240
Yeah, exactly.

1633
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:30,800
So there's like this confluence of super well-priced, really powerful front-end hardware.

1634
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,880
And an abundance of free software that you can just use it to manage all.

1635
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:36,940
At all levels.

1636
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:41,120
From getting this content automatically off the internet, from backing it up off your

1637
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:44,480
own optical media, to managing it.

1638
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:50,400
And then, on top of it, the seamless integration now with things like YouTube and Torrance

1639
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,360
and all this stuff that makes online media at the same level as all the other stuff.

1640
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:56,280
Everything's on the same level playing field.

1641
01:11:56,280 --> 01:12:01,000
And Kodi is in a perfect intersection of all that stuff with the hard drive.

1642
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,000
It's just, I love it.

1643
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,600
I'm really excited about it.

1644
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:07,360
I just linked a super sexy case from the Flirk team.

1645
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:08,360
That is really nice.

1646
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,360
Check this out.

1647
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,360
I saw that.

1648
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,360
I think I saw it.

1649
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,360
Maybe linked on the Kodi main site.

1650
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,360
Oh, I might have to pick that up.

1651
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:14,360
I can't remember where I saw this.

1652
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,960
Yeah, they had a deal, the Flirk and Kodi made a deal to make their own Kodi version

1653
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:18,960
of this.

1654
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:19,960
Okay.

1655
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:20,960
Oh, nice.

1656
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:21,960
Yeah.

1657
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:22,960
Doesn't that look really nice?

1658
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:23,960
Wow.

1659
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,960
Like, legitimately, I could see like when Angela's like, okay, I'm ready to replace these Rokus,

1660
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,600
I would totally go with this.

1661
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,360
See that's perfect because I have that NUC of my parents' house that's also their like

1662
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,040
router and it's, you know, it's playing a lot of roles for them, but I can just, I have

1663
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,080
a pie sitting around, buy one of these, stick it in their bedroom upstairs.

1664
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:40,400
Now they have both TVs connected to my chair.

1665
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,880
You know, I wonder if Noah's going to start working with some of this stuff too.

1666
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:43,880
I know.

1667
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:44,880
Because he does some displays too.

1668
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:45,880
Exactly.

1669
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:46,880
Nice rotten corpse.

1670
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:47,880
Yeah.

1671
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:48,880
Thanks for mentioning that because I'd forgotten about that.

1672
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:51,040
And it's 15 bucks and your money's going to a great deal.

1673
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,840
Anytime I feel like you're buying from this ecosystem, that's going to a good cause.

1674
01:12:53,840 --> 01:13:00,720
And specifically since Chris mentioned on last that the Nvidia Shield was just so responsive,

1675
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:06,520
I noticed a huge bump upgrading from Raspberry Pi 2 to Raspberry Pi 3 when using Kodi.

1676
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:07,520
Hmm.

1677
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:08,520
Yeah.

1678
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,520
I believe that.

1679
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:14,920
I should make mention that on playback, when watching my review of the Shield, Plex actually

1680
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,560
started the file right away, but the video file I just happened to chose had like two

1681
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,140
seconds of black.

1682
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:25,740
So somebody on YouTube was like, um, hey, and I watched it back and I'm like, oh yeah.

1683
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:31,360
So it actually, the Nvidia Shield is just wicked fast, period.

1684
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,200
And I mean that on like every level.

1685
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:37,000
Like Netflix is, obviously that's going to be fast, it's a simple app, but like Borderlands

1686
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
2 launches instantly.

1687
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,000
Wow.

1688
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,200
It's really, it's really powerful.

1689
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:43,480
And Noah's box is cheaper and I like that.

1690
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,400
And then the Raspberry Pi's are even another route to go.

1691
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:47,840
So who am I to say which one you should go with?

1692
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,880
But at each level there's great options.

1693
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:54,000
And I can't even want to build a full PC over here in the studio too, just to have fun with

1694
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
that.

1695
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,920
But you know, I do have that Pi sitting around, so if you want to try it as an end point to

1696
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:02,600
whatever solution you go to, I would be happy to set that up.

1697
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:03,600
Love you, Wes.

1698
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,440
What were you going to say, Noah?

1699
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:10,280
I have a Pi B Plus that actually runs Kodi.

1700
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:17,000
It's not the fastest solution, but it does work pretty well, especially if you're only

1701
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,560
doing like 720p and lower.

1702
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:21,120
It runs like a champ.

1703
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,120
Yeah.

1704
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:26,360
I mean, almost all the TV shows I get are 720p or lower.

1705
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,880
North Ranger, were you going to say something, but we kept cutting you off here?

1706
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:29,880
Oh, yeah.

1707
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:35,520
I can't remember if I saw this on the big rundown on last two that some of these Android

1708
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,760
TV boxes are really the only ones that you can do reliable 4K streaming yet for people

1709
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:42,360
that are jumping on the 4K TV bandwidth.

1710
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:43,360
That is true.

1711
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,360
Yeah.

1712
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:48,840
You know, and I don't have a 4K TV, so I just mentioned it in the specs, but not only does

1713
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:55,680
the Shield support 4K video, but it also supports UHD 4K, and I'll tell you, I am more excited

1714
01:14:55,680 --> 01:15:01,520
about UHD 4K than I am 3D because what UHD, basically, if my understanding is correct,

1715
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:07,080
and it might not be, but my understanding is that UHD is essentially HDR 4K video.

1716
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:10,360
So like it's 4K video with HDR exposure.

1717
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,560
The spec you want to look for is UHD Plus.

1718
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:13,560
Right.

1719
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:14,560
Yeah.

1720
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,560
Okay.

1721
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,560
Thanks.

1722
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:17,560
Yeah.

1723
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:18,560
And that, I cannot wait.

1724
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:24,120
It does not compel me, but 4K UHD Plus, yeah, that's got me.

1725
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:30,880
So Chris, what are you thinking for storage hardware, especially in the RV, and aren't

1726
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,800
you worried about heat?

1727
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,800
Big time.

1728
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:38,160
Yeah, I really am because it's going to be in a dinette booth underneath the booth, closed

1729
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,160
up.

1730
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:43,120
I'm already worried about heat with just the cradle point and the Wi-Fi, and I have a cell

1731
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,160
booster in there right now.

1732
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:49,960
So I don't know, I have pledged to make it Linux.

1733
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:50,960
That's what I know.

1734
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:51,960
Okay.

1735
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:58,240
Which has eliminated FreeNAS from the running, which is a little disappointing because I

1736
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:01,800
could use the FreeNAS plug-ins to accomplish some of the stuff I want because I don't want

1737
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,280
to run more than one device.

1738
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,280
Right.

1739
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:05,440
Just because of the power issues.

1740
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:06,440
So these are running on-

1741
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:07,760
It simplifies everything if you just have the one.

1742
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,260
All of this stuff is going to be running off an inverter, which also powers my fridge and

1743
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,460
two other TVs.

1744
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,820
So there's not – I don't know how much overhead this thing has, but this inverter

1745
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:20,720
probably only has like another thousand watts to give.

1746
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:26,040
So I got to make sure that I really – I got to make sure that I am very power conscious

1747
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:27,360
about what I choose.

1748
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:31,080
So whatever I implement, I think I'm going to need the support of – I got to be able

1749
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:32,080
to virtualize.

1750
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,080
Yeah, totally.

1751
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:40,000
So I think – so I am really trying not to do a NUC with Linux on it that's just connected

1752
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,520
to some disk, but that seems like a possibility to me.

1753
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:49,640
But what I really want to do is I would really like to have something like FreeNAS that is

1754
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,640
Linux-based.

1755
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:57,000
But eventually, I'm going to put – I have three booth dinette seats to work with.

1756
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:01,840
So I'm going to spread things out amongst the dinette seats to spread out the heat,

1757
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,380
and that is one thing I'll be doing.

1758
01:17:03,380 --> 01:17:10,320
And then I want to have a shit ton of storage so I can consolidate all of my media that

1759
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:14,980
I store here at the studio and all of my media that I store at Angela's house, which is

1760
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:19,400
about two terabytes here at the studio and about 12 terabytes at Angela's house.

1761
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:24,800
I want to consolidate all of that into my own file server so I can get off their file

1762
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:25,800
servers.

1763
01:17:25,800 --> 01:17:30,220
The studio's file server shouldn't be housing some of my personal media.

1764
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:31,600
So get that off there.

1765
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,280
Get it off Angela's house server so that way she can put more of her own stuff on there,

1766
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,360
like whatever she wants to watch.

1767
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:41,640
And then I want to have enough left over to run virtual machines and enough left over

1768
01:17:41,640 --> 01:17:48,220
to store video content and audio content that I record on the road when I'm, like, doing

1769
01:17:48,220 --> 01:17:49,220
rover logs or shows.

1770
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:50,220
I want to have a local backup.

1771
01:17:50,220 --> 01:17:52,280
A nice working set that you can have all the time.

1772
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,280
Yeah.

1773
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:57,880
And how to do all of that without generating a crap ton of heat or a crap ton of maintenance.

1774
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:04,320
And something that is super reliable because when I'm on the road, I've got a million

1775
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,320
things to worry about.

1776
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,320
And –

1777
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,320
You need it to just work.

1778
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:08,320
Yeah.

1779
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,320
So that's my challenge.

1780
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,320
Yeah.

1781
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,320
Go ahead.

1782
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:12,320
Whack walk.

1783
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,320
Whack work.

1784
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,320
Whack work.

1785
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,320
Whack work.

1786
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,420
I like that we have muhahaha in there too.

1787
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:19,500
So that is my goal.

1788
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:21,680
That is where – that is what I'm aiming for.

1789
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,580
And I will – whatever I end up – whatever solution I build, I'll probably record it

1790
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:30,280
all as I build it up and set it up and then do an episode of Last About It or something.

1791
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:33,120
So whatever I end up doing, whatever – however I try to solve all these things –

1792
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,120
Stay tuned.

1793
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,120
Yeah.

1794
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,120
Stay tuned and find out.

1795
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,120
All right.

1796
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:40,640
I have a little conspiracy bacon to fry that's not really Linux related.

1797
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,720
It's actually Apple related.

1798
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,360
But it might result in more Linux users.

1799
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:46,360
So –

1800
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,360
Hey.

1801
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,360
You want to fry a little conspiracy bacon with me?

1802
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,360
Yes.

1803
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,360
Let's do it.

1804
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,360
Mmm.

1805
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,360
Smells good in here.

1806
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,540
So if you follow any of the Apple blogs or Scuttlebutt or whatever, I mean they're just

1807
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:56,080
all over the internet.

1808
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:00,300
Apple users are belly aching about how old Mac hardware is, right?

1809
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:02,320
It's like super ancient now.

1810
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,960
With the exception of like a couple of Mac devices, they basically are – some of the

1811
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:09,240
machines are running three-year-old hardware and they're still charging the same exact

1812
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:14,280
price they did when they shipped it, like the Mac Pro or some of the MacBook line.

1813
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,800
And I've been wondering like what are they doing?

1814
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:16,800
Are they crazy?

1815
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,840
And then today this new Apple commercial went online.

1816
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:21,840
Have you seen this?

1817
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:22,840
I have not.

1818
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,280
It's called iPad Pro, what is a computer?

1819
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:27,760
Now I can't play all of the audio because I'm sure even though it's a commercial I'll

1820
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,760
get taken down for playing it.

1821
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:29,760
Well of course, Chris.

1822
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:35,000
And a screen you can touch and even write on.

1823
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:40,080
So the whole ad is the premise around rethink what a computer is.

1824
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,140
Don't assume that it's just for content consumption.

1825
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:44,920
This is the new iPad.

1826
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:48,560
Imagine what your computer could do if your computer was an iPad Pro.

1827
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:49,560
So here's my conspiracy.

1828
01:19:49,560 --> 01:19:50,560
Are you ready?

1829
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:51,560
Oh yeah.

1830
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:57,360
So Apple is intentionally slowing down the MacBook and the Mac line in general to try

1831
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,720
to get their consumer base to switch over.

1832
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:00,720
Rev up on the iPads.

1833
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:01,720
Yeah.

1834
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:02,720
Yeah.

1835
01:20:02,720 --> 01:20:05,480
To be like, let's buy iPads instead because they feel like they can't really, you know,

1836
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:08,360
there's not like that Mac business isn't going to go, it's just sort of what it's been

1837
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:09,360
forever.

1838
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,360
Yeah.

1839
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:11,360
Do you think that could be what it is?

1840
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,200
Could it be the grand Apple conspiracy to get everybody on iPads?

1841
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,120
I mean it is their beautiful walled garden environment.

1842
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,120
I could see it.

1843
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:22,120
It's up to you to decide, dear audience.

1844
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,120
Who knows?

1845
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,120
Makes sense to me.

1846
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:28,200
Everyone will have services and iPads and only us weirdo Linux users will be left on

1847
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,200
the desktop.

1848
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,200
Yeah.

1849
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,200
Yeah.

1850
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:32,200
Oh.

1851
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,400
Maybe it's better that way.

1852
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:37,640
Then people who want to make desktop apps will have to come to us and we'll by then

1853
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:41,040
we'll have decided on the one true packaging format so it'll be fine.

1854
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,040
Oh, we've already decided.

1855
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:43,040
We're going to talk about it in the show today.

1856
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,040
Oh great.

1857
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:45,040
Yeah.

1858
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:50,240
We're going to talk about Apple's margins on their A9, A10, and A11, all their in-house

1859
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,520
chip sets compared to Intel.

1860
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:53,520
Sure.

1861
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:58,240
Especially since they can build that one chip and use it across three mobile devices.

1862
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:15,480
The margins on that have got to be pretty smart.
