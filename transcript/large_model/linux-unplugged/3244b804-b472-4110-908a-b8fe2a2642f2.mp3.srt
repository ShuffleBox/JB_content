1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
So Wes and I have been kind of geeking out and

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,560
following the development of getting Linux support for

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,240
the M1 platform, like completely upstream support.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,840
And Hector Martin and the Linux team, they're working on that.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,360
And as part of this interest and just kind of documenting it so

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,800
we can report on the shows, Wes was watching one of the live streams last

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,040
night that Hector Martin does of development, fascinating insights.

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,120
And listen to how they're actually developing the GPU driver,

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,120
which they've just upstreamed some of the M1 GPU driver

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,920
support to Mesa with 75% OpenGL ES compliance, which is wild at this stage.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,880
But how are they doing this?

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,560
Since they don't have a complete Linux operating system to run and

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,240
develop on, they have an amazing hack.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, the M1 GPU driver, that's the user space part, by the way.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,280
So it's running on Mac OS at this point, but

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,040
it's really awesome that it's passing a ton of the tests already.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,680
So that's why I really wanna work on this hypervisor,

18
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,520
because once this works, it will give me the information I need to write

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,760
the kernel side of this.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,440
And since the user space side is going so well, basically,

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:11,440
once the kernel side has basic GPU context and memory management,

22
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,320
we can plug that in and then suddenly everything works on Linux too.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,560
So it's really cool that we're getting so much progress.

24
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,280
I had a private conversation with Hector and he told me that he was optimistic

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,440
that we may have a usable desktop by December.

26
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,040
And I thought he was crazy when he said that, I thought, no way, no way.

27
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,120
But now that I hear that, he might be onto something.

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,360
Sounds like you better start budgeting, buddy.

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,560
I don't think so.

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,920
I mean, if you think about it, Wes, if you're gonna spend that kind of money,

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,280
it's gotta be, if you're gonna do it for a brand new computer,

32
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,040
it has to be really operational.

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,160
I think at this stage, it's gonna be, you can do data recovery,

34
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,000
you can do forensics, you could do some sort of rescue and

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,360
get basic Linux functionality.

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,840
I think that's gonna be where we get to in 2021.

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,240
But that's gonna be really valuable.

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:08,480
Hello, good looking and welcome back to your weekly Linux talk show.

39
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,440
My name is Chris.

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
My name is Wes.

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,960
Hello, Wes.

42
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,760
You know, you didn't have to wear the postal outfit for today's episode.

43
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,840
That wasn't required.

44
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,960
You turned the studio into a post office.

45
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,680
I just thought I'd dress to fit.

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,800
This episode is brought to you by the all new at Cloud Guru,

50
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,560
Well, coming up on episode 404, it's webmail has been found.

51
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,080
It's the finale of the email server series this week.

52
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,840
It's a three-part series, and we have one last important task we must finish.

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,600
We must get webmail up and running after a back and forth.

54
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,800
If we were gonna do it, we decided, yes, it's a feature we need.

55
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,880
And really, to make it complete,

56
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,200
we know we gotta have a little bit of a production test.

57
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,520
So we're gonna give out credentials live on the show to, I won't say who,

58
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,680
I'm gonna reveal, but to a test user.

59
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,400
Hint, hint, he's in the mumble room.

60
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,440
And he's gonna try logging in for the first time and send an email and

61
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,840
let us know if it works right here live.

62
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,520
Then after all this is done, we're gonna kind of, just from time to time,

63
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,840
follow up and do check-ins on the email server.

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,400
It's not gonna be like a regular thing anymore,

65
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,000
kind of like how we do the Arch server from time to time.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,920
But of course, we've got community news, we've got pics, we've got some feedback.

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,440
So before I get into any of that,

68
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,120
I'd like to say time appropriate greetings to that mumble room.

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,760
Hello, virtual lug, lup-lup.

70
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,440
Hello.

71
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:32,960
Hello.

72
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,480
Hello.

73
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,000
Hello.

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,520
Hello.

75
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
Namaskaram.

76
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,560
Hello, everybody.

77
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,080
Boy, it's nice to have, look at that, 25 of you in there.

78
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,720
Good to have you here today.

79
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,480
So let's start with a little community news because one of those members in that

80
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,400
virtual lug is Mr. Daniel Fore from the elementary OS project.

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,200
And we have news of a beta for elementary OS 6.

82
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,880
Dan's joining us to tell us a little bit about it.

83
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,160
Hello, Dan, welcome back.

84
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,520
Hey, how's it going?

85
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,760
Oh, pretty good.

86
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,160
Good to see a beta land.

87
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:06,240
This is kind of an exciting milestone in the road towards elementary OS 6.

88
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
So what are we expecting here?

89
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,320
This doesn't look like it's a final product at this stage, but

90
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:14,320
it's looking like it's getting pretty close to something you could use day to day.

91
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,120
Yeah, I tell you what, it's been a rough year for obvious reasons, but

92
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,360
I'm really excited to get this beta out.

93
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,920
So what we're really looking at here is we're making this big transition over to

94
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,600
a flat pack based app center, right?

95
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,440
And we have all these great new APIs, both from upstream and

96
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,160
from things we've been working on.

97
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,320
And we're in a place right now where we want to really stabilize that developer

98
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,520
experience and get people in and building their apps as flat packs with these new

99
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,240
APIs and getting feedback about their experience so

100
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,920
we can get ready to do the real thing.

101
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,840
All right, so you mentioned the year.

102
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,520
It's been 370-ish days since 2004 came out, which will be the base.

103
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,560
And I'm wondering, what are your thoughts reflecting on that amount of time?

104
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,280
Is it the project's goal to generally ship sooner than that?

105
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,360
Or is it really just a matter of you ship when it's ready, and

106
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,920
if it takes 370-ish days to get to a beta, that's acceptable and

107
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,240
what the user should expect?

108
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Yeah, I mean, it's a little bit of this, a little bit of that.

109
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,360
Like, obviously, it would have been nice to ship a lot sooner.

110
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,200
We had planned a sprint early last year that we were supposed to be able to go and

111
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,760
get all this flat pack app center stuff done at that time.

112
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,360
And then the world blew up.

113
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,680
So this is definitely a lot more delayed than we really wanted.

114
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:39,240
But that is kind of the beauty of deciding to release when we're ready is we've

115
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,400
never really had these big commitments to dates.

116
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,840
And it was more like, this is the work that needs to get done.

117
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,680
And as long as it takes to get the work done, that's the experience we want to ship.

118
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,840
And you know what, I think the users appreciate that.

119
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,040
So there is now ways, though, for people to get involved and

120
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,480
help accelerate development and help make elementary OS 6 great.

121
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,200
I saw you have information posted where you go through the beta,

122
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,440
you show some of the new features.

123
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,960
By the way, I really like that new, I think you guys call it accent colors

124
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,560
feature that kind of just lets you spice up the UI a little bit.

125
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,400
That looks really slick.

126
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,200
How does that work, Dan?

127
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,760
Does it highlight the default buttons in different colors that you choose?

128
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,200
Is that essentially what it's doing?

129
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,880
Yeah, so under the hood, what it actually is, is we're now shipping

130
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,920
eight different variations of our style sheet that are kind of built at compile

131
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,680
time, and they all use a different base accent color.

132
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,440
So when you're getting things like the suggested action buttons, or

133
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,400
selections in radios, or in menus, or lists, or things like that,

134
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,840
anytime that you see, normally you just see a blue accent by default.

135
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,680
But now you can kind of choose what your favorite color is, or

136
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,800
we actually even just merged the ability to have it automatically select a color

137
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,120
based on your wallpaper.

138
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,680
There must be a performance benefit to you guys building those themes ahead of

139
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,320
time.

140
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,720
And then as a user, I select them, they're built and ready to go.

141
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,160
That just seems great.

142
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,600
Is that something that's normal, or

143
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,320
is that something that elementary OS does differently?

144
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,240
You know, I'm really not sure how other platforms are handling it.

145
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,920
I think Deepin maybe has a color selection, and

146
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,280
I think maybe another desktop environment.

147
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,960
I'm really not sure about how other ones are working.

148
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,720
But this is like the one we felt that would be the easiest to maintain and

149
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,520
allow us to add as many colors as we want and

150
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,760
make sure that when people go to switch them, they're switched and they're done.

151
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,080
I just like to know these kinds of things because I think honestly one of the great

152
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,400
things about the elementary OS experience is I love a lot of GTK applications.

153
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,360
But in the past, I've run into issues with Gnome Shell itself.

154
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,400
A lot of that's been fixed up, but elementary OS has always been there as

155
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,840
an alternative that lets you play in that user space, kind of like Budgie does, but

156
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,080
with some real nice choices you guys have made.

157
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,240
So to that end, I'm curious just to get your high level thoughts on

158
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,320
Gnome 40 adopting a horizontal layout that reminds me a lot of

159
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,120
the way Pantheon does things.

160
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,320
Yeah, I think it's really interesting.

161
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,560
I think that a lot of people have this perception that developers from different

162
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,320
desktop environments are in fierce competition and don't ever talk to each

163
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,440
other or anything like that, but it's really not true at all.

164
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,200
We were at the design sprint where they were working on the design for

165
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,440
the new login and lock screen.

166
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,880
And a lot of the discussions that we had with the Gnome design team actually

167
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,920
informed the design for our stuff.

168
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,520
So we're in contact with designers at Gnome and we go to Guadac and things like that.

169
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,720
And so there's a lot of cross-pollination of ideas, and

170
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,120
it doesn't totally surprise me that we would decide to do a lot of things very similarly.

171
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,880
Right, and I gotta say, as an end user, the experience for

172
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,360
me just means it's more consistent when I'm switching between desktop environments.

173
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,360
It's just like one less thing for me to have to do a translation in my head.

174
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,480
So it kind of works out for an end user, so I like it.

175
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,000
Well, there's a lot in here, like stuff with App Center and flat packs, but

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm curious if there's any other areas that you'd just like to particularly touch on

177
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,040
before we give people any more info on how to get involved.

178
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,880
Yeah, I think the biggest ones here are just that we were trying to roll out that

179
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,800
whole new look and feel with the new style sheet, and

180
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,520
we really need feedback from app developers to make sure we didn't break our styles.

181
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,600
So any kind of weird idiosyncrasies, we'd love to have reported there.

182
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,040
I mean, we're really just in this stage of here's all the big stuff and

183
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,160
tell us what we broke.

184
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,360
Yeah, that new installer needs some hands on.

185
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,160
That's probably a really easy way for people to give it a test.

186
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,480
I like that you have this page, so

187
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,760
I'm gonna recommend everybody that wants to help out, check it out.

188
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,440
Elementary.io slash git dash involved.

189
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,000
Every project should do this.

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,800
The team just outlays a lot of ways you can just get involved,

191
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,080
be it from funding to design to desktop and support.

192
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,960
It's super clever, and it's really well done.

193
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,880
Thanks a lot.

194
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,240
Well, Dan, thank you.

195
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,480
Thank you, and thank you guys for putting out all the good stuff.

196
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,800
And I look forward to giving it a try.

197
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,200
And then, of course, the release.

198
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,960
When that does happen, you come back and chat with us about it.

199
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,200
Yeah, absolutely.

200
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,480
I think we're probably gonna kick off another beta, hopefully relatively shortly.

201
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,920
We're getting a lot of great feedback and a lot of bug fixes in, so

202
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,400
we really wanna keep that feedback loop churning.

203
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,120
Thank you, sir.

204
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:15,800
Thanks for updating us.

205
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,440
Good to have you here.

206
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,240
Thank you.

207
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,560
Mr. Daniel Fore, everybody, from Elementary OS.

208
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,360
We will have links to everything we just chatted about in the show notes,

209
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,460
of course, so you can go right there.

210
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,040
Now, a project that we just love on this show,

211
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,680
we use it to help produce this here podcast, is Audacity.

212
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,960
And you may have heard this week that Audacity has joined the Muse Group,

213
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,520
which is a collection of brands that includes another popular open source

214
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,520
music app called MuseScore, a lot of people are familiar with that.

215
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,840
And I think that the Muse Group is, I don't know a lot about it yet, but

216
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,320
we've invited several people involved onto the show to come tell us about it.

217
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,280
And I did reach out to the Audacity development team,

218
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,960
well, at least a couple of the developers.

219
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,720
And they don't have a lot to add to this story at this moment.

220
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,360
But the way it seems to be coming through is that MuseScore will be involved with

221
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,400
the management and day-to-day operation of Audacity,

222
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,840
much like how sometimes a foundation will.

223
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,960
And then there will be a team of developers that will remain that have been

224
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,160
there for a while that will continue to develop under that umbrella now.

225
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,280
I essentially believe what's happened here is the equivalent of copyrights and

226
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,520
trademarks have been purchased and acquired and transferred to Muse Group.

227
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,520
And one of the key goals, it sounds like from the outset here,

228
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,160
is to improve the UI of Audacity, it's kind of job number one right now.

229
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,600
Which, Wes, it's like the developer that I spoke with literally said to me,

230
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm also both scared and excited.

231
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,360
Yeah, I think that's right.

232
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,160
I mean, it's really been a long journey for Audacity.

233
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,960
It began development way back in 1999, yeah, that's right,

234
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,240
last millennium at Carnegie Mellon University and has come a long way since there.

235
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,920
I mean, they just recently shipped version 3.0, which added a lot of stuff already.

236
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,520
It's not really clear exactly all what's going on here.

237
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,360
Muse Group itself was formed, just like the company,

238
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,320
was formed a few days prior to the Audacity announcement.

239
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,640
Although obviously MuseScore and

240
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,960
some of the other stuff involved had been going on a lot longer than that.

241
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,360
We don't know a lot about the financials or the exact structure, but

242
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,960
if how this works out is they've got a new steward who wants to help support

243
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,800
the development of this free and open source audio tool, I think I support that.

244
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,920
And because it is open source, I mean, if they ruin it, at least we can fork it.

245
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,040
That's true, and I'm not particularly familiar with MuseScore, but

246
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,440
from just kind of doing some research for this story, it seems to be really well

247
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,360
liked, it seems like people are very much a fan of that software and

248
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,920
have a lot of goodwill towards this acquisition because of how they have

249
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,760
managed MuseScore, hopefully that's a good sign.

250
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,240
This is one of those stories that does actually kind of terrify me just a little

251
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,480
bit because it is a tool that is so precious to so

252
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,400
many of us in any kind of media production on Linux.

253
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,000
Media production, I mean, it's used a bunch in academic research.

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,600
It's just sort of, like it happens with the best open source tools,

255
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,560
it just becomes sort of part of the landscape because it doesn't cost anything.

256
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,040
You can always count on it, it's always there for you, and

257
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,640
it would be a shame for that to change.

258
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:27,800
Yeah, I will continue to leave our doors open to anyone

259
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,120
involved that would like to come chat with us, I've sent out a couple invitations.

260
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,320
And maybe we'll do a follow up next week, kind of a head scratcher.

261
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,800
And one thing that was a little strange to me is that the announcement

262
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:47,800
started on YouTube in a YouTube video by the design lead from the Muse group.

263
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,200
Who's a well known individual, and so maybe that makes sense.

264
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,520
But it wasn't like a press release from the Audacity project or

265
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,720
like the Muse group website, if there is one.

266
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,520
And that video, I mean, it had a lot to like in the video, definitely, but

267
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,360
it was aimed at the existing audience, his audience on YouTube.

268
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,520
And so it's sort of like, hey, I'm in charge of Audacity now, isn't that?

269
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,480
Here's what I'm thinking, which is great.

270
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,800
But yeah, there hasn't been a lot of communication geared to the wider

271
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,720
open source community or users who aren't familiar with Muse group but

272
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,240
are familiar with Audacity.

273
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,920
Put very well, and we will have a link in the show notes.

274
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,360
There is now a post on the Audacity website,

275
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,200
which we will also link in the show notes.

276
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:29,760
But quite literally, all it does is it quotes the YouTube video.

277
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,560
They just put a block quote of essentially a transcript from the YouTube video.

278
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,120
And then the only thing they add to it is that we're scared and excited, and

279
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,920
they hope we are too.

280
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,600
That's the entirety of the statement from the Audacity project.

281
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,920
And I think it's one of those situations where things are still getting dialed in.

282
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,360
And whenever you have a deal like this, it involves copyright and

283
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,560
intellectual property and money.

284
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,680
That there's just certain things that people can't say right now.

285
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,720
And so this news has kind of come out before maybe everything is fully formed

286
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,120
based on my read of my conversation and this post.

287
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,360
It's like they just can't say everything fully yet.

288
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,600
But the headlines are getting written fast, so

289
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,760
that's why I wanted to contact them.

290
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,960
Because the headlines clearly say the Muse group now owns Audacity and

291
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,560
is in control of it and will be quote unquote partnering with the open source

292
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,840
developers, which is just not very clear.

293
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,680
It doesn't really say who is quite in charge then.

294
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,960
Because you can't make an open source community do anything.

295
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,840
It's like you can't, you can't herd cats.

296
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,440
It's like you can have goals and you can have outlines.

297
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,320
If you get everybody on board, they'll go for it.

298
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,120
But if you just come at them from on high with a mandate,

299
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,160
not all of them are gonna do anything.

300
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,920
They're not gonna jump necessarily.

301
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,840
Right.

302
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:52,520
How many resources will be expended by the project in terms of development time?

303
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,360
How much of that will be sort of shepherding and

304
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,200
helping out existing development, volunteer resources, or paid resources?

305
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,800
We don't know.

306
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,760
I guess we'll just have to pay some close attention to the repo and

307
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,360
see what happens.

308
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,520
Linode.com slash unplugged.

309
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,640
Go there to get a $100 60 day credit, yep, $100 towards a new account.

310
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,320
And go there to really support the show too.

311
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,920
Let us know you heard about it here.

312
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,400
Linode is our cloud hosting provider.

313
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,560
It's what we've built our new email server on.

314
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,600
It's Linode, of course.

315
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,360
It's what we do our back end processing, and hosting, and our automation system,

316
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,000
and next cloud, and object storage for config backups.

317
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,600
It's how we do a lot of the things that make it possible for

318
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,200
a small team to operate at the scale that we operate at.

319
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,000
That's why Linode is essentially like part of our team.

320
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,240
Because they're a fundamental aspect of how we get production done.

321
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,120
And unlike the big clouds, unlike big cloud, like AWS and

322
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,480
the Googs and Azure, Linode gives you access to tools they would never dream of.

323
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,240
And man, oh man, is Linode's UI infinitely simpler and

324
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,720
much more straightforward.

325
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,400
And yet somehow, you'll be amazed at the speed, performance, and

326
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,120
complexity of things you could actually build if you wanted to.

327
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,200
And you get 11 data centers to choose from.

328
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,240
Every service level is backed by the best customer support in the business.

329
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,280
And that matters, that really matters.

330
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,440
Instead of just being a number,

331
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,680
you're gonna talk to an individual by phone or ticket.

332
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,200
And it's gonna make all the difference when you're in a tough spot.

333
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,480
And it's not just like that one great thing about Linode.

334
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,280
It's like all the things about Linode that make them our go-to choice for

335
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,920
anything we're building.

336
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:41,120
It's not even really a debate, because when you become kind of a Linode connoisseur,

337
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,480
there's just things you can't do on the other providers.

338
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,240
And they really, truly love Linux.

339
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,080
I mean, you can see it in the projects they support and

340
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,040
the conferences that they've supported.

341
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,080
But when they are building anything,

342
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,720
they start from a perspective of how can we make Linux do this for us?

343
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Even if it doesn't fully do it yet.

344
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,800
I've shared the story before about when they became their own ISP.

345
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,240
And back then when they did that, it was ridiculous to be using Linux

346
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,800
at the layer that they were planning to use, at the networking layer.

347
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,160
And now it's become an entire industry.

348
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,040
Because they see this stuff like we do.

349
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:16,760
Like we're sitting here shucking and jiving about pipe wire.

350
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,080
Back in 2018, well, it's shipping in 2021.

351
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,600
Because we're passionate about this stuff.

352
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,560
We follow it for a long time, just like Linode does.

353
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,760
And that's what I love about them.

354
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,600
Because if you're a long time Linux user, that stuff shines through the product.

355
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,160
I think it's really great.

356
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,040
So go see what you can do with Linode.

357
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Go put that $100 to work for you and see what I've been talking about it.

358
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,400
linode.com slash unplugged.

359
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,040
Build something or maybe even learn something.

360
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,760
There's a lot of great places to host, I'll admit.

361
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,040
But nobody does it like Linode.

362
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,800
Go see why we choose Linode every single time.

363
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,840
linode.com slash unplugged.

364
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:59,280
You know, Mr. Payne, we have a really major, major housekeeping today.

365
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,760
I normally say we just have a spot of housekeeping.

366
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,920
But I enthusiastically embraced the housekeeping this week.

367
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,120
Well, we woke up and it was a mess in here.

368
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,800
Clearly, we didn't clean up after ourselves last week.

369
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,440
Oh, it wasn't you and me.

370
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,800
It was Minimac and that rowdy Luplug.

371
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,960
They had a hell of a get together this Sunday.

372
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,760
Minimac, do you want to give us a little update on how the Mycroft get together went?

373
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,120
Well, it went really well.

374
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,040
We had an excellent pre-talk.

375
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,920
And I want to thank all the members of the Mycroft community that found the time for

376
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,960
a really Luplug session.

377
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,200
And most of them will be present next week, too.

378
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,560
Yeah, that's the main show, right?

379
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,880
That's the big event.

380
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Indeed.

381
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,320
So in the pre-talk, we tried to nail down the structure of the talk that actually takes

382
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,680
place next week.

383
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,360
But we already had some inside information and everything was really cool.

384
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,560
And we played around with our Mycroft bot we have now in the Mumble channel.

385
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,960
And that one will be available, I guess, for the whole week.

386
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,880
So if you want to test that one, you can whenever you want.

387
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,840
Please be aware that it can be a little bit tricky with the wake word, with the HeyMycroft

388
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,840
word.

389
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,600
And maybe you have to adjust your microphone settings a little bit.

390
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,880
I have some excellent news.

391
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,320
Chris Gessling, you know, the guy from Down Under, the community manager.

392
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,120
He has announced his presence, too, for the talk.

393
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,360
So I guess we're going to have to beam him some coffee.

394
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,960
That is great.

395
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,040
So it will be an excellent talk.

396
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,240
And I really hope that you find the time to join us.

397
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,240
I will put a reminder on all the JB social media channels.

398
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,760
All I can say is see you next Sunday.

399
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,720
It's really neat to see the Mycroft team engaging.

400
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,880
There's people that showed up just for the pre-talk this Sunday.

401
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,680
So you know it's going to be a great turnout this Sunday.

402
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,200
And yeah, you heard him right.

403
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,280
They now have a Mycroft bot in the Mumble room that you can speak to via Mumble.

404
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,280
It's so cool.

405
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
It's so cool.

406
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Yeah.

407
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,760
So check it out this Sunday.

408
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,820
Also, I want to put a call out there for your questions.

409
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,640
We want to do a Q&A episode coming up later this month because I'm going to be doing some

410
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
traveling.

411
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,760
I'm going to just take that opportunity to just answer questions.

412
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,560
We haven't done that ever on the show.

413
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
So ask us anything.

414
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,440
We'll answer as many as we can.

415
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,640
Go to linuxunplug.com contact for the Q&A episode coming up real soon.

416
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,560
And also I'll mention we have a couple very limited retro last items in the garage right

417
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,400
now, including the very last few coins.

418
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,480
We still have some swag bags that honestly the swag bags are super popular.

419
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,120
Those are up right now at Jupiter garage.com.

420
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,760
It's the very last of the last coins.

421
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,880
So grab one if you would like them.

422
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,400
What's this tech talk today portable speaker?

423
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,400
I see.

424
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,160
That seems like the perfect way to listen to a Linux unplugged.

425
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,900
If you happen to have a device that still has a headphone jack, it's just a little,

426
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,520
it just runs right off the headphone jack.

427
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
I might have a battery in there.

428
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
I can't remember.

429
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
It works though.

430
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
I just plugged it in.

431
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,520
Yeah.

432
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,960
If you were a tech talk today fan, I looked at that little speaker and I thought, you

433
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,480
know, I kind of miss doing that show.

434
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,340
I don't need to do any more shows.

435
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,300
I really don't need to do any more shows, but I kind of miss it.

436
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:13,080
So that's all at Jupiter garage.com.

437
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,460
So this is the finale of our email series.

438
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,400
We today finally we'll finish it all up.

439
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:23,720
We've been building our own self hosted email server in 2021.

440
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,920
Yeah, I know.

441
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,040
I know we're doing it because everybody says you should never host your own email server.

442
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,240
So we're going to do it so you don't have to spite email server.

443
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,800
It's definitely the best possible reason.

444
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,800
It is totally a spied email, you know, and we have two important tasks to complete today.

445
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,360
We must deploy the web mail.

446
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,920
And of course, we must get our first production user online.

447
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,680
But I have to first acknowledge that we have gotten a lot of feedback about this topic.

448
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,940
Wow.

449
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,880
We weren't even sure if you guys would love this idea or not.

450
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,960
But it turns out a lot of you crazy bastards out there are also hosting your own email.

451
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,260
But additionally, a lot of people are thinking about it for some reason.

452
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,740
Maybe it's Google fatigue, or it's probably a dozen reasons.

453
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,520
But this is this has been remarkable.

454
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,480
I spent oh, I don't know.

455
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:20,020
Three hours yesterday, just reading email about self hosted email hosting.

456
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:26,120
So I kept sending West messages like I'm I've made it back to this date.

457
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,400
I've made it this far.

458
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,880
I was given like real time messages.

459
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,560
It was a mountain of feedback.

460
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Yeah, wow.

461
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,560
I did not expect that.

462
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,640
I mean, a few sure.

463
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,840
But apparently email is a spicy topic.

464
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Yeah.

465
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,360
And Hank wrote in with a with a pretty good question that I think we should cover on the

466
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
show.

467
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
So I wanted to respond to this one on air.

468
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,000
He says, What's your plan to keep your email servers secure?

469
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,920
You tout the fact that your update woes are minimized.

470
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,760
I think you've just shifted the need to update the OS though to needing to update the containers.

471
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,000
In this regard, I just prefer to keep things within the packaging system on Debian and

472
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
its derivatives.

473
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,440
I install unattended upgrades package which defaults to install security updates daily.

474
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,720
Security updates are tested and very unlikely to break anything.

475
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,960
I suppose the same is true for a containerized email server.

476
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,560
But I'm unaware of any automated security updates.

477
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,960
By the way, unattended upgrades is a good little pro tip on you Debian users out there

478
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,660
and derivatives.

479
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,360
If that's something you might be able to get away with on your box.

480
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,680
But he makes a good point West because I think we kind of maybe tried to connect security

481
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,880
with containerized application.

482
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,200
And that is something we should never do on this show.

483
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Yeah, right.

484
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,760
I mean, of course, you still need to do updates if there's a vulnerability or a bug that needs

485
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
attention.

486
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,680
Well, you got to get those somehow.

487
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,440
Containers do give us some nice tools for sort of separating those concerns.

488
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,280
It allows us to sort of choose when we want our updates in our containers versus on our

489
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
host system.

490
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,840
And so if we did want, you know, automated updates on the host system, we certainly could,

491
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,840
although we still need to attend to what's going on in the container.

492
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,920
What's nice about having this all in Docker and open source is we have access to everything.

493
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,260
So if we want to rebuild things, if we want to make tweaks, we have that functionality.

494
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,520
And we try to choose projects that have regular updates to the end releases to their images

495
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
anyway.

496
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,200
Beyond that, there are some nice tools around there as well.

497
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,200
If you do want to set up something like an automatic update, but you will have to do

498
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
that yourself.

499
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
True.

500
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,880
Real time update from Neil in the chat room.

501
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:31,240
He says that if you're on Fedora, a DNF-Automatic will achieve the same result as unattended

502
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
dash upgrades.

503
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Nice tip.

504
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Yeah.

505
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Thanks, Neil.

506
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah, I think the message I was trying to make last episode is that when I looked at

507
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
say Mail-in-a-Box, which I still think is an awesome project, and if you're good with

508
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,600
the traditional way of deploying software where it just uses packages and it just kind

509
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,840
of goes all over your system, that's a great option.

510
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,040
I was surprised by my reaction, guys.

511
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:55,800
And I think the thing I want you to take away is when I used Mail-in-a-Box and I watched

512
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,480
that install script run, instead of having this sensation of, oh, man, it's so great,

513
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,800
this is just taking care of everything for me, I had this sinking concern that I had

514
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,980
no idea what was really happening to my system.

515
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:17,000
And I just watched package after package after config file after config file get written

516
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
to the hard drive.

517
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,800
And I started thinking, this is fundamentally altering this box in a way that I don't know

518
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,740
if I'm going to feel confident in just upgrading when there's a new update that comes out.

519
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,940
It also gets more complicated when, you know, like we were doing for today's show, start

520
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,040
hacking in things like web mail, and suddenly you've got multiple conflicting things installed.

521
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
And maybe you don't do that.

522
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,180
Maybe you've got, you know, a VPS or a VM for everything.

523
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,840
But I think it's pretty common to just sort of add those things on when it's convenient.

524
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,800
And then you've got mixed requirements that maybe one update needs an update, but that

525
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,440
might break another part of the system.

526
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,560
I mean, there's several advantages, right, Byte?

527
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:55,000
Yeah, so when you restart a system because of an update, usually you get a message like

528
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,800
a restart is necessary, then your entire system is down for a long time.

529
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,760
But if you use containers, a container is usually really fastly rebooted.

530
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,880
And if it's only by the service itself, yeah, it's really fast.

531
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,280
Yeah, I think that when you look at running your core applications that you want to run

532
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:21,260
for, you know, five years minimum, and you want to maybe even survive an entire OS upgrade,

533
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,500
having that isolation is such a killer feature for me.

534
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:32,000
Other things like snapshots, or easily quickly rebooting, or switching to a different image

535
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,760
or something like those, there's a lot of nice advantages.

536
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
Migrating to a new host server.

537
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
Right, oh my gosh, yes.

538
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,640
That's been very handy for us.

539
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,160
We did a migration from DigitalOcean to Linode, and it was absolutely much simpler by having

540
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,680
a lot of our applications, nearly all of our applications containerized.

541
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,680
It made it just significantly simpler.

542
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,840
And so mobility and maintainability of the host OS are paramount for me.

543
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,440
And then there was other benefits, like instead of going with Ubuntu 18.04, I could now deploy

544
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:04,720
CentOS Stream 8, which is something I've wanted to test in production so I could just talk

545
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
about on the show anyways.

546
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,120
I mean, Hank does have a good point though, right, that you don't get the security for

547
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,320
free, and it's still definitely something you have to manage, and that may influence

548
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,920
how you want to run your software.

549
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,440
So Neil, I'm curious what your thoughts are, because I know one of the things that's

550
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,360
drive you crazy in the past is when people equate running applications in a container

551
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,520
to being secure, but there's probably still some use cases here that you probably agree

552
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
with.

553
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,560
Yeah, so like for me, it isn't necessarily about security to choose to use containers

554
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,080
over something else, although security can be beneficial.

555
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:41,360
The main aspects I wind up using it for is I actually kind of use it a little differently

556
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
than most people.

557
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:46,200
I use it mainly to replace virtual machines.

558
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,680
So unlike a lot of folks, I actually have an init.

559
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,880
I have systemd init running in my containers.

560
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,080
I'm using systemd nspawn instead of Podman for some of my stuff, because a lot of my

561
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,380
stuff are multi-service stuff, and it's just not worth it for me to do the extreme splitting

562
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,380
required to do it in something like Podman or whatnot.

563
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,080
So I run them as nspawn containers, which means they boot up like they would VMs.

564
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,200
And because I'm using Butterfests in my file system, they're snapshot and I can actually

565
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,320
do Butterfests and receive to transfer them everywhere.

566
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,520
And I also, because of Butterfest's coolness, I actually just layer them on top of the host

567
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,760
operating system root file system.

568
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:32,120
So I take the host operating system, make a snapshot, use that as the base to instantiate

569
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,020
a container and do clever rebase things.

570
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,180
So for me, what the advantage of containers is, these different things are still running

571
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:43,580
on the same system I would normally run it on, like if they were all in one box, but

572
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,700
I have the ability to orchestrate them independently.

573
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,320
If they need to have conflicting requirements, they're easily handled.

574
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:58,460
Like if I have to have CentOS for an environment and use different module streams, like being

575
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:03,160
able to use the different application stream from RHEL or modules from CentOS and activate

576
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,400
them for the language stacks and whatnot, I can still use packaging.

577
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,720
I can still use all the tools that I'm familiar with.

578
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,460
I can still manage it with config management or Ansible or whatever I'd like.

579
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,460
But because most of my applications don't need a different kernel and don't need emulated

580
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:22,860
hardware for all of them, I can drastically simplify the maintenance and management of

581
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,860
my systems.

582
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:29,160
And the big win for me there is when I sometimes get trapped into running an application that

583
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,240
can't necessarily upgrade right away, the operating system can move forward and most

584
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,520
of my things can move forward and that one thing can stay back a little bit until either

585
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,760
I figure out a way to upgrade it or I replace it with something else.

586
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,500
I don't use it as a way to hold back.

587
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:51,160
I use it as a way to be more strategic about how I spend my time managing my infrastructure.

588
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,160
Well put.

589
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,160
And two thoughts.

590
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:57,200
First thought is, and this is why, why we covered all this is a huge part of security

591
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,580
is staying current, especially with software that has open ports to the internet.

592
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,720
We've locked ours down and can because we have mail route in front of it, but we could

593
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
lock it down further, obviously.

594
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,320
I mean, there's all options we have there, but some software like SSH and web servers,

595
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,440
they're always going to be exposed directly to the internet.

596
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,480
So keeping them current is a huge, huge part of security.

597
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,780
But if you, if you listen to what Neil said in there too, is you'll also essentially hear

598
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:27,000
the reason why developers that want a modern workstation need a more modern file system

599
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,540
than extended for.

600
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:35,060
He just clearly laid out how he can use ButterFS as part of his development workflow to give

601
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,640
him different environments that are safe and disposable and do it in a very clever way.

602
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,120
And that's why you need something beyond what just extended for can do.

603
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,260
Even if you or I maybe only use it for compression or something like that, he or other developers

604
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:53,600
like him can use it for a lot of crazy features, including just making their day to day job

605
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
simpler.

606
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,140
And that's why it's important that we ship really competitive file systems with desktop

607
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,960
Linux distributions that want to be used as a workstation.

608
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,620
Just my little side note, and thankfully most Linux distributions will let you format any

609
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,000
disk and just about any file system you want.

610
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,720
All right, so we had to decide essentially between two webmail packages as we saw it.

611
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,980
There's a lot out there.

612
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:20,500
And one of the kind of nice things about doing it in these three part stages that we've done

613
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,160
here on the show is in between the audience has had time to give us a lot of good ideas.

614
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:29,260
And we definitely got two suggestions the most via all the different mechanisms people

615
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,260
get a hold of us.

616
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,660
And that was RainLoop and RoundCube.

617
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,160
And I was a little hesitant to RoundCube just because I had used it before and kind of wanted

618
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,840
to try something new.

619
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,280
So we first took a look at RainLoop.

620
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,340
Yeah, you know, we heard a lot of good stuff about RainLoop and I'd never used it either.

621
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,740
So I was pretty curious where I think I'd used RoundCube.

622
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:51,480
I didn't run it myself, but it was used by someone else that was hosting email for me

623
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,740
and that had been fine.

624
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:57,520
But it's funny, we were just talking about, you know, how containers are kind of an integral

625
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,660
part of this setup.

626
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:04,320
And that's where things, at first we were hopeful, but kind of fell down in our trials

627
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,560
with RainLoop.

628
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,340
There is a Docker Compose and some Docker setup in their repository, but they don't

629
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:15,220
have a lot of docs around it, at least that I could find in my cursory survey.

630
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,800
And it just didn't seem as set up for that.

631
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,280
The docs on their main site really were geared around more of a legacy installation setup

632
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,640
where you've already got like web server infrastructure running and you kind of just bootstrap this

633
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,680
PHP app onto there.

634
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,320
By comparison, RoundCube has a lot of nice docs there, their site seems really well developed.

635
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,180
Seems like they've got a community around them and they've got this whole plethora of

636
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,740
Docker Compose support, multiple Docker Compose files and very explicit examples of sort of

637
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:45,740
like, well, here's three different options.

638
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,820
If you want to go the Apache route or the NGINX FPM route and here's an option with

639
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,200
Postgres or here's an option with MySQL.

640
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,860
So it just felt like here's a project that's embracing this as an option for running the

641
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,120
software that they make.

642
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,420
And that was a pretty big signal.

643
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:05,240
And simplicity in setup is also appealing here because it's not going to be our primary

644
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,000
job to admin this.

645
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,320
And it's kind of a jackass move even to put a mail server in production and then give

646
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,840
it the amount of attention that we're going to give it.

647
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:18,800
So we want to build it in a way that when future Wes and Chris come back to this thing,

648
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,880
we know how to fix it or how we built it or how we could even rebuild it.

649
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:27,720
And when we looked at RainLoop versus RoundCube, it honestly kind of just came down to RoundCube

650
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,400
was a little simpler, had a little bit clearer documentation and just was a little bit easier

651
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,240
for us to snap into the old configuration and setup that we had.

652
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,680
Now, I still would like to do some some playing with RainLoop and there might be some things

653
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,440
I've missed or if the audience has a as a compose file handy that they want to share

654
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
with us, that'd be great, too.

655
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,440
I would totally try it.

656
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,280
And I think it's still something I want to try.

657
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,500
It was just to get this, you know, accomplish our tasks, start playing with web mail, see

658
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,720
how to integrate RoundCube was really the simpler and easier option.

659
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,720
And I mean, it is pretty neat, like it's not a bad experience.

660
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,860
We'll get more into that.

661
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:04,560
And they've been around for 13 years, like since 2008.

662
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,640
That's also pretty impressive.

663
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,840
And it seems actively developed today.

664
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:13,480
A former past version of Chris definitely deployed RoundCube and liked it back then.

665
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,360
But you know, we could sit here and tell you about it.

666
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,240
But maybe we should put it to the test.

667
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,440
All right, Mini Mac, get your telegram ready.

668
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
This is it.

669
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,560
I am ready.

670
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,040
So Mini Mac will be our first production user.

671
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,920
We want this to be a tool for members of our community.

672
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,760
And we thought let's put it to the test right here.

673
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,840
So I just sent you on telegram the URL for the web mail, your credentials.

674
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:42,280
If you could log in, first of all, tell us if it works, if it loads for you and if you

675
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,280
can send off an email.

676
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,560
Now, you should use your full email as the sort of username.

677
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,560
Login.

678
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,560
Yeah.

679
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
What do you think, Wes?

680
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
Are you nervous?

681
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Fingers crossed.

682
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
I should be looking at the logs, shouldn't I?

683
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,240
I'm a little nervous, actually, because, you know, we really did not test this beforehand.

684
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,920
I mean, we tested it, but it's a whole different ballgame.

685
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Okay.

686
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
First success.

687
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,920
I mean.

688
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,920
Good.

689
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,920
Good.

690
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
Good.

691
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,920
That's a good sign.

692
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,920
Okay.

693
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,720
Now, do you want to send me an address where I should my first famous first words sent

694
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
to?

695
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Oh, yeah.

696
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
Email me.

697
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Chris at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

698
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
He gets a lot of email.

699
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
He probably won't reply.

700
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,720
Don't be offended.

701
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,960
Wes suggested that I should send you a welcome email, but I wanted you to send the first

702
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,160
email.

703
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,400
I think this is a good test because Gmail is really picky about who it actually accepts

704
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,800
email from.

705
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,440
So if it's going to reject your email, it's going to be Gmail.

706
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,560
My heart rate is pounding, actually.

707
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
My heart is going.

708
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:41,760
I suppose the question is, does Minimax sound like a scammer in his event?

709
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,160
He does have some products to sell you, but that's just, you know, that's that's a coincidence.

710
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,160
Okay.

711
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
Email is out.

712
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,160
Oh, boy.

713
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
Let's verify and sent.

714
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
Yeah.

715
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,880
Okay, I don't see it yet.

716
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Come on.

717
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Wes, you see?

718
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Dad, you have the logs up?

719
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Oh, no.

720
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
Here, let me check.

721
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,880
Wait.

722
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Hold on a second.

723
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:02,880
Hold on a second.

724
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,880
Oh, there it is.

725
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
What?

726
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
Yeah, you got it.

727
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
It works.

728
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,880
Congratulations, Wes.

729
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,880
Yeah.

730
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,880
We got it.

731
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,880
See titles, famous first words.

732
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,880
All right.

733
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
I'm going to write back.

734
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
Yeah, I'm going to write back.

735
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
Just very simply.

736
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,880
It worked.

737
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
And I'm going to tell me if you got that.

738
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
I mean, I'm very happy.

739
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,680
I suppose we should check it round round trip.

740
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,840
But did you get the reply?

741
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Not yet.

742
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
Oh, my God.

743
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,240
I hate email.

744
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,080
Just the other week, you were talking about how it's a cool federated system.

745
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,560
And now, here you are.

746
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
I know.

747
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
It should see it.

748
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
It should come right in.

749
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
Success.

750
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,160
Re from Chris Fisher, famous first words.

751
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,920
Excellent.

752
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:50,440
And the content is, in fact, it worked.

753
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,440
Nicely done, Wes.

754
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
Nicely done, Minimac.

755
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,720
I mean, I'm honestly, I'm still surprised, but it just doesn't seem like we did it so

756
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:01,160
hastily and we really didn't know what we were doing.

757
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,600
But thankfully, the tools that we have access to right now are good enough that it kind

758
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,520
of takes care of that for us.

759
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,760
I mean, not to do a shameless plug, but it is legitimately why Alex and I started the

760
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,800
self-hosted podcast, because these tools, the stuff that you can run yourself now, it's

761
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,280
at a level way beyond anything we dreamed when we first started doing these shows.

762
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,200
And I am so grateful for the open source projects that make all of that possible.

763
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,160
And so our plan there is we're just going to slowly roll that out a little bit to certain

764
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,480
people just over time as we just kind of expand it.

765
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,760
And then maybe eventually, I don't know, we might go further from there.

766
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,120
I don't know what we're going to do exactly.

767
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:40,640
We just want to try to get a few people on there to make sure everything's working.

768
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,520
Because you know, even though we're crazy, we want to be cautious.

769
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,360
And then we'll probably just kind of ramp it up over time.

770
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:48,160
So I guess more on that when we do a future email server update.

771
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,000
And that essentially right there completes the email server series.

772
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,680
And Wes Payne was a hero and a legend in this one, because we put a lot of work, specifically

773
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,560
Wes did, into Rain Loop.

774
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,400
And we thought we were going to go with that all the way until just really last night,

775
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,520
maybe this morning.

776
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,520
And then at the last minute, we said, now let's do round cube instead.

777
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,840
And Wes got it all set up and running just a little bit before the show, like a real

778
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
legend.

779
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,240
So let's pause everybody to Wes Payne for getting that done.

780
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,640
Good job, Wes.

781
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,560
Now you'll just have to wait and see how it lasts, right?

782
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,560
Can we maintain it?

783
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,560
How does it do?

784
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,720
Do we keep using it?

785
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:31,360
Stay tuned to Linux Unplugged for more.

786
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,160
Mailroute.net slash Linux.

00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:37,240
Try out Mailroute today and get 10% off the lifetime of your account and get a 30 day

free trial, no credit card required.

789
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,840
Mailroute is how we are routing mail through to our mail server.

790
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,960
So yeah, during the live show, we went through Mailroute.

791
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,680
It happened so dang fast.

792
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:55,000
And if you have a business where even just a handful of people, you know how critical

793
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
email is.

794
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,880
And you know how bad threats like ransomware are getting more and more.

795
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,880
And admins are looking for ways to manage that risk.

796
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,980
And Mailroute is a fantastic way to do that.

797
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:10,480
For 24 years, they have focused on that core competency, just providing cutting edge email

798
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
security.

799
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,320
And I absolutely loved the tools as an admin while we were setting up our email server

800
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,840
the first time around.

801
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:21,800
I logged in and looked at their real time logs and saw the emails coming and going and

802
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,680
knew that, hey, we'd gotten some stuff set up.

803
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,960
So I was pretty confident it was going to work.

804
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,960
You know, it gave me a pretty good snapshot and I really liked that tool, especially when

805
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,960
I'm setting things up.

806
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,800
But another thing that I know I'm going to take advantage of at some point, and I would

807
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,480
really, I would really recommend you consider this as well, is you can use Mailroute to

808
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,240
queue up messages for up to like 15 days or like whatever you set it to.

809
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,800
So that way you have time for maintenance or if you have an outage or an internet outage

810
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,680
of some kind, Mailroute will make sure you don't lose your email.

811
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,480
And then when your system comes back online, it just forwards it right to your mail server

812
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,420
like it was never down really.

813
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,120
That's just such a nice piece of mind.

814
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,440
Additionally, if you work in government and compliance is an issue for you, Mailroute

815
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,760
has some of the most important compliances that you could have in that business.

816
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,320
So you can feel safe using Mailroute.

817
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,840
Of course, they have a lot of information on their website.

818
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:17,540
So go try Mailroute out today and get 10% off the lifetime, lifetime of your account.

819
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,960
How great is that that they're doing that for us and for you guys too?

Visit mailroute.net slash Linux.

822
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,220
This is an example of one of those great partnerships where we contacted Mailroute because we were

823
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,640
absolutely going to be using Mailroute and we just said, we think you'd be a great fit.

824
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,400
We're doing this mail series where we'd love to have you on board.

825
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,000
Mailroute said, all right, let's do it and they did it for two episodes and now they're

826
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,780
back because they got a lot of great feedback from you guys.

827
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:50,220
We had a bunch of you try it out and really like it and so they thought, let's stick around

828
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,220
for a little bit longer.

829
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,040
So they're here for a little bit longer and I'd love for you to go try them out because

830
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,740
I think they could provide a real service regardless of the scale of your institution.

831
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:02,560
But this could offer a lot of benefit if you're a large institution or a small business.

832
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,640
But if you're just a self-hoster and you want the peace of mind, you don't want to worry

833
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,000
about the crap and you don't want to worry about the downtime, Mailroute's going to solve

834
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
that for you.

835
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,640
And they've been solving it for 24 years.

836
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,400
So go to mailroute.net slash Linux, get 10% off the lifetime of your account, support

837
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,040
the show and start a free 30-day trial with no credit card required.

838
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,840
Mailroute.net slash Linux.

839
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:32,960
Well speaking of email, it's time to check our mailbag and we've got an email from Murray

840
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,920
wanting to know more about Pipewire.

841
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,120
Hi, you guys asked what specific things from Fedora 34 listeners would like you to cover.

842
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:48,320
I know you choked about Pipewire being too niche, but as a musician and podcaster transitioning

843
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:55,560
off macOS and onto Linux full time, I would love to hear more about it.

844
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:02,440
Audio has been the single biggest pain point in my move since it works dramatically differently

845
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:03,440
than in macOS.

846
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,160
I only learned about Pipewire shortly before listening to the episode and it sounds super

847
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,440
cool.

848
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,320
Please do share more of your thoughts on it.

849
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,880
Best, Murray.

850
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:19,280
Murray, you are coming in at such a great time into Linux media production.

851
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:26,680
Oh, how do, how I could just picture that the future for you is going to be so bright

852
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,360
because Linux has really gotten to a good point.

853
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,800
I kind of seem to kind of get the impression that you're focused more on the audio end

854
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,800
of stuff.

855
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,800
Pipewire does manage video.

856
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:43,000
In fact, it started to manage video, but it has really, really gotten to the point where

857
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,800
you can produce media on Linux all day long and it's fantastic.

858
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,560
We do things that I simply could never leave Linux.

859
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,200
We just had a hypothetical like back and forth this other Sunday when we were recording land,

860
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,520
like how would we even recreate what we do now on other platforms?

861
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,240
It's just, it's remarkable what we get out of one computer running Linux because of jack

862
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:11,620
audio and Pipewire takes everything I love about the current state of Linux audio and

863
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:14,680
makes it easier and remains compatible with it.

864
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,640
And that's why it's going to be kind of a big deal as it rolls out.

865
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:25,200
It started as really a way to just focus on getting video in and out of the Linux desktop,

866
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,760
particularly like in a Wayland future.

867
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,360
But it's really grown into a low latency audio and video system for playback and capture.

868
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:35,440
Yeah, you know, we did some chatting with the developers and they kind of emphasize

869
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,240
that that once you've got this sort of graph node processing to handle, you know, little

870
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:46,680
bits of either video or audio, it's kind of the same and why not unify that in one tool?

871
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,200
You can think about this too, in terms of development, you can think of Pipewire as

872
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,880
a server and a user space API to deal with multimedia pipelines on the desktop like mixing

873
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:02,160
available sources of video and accessing sources of audio and bringing those all together.

874
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,480
And there is an API the developers can write to as well as they can just continue to use

875
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,760
pulse audio or jack audio, if that's what their application is designed for, because

876
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,120
Pipewire speaks that as well.

877
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,120
That's huge.

878
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,120
Right.

879
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,760
So you get the like legacy support, but you also have a new Pipewire native API if you

880
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,160
want to be future forward, right with that more efficient lower latency Pipewire backend

881
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,600
server managing it all now.

882
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,760
So really, depending on your distribution, things are going to pretty much work just

883
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,000
as normal, you won't even really know anything has changed.

884
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,040
And it really has been, for me, at least a very smooth transition.

885
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,720
It's been a very positive transition, unlike maybe a decade ago where it would have been

886
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,120
a little or decade plus would have been a little bump here.

887
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,160
Yeah, it should all just work.

888
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,420
But one of the neat things about Pipewire supporting all of these options at the same

889
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:53,400
time is in the audio world, it unifies them.

890
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,980
Before you had a lot of neat stuff you could do with jack.

891
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,040
And then of course, there was the pulse world, which is growing more and more functionality

892
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,080
with things like pulse effects.

893
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,120
And you can do a lot of clever stuff with pulse, but it was never really designed for

894
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,000
that pro audio, low latency sort of workload.

895
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,840
And that just meant you had two or three different Linux audio worlds that didn't always play

896
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,560
nicely together, or you had to, you know, really know what you're doing to link them

897
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,560
up correctly.

898
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,480
But in Pipewire, that just works.

899
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,160
Or maybe another way to put it is stack them on top of each other, right?

900
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:25,480
You would have you would have sound system stacked on top of sound systems.

901
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,340
Yeah, really, as much fun as that sounds like.

902
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:32,920
And so I think, you know, for Murray's case, things should just work, you can just get

903
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,920
started.

904
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,640
But when you're ready, you can start playing with some of these tools that are designed

905
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,880
around jack workflows, things like like Katia or Carla.

906
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,780
And then you can start doing some of that fancy orchestrating of moving inputs wherever

907
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,680
you need doing loop backs, monitoring input on the system, all that fun kind of pro audio

908
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,000
stuff that you might have been using a special Mac app for.

909
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,100
Yeah, put really simply, if you're recording a podcast, and you want to record a guest,

910
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:02,620
and you want to do it all on maybe one laptop, or one computer, how do you capture that application

911
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:08,480
audio and bring it into your recorder to record it, you need tools that can link that all

912
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,480
together.

913
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:13,760
And that's what Pipewire will enable in a way that we've had before, but was not in

914
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,200
a unified framework for exchanging all of this.

915
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,800
And none of the previous solutions that we've talked about were really built with our way

916
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:27,160
land future in mind and the security requirements that come with that, like having applications

917
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:32,200
sandboxed in flat packs that need ways that are standardized and API's to communicate

918
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,200
with each other.

919
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,120
And Pipewire aims to solve all of those problems to outside of just the multimedia improvements

920
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:43,200
we've talked about, it's really going to be a unified framework for both consumers that

921
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:46,960
won't even know they're using Pipewire quite legitimately won't even know.

922
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,280
And pros like us who are going to rant and rave about it for years now because this is

923
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,560
over time and even already beginning to solve pain points that we have struggled with for

924
00:47:57,560 --> 00:48:04,520
13 years, legitimately, legitimately, probably maybe even longer, maybe 15 years.

925
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,000
And so it's really exciting for us as content creators who've been using this platform for

926
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,900
a very long time to see something that really truly feels competitive with what you see

927
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:15,900
on the Mac side.

928
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:20,120
Well, we're clearly very excited about Pipewire the future, especially now that it's deployed

929
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,120
in Fedora 34.

930
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,180
But it's also a project we've been following for a long time here on the show.

931
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,180
So if you want some background and to get an idea of how far things have come, maybe

932
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:35,920
check out Linux Unplugged 272 way back when October 2018 when we sat down with lead Pipewire

933
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,840
developer Wim Taymans who told us what he was aiming to do.

934
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,320
And just a couple of picks before we get out of here.

935
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:47,920
This week, we wanted to share a Pastebin alternative.

936
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,920
There's a lot out there.

937
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,560
So we'd love your feedback too for ones that you love that are simple and self-hostable.

938
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:59,160
But our beloved Slexi.org, which we have used as a J.B. team for years to past Pastebins

939
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,720
back and forth or when you hear us read an email on the show that we've linked in our

940
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,280
show notes, we put it in Slexi.org and they are shutting down as all hosted services that

941
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,040
Giveth eventually Taketh.

942
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,560
Just when you really depend on them and don't think they'll go anywhere.

943
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:14,560
I really hadn't.

944
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,200
I just started thinking, huh, I guess they are sticking around.

945
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,680
So this week, Wes found us a markdown loving Pastebin service.

946
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,560
Although really, I should give credit to Gamma over in our matrix chat, the J.B. matrix who

947
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,560
posted this.

948
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,900
And I just thought, boy, that seems perfect for our needs.

949
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,900
Thank you, Gamma.

950
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:33,900
I didn't know that.

951
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,900
Look at you.

952
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,900
Good guy, Wes.

953
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:36,900
Giving him credit.

954
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,900
All right.

955
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:38,900
Now, I'm trying to get you to say the name, though, because I'm avoiding the name.

956
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:41,960
I'm going to say rentree, rentree.org.

957
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,520
For our entry, I don't know if that's better.

958
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,520
Yeah.

959
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,720
And rentree.co, too, works maybe?

960
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,720
I'm not sure.

961
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,720
But it's called rentree.

962
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,480
And it's a markdown lightweight Pastebin that is really clean.

963
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:58,240
And you can combine images, inline links, code snippets, all the markdown stuff.

964
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,800
And we put a link to that in the show notes.

965
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,860
And then this is also, at the same time, the show saying to you, hey, we know of a handful

966
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,860
of these.

967
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:10,360
And we've debated which one we want to use, which one we want to self-host.

968
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,600
But we'd like to point to this link and say, hey, do you know of anything that's kind of

969
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:14,600
clean like this?

970
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:20,320
Because what we need is just a nice, clear reading experience with not a lot of junk

971
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,960
because we're reading it live on air.

972
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,820
And we don't want like sidebar stuff or big, huge, fat header bars and stuff like that.

973
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,040
We just want something nice and clean.

974
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,840
And if you know of a Pastebin alternative that's open source and self-hostable, please

975
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,960
let us know at linuxunplug.com slash contact.

976
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:40,040
Because we'd like to try one out and then standardize one for the network.

977
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,400
Like we kind of have with HedgeDock.

978
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,400
And then we have one last extra pick for you this week.

979
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,840
And it's a special one, Wes, do you happen to know why?

980
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:55,080
Something tells me it must be written in Rust.

981
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:00,720
That's right.

982
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:01,720
Feels good.

983
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,320
It's been too long since we've had a Rust pick.

984
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:08,740
And this one is the kind of pick you were never asking for, a replacement for PS written

985
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,520
in Rust called Prox.

986
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:15,840
But hear me out, it actually has a pretty great output.

987
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,640
They call it a human readable format that is colored with automatic theme detection

988
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:26,120
based on your terminal background, keyword search over a multi-column UI, and then additional

989
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:32,920
information that your boy PS doesn't have like TCP UDP port usage, read write throughput,

990
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,240
the Docker container name that that process might be running under, and more memory information

991
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,480
which is nice in the era of system DOOMD.

992
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,880
Oh, you know, this tree view is pretty sweet too.

993
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:48,880
Yeah, it really does actually look good enough that I'm I think I'm legitimately switching

994
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,880
to this.

995
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:54,340
I initially picked this as an ironic pick because who needs another PS?

996
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,700
That's ridiculous.

997
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:58,200
And then I installed it and I absolutely love it.

998
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,240
It's even great on our server.

999
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,320
I love the Docker support and that is really handy.

1000
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,880
Whoa, and there's experimental support on both Mac and Windows.

1001
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:07,880
Look at them.

1002
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:08,880
Everybody gets to play.

1003
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,560
Oh, I didn't even I didn't even really think about the fact that there's Rust apps on the

1004
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,560
Mac.

1005
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,560
Of course there are.

1006
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,500
I knew Microsoft was hot to trot with Rust, but I'm sure Apple's been super helpful getting

1007
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,280
Rust working on Mac OS.

1008
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,560
And Chris, you'll never guess, it's already packaged in Arch.

1009
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,560
Oh, of course.

1010
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:26,560
Yeah, absolutely.

1011
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,560
I knew that.

1012
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:28,560
You know, I knew that.

1013
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:29,560
Anyways, go check it out.

1014
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,600
It's a really nice, really clean, really elegant way to list all of the processes and the resources

1015
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:35,820
they're using and all of that.

1016
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:40,840
It's called Prox, P-R-O-C-S, and yeah, it's up on GitHub, so it's probably just easier

1017
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:46,120
to get the link in the show notes, if I'm being honest with you.

1018
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,840
Thank you very much to our Unplugged Core contributors at unpluggedcore.com for like

1019
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,280
a few more hours.

1020
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:57,640
The secret promo that I gave out will be valid and then I'm going to remove that product

1021
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:58,640
from the garage.

1022
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:04,160
So if you haven't taken advantage of it yet, you got hours, you got hours left.

1023
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,280
But you know, there's other things we do to thank our members.

1024
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:09,760
We also make a couple of feeds available to them, a completely unedited raw version where

1025
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:15,900
you hear us screw up and lots of probably, I would say, two solid pre-shows easily, maybe

1026
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,600
three pre-shows that we just totally blew and did not record except for our members.

1027
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,760
That's in the feed this week too.

1028
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,280
And then also you can get just a limited ad feed if you prefer.

1029
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:28,680
It's a little tighter version of the show, same full production, all of that stuff.

1030
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:32,740
Those are two different feeds we make available to those of you who help make the show sustainable

1031
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,340
at unpluggedcore.com.

1032
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,240
And thank you everybody who does support the show there.

1033
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:44,200
Be sure to go check out jupytergarage.com too for some of that limited time last merch.

1034
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,680
And those coins are almost gone at jupytergarage.com.

1035
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,720
If you do the Twitter thing, you can follow the show at linuxunplugged.

1036
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:57,480
The website's linuxunplugged.com, but we do have a Twitter handle, which, you know, you

1037
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,760
can follow.

1038
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,760
You can follow.

1039
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,120
I follow the network.

1040
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,920
I'll just follow the whole network at Jupiter Signal.

1041
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,200
I'd probably follow Wes.

1042
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:07,080
Wes, tweet a picture of some dogs sometime.

1043
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:12,120
Maybe you have, but you know like that epic superhero like A-Team shot you took of the

1044
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,320
pups the other morning?

1045
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,200
That would make, that's some serious Twitter material right there.

1046
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,200
Cute dogs.

1047
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,200
Who can say no?

1048
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,200
All right, I'm on it.

1049
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,200
I can't say no.

1050
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,200
I can't say no.

1051
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,200
So go find him.

1052
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,200
He's at Wes Payne on the Twitter.

1053
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,200
I'm at Chris LAS.

1054
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:27,640
The entire network and all of our fantastic podcasts, like the self-hosted podcast and

1055
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:33,440
Linux Action News, and the Coda Radio program, are all over at JupiterBroadcasting.com.

1056
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,880
And we'd love to have you join the show live.

1057
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,880
See you next week.

1058
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:39,320
Same bad time, same bad station.

1059
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,820
Just get your Linux on every Tuesday.

1060
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,820
Get all Linux-y.

1061
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:47,800
And join us live at 12 p.m. Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1062
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,160
I'm not exactly sure what it means to get all Linux-y.

1063
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:54,140
Probably means like boot up a Linux box and join the live stream.

1064
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,140
That's probably what it means.

1065
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,160
The only way to find out is join us live next week while we get Linux-y, right?

1066
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,160
Yeah.

1067
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,160
Maybe bring a towel, though.

1068
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,160
Yeah.

1069
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,160
That's not a bad idea and a beverage.

1070
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,120
And you can absolutely join us in our mumble room.

1071
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,480
Info for that is at LinuxUnplugged.com slash mumble.

1072
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,480
That's the way.

1073
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,480
You get the idea.

1074
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,480
You get the idea.

1075
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,480
We have a website.

1076
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,480
Aren't you proud of us?

1077
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:15,480
And we put links of relevant information on there that you're probably wondering.

1078
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,120
It's a good idea.

1079
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:31,360
See you next Tuesday.

1080
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:55,160
Alright, JBtitles.com.

1081
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,600
Let's go name this thing.

1082
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,560
Do we miss anybody or anything in the show that we wanted to catch up on the post show

1083
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,040
before we head out of here?

1084
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:06,960
Well, Neil let us know that our pick is also packaged in Fedora.

1085
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,160
So you know, all those folks we convinced to try Fedora 34 don't have to miss out.

1086
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:12,160
Nope.

1087
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,160
Absolutely.

1088
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,160
Absolutely.

1089
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:15,160
I don't know.

1090
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,720
I've kind of played with the whole episode 404 thing with KOTORadio.

1091
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:21,600
So I feel like it's kind of silly if we go all in.

1092
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:26,100
But also I feel silly if we don't acknowledge that today is May 4th, which all of the Star

1093
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,180
Wars fans are excited about because the fourth is with them.

1094
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:31,640
And it is episode 404 on May 4th.

1095
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,320
There's a lot of fun to be had there.

1096
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,460
But this show is not a Star Wars show.

1097
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,960
And we just did the 404 gag with KOTORadio like 11 weeks ago.

1098
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,280
So I'm I'm perplexed as to how to title this monster.

1099
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,080
Well, you could always reference the 504 code.

1100
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,080
Which is?

1101
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:54,840
I don't actually know what it is because I've never seen it before.

1102
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,720
That is the least helpful ever.

1103
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,360
Like I'm sure Wes as a as a web dev like actually knows it off the top of his head.

1104
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,360
Method not allowed.

1105
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,360
Oh, my gosh.

1106
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:06,360
Listen to you.

1107
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,360
Nicely done.

1108
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:12,360
Thank you.
