WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.840
Talking of a brave new world, Chris, as your Librem laptop arrives.

00:06.840 --> 00:15.240
All right, well, let's go over to the Purism website, P-U-R-I dot S-M, and check out the

00:15.240 --> 00:21.160
shipping status for the Librem 15 Rev 1, which is, I believe, the one I ordered, or the Rev

00:21.160 --> 00:23.560
2, which is the one I believe I'm getting.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.160
Shipping now, it says.

00:25.160 --> 00:26.160
Shipping now.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.160
Wow.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.160
Wow.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.160
Would you look at that?

00:29.160 --> 00:30.160
Actually, guess what?

00:30.160 --> 00:31.160
Big news.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.160
Big news.

00:32.160 --> 00:33.160
I got big news.

00:33.160 --> 00:34.160
Oh.

00:34.160 --> 00:37.600
That's right.

00:37.600 --> 00:39.960
The Librem has actually arrived.

00:39.960 --> 00:40.960
It's here.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.080
It is here in my hands right now, the Librem 15.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.080
Fantastic.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.080
He is holding it up.

00:45.080 --> 00:46.080
You can't see, but he is holding it up.

00:46.080 --> 00:50.040
The camera feed died from in studio today, but yeah, you will hear it soon.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.040
You will hear it soon.

00:51.040 --> 00:54.200
Yeah, we're going to do a little quick hands-on in the show today, I think.

00:54.200 --> 00:55.200
Oh, that would be good.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.200
That would be good.

00:56.200 --> 00:59.000
You know what's super ironic is it showed up Wednesday.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.720
It showed up the day after we recorded it.

01:00.720 --> 01:01.720
The day after.

01:01.720 --> 01:02.720
Yeah.

01:02.720 --> 01:03.720
Yeah.

01:03.720 --> 01:04.720
Well, that's difficult, isn't it?

01:04.720 --> 01:05.720
Yes.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.720
We just had to bust the balls for a while.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.720
Yeah.

01:09.720 --> 01:10.720
Yeah.

01:10.720 --> 01:11.720
Maybe they heard that show on Tuesday.

01:11.720 --> 01:12.720
Maybe.

01:12.720 --> 01:13.720
He keeps talking about us.

01:13.720 --> 01:14.720
He's listening live.

01:14.720 --> 01:17.840
I'll tell you, the box looked like it was hastily put together.

01:17.840 --> 01:22.360
It was like I got this weird, generic box that had lots of previous FedEx stickers on

01:22.360 --> 01:23.360
it.

01:23.360 --> 01:24.360
Yeah.

01:24.360 --> 01:28.200
Because we've been wondering where it's at for about 286 days.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.200
So it's here.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.640
It's a previous FedEx sticker, so is it a review unit?

01:32.640 --> 01:33.640
No.

01:33.640 --> 01:34.640
No, it's mine.

01:34.640 --> 01:35.640
It is.

01:35.640 --> 01:36.640
I believe it is mine.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.880
It matches the specs that I ordered, minus a few things I was expecting, which I will

01:39.880 --> 01:40.880
cover.

01:40.880 --> 01:46.840
I have presently ran Purism OS on it, and I've ran Ubuntu 16.04 on it, and right now

01:46.840 --> 01:50.040
I have Antigros Linux installed on it.

01:50.040 --> 01:51.760
So I've tried a few different distros.

01:51.760 --> 01:52.760
Running the gamut here.

01:52.760 --> 01:53.760
Yeah.

01:53.760 --> 01:54.760
Done a few different things.

01:54.760 --> 01:55.760
Got some initial hands-on impressions.

01:55.760 --> 01:56.760
Have you tried PCBSD?

01:56.760 --> 01:57.760
No.

01:57.760 --> 01:58.760
It doesn't boot.

01:58.760 --> 01:59.760
It doesn't?

01:59.760 --> 02:00.760
Have you tried it?

02:00.760 --> 02:01.760
Yeah.

02:01.760 --> 02:02.760
I've been playing with it.

02:02.760 --> 02:03.760
I ended up trying Virgin 11 on it.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.760
I got to spend a little time debugging it.

02:04.760 --> 02:05.760
So you have a Purism?

02:05.760 --> 02:06.760
Yeah.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.760
I'm the one who sent you a message on Wednesday when I got mine.

02:07.760 --> 02:08.760
Oh, that's great.

02:08.760 --> 02:09.760
I'm glad you made it.

02:09.760 --> 02:10.760
Thanks for coming.

02:10.760 --> 02:11.760
That's cool.

02:11.760 --> 02:12.760
Yeah.

02:12.760 --> 02:13.760
You and I got our rigs the same day, which was interesting, I thought.

02:13.760 --> 02:14.760
Well, I ordered it literally right after I got mine.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.760
Yeah.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.760
That's great.

02:16.760 --> 02:17.760
I'm glad you made it.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.760
Thanks for coming.

02:18.760 --> 02:19.760
That's cool.

02:19.760 --> 02:20.760
Yeah.

02:20.760 --> 02:25.760
You and I got our rigs the same day, which was interesting, I thought.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.600
Well, I ordered it literally right after you did.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.560
So you've tried what then?

02:30.560 --> 02:32.760
You've obviously already tried PCBSD.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.640
What else have you tried?

02:34.640 --> 02:37.640
I put the Ubuntu Mate on it as well.

02:37.640 --> 02:43.080
I'm still running Pure OS as I need to work on the touchpad issue.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.080
Yeah.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.800
I'll talk about the touchpad a little bit today, if I remember.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.960
I'm going to do a full review on Sunday where I'm really going to throw some tests at it,

02:50.960 --> 02:54.800
but right now I'm still in the process of releasing what the battery life is like at

02:54.800 --> 02:57.240
different settings and releasing what I can get from the performance.

02:57.240 --> 03:01.800
So I'm really kind of early days into it, but my intention is to get a config, lock

03:01.800 --> 03:04.960
it down, and figure out exactly how it's set up.

03:04.960 --> 03:10.560
Maybe do rolling distro, maybe just do Ubuntu 16.04, maybe something else.

03:10.560 --> 03:16.700
And then for the next set of hardware I get, so like if I get the Oryx Pro in here or the

03:16.700 --> 03:20.560
Entroware when it arrives, I want to have very similar testing sets.

03:20.560 --> 03:24.480
That's not scientific, but I want a very similar testing set so that way when I'm talking about

03:24.480 --> 03:25.480
the machines I can...

03:25.480 --> 03:26.480
Yeah, some kind of baseline.

03:26.480 --> 03:27.480
Yeah.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.800
I don't know if I'm going to be able to test the Oryx Pro, but I hope so.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.200
And I'm very excited to see how the Entroware stacks.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.280
We'll talk more about that, too, because...

03:34.280 --> 03:43.000
So I heard from Entroware about an hour ago and your Apollo has been shipped.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Woo!

03:44.000 --> 03:49.360
Oh, the showdown is arriving soon.

03:49.360 --> 03:55.240
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 132 for February 16th, 2016.

03:55.240 --> 04:11.120
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that has a brand new Linux laptop,

04:11.120 --> 04:13.520
and I'm all ready and fired up to talk about it.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.520
My name is Chris.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.520
My name is Wes.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.020
Hello there, Wes.

04:17.020 --> 04:18.400
So we have a great show today.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.360
Yes, we do.

04:20.360 --> 04:25.080
Sometimes the internet just delivers, and all we have to do is just sit back and receive

04:25.080 --> 04:26.160
the benefits.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.560
We just receive them.

04:27.560 --> 04:32.360
This week on the Unplugged show, we're going to talk about the Vulkan API.

04:32.360 --> 04:33.680
It's here!

04:33.680 --> 04:38.080
And as far as launches go, this is tops.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.520
I mean, in all of the years we've been covering stuff like this, I've never seen a launch

04:41.520 --> 04:45.680
like this, and I'm very excited about that because I think this type of execution is

04:45.680 --> 04:48.000
actually going to lead to industry adoption.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.480
We're going to talk about why that's a big deal for Linux, for alternative CPU architectures,

04:52.480 --> 04:53.480
and you.

04:53.480 --> 04:57.080
Yeah, coming up in this week's episode plus, we've got updates on Ubuntu Touch, integrating

04:57.080 --> 04:58.360
biometrics.

04:58.360 --> 05:02.320
We've got info for all of you out there wondering about the new Purism laptop.

05:02.320 --> 05:03.320
I've got it!

05:03.320 --> 05:06.600
I'm going to give you my first impressions of the Librem 15.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.160
It's right here in my hot hands.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.980
Hear that?

05:09.980 --> 05:10.980
That's its metal-like case.

05:10.980 --> 05:12.920
It's the sound of it being real, folks.

05:12.920 --> 05:16.360
Yeah, it's actually here, Wes, and we're going to cover it in today's episode.

05:16.360 --> 05:21.320
So I'll give you my first impressions, a couple of things that surprised me, not necessarily

05:21.320 --> 05:22.320
for the good.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.320
No.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.160
Yeah, not necessarily.

05:25.160 --> 05:28.760
So we've got that coming up, also a brand new version of FFmpeg.

05:28.760 --> 05:33.960
Google finds a major security that affects, well, basically all Linux distributions.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.640
We'll give you a roundup on the Vulkan stuff.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.380
It's going to be huge.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.960
So we've got a lot to cover today in the show, Wes.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.800
So before we get started, I realized we made a fatal flaw last week.

05:43.800 --> 05:44.800
Oh, no.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.800
Do you know what that was?

05:45.800 --> 05:46.800
What?

05:46.800 --> 05:47.800
No beer.

05:47.800 --> 05:48.800
No beer.

05:48.800 --> 05:49.800
No beer.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.800
And what happened?

05:50.800 --> 05:51.800
What happened?

05:51.800 --> 05:52.800
We ended up having a fedora rant.

05:52.800 --> 05:53.800
Yep.

05:53.800 --> 05:54.800
Right?

05:54.800 --> 05:55.800
Got yourself in trouble again.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.760
So this week, Wes, being the good co-host that he is, showed up with some beers.

05:58.760 --> 06:04.380
So we're going to be drinking something called, you ready for this?

06:04.380 --> 06:05.840
Big Guns.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.720
Big Guns from Fort George Brewery.

06:08.720 --> 06:12.280
And it's got an ABV of 4.2, so it's not on the high end here.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.280
No, no.

06:13.280 --> 06:18.800
It's an American IPA with no real score from a beer advocate, but the folks there seem

06:18.800 --> 06:19.800
to like it.

06:19.800 --> 06:20.800
Have you been sipping on it, Wes?

06:20.800 --> 06:21.800
What do you think?

06:21.800 --> 06:22.800
Yeah, it's not too bad.

06:22.800 --> 06:23.800
Pretty easy going.

06:23.800 --> 06:27.360
Not as big gun as I was hoping for, honestly.

06:27.360 --> 06:28.360
Wow.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.920
A lot of hops in this beer.

06:29.920 --> 06:30.920
A lot of hops, though.

06:30.920 --> 06:31.920
Maybe it's a hop gun.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.640
This is a bouquet of hops.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.640
But it's not too bitter.

06:34.640 --> 06:36.120
I mean, it's pretty clean.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.280
Yeah, it's not so bad.

06:38.280 --> 06:42.440
FortGeorgeBrewery.com slash Big Guns, if you want to check out the beer we're drinking,

06:42.440 --> 06:43.440
unfiltered.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.800
Expect sediment at the bottom of a can.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.200
See this cool green monster they've got, though?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.360
That's a huge hop monster, is what that is.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.800
He's got tats, too.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.200
He's got awesome tats.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.200
And he's shooting a tank.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.560
That's great.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.560
That's what's on the can.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.560
Well, good call, Wes.

07:00.560 --> 07:01.560
Thanks for bringing that in.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.560
My pleasure.

07:02.560 --> 07:03.560
All right.

07:03.560 --> 07:05.940
So we've got some stories to follow up on I'm pretty excited about.

07:05.940 --> 07:09.440
And the first one is an Ubuntu phone rumor.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.880
Let's bring in the Momba Room to talk about this.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.480
I'm appropriate gradients, Momba Room.

07:13.480 --> 07:14.480
Hello.

07:14.480 --> 07:15.480
Hello.

07:15.480 --> 07:16.480
Hello.

07:16.480 --> 07:21.560
So one thing that I'm very excited about in Android Marshmallow is legitimate fingerprint

07:21.560 --> 07:23.000
API support.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.640
That's a good thing.

07:24.640 --> 07:32.320
And I'm having some experience, not a lot, but some experience with Touch ID.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.480
I'm pretty impressed with the implementation.

07:34.480 --> 07:38.360
And my Galaxy S6 also had early fingerprint support, even though it was sort of hacked

07:38.360 --> 07:39.360
in by Samsung.

07:39.360 --> 07:40.360
That's right.

07:40.360 --> 07:44.280
But when I saw this story by Joey over at OMG Ubuntu, that Ubuntu phone was going to

07:44.280 --> 07:48.240
gain biometric security features, kind of got my attention.

07:48.240 --> 07:51.760
Ubuntu phones running secure biometric identity tools will be demoed at next week's Mobile

07:51.760 --> 07:52.880
World Congress.

07:52.880 --> 07:57.720
Canonical has partnered with ConsenSys and BlockApps, and BlockApps is going to be important

07:57.720 --> 08:04.400
here, I want you to pay attention, to provide a web wallet and biometric identity tools

08:04.400 --> 08:11.440
on Ubuntu devices using Ethereum, a decentralized public blockchain protocol.

08:11.440 --> 08:16.300
As part of the collaboration, BlockApps' Nimbus U-Port biometric digital identity tool has

08:16.300 --> 08:19.480
been ported to run on Ubuntu phones and tablets.

08:19.480 --> 08:26.080
U-Port is described as the next generation of identity management systems and is pitched

08:26.080 --> 08:27.480
as a self-sovereign identity.

08:27.480 --> 08:28.480
I want that.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.480
Me too.

08:29.480 --> 08:30.480
I'm self-sovereign.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.480
Yeah, and I like blockchains.

08:31.480 --> 08:32.480
Those are great.

08:32.480 --> 08:37.600
U-Port permits secure interaction with the Ethereum blockchain using biometric and encryption

08:37.600 --> 08:40.040
features.

08:40.040 --> 08:41.040
This is unbelievable.

08:41.040 --> 08:45.320
If a person is verified through the Ethereum blockchain but the ownership of the identity

08:45.320 --> 08:49.140
is determined locally using public and private key pairs, this is going to be integrated

08:49.140 --> 08:51.920
in with Ubuntu touch devices, or at least some of them it sounds like.

08:51.920 --> 08:57.760
I don't really know what the end distribution is going to be like, but I guess Canonical

08:57.760 --> 09:03.120
is being very cheeky, at least some folks there, and they're calling it the Internet

09:03.120 --> 09:06.240
of People, and it's just beginning.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.240
The Internet of People.

09:07.240 --> 09:11.000
Now, of course, I got to pick on Popi just for a moment, but Popi, do you know anything

09:11.000 --> 09:14.480
about this at all that you can make a little more understandable?

09:14.480 --> 09:18.240
Because to me, this sounds like fancy future technology using blockchains on phones that

09:18.240 --> 09:20.280
are going to be out in the future.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.320
I mean, it just all sounds super pie in the sky, but there must be some real code here.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.780
There must be some actual relationships and agreements in place.

09:26.780 --> 09:28.680
I have no idea.

09:28.680 --> 09:33.040
So by the way, so Popi, let me tell you more about this then.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.040
Please do.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.580
We've got the inside scoop.

09:35.580 --> 09:39.320
It's called Uport and it uses a blockchain.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.280
It's going to kickstart the Internet of People.

09:41.280 --> 09:42.280
Actually you did, me too.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.280
What did you find there, Wes?

09:43.280 --> 09:45.000
Well, this is the Ethereum website.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.720
Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts, applications that run

09:48.720 --> 09:53.520
exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud, or third-party

09:53.520 --> 09:54.520
interference.

09:54.520 --> 09:58.240
It's the head of devices marketing at Canonical, says Popi.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.240
So I'll let you know.

09:59.240 --> 10:02.880
Canonical is keen to support the development of blockchain applications and their expansion

10:02.880 --> 10:06.000
from business cloud solutions to mobile consumer applications.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.940
Working with ConsenSys and BlockApps on building a platform for consumption and creation of

10:09.940 --> 10:15.800
blockchain-based mobile apps is a realization of a promise of Ubuntu as the reinvention

10:15.800 --> 10:17.560
of personal mobile computing.

10:17.560 --> 10:19.280
That's a mouthful.

10:19.280 --> 10:20.760
Yeah.

10:20.760 --> 10:27.000
So identity management based on a decentralized blockchain and the key exchange and comparing

10:27.000 --> 10:31.960
is done locally on the device, integrated with a fingerprint sensor on the phone.

10:31.960 --> 10:36.820
Popi, is there any Ubuntu Touch device shipping today that has a fingerprint sensor that's

10:36.820 --> 10:38.080
just not turned on?

10:38.080 --> 10:39.080
Nope.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.080
Okay.

10:40.080 --> 10:47.440
None of the devices that we ship with or that our partners ship with Ubuntu out of the box

10:47.440 --> 10:50.480
and none of the community-supported ports do either.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.320
So there's a bit of work to do there.

10:52.320 --> 10:56.800
This to me, I mean, Joey's got, he's got quotes from Canonical staff.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.640
He's got links to projects.

10:58.640 --> 11:02.640
I mean, there's some smoke here and so there's probably some fire, but we probably just won't

11:02.640 --> 11:05.160
know all the details or some more details until next week.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.160
Yeah.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.000
All the details we've got are kind of pie in the sky right now.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
Yeah.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.680
I think it's kind of one of those pre-MWC announcements that happens every year where

11:12.680 --> 11:17.720
it's kind of, we're going to show this off at MWC, come and talk to us kind of thing.

11:17.720 --> 11:22.480
And then there'll be backroom conversations with device manufacturers and carriers and

11:22.480 --> 11:23.480
so on.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.480
You know, not necessarily public.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.480
Right.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.480
You know.

11:26.480 --> 11:32.040
And also, and now if nothing else, there is down the road, if Canonical is talking to

11:32.040 --> 11:35.840
a hardware provider and they're like, so the device hardware we're thinking about using

11:35.840 --> 11:38.880
with our Ubuntu Touch images has a built-in fingerprint reader.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.100
Can you utilize that?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.320
And now the answer to that is yes.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.320
And here's our solution.

11:42.320 --> 11:43.320
Yep.

11:43.320 --> 11:44.320
Exactly.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.600
So even if there's nothing shipping now in the future, that might help conversations.

11:46.600 --> 11:51.120
Speaking of things that might happen in the future but aren't actually shipping yet, Meru.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.120
Meru.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.120
Our old friend.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.120
Yeah.

11:54.120 --> 11:55.120
We talked about it last week.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.120
We're like, where the hell is this coming from?

11:56.120 --> 11:59.240
It was sort of like out of nowhere.

11:59.240 --> 12:04.120
And it was a project to run Debian on top of Android so you could hook up your Android

12:04.120 --> 12:10.520
phone, a Nexus 5, to a monitor and get a type of convergence, an Android XFCE based, well,

12:10.520 --> 12:13.880
I guess it's maybe a virtual machine, I'm not quite sure how it works, but a XFCE based

12:13.880 --> 12:15.480
desktop that runs on top of Android.

12:15.480 --> 12:18.800
You still get Android and you get an external loop.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.800
We talked about it.

12:19.800 --> 12:20.800
How is this possible?

12:20.800 --> 12:25.360
Well, so last Thursday, Meru was announced, the software that turns your smartphone into

12:25.360 --> 12:26.360
a PC.

12:26.360 --> 12:29.920
And the developer said he was expecting some attention, but he thought maybe he'd get a

12:29.920 --> 12:32.120
few early enthusiasts willing to give it a shot.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.480
Instead, he got a couple of thousand.

12:33.480 --> 12:36.760
In a few hours, someone picked it up on Hacker News, where it hit number five.

12:36.760 --> 12:43.000
Within the next 48 hours, dozens of text sites, blogs, et cetera, this show, people from all

12:43.000 --> 12:45.880
over the world were asking when Meru would be supported on their devices.

12:45.880 --> 12:50.080
The press began speculating about a group of unknown developers challenging the likes

12:50.080 --> 12:52.240
of Microsoft and Ubuntu.

12:52.240 --> 12:53.760
I freaked out.

12:53.760 --> 12:57.380
I was the only one that knew Meru was just me.

12:57.380 --> 13:01.280
How the heck was I going to handle thousands of people that signed up for the beta?

13:01.280 --> 13:05.120
Then different emails started showing up, emails from people who said they were ready

13:05.120 --> 13:09.800
to offer support in any way and would absolutely love to help and so on.

13:09.800 --> 13:12.280
The support just kept pouring in.

13:12.280 --> 13:17.120
I've got to say, the open source community never ceases to amaze me.

13:17.120 --> 13:22.420
I've had emails from people asking if they can help test Meru on other devices on a Sunday.

13:22.420 --> 13:27.300
How many people, how many normal people do you know that willingly want to give up their

13:27.300 --> 13:29.080
Sundays to help test software?

13:29.080 --> 13:30.080
Probably too many.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.080
Yeah, our audience.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.080
Us.

13:32.080 --> 13:33.080
Yeah.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.280
With that spirit in mind, I'm open sourcing Meru.

13:35.280 --> 13:36.280
Oh.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.280
Heck yes.

13:37.280 --> 13:41.200
Setting up a largest open source project is new to me, so please be patient.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.800
There's a decent amount of work that needs to be done to document and automate things

13:43.800 --> 13:48.080
so people can easily get started with the code.

13:48.080 --> 13:51.880
A pretty good conclusion to the Meru story that we covered last week.

13:51.880 --> 13:52.880
We'll see.

13:52.880 --> 13:56.280
Rodden, I think maybe you seem the most skeptical of the group.

13:56.280 --> 14:00.400
Did he go?

14:00.400 --> 14:01.400
He's not here.

14:01.400 --> 14:02.720
Well, I think we'll see.

14:02.720 --> 14:08.480
Rodden essentially put it down to this at least puts it on the may try some days track.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.640
I think what we should actually do is get Rodden to try it.

14:10.640 --> 14:13.000
I think a lot depends on how quickly it moves, right?

14:13.000 --> 14:16.680
Like if they can get something that works really well on more than just one phone quickly,

14:16.680 --> 14:17.680
then maybe people use it.

14:17.680 --> 14:18.680
I don't know, man.

14:18.680 --> 14:21.360
I actually think sticking to the Nexus 5 is a pretty good strategy.

14:21.360 --> 14:27.680
Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, expand to the 6P if you got stuff, but stick to the hardcore enthusiast

14:27.680 --> 14:29.680
devices just for a little while to get that working.

14:29.680 --> 14:30.680
I mean, yeah, definitely.

14:30.680 --> 14:32.840
And you want to have a really good experience.

14:32.840 --> 14:36.200
But like Popey pointed out last week, those are also people that are most expecting to

14:36.200 --> 14:39.360
be able to update their devices.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.840
Would you give it a shot?

14:40.840 --> 14:41.840
You got a Nexus 5.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.840
I do.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.840
Yeah, I'd give it a shot.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.840
I signed up for the beta.

14:44.840 --> 14:53.360
So when I get what if, like Popey was worried, you can't install, say, the next Android update?

14:53.360 --> 14:55.640
Is that all it takes and you're done?

14:55.640 --> 14:56.640
It depends.

14:56.640 --> 15:00.560
If I couldn't install updates at all, if it was a little delayed, or, you know, they're

15:00.560 --> 15:03.040
still working out the update pipeline, we'll see.

15:03.040 --> 15:05.000
I would like to remain relatively current.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
I mean, I do run.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.200
Yeah, that's a good point.

15:07.200 --> 15:12.120
So I think the interesting story here, and it's one that happens all the time, and he

15:12.120 --> 15:15.520
even says in his blog post, like, how did the media not know it's just one guy?

15:15.520 --> 15:17.360
Why did they all assume it's a group of people?

15:17.360 --> 15:18.360
It's just one guy.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.720
Well, it probably means your presentation was pretty slick, so it looks like it's more

15:20.720 --> 15:21.900
than one person.

15:21.900 --> 15:25.240
But this kind of thing happens all the time in open source.

15:25.240 --> 15:28.920
We start talking about something like it has a whole team of people behind it, or it has

15:28.920 --> 15:34.440
a big bunch of funding, and it turns out to be one guy, one gal, maybe a couple of people

15:34.440 --> 15:39.440
at best, who are slaving away at something for years with no thanks.

15:39.440 --> 15:43.140
And then all of a sudden, one day, something happens, and it gets a ton of exposure.

15:43.140 --> 15:45.840
Maybe it's a bug, maybe it's something.

15:45.840 --> 15:51.240
And we just kind of run off, and we don't stop and go, this could be just a person.

15:51.240 --> 15:54.680
This could be just somebody's pet project they're working on.

15:54.680 --> 15:59.960
In open source, I think we look at it, and we automatically attribute attributes to an

15:59.960 --> 16:03.600
open source project that we also attribute to a company.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.880
And so we are familiar with some of the bigger open source projects that do have a lot of

16:07.880 --> 16:08.880
that kind of infrastructure.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.280
But it doesn't mean everyone does.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.800
Kits and Kitty, you had some comments on the Android update issue.

16:12.800 --> 16:13.800
Go ahead.

16:13.800 --> 16:19.760
Yeah, I actually think that the Android update issue is a real bummer, and it's always tempting

16:19.760 --> 16:21.880
me to move away.

16:21.880 --> 16:25.880
But it's really the only reason I want to see Ubuntu funds succeed.

16:25.880 --> 16:31.480
So I think Android gets too much exposure, but really, on the flip side is, I don't want

16:31.480 --> 16:35.400
to use Apple.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.520
That's been my internal battle back and forth for a while now.

16:38.520 --> 16:44.080
I want a modern, updated smartphone with good apps that actually make me more productive,

16:44.080 --> 16:47.360
things like Uber and whatnot, because I just needed to call Uber recently.

16:47.360 --> 16:51.360
I want all that stuff, and I want it – if I'm going to pay for it, I want it to be

16:51.360 --> 16:52.360
decent.

16:52.360 --> 16:56.080
It doesn't have to be perfect, but I want it to be decent.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.960
Speaking of decent, Recon, I'm talking about this today.

16:59.960 --> 17:03.960
There are carriers out there that kind of help give you a leg up.

17:03.960 --> 17:08.980
If you want a device that gets updates frequently, say you have an S6.

17:08.980 --> 17:11.440
You know Samsung is shipping out Marshmallow for the S6?

17:11.440 --> 17:12.440
Are they now?

17:12.440 --> 17:14.760
It depends if your carrier lets you.

17:14.760 --> 17:15.760
Of course.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.760
Yeah, yeah.

17:16.760 --> 17:23.640
Some international carriers, I just – that process right there, that drives me so crazy.

17:23.640 --> 17:24.640
That's broken.

17:24.640 --> 17:25.640
That drives me so crazy.

17:25.640 --> 17:26.640
You know who's got it better?

17:26.640 --> 17:27.920
Our buddies over at Ting.

17:27.920 --> 17:28.920
They don't get in the way.

17:28.920 --> 17:29.920
No, they don't get in the way.

17:29.920 --> 17:30.920
I'm not going to lie to you about that stuff.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.200
Ting is on a mission to make mobile make sense.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.560
They're on a mobile mission to make it make sense.

17:36.560 --> 17:37.760
Does that make sense?

17:37.760 --> 17:39.200
Mobile sense making by Ting.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.200
Yeah, exactly.

17:40.200 --> 17:43.360
Go over to linux.ting.com to get our discount and support the show.

17:43.360 --> 17:47.040
No contracts, no determination fees, and you only pay for what you use.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.600
It's some sort of wizardry, you guys.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.400
Actually, it makes a lot of sense.

17:50.400 --> 17:54.200
They're an MVNO, and they have the CDMA and GSM network, which means there's a lot of

17:54.200 --> 17:55.400
devices they're compatible with.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.780
It also means they didn't spend the last 20 years digging holes in the ground and putting

17:58.780 --> 17:59.780
towers down.

17:59.780 --> 18:03.520
They're able to come in and license the towers from carriers that did that investment, and

18:03.520 --> 18:06.440
they're able to take that savings and turn it around into great service, so they can

18:06.440 --> 18:11.680
do things like invest in really good customer service or invest in the best online management

18:11.680 --> 18:13.960
dashboard for your cellular network.

18:13.960 --> 18:17.480
They're able to pay unbelievable rates out.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.640
For example, three devices, right?

18:20.640 --> 18:27.240
Three devices, three smartphone devices, iPhone 5, Samsung S6, Nexus 5, and there's an iPhone

18:27.240 --> 18:28.240
6.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.240
Actually, it's four devices.

18:29.240 --> 18:36.320
We have a 6S on there, too, and all of it together, 30, 35 bucks.

18:36.320 --> 18:39.560
Part of that reasoning is because not all the devices are being used at the same time.

18:39.560 --> 18:42.560
You can turn devices on and off depending on what testing we're doing.

18:42.560 --> 18:47.000
We can be extremely Wi-Fi savvy, so we can do like Telegram and Hangouts and things like

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
that.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.820
On top of it, it's just because it's a flat $6 for the line, and it's just your minutes,

18:50.820 --> 18:52.320
your messages, and your megabytes.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.000
You add that up, that's all you got to pay.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.560
You go to linux.ting.com, you get a discount.

18:56.560 --> 19:01.640
You get $25 off a device, you get $25 in service credit, and that is really nice because the

19:01.640 --> 19:05.840
average Ting line is $23 a line after minutes and messages and megabytes, 23 bucks.

19:05.840 --> 19:09.720
You get a $25 credit, you're not even going to pay for your first month.

19:09.720 --> 19:11.280
The best part is then you can just try it.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.280
There's no risk.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.840
You can probably bring your phone you already have.

19:13.840 --> 19:14.840
You know what I love?

19:14.840 --> 19:15.840
Shoot.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.640
I love the fact that they got $9 SIMs.

19:17.640 --> 19:18.640
You want to try out Ting?

19:18.640 --> 19:19.640
You're talking about trying out Ting.

19:19.640 --> 19:23.960
Get a $9 SIM, pop it in a device, port it over to Ting if it's compatible, and you're

19:23.960 --> 19:24.960
good to go.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.640
You're just paying for what you use.

19:27.640 --> 19:33.680
They have every device from good, solid feature phones that are $60, $70 for a really good

19:33.680 --> 19:37.400
phone with no contract, no early termination fee, and only pay for what you use.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.720
Can you imagine on a feature phone?

19:38.720 --> 19:40.800
Then they go all the way up to the Cadillacs.

19:40.800 --> 19:45.240
They got the Caddy, so the S6s, they got the iPhone 6Ss, they got the Nexus size, they

19:45.240 --> 19:49.920
got the Moto Xs, all of it because that's what consumers want.

19:49.920 --> 19:53.000
They have a powerful control panel.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.120
No BS when you call them.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.120
They're going to help you out.

19:56.120 --> 19:57.120
They'll stick with you.

19:57.120 --> 19:58.940
They got the tools to manage all of it.

19:58.940 --> 20:03.880
If you're doing one account or many, go to linux.ting.com, support the show linux.ting.com,

20:03.880 --> 20:04.880
check them out.

20:04.880 --> 20:09.560
And if you're considering cutting the cord, they have some tips for you.

20:09.560 --> 20:13.120
This is a thread they've been following for a while, and they're monitoring the cable

20:13.120 --> 20:14.120
TV bills.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.240
In some areas they're doing like fiber in it and stuff like that, so they're watching

20:16.240 --> 20:17.240
the scene.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.240
And they're really breaking it down.

20:18.240 --> 20:21.120
The cable TV companies, what they're charging, what you're paying for.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.280
They've done some good research here.

20:23.280 --> 20:27.000
And different alternatives you can do if you want to cut the cord, all up on the Ting blog.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.440
Go to linux.ting.com and then go check that out.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.760
And a big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

20:32.760 --> 20:33.760
Thanks, Ting.

20:33.760 --> 20:34.760
Thank you, Ting.

20:34.760 --> 20:35.760
Thank you, Ting.

20:35.760 --> 20:36.760
Thank you, Ting.

20:36.760 --> 20:40.160
Real quick, I want to talk about something that you all need to know about before we

20:40.160 --> 20:41.160
go too much further.

20:41.160 --> 20:42.600
You need to update your boxes.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.600
So I'm sure you all are using rigs that are still getting updates.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.840
You're not using some distros, not getting updates anymore.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.280
You're not crazy like that.

20:49.280 --> 20:55.120
Google and the folks over at Red Hat were both eating from the same end of a spaghetti

20:55.120 --> 21:01.600
noodle and ended up kissing in the middle and discovered a flaw in glibc that could

21:01.600 --> 21:05.640
lead to a buffer overflow.

21:05.640 --> 21:09.000
The Google blog starts, have you ever been deep in the minds of debugging and suddenly

21:09.000 --> 21:13.520
realized you were staring at something far more interesting than you were expecting?

21:13.520 --> 21:15.200
Well, you're not alone.

21:15.200 --> 21:19.560
Recently, a Google engineer noticed that their SSH client segfaulted every time they tried

21:19.560 --> 21:23.320
to connect to a specific host.

21:23.320 --> 21:27.440
That engineer filed a ticket to investigate the behavior and then after an intense investigation,

21:27.440 --> 21:33.160
we discovered the issue lay in glibc and not in SSH as we were expecting.

21:33.160 --> 21:36.100
Thanks to this engineer's keen observation, we were able to determine that the issue could

21:36.100 --> 21:39.360
result in remote code execution.

21:39.360 --> 21:42.160
We immediately began an in-depth analysis of the issue and determined whether it could

21:42.160 --> 21:44.160
be exploited and possible fixes.

21:44.160 --> 21:48.800
We saw this as a challenge and after some intense hacking sessions, we were able to

21:48.800 --> 21:53.920
craft a fully working exploit.

21:53.920 --> 21:58.720
In the course of our investigation and to our surprise, we learned that glibc maintainers

21:58.720 --> 22:03.000
had previously been alerted to the issue via their bug tracker in July 2015 and to our

22:03.000 --> 22:11.080
delight, Florian and Carlos of Red Hat had also been studying the bug's impact, albeit

22:11.080 --> 22:15.280
completely independently due to the sense of nature of the issue, the investigation

22:15.280 --> 22:19.760
patch creation and regression test performed primarily by Florian and Carlos had continued

22:19.760 --> 22:21.640
quote unquote off bug.

22:21.640 --> 22:25.360
This was an amazing coincidence and thanks to their hard work and cooperation, we were

22:25.360 --> 22:30.160
able to translate both teams' knowledge into a comprehensive patch and regression test

22:30.160 --> 22:33.920
to protect glibc users and the patch is available here.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.620
Isn't that a beautiful story?

22:35.620 --> 22:36.620
That is a beautiful story.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.720
Red Hat and Google, kumbaya coming together.

22:38.720 --> 22:43.560
Now of course my friends over at ThreatPost who I generally think do a great job, their

22:43.560 --> 22:48.880
headline, it's one of the best, there's a few different ways you could take this.

22:48.880 --> 22:59.360
I like theirs a lot, a critical bug in glibc vulnerability puts all Linux machines at risk.

22:59.360 --> 23:05.460
So depending on where you go, there's a different take on the severity, all Linux users must

23:05.460 --> 23:13.360
patch, all things are bad, the flaw CV 2015 7547 is a stack based buffer overflow in the

23:13.360 --> 23:18.080
glibc DNS client resolver that puts Linux machines at risk for remote code execution.

23:18.080 --> 23:22.200
I don't really have much more to say other than that, but I just wanted to get the word

23:22.200 --> 23:23.200
out there.

23:23.200 --> 23:28.160
This came out since last, probably going to be a patch for your local distro soon.

23:28.160 --> 23:31.240
You know, I mean these things come up, right, do we really need to make a big deal about

23:31.240 --> 23:32.240
it?

23:32.240 --> 23:35.080
I mean we can make scary headlines, but yeah.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.920
It's like all software, there are problems, stay up to date.

23:37.920 --> 23:41.760
And some of us have larger problems, like some of us there's a lot of machines that

23:41.760 --> 23:42.760
have to be updated.

23:42.760 --> 23:46.080
Wimpy, you probably had a few rigs you had to update after this announcement.

23:46.080 --> 23:49.080
A few, yeah, that was an afternoon's work.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.080
Surprise!

23:50.080 --> 23:58.080
Yeah, so yeah, Debian have pushed the patches out and what we noticed is their security

23:58.080 --> 24:04.120
announcement says the patch is available for Jesse and Unstable, but actually they've also

24:04.120 --> 24:06.400
provided patches for Wheezy as well.

24:06.400 --> 24:10.480
So if you're running Wheezy you need to go back and patch Wheezy, but it's not in the

24:10.480 --> 24:11.480
security announcement.

24:11.480 --> 24:15.200
So if you're running Wheezy servers, go and deal with that.

24:15.200 --> 24:20.600
But what I think is more interesting about this is, is this the tipping point?

24:20.600 --> 24:27.200
Are we at the point now where we don't have to have a catchy name and a sick logo to go

24:27.200 --> 24:31.400
alongside these, you know, landmark vulnerabilities?

24:31.400 --> 24:34.280
Is that a good thing?

24:34.280 --> 24:37.080
That's why I'm not taking this seriously.

24:37.080 --> 24:39.280
You think without the branding it's not really a big deal?

24:39.280 --> 24:40.280
Yeah, totally.

24:40.280 --> 24:43.600
There's no big logo, it's not on the BBC News, I don't care.

24:43.600 --> 24:47.600
I'm just updating my machine like I would if there was an updated GIMP.

24:47.600 --> 24:52.080
I'm almost with you, but I'm also with Wimpy at the same time.

24:52.080 --> 24:56.640
This is a phenomenon that Alan and I have talked about on TechSnap a lot, is we've watched

24:56.640 --> 24:59.480
this branding that's now happening with vulnerabilities.

24:59.480 --> 25:02.640
You know, we can think of things like Shellshock and Heartbleed, these immediately come to

25:02.640 --> 25:03.640
mind, right?

25:03.640 --> 25:09.160
And there's others, Ghost, and all of these that, you know, and what's weird now, yeah,

25:09.160 --> 25:13.320
what's weird is we have like this common language, like Ghost was that one that affected Bash,

25:13.320 --> 25:14.320
right?

25:14.320 --> 25:16.400
And Heartbleed was that one that affected OpenSSL.

25:16.400 --> 25:21.400
Now we can just refer to these names and we all know what we're talking about.

25:21.400 --> 25:22.400
In a way, though...

25:22.400 --> 25:24.000
This is a Dharmak and Jalad moment here.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.000
Yes.

25:25.000 --> 25:30.280
In a way, it's actually, I feel like it begins, this sounds super D-baggy, but I feel like

25:30.280 --> 25:34.240
it begins the conversation when you're in an employment situation where like you've

25:34.240 --> 25:37.920
got to go to your boss and say, hey, we've got to update, and it begins that conversation

25:37.920 --> 25:39.120
because they've heard the name.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.120
It's on the news.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.120
It's obviously a big deal.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.120
Right.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.840
Like when Heartbleed came out, I think I even played a clip of CBS Morning News covering

25:44.840 --> 25:45.840
it.

25:45.840 --> 25:46.840
Like it was everywhere.

25:46.840 --> 25:54.120
So in some ways, I feel like the branding has been good, but the other time, the implicit,

25:54.120 --> 25:56.760
the thing that's implied there, and I'm going to be curious to know your thoughts on this

25:56.760 --> 26:02.360
is, doesn't it also sort of drag Linux credibility through the dirt when it's...

26:02.360 --> 26:03.360
Exactly my point.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.360
Yeah.

26:04.360 --> 26:10.680
All of the big outlets get hold of it because there is a catchy name and a sexy logo.

26:10.680 --> 26:14.880
And it drags Linux reputation through the mud.

26:14.880 --> 26:18.760
Whereas when it's announced like this, and probably the reason there's no sexy logo and

26:18.760 --> 26:22.080
branding this time is because it's Red Hat and Google.

26:22.080 --> 26:25.000
They're not security researchers trying to promote themselves.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.000
Exactly.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.000
Trying to promote their company.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.000
Yeah.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.440
Yeah, exactly.

26:29.440 --> 26:35.360
And when there is the branding, I just feel that it scares people unnecessarily because

26:35.360 --> 26:39.520
the people in the industry know what the issue is and know how to deal with it.

26:39.520 --> 26:44.360
And today's announcement through the various distros and security announcements has just

26:44.360 --> 26:51.140
been responded to in the same way we respond to any vulnerability that affects components

26:51.140 --> 26:55.480
that you're running in your infrastructure and you just go out and patch and move merrily

26:55.480 --> 26:56.480
along.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.600
You don't then have two weeks of media fallout.

26:58.600 --> 26:59.600
Yeah, that's true.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.520
All the security officers are still paying attention to it.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.520
That's true.

27:02.520 --> 27:06.320
Kitson though points out, Kitson, you think that was inevitable.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.320
This was going to happen.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.000
I mean, we give everything names.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.880
Yeah, we do.

27:10.880 --> 27:15.440
If you really think about it, everybody knows what you're talking about whenever you say

27:15.440 --> 27:18.680
like Hurricane Sandy or Wilma or whatever.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.680
Or Katrina.

27:19.680 --> 27:25.640
And those things come up and even like with non-hurricanes, for instance, you have the

27:25.640 --> 27:26.640
May blizzard.

27:26.640 --> 27:32.000
A good portion of the people that live through that know what that is.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.480
People name houses and their cars.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.480
Yeah, that's true.

27:34.480 --> 27:35.960
Yeah, the lady Jupiter there.

27:35.960 --> 27:36.960
Yeah.

27:36.960 --> 27:37.960
All right.

27:37.960 --> 27:42.080
I did notice that one of their suggested mitigations is having a local resolver like

27:42.080 --> 27:45.120
DNS mask or something that will reject non-compliant responses.

27:45.120 --> 27:49.080
That's another reason if you are doing that, you can have something like that on your land.

27:49.080 --> 27:55.000
I mean, some of those resolvers have been updated as well for the same reason though.

27:55.000 --> 27:58.600
So NCSD got patched today as well.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.560
I also though had the same thought Wimpy did.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.360
I was like, I'm just glad this isn't getting a name.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.720
For some reason, that was also my first reaction.

28:04.720 --> 28:08.400
I'm just glad it's not getting overhyped and we still need to update.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.640
But let's overhype this.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.120
I can't give enough hype to FFmpeg.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.120
Oh, I'm so excited.

28:12.120 --> 28:16.940
FFmpeg 3.0 release supports VP9 acceleration, which is going to be good for some folks.

28:16.940 --> 28:21.160
New decoding standards, new AAC encoding improvements, which is nice.

28:21.160 --> 28:24.400
Meaning you won't have to pull in that special library just to encode.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.800
Well, if it's good enough, we'll see.

28:25.800 --> 28:26.800
Yes.

28:26.800 --> 28:27.800
Well, I trust them.

28:27.800 --> 28:28.800
I mean, I'd be willing to give it a shot.

28:28.800 --> 28:29.800
But yeah, you're right.

28:29.800 --> 28:30.800
That's the whole idea.

28:30.800 --> 28:34.040
New filters across the board, which look really good.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.040
What else?

28:35.040 --> 28:37.280
Anything else about FFmpeg 3.0 that jumped out at you?

28:37.280 --> 28:38.280
Intel QuickSync.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

28:39.280 --> 28:42.160
You know, there's been a lot of talk of this on the Windows side in the MB community to

28:42.160 --> 28:44.600
get the GPU to do your transcoding.

28:44.600 --> 28:48.880
So it sounds like FFmpeg supports this now.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.680
That's not just good for MB.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.240
No, it's good for a lot of people.

28:53.240 --> 28:56.080
That's going to be so good for server-side streaming and encoding.

28:56.080 --> 28:58.000
I know Alan was looking at using it.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.000
Yes.

28:59.000 --> 29:03.040
In fact, Alan just recently specced systems with support for that out of the box because

29:03.040 --> 29:06.100
he wants to use that to do server-side encoding.

29:06.100 --> 29:07.100
That's a huge deal.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.100
I'm excited.

29:08.100 --> 29:09.100
I mean, I love freaking FFmpeg.

29:09.100 --> 29:16.440
And I feel like the thing about FFmpeg is if there was one piece of software that people

29:16.440 --> 29:21.240
don't realize contributes so much to their desktop in the background for media playback

29:21.240 --> 29:23.840
and for a lot of podcasters, it's FFmpeg.

29:23.840 --> 29:26.240
Wim, you had a comment about the AAC encoding.

29:26.240 --> 29:27.240
Go ahead.

29:27.240 --> 29:33.640
Yeah, only that to get a decent AAC encoder on FFmpeg often means you have to compile

29:33.640 --> 29:37.960
it from source and link in third-party libraries that might not be open source.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.720
So I'm pleased to see a native AAC encoder.

29:40.720 --> 29:50.280
And I should be interested to try it out and see how it compares with the FAC and FAD components.

29:50.280 --> 29:55.240
We've done in-house testing of AAC versus MP3 versus Vorbis.

29:55.240 --> 29:56.800
There's a definite.

29:56.800 --> 30:02.240
You can do, for example, this is like two, three years ago that I did this testing.

30:02.240 --> 30:09.840
And a 96-kilobit AAC to my ears sounded better than a 128-kilobit Ogg Vorbis or MP3.

30:09.840 --> 30:11.360
I believe that.

30:11.360 --> 30:16.080
So you get – in mobile, that makes a difference.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.080
Yeah, congratulations.

30:17.080 --> 30:20.400
FFmpeg version 3.0 is out.

30:20.400 --> 30:23.520
The other big feature that they introduced a couple of years ago was ProRes support.

30:23.520 --> 30:25.000
I couldn't believe it when they have that.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.800
And now that they have got AAC encoder support.

30:26.800 --> 30:30.240
I know they also added support for the GoPro Cineform HD.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.520
So if you have a GoPro, that might help.

30:32.520 --> 30:36.800
And then in the previous release, they got the HEVC hardware support.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.200
Cineform is really nice.

30:38.200 --> 30:45.640
That is – boy, I wish – I guess an equivalent piece of software from Adobe or something

30:45.640 --> 30:46.640
would be $1,000.

30:46.640 --> 30:49.560
Yeah, it's easy.

30:49.560 --> 30:53.480
The fact that you can use it on the command line, too, is a huge, huge deal.

30:53.480 --> 30:55.480
Build up all kind of pipelines that you want.

30:55.480 --> 30:56.480
Yes.

30:56.480 --> 31:00.600
And then inside jobs and scripts and even like the encoding for all of our networks,

31:00.600 --> 31:05.280
all the shows here on the network, done with FFmpeg on a bash script on the command line.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.640
Just – it's a huge, huge software project.

31:07.640 --> 31:11.160
And when – one of these days, when I get the Patreon funding to the level I want where

31:11.160 --> 31:14.000
I can start – I want – that's one of the first projects on my list.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.000
Absolutely.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.840
I really can't – it's like they're like the central plumbing for so many multimedia

31:18.840 --> 31:19.840
productions.

31:19.840 --> 31:20.840
It's really valuable.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.920
I want to take a moment to tell you about something else that's been extremely valuable

31:22.920 --> 31:24.200
for my back-end infrastructure.

31:24.200 --> 31:25.200
That's DigitalOcean.

31:25.200 --> 31:28.600
Go over to DigitalOcean right now and check them out and use our promo code of Absolute

31:28.600 --> 31:29.880
Power, Knowledge and Authority.

31:29.880 --> 31:30.880
That's DOUnplugged.

31:30.880 --> 31:35.560
I mean, if you don't like Knowledge, Power and Authority and have – well, maybe save

31:35.560 --> 31:36.560
ten bucks, too.

31:36.560 --> 31:37.560
That's also something else you can do.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.160
When you use the promo code DOUnplugged, then don't use it.

31:39.160 --> 31:40.640
But I like saving ten bucks.

31:40.640 --> 31:45.520
I like Knowledge, Power and Authority – Power and Authority by DigitalOcean with your own

31:45.520 --> 31:46.520
Linux rig.

31:46.520 --> 31:49.220
It's not like other solutions where you go deploy a machine and there's some sort

31:49.220 --> 31:54.800
of like cPanel type interface where you manage it or you have to go use some sort of archaic

31:54.800 --> 31:58.080
web interface to go deploy a VPS.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.600
It is a totally different experience.

32:00.600 --> 32:05.240
Really great UI, Linux infrastructure throughout using KVM for the virtualizer, SSDs for the

32:05.240 --> 32:08.400
drives, 40 gigabit eConnections to the internets.

32:08.400 --> 32:09.960
It is a great solution.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.400
DigitalOcean is very simple to get started to.

32:11.400 --> 32:14.640
In less than 55 seconds, you're going to have your rig running.

32:14.640 --> 32:21.280
It is going to – I mean, for example, this weekend, when I was setting up a Discord server,

32:21.280 --> 32:23.280
I did it during the segment break.

32:23.280 --> 32:24.400
I went over to DigitalOcean.

32:24.400 --> 32:28.360
I spun up an Ubuntu 14.04 droplet and I got the root password changed.

32:28.360 --> 32:33.800
I got some DNS set up in minutes, in minutes, while I'm live on the air.

32:33.800 --> 32:34.800
It's a really great system.

32:34.800 --> 32:39.320
And they have data centers in New York, San Francisco, Singapore, Amsterdam, London, Toronto

32:39.320 --> 32:40.720
and Germany.

32:40.720 --> 32:44.200
That interface is so good, but you know what?

32:44.200 --> 32:45.860
You're beyond interfaces.

32:45.860 --> 32:47.680
You're bigger than interfaces.

32:47.680 --> 32:48.680
That's right.

32:48.680 --> 32:49.680
They got an API.

32:49.680 --> 32:53.220
They got a straightforward API you can use to just build off of – I mean, just go build

32:53.220 --> 32:54.220
off of like a boss.

32:54.220 --> 32:56.560
I mean, I'm not going to tell you what to do, but here's what I'm going to tell you

32:56.560 --> 32:57.560
what to do.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.080
Go use that API to create something.

32:59.080 --> 33:01.400
Go contribute to the tons of great open source code that's out there.

33:01.400 --> 33:02.680
Oh, you need to get started quick?

33:02.680 --> 33:03.680
Well, guess what?

33:03.680 --> 33:05.200
DigitalOcean's got you covered.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.580
One-click application deployments.

33:06.580 --> 33:08.140
So this weekend, we covered Discourse.

33:08.140 --> 33:09.880
I don't know why we even bothered installing it.

33:09.880 --> 33:13.960
They have one-click deployment of Discourse on DigitalOcean.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.200
You don't even need to spend that time.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.200
GitLab.

33:16.200 --> 33:17.360
Go check out GitLab.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.360
Just go play with it for a little bit.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.960
Use our promo code, DOUNPLUG, to get a $10 credit.

33:20.960 --> 33:25.840
Or if you want to try something like, I don't know, Rocket Chat or anything Docker container-based,

33:25.840 --> 33:26.840
one-click deployment.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.680
You get in the 14.04 base machine.

33:28.680 --> 33:29.680
You get Docker.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.440
You get the whole stack ready to go own cloud.

33:31.440 --> 33:34.880
It's ridiculous how easy it is to get started in own cloud.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.480
Our Mumble Room?

33:36.480 --> 33:39.000
Our Mumble Room powered by DigitalOcean Droplet.

33:39.000 --> 33:40.240
My own cloud installation.

33:40.240 --> 33:41.360
My Sync thing installation.

33:41.360 --> 33:42.360
My BitTorrent.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.640
Yes, I also use BitTorrent Sync still.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.120
Also powered by DigitalOcean.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.440
My Quasicore installation.

33:47.440 --> 33:49.320
Oh my goodness, Wes.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.320
There's so many.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.320
We take calls.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.320
Guess what?

33:52.320 --> 33:53.320
Powered by a DigitalOcean Droplet.

33:53.320 --> 33:54.320
It's fantastic.

33:54.320 --> 33:55.320
It's my go-to proxy as well.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.320
Their connections are so good.

33:56.320 --> 33:59.560
I was trying to download Xcode for a family member the other day.

33:59.560 --> 34:00.560
Don't ask me why.

34:00.560 --> 34:01.560
I know it's terrible.

34:01.560 --> 34:05.200
But my Comcast connection, you know, way too slow.

34:05.200 --> 34:07.560
Copied those cookies over to DigitalOcean Droplet.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.120
One command line later, and there it was.

34:09.120 --> 34:10.120
Full speed.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.120
Nice.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.120
Good move.

34:12.120 --> 34:13.120
Yeah.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.120
For $5 a month.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.240
When I'm up at the Rover, and I'm all like, or not, Lady Jupiter, hello.

34:16.240 --> 34:18.080
And I'm all like, this is a huge file.

34:18.080 --> 34:19.080
And I'm on a mobile connection.

34:19.080 --> 34:20.080
Exactly.

34:20.080 --> 34:21.080
I go to my studio.

34:21.080 --> 34:22.080
I SSH into my Droplet.

34:22.080 --> 34:23.080
I download it there.

34:23.080 --> 34:26.640
And then when I get here at the studio and I pull it down, the DigitalOcean connection

34:26.640 --> 34:27.640
is so fast.

34:27.640 --> 34:28.640
Just lies.

34:28.640 --> 34:30.020
I have a 100 megabit connection here at the studio.

34:30.020 --> 34:33.800
It saturates that entire connection when I pull files down from DigitalOcean.

34:33.800 --> 34:36.360
So it's exactly the same way I do it too.

34:36.360 --> 34:40.080
And with the pricing the way it is, and you use our promo code DUNPLUG to get the $10

34:40.080 --> 34:44.280
credit, I don't even bother spinning up virtual machines on my desktop anymore.

34:44.280 --> 34:47.680
You can run a really, really, really, really nice rig for $0.03 an hour.

34:47.680 --> 34:51.200
And when you use the promo code DUNPLUG to get the $10 credit, you can do that for a

34:51.200 --> 34:52.200
while.

34:52.200 --> 34:53.200
It's crazy.

34:53.200 --> 34:56.840
You know, those are American U.S. greenback dollars.

34:56.840 --> 34:58.160
So you've got to convert.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.960
But you use the promo code DUNPLUG anywhere in the world.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.440
I hear there's things that will do that for you.

35:01.440 --> 35:02.440
So figure that out.

35:02.440 --> 35:03.440
Probably.

35:03.440 --> 35:04.440
We're not here to help you.

35:04.440 --> 35:05.440
No, no, no.

35:05.440 --> 35:06.440
We're just here to tell you to go to DigitalOcean.

35:06.440 --> 35:07.440
Yeah.

35:07.440 --> 35:11.320
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DUNPLUG and a huge thank you to DigitalOcean for not

35:11.320 --> 35:17.360
only rocking the entire tire back in infrastructure now, but also for having such a freaking great

35:17.360 --> 35:20.760
service and a great UI that really make it actually approachable either for beginners

35:20.760 --> 35:21.760
or experts.

35:21.760 --> 35:27.160
DigitalOcean.com, use the promo code DUNPLUG and a big thank you to DigitalOcean.

35:27.160 --> 35:29.560
All right.

35:29.560 --> 35:33.320
Let's spend a moment before we get to the purism, let's spend a moment talking about

35:33.320 --> 35:35.880
the really big long-term thing that happened this week.

35:35.880 --> 35:40.600
I'm extremely, extremely, extremely excited to talk about Vulkan for a few moments.

35:40.600 --> 35:47.320
No, no, I don't mean of the Mr. Spock variety, although I do like that type of Vulkan.

35:47.320 --> 35:52.200
I am talking specifically about the API.

35:52.200 --> 35:59.440
So one group that we're going to talk about today doesn't actually have code to show you,

35:59.440 --> 36:03.160
but they do have a great video with a guy who does a hell of a VO.

36:03.160 --> 36:08.000
Wes, I mean, you know, I thought maybe one day if this podcasting thing didn't work out,

36:08.000 --> 36:09.560
I could do that in the world, right?

36:09.560 --> 36:10.560
Oh, yeah.

36:10.560 --> 36:11.560
Yeah.

36:11.560 --> 36:12.560
Backup career.

36:12.560 --> 36:13.560
Yeah, backup.

36:13.560 --> 36:14.560
Exactly.

36:14.560 --> 36:16.760
This guy though, this guy is really, this guy is going to take the market from right

36:16.760 --> 36:19.960
out from underneath me and he's going to tell us about Vulkan.

36:19.960 --> 36:26.120
Vulkan is the only open standard and cross-platform API for high efficiency access to graphics

36:26.120 --> 36:29.160
and compute on modern GPUs.

36:29.160 --> 36:34.920
Derived from AMD's revolutionary Mantle API, the Vulkan API provides applications with

36:34.920 --> 36:40.840
direct control over GPU acceleration for optimized efficiency and performance.

36:40.840 --> 36:46.520
Vulkan exposes features that were not accessible through OpenGL, delivering benefits that include

36:46.520 --> 36:51.960
close to metal control of the GPU, demanded by sophisticated game engines and interactive

36:51.960 --> 36:58.080
media, reduced driver overhead and CPU usage, enabling faster performance and better image

36:58.080 --> 37:02.440
quality, superior utilization of multi-core processors.

37:02.440 --> 37:08.080
Vulkan is the only high performance graphics API that works across multiple operating systems,

37:08.080 --> 37:10.200
including Windows and Linux systems.

37:10.200 --> 37:16.480
An industry leader in open standards technologies, AMD donated the Mantle API code to Chrome

37:16.480 --> 37:21.400
Monos to jumpstart Vulkan development with a solid and proven technology foundation.

37:21.400 --> 37:27.200
AMD's co-development of the Vulkan API paves the way for PC games to run on both Windows

37:27.200 --> 37:30.760
and Linux with the same features and performance.

37:30.760 --> 37:35.560
Vulkan makes this possible for the first time, enabling a big step forward for PC gamers

37:35.560 --> 37:41.360
seeking an exceptional gaming experience on AMD Radeon GPUs and APUs.

37:41.360 --> 37:46.560
For more information, visit www.gpuopen.com.

37:46.560 --> 37:47.560
All right.

37:47.560 --> 37:48.560
I like how they have an echo in there.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.560
That's nice.

37:49.560 --> 37:50.560
Calm.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.560
Calm.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.560
So you know it's serious.

37:52.560 --> 37:55.440
That's AMD's little video on what Vulkan is, so that way I don't have to explain it and

37:55.440 --> 37:56.440
the guy has the video.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.680
He's got a nice voice, but I think your microphone's nicer.

37:58.680 --> 37:59.680
Thanks.

37:59.680 --> 38:00.680
Thanks.

38:00.680 --> 38:01.680
Yeah.

38:01.680 --> 38:05.040
So Vulkan, industry forged, and there's a lot to talk about here today.

38:05.040 --> 38:08.840
Before we go too far, if anybody in the Mamba Room has anything to add, just tag me in the

38:08.840 --> 38:09.840
chat room.

38:09.840 --> 38:10.840
Who is this?

38:10.840 --> 38:11.840
Is it VW?

38:11.840 --> 38:12.840
Who's got the...

38:12.840 --> 38:18.400
William, you might have a hot key active because I hear you from time to time.

38:18.400 --> 38:22.160
So Vulkan, it's a really big deal for a couple of reasons.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.880
First of all, today is the big launch day.

38:23.880 --> 38:27.680
1.0 is out, and I got to say, I'm pretty damn impressed.

38:27.680 --> 38:31.560
Intel, out of the gate, announces an open source driver ready to go.

38:31.560 --> 38:36.640
Nvidia, out of the gate, today has a Linux driver ready for you to go.

38:36.640 --> 38:37.640
AMD.

38:37.640 --> 38:38.640
Not quite.

38:38.640 --> 38:40.480
They're working on it though.

38:40.480 --> 38:41.480
They're gonna...

38:41.480 --> 38:45.000
They totally have a great video for you to watch, so that's cool.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.240
So we have a lot of support launching today.

38:48.240 --> 38:52.480
Wes, how do you feel about Vulkan?

38:52.480 --> 38:54.440
Do you feel like this is actually going to move the needle?

38:54.440 --> 38:56.840
Do you think the industry's gonna get behind Vulkan?

38:56.840 --> 39:02.960
They're gonna start writing games for Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS, maybe not iOS, Linux

39:02.960 --> 39:03.960
using the Vulkan API?

39:03.960 --> 39:05.520
Do you think it's actually gonna happen, Wes?

39:05.520 --> 39:07.720
I think the driver support is a very good first step.

39:07.720 --> 39:12.040
If we saw this spec released and it was a lot of staggered releases for drivers, I mean,

39:12.040 --> 39:14.520
maybe it's not perfect, but it's a long way.

39:14.520 --> 39:20.400
I think Vulkan fits in in kind of a complicated way into the ecosystem.

39:20.400 --> 39:23.600
You have OpenGL, and then you have Vulkan, which has some underlying stuff, but not everyone

39:23.600 --> 39:26.080
is gonna need or want to just use Vulkan.

39:26.080 --> 39:29.880
And then you already have DirectX 12, which is kind of a whole own ecosystem.

39:29.880 --> 39:33.520
So I think it's gonna be a long game, but it's a strong first step.

39:33.520 --> 39:34.520
Let's go to the number.

39:34.520 --> 39:37.520
So Gab, I see in there you say that your friend works with DirectX, and he's thinking about

39:37.520 --> 39:39.000
switching to Vulkan.

39:39.000 --> 39:40.680
Share that story with me.

39:40.680 --> 39:48.040
Yeah, I have this friend of mine, which is studying making game engines, and he's been

39:48.040 --> 39:54.040
using DirectX and Windows for a lot of time, basically because he says that OpenGL is not

39:54.040 --> 39:56.320
on par with DirectX.

39:56.320 --> 40:02.160
And he says this with pain because he likes and loves open source technologies, but he's

40:02.160 --> 40:08.080
kind of forced to use DirectX because it doesn't really want to bother with OpenGL.

40:08.080 --> 40:15.640
And when Vulkan was announced, he was like, me and him were going crazy about it because

40:15.640 --> 40:24.280
it opens literally, yeah, it opens literally a great new frontier because it works on every

40:24.280 --> 40:25.280
platform.

40:25.280 --> 40:32.480
The video you've shown shows Linux and Windows mainly, but it's bigger than that, though.

40:32.480 --> 40:33.480
Yeah, of course.

40:33.480 --> 40:34.480
The point, that's the point.

40:34.480 --> 40:39.640
You can run Vulkan game engines on Android, iOS, macOS, consoles.

40:39.640 --> 40:43.520
Save that thought because we're gonna get to that aspect of here in a second, but I

40:43.520 --> 40:46.080
want to stay with the Linux aspect for a second.

40:46.080 --> 40:49.400
Wimby, you predicted something regarding Vulkan.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.400
Remind me of that.

40:50.400 --> 40:51.400
Yeah.

40:51.400 --> 40:55.920
So on the Ubuntu podcast, we did our end of year predictions and my first one that Vulkan

40:55.920 --> 41:01.400
would be finalized and released in 2016, I actually said that the measures would be that

41:01.400 --> 41:07.640
Linux drivers will be released for Intel IGPs as open source, Nvidia via proprietary drivers

41:07.640 --> 41:11.160
and AMD via proprietary drivers.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.160
Well, that's about it.

41:12.160 --> 41:20.680
Steam would include support, yeah, but this is the kicker, that on equivalent hardware,

41:20.680 --> 41:23.720
Vulkan on Linux will outperform Windows 10.

41:23.720 --> 41:28.040
Now in that, do you mean immediately or do you think there's going to be a period of

41:28.040 --> 41:31.640
time where Vulkan's gonna have to sort of be optimized and they're gonna have to suss

41:31.640 --> 41:33.240
out how to write for it?

41:33.240 --> 41:34.240
In 2016.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.240
Okay, in 2016.

41:35.240 --> 41:41.480
So a game that is written for Vulkan that is available on Linux and Windows on equivalent

41:41.480 --> 41:44.680
hardware will run faster and more efficiently.

41:44.680 --> 41:50.200
See, the reason I ask you that is the folks that are making, what is it, Tremulous?

41:50.200 --> 41:51.200
I can't remember.

41:51.200 --> 41:55.760
There are, I have it linked in the show notes, there is a game developer already about to

41:55.760 --> 41:58.400
ship Vulkan support for their game, yeah, Talos.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.400
That's what it is.

41:59.400 --> 42:00.400
Well, I love that game.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.400
Yeah, Talos, thank you.

42:01.400 --> 42:05.320
They say, yep, they say our GPU-bound scenarios, ultra settings, resolution higher than full

42:05.320 --> 42:10.840
HD, you're gonna see lower performance with Vulkan, 20 to 30% lower.

42:10.840 --> 42:15.560
This is a work in progress and we are analyzing and optimizing performance to get to the bottom

42:15.560 --> 42:18.360
of this, as well as the rest of the people in the group.

42:18.360 --> 42:19.360
That's not too bad though.

42:19.360 --> 42:21.080
20% is not a ton.

42:21.080 --> 42:25.960
Right, but that does mean some interesting, like, headlines out of the gate for Vulkan,

42:25.960 --> 42:26.960
right?

42:26.960 --> 42:27.960
Yeah.

42:27.960 --> 42:28.960
Yeah.

42:28.960 --> 42:34.680
The most interesting thing is that this was sort of kickstarted from AMD's Mantle project.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.960
Yes, I agree, that is interesting.

42:36.960 --> 42:41.320
And AMD don't have a driver on Linux on the day of launch.

42:41.320 --> 42:42.320
It's hilarious, actually.

42:42.320 --> 42:43.320
AMD's like...

42:43.320 --> 42:44.320
Yeah, AMD's so open, guys.

42:44.320 --> 42:45.320
Pioneer of the tank.

42:45.320 --> 42:46.320
Guys, they're so open.

42:46.320 --> 42:47.320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:47.320 --> 42:54.520
You feel bad for them, because it must just be an engineering resource contention issue,

42:54.520 --> 42:55.520
but...

42:55.520 --> 42:57.440
I mean, they had to spend all that time making that sweet video.

42:57.440 --> 42:59.960
It's the same team.

42:59.960 --> 43:02.480
But it's like a bad joke just getting worse.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.480
Yeah, it is.

43:03.480 --> 43:07.040
AMD's drivers are always behind and they can't even keep up with their own technology.

43:07.040 --> 43:09.760
It's just like, God.

43:09.760 --> 43:13.340
So NorthRanger, I'm curious about your assertion here.

43:13.340 --> 43:18.880
You think that this might catch Microsoft overreaching, go into detail there.

43:18.880 --> 43:27.920
Yeah, I think Vulkan's in an interesting position in that it can be promoted as the cross-platform

43:27.920 --> 43:34.560
solution, whereas Microsoft is going out on a limb and saying, if you want DirectX 12,

43:34.560 --> 43:39.600
you want that same level of access to your GPU hardware, you're going to have to go to

43:39.600 --> 43:40.600
Windows 10.

43:40.600 --> 43:41.600
Right, right.

43:41.600 --> 43:44.760
And if they're offering upgrades for free, they're still going to keep pushing and pushing

43:44.760 --> 43:46.680
and pushing.

43:46.680 --> 43:49.480
And that may be a little overextension on their part.

43:49.480 --> 43:54.640
And here's why I think it can't really long-term work that well for Redmond, is it's bigger

43:54.640 --> 43:56.100
than x86.

43:56.100 --> 43:58.440
It's way bigger than x86, right?

43:58.440 --> 44:03.040
This video I'm playing right here is a Vulkan demo running on a Mali GPU, which is an ARM-based

44:03.040 --> 44:04.040
GPU.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.340
Now, Vulkan isn't necessarily about improved graphics.

44:06.340 --> 44:13.600
It's a graphics API, but it is about having a uniform cross-platform graphics API.

44:13.600 --> 44:19.880
And the fact that we already have working code on Mali CPUs, or Intel's GPUs, I guess

44:19.880 --> 44:25.080
I should say GPUs, and also on Nvidia, that's a big deal.

44:25.080 --> 44:31.800
But from what I've been reading, it's actually even a bigger deal on ARM GPUs, because Vulkan

44:31.800 --> 44:38.000
has some specific stuff in it for memory management that didn't exist before in OpenGL that makes

44:38.000 --> 44:41.560
gaming performance on ARM CPUs much faster.

44:41.560 --> 44:45.800
Essentially, there's a lot less back and forth between the CPU and the memory bus and the

44:45.800 --> 44:46.800
assets.

44:46.800 --> 44:50.640
And instead, the stuff goes into the GPU, it knows what memory buffers it needs to access

44:50.640 --> 44:54.600
in the GPU, and it doesn't have to keep referring back to the source material.

44:54.600 --> 44:59.000
And on traditional GPUs, that's not as big of a performance hit.

44:59.000 --> 45:03.720
But on ARM GPUs, because they don't have as much overhead, it is noticeably a big difference.

45:03.720 --> 45:08.880
And so Vulkan might actually improve performance on ARM GPUs.

45:08.880 --> 45:12.320
And if that's the case, you're going to have Android, which is huge, right?

45:12.320 --> 45:15.320
That could go from zero to a huge deployment real quick.

45:15.320 --> 45:19.680
Then you've got the fact that you can deploy it on Windows machines and on Steam OS, aka

45:19.680 --> 45:20.680
Linux.

45:20.680 --> 45:23.000
That might just be what tips it right there.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.680
So the ARM stuff is, you can't underestimate how big of a deal it is.

45:26.680 --> 45:28.560
This is not a Linux-specific technology.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.880
And that's where our strength lies.

45:30.880 --> 45:35.040
Even if not all the code out there is for Linux first.

45:35.040 --> 45:42.240
And then, if that wasn't enough, the sprinkles on top, Qt is working on Vulkan support directly

45:42.240 --> 45:43.240
in the Qt framework.

45:43.240 --> 45:44.240
Whoa.

45:44.240 --> 45:45.240
Yeah, they've announced that today.

45:45.240 --> 45:49.240
The Qt company has joined the Kronos Group to be alongside many other companies supporting

45:49.240 --> 45:51.840
cross-platform industry-backed APIs.

45:51.840 --> 45:52.840
Huge deal.

45:52.840 --> 45:53.840
Huge deal.

45:53.840 --> 45:57.320
That's just more support right in their corner.

45:57.320 --> 45:58.320
Man.

45:58.320 --> 45:59.320
Here we are.

45:59.320 --> 46:05.240
You've got Qt announcing support, NVIDIA shipping a driver, Intel, by the way, announces their

46:05.240 --> 46:09.280
support on the Mesa mailing list.

46:09.280 --> 46:12.680
As part of the open-source community, Intel announces their support.

46:12.680 --> 46:13.680
Here's the source code.

46:13.680 --> 46:16.160
AMD's like, yeah, we're going to get there, bro.

46:16.160 --> 46:19.380
But a lot of companies are totally behind it.

46:19.380 --> 46:24.400
This is a Class A, well-done, non-botched launch, everybody.

46:24.400 --> 46:25.400
Congratulations.

46:25.400 --> 46:29.240
We're witnessing what it looks like when an industry-backed standard is launched and they

46:29.240 --> 46:32.840
actually do it successfully in a way that's going to build positive momentum.

46:32.840 --> 46:35.760
We don't get to witness this very often, so you might not be recognizing it first.

46:35.760 --> 46:36.760
I understand.

46:36.760 --> 46:37.760
And it's still going to take a while.

46:37.760 --> 46:38.760
It's rare.

46:38.760 --> 46:39.760
Yes, exactly.

46:39.760 --> 46:40.760
It's a ways off.

46:40.760 --> 46:42.880
It's a slow-moving thing, but this is a really good story.

46:42.880 --> 46:50.200
But these SOBs over at the Kronos Group managed to launch 1.0, and they got all of these

46:50.200 --> 46:53.400
lax-a-doodle companies to somehow work together with them.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.040
All with various different interests.

46:55.040 --> 46:56.040
Yes.

46:56.040 --> 46:58.480
And actually, I'll make their announcements on day one.

46:58.480 --> 47:04.160
If you were watching Reddit or Hacker News today, it was awash in Vulkan news.

47:04.160 --> 47:08.400
Their hashtag Vulkan API or something like that on Twitter was actually trending for

47:08.400 --> 47:09.480
a short period.

47:09.480 --> 47:13.480
My point is, they managed not to screw it up, everybody.

47:13.480 --> 47:15.240
They actually managed not to screw it up.

47:15.240 --> 47:18.200
And it actually looks like it could have some momentum.

47:18.200 --> 47:21.360
And the beauty is, Linux just is along for the ride.

47:21.360 --> 47:22.360
Right?

47:22.360 --> 47:23.360
First class.

47:23.360 --> 47:24.360
Just, damn.

47:24.360 --> 47:25.360
I'm stoked about that.

47:25.360 --> 47:26.360
Yeah, it is huge.

47:26.360 --> 47:30.000
I think it's one of the biggest things to happen to Linux this year, but we just won't

47:30.000 --> 47:31.920
see the results for a year or two.

47:31.920 --> 47:34.200
In two years, we'll be really, really pleased with all this.

47:34.200 --> 47:37.880
Now, we just get to sit back and watch all these green-blooded graphics.

47:37.880 --> 47:43.160
Someday, we'll be running Sweet Wayland on Vulkan hardware that's going to be great.

47:43.160 --> 47:50.920
With my Vulkan GPU-accelerated Mate desktop on Ubuntu 16.10.

47:50.920 --> 47:53.040
Or maybe it's going to be 17.04.

47:53.040 --> 47:54.920
I'm not so sure.

47:54.920 --> 47:59.720
But you know, the great thing is, too, is that our friends over at Valve have a particular

47:59.720 --> 48:00.880
interest in this.

48:00.880 --> 48:04.640
So they're watching this as well and moving it forward for the Linux side.

48:04.640 --> 48:05.780
They're working with Steam developers.

48:05.780 --> 48:07.480
I've got links about that in the show notes.

48:07.480 --> 48:08.640
So there's a lot going on here.

48:08.640 --> 48:09.640
Yeah, there is.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.520
This is a big day.

48:11.520 --> 48:12.600
Mark it on your calendars, everybody.

48:12.600 --> 48:14.560
The day Vulkan was born.

48:14.560 --> 48:16.480
And it's not the Mr. Spock variety.

48:16.480 --> 48:19.000
So we've got lots of links for you guys to go check out in the show notes, if you're

48:19.000 --> 48:20.000
curious.

48:20.000 --> 48:22.360
Including the Vulkan decision tree.

48:22.360 --> 48:23.360
Did you see that?

48:23.360 --> 48:24.360
Yeah, I sure did.

48:24.360 --> 48:25.360
This is a fun graph.

48:25.360 --> 48:26.360
That's good, right?

48:26.360 --> 48:28.880
It will answer all your Vulkan-related deployment questions.

48:28.880 --> 48:33.640
Also because we could literally spend multiple episodes on this, and that would bore everyone

48:33.640 --> 48:34.640
to death.

48:34.640 --> 48:39.800
I'm just going to link you to a webinar the Kronos Group is doing on February 18th, a

48:39.800 --> 48:43.640
couple of days from now, 9 a.m. Pacific time.

48:43.640 --> 48:45.080
It's a webinar that's free.

48:45.080 --> 48:46.480
The link is just in the show notes.

48:46.480 --> 48:47.480
You should go sign up.

48:47.480 --> 48:48.600
What's Vulkan about?

48:48.600 --> 48:49.600
Learn about it.

48:49.600 --> 48:51.880
Learn about the API, the people who've been creating it.

48:51.880 --> 48:52.880
It's a one-hour session.

48:52.880 --> 48:53.880
They're going to talk about the API.

48:53.880 --> 48:58.200
They're going to go into details about the SDK and have a Q&A session.

48:58.200 --> 49:01.800
So if you want to, you can attend that and ask questions.

49:01.800 --> 49:04.420
If you don't want to, save that link.

49:04.420 --> 49:08.480
And after their webinar is done, they're going to post the video at the same URL.

49:08.480 --> 49:11.240
So depending on when you're listening to this, you can either attend the webinar or you can

49:11.240 --> 49:13.400
watch the webinar, a one-hour webinar.

49:13.400 --> 49:19.720
More details about Vulkan, the Kronos Vulkan working group chair is going to be there.

49:19.720 --> 49:24.840
The spec editor is going to be there, and also two of the SDK technical leads will be

49:24.840 --> 49:26.520
in the webinar.

49:26.520 --> 49:29.960
So they're obviously going to be way better positioned to talk about it.

49:29.960 --> 49:30.960
Yeah, don't ask us.

49:30.960 --> 49:31.960
Yeah, exactly.

49:31.960 --> 49:32.960
So we've got that linked up there.

49:32.960 --> 49:35.560
I might try to attend that one or at least watch the results.

49:35.560 --> 49:41.000
But I feel like this is, even if you're not a gamer, this is a big deal.

49:41.000 --> 49:46.520
I feel like because with Qt integrating it and all of that, this is the kind of thing

49:46.520 --> 49:50.120
that I've been wanting to see for a long, long time.

49:50.120 --> 49:51.120
And I don't know.

49:51.120 --> 49:53.520
Does anybody in the Mumber Room want to cast a doubt?

49:53.520 --> 49:54.520
Anybody want to play devil's advocate?

49:54.520 --> 49:56.040
Because I'm riding the hype train right now.

49:56.040 --> 49:57.040
I'm very excited about that.

49:57.040 --> 49:59.720
This is the happiest I've seen Chris in a long time.

49:59.720 --> 50:00.720
Yeah.

50:00.720 --> 50:01.720
Well, yeah, that's true.

50:01.720 --> 50:04.000
I do like me the Vulcans.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.200
I can't help it.

50:05.200 --> 50:10.080
Yeah, so in the show notes, we have links to basically all the software downloads that

50:10.080 --> 50:13.400
are available for Linux right now if you want to check it out.

50:13.400 --> 50:14.400
Hmm.

50:14.400 --> 50:15.400
Hmm.

50:15.400 --> 50:16.400
Hmm.

50:16.400 --> 50:17.400
Pretty exciting.

50:17.400 --> 50:18.400
Pretty exciting.

50:18.400 --> 50:19.400
Pretty exciting.

50:19.400 --> 50:20.400
Pretty exciting.

50:20.400 --> 50:21.400
Pretty exciting.

50:21.400 --> 50:22.400
Pretty exciting.

50:22.400 --> 50:23.400
Pretty exciting.

50:23.400 --> 50:24.400
Pretty exciting.

50:24.400 --> 50:25.400
Pretty exciting.

50:25.400 --> 50:26.400
Alright, we gotta talk about the purism.

50:26.400 --> 50:27.400
We got the Liebroom 15.

50:27.400 --> 50:28.400
Hmm.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.400
The one and only.

50:29.400 --> 50:30.400
Here, Wes.

50:30.400 --> 50:31.400
You know what I'm gonna do?

50:31.400 --> 50:32.400
You know what I'm gonna do?

50:32.400 --> 50:33.400
I'm gonna talk about Linux Academy for a moment.

50:33.400 --> 50:34.400
Ooh.

50:34.400 --> 50:35.400
And while I talk about Linux Academy, I got a job for you.

50:35.400 --> 50:36.400
Okay, yeah.

50:36.400 --> 50:39.040
I want you to hold this Liebroom in your hands and I want you to identify the number one

50:39.040 --> 50:43.460
thing that's wrong with me, that I have wrong with it, just by the external appearance.

50:43.460 --> 50:44.540
You don't have to crack it open.

50:44.540 --> 50:45.540
Okay.

50:45.540 --> 50:49.480
observe the external appearance of the machine and identify, and don't say till after the

50:49.480 --> 50:52.960
Linux Academy read, but identify what it is, the number one thing that upsets me.

50:52.960 --> 50:55.140
All right, so now I'll tell you about Linux Academy.

50:55.140 --> 50:57.440
Go to LinuxAcademy.com slash unplug.

50:57.440 --> 51:00.280
You go there, you visit, it supports the show, lets them know you heard about it here.

51:00.280 --> 51:03.040
It's basic, it's obvious, but here it gets even better.

51:03.040 --> 51:06.760
You also get a great discount if you want to sign up for the Linux Academy, and man,

51:06.760 --> 51:07.760
is this a great service.

51:07.760 --> 51:11.880
Linux Academy is a platform built for Linux users and enthusiasts by Linux users and enthusiasts

51:11.880 --> 51:14.200
about all of the technologies around Linux.

51:14.200 --> 51:18.200
Unlike those BS other online services that say, oh, we'll teach you how to use Apache,

51:18.200 --> 51:23.080
and then it's like one of many courses including how to fix the sync when it leaks, how to

51:23.080 --> 51:26.440
use Adobe After Effects, like all these other things that are totally unrelated because

51:26.440 --> 51:29.520
they just want to have as many courses as possible.

51:29.520 --> 51:31.520
That's not Linux Academy's approach at all.

51:31.520 --> 51:35.760
Linux Academy has step-by-step video courses, downloadable comprehensive study guides, instructor

51:35.760 --> 51:37.840
help is available on demand.

51:37.840 --> 51:40.520
You can choose from seven plus distributions.

51:40.520 --> 51:42.440
It'll automatically adjust the courseware.

51:42.440 --> 51:45.080
There's over 2,300 video courses.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.720
You can keep track of your progress as it goes along.

51:46.720 --> 51:52.840
It breaks down hard, unbelievable concepts into hours that you can grok and you can actually

51:52.840 --> 51:53.900
execute on.

51:53.900 --> 51:56.600
They have courseware available that'll automatically adjust to your availability.

51:56.600 --> 51:58.260
They're always doing updates.

51:58.260 --> 52:01.340
That's why you have a subscription, and it is worth it.

52:01.340 --> 52:02.340
They have live streams.

52:02.340 --> 52:06.640
They're making available offline even if you can't attend live, and they constantly have

52:06.640 --> 52:09.480
new scenarios they're putting out there to give you a hands-on experience.

52:09.480 --> 52:11.340
They have graded server exercises.

52:11.340 --> 52:16.560
They get you ready to go out and actually test, to actually do the work, and if nothing

52:16.560 --> 52:22.040
else, they give you the ability to actually work with different types of technologies

52:22.040 --> 52:28.400
and maybe see what you find interesting, see what challenges you, linuxacademy.com slash

52:28.400 --> 52:29.400
unplugged.

52:29.400 --> 52:32.840
If you've ever had to get into AWS, I would invite you to go try out their courseware

52:32.840 --> 52:33.840
on it.

52:33.840 --> 52:39.200
Instructor mentoring, a great community stacked full of Jupyter Broadcasting members and updates

52:39.200 --> 52:40.200
all the time.

52:40.200 --> 52:45.400
They really put a lot of effort into revitalizing older content so it stays current.

52:45.400 --> 52:48.260
They watch the trends in Linux to see what they should do courses on.

52:48.260 --> 52:50.180
It's a great system.

52:50.180 --> 52:54.280
Go check them out at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, and a big thanks to Linux Academy

52:54.280 --> 53:00.000
for sponsoring the Unplugged program, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

53:00.000 --> 53:03.160
Okay, Wes, you had some time to, you know.

53:03.160 --> 53:04.160
Yes, I did.

53:04.160 --> 53:05.720
You know, it's a nice-looking laptop.

53:05.720 --> 53:06.720
It is.

53:06.720 --> 53:07.720
It feels good in the hand.

53:07.720 --> 53:08.720
Yeah, it's not too heavy.

53:08.720 --> 53:09.720
It's reasonably well-balanced.

53:09.720 --> 53:10.720
It's just metal.

53:10.720 --> 53:11.720
So that's kind of cool.

53:11.720 --> 53:13.680
You don't see that every day on a Linux laptop.

53:13.680 --> 53:18.000
So what is missing, as far as I'm concerned, on the Librem 15?

53:18.000 --> 53:20.640
I will say there are some sharp edges on this thing.

53:20.640 --> 53:21.640
That's true.

53:21.640 --> 53:22.640
That's true.

53:22.640 --> 53:23.640
That is true.

53:23.640 --> 53:27.600
There's something missing, though, that's a pretty big deal to me.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.880
Can you guess what it is?

53:29.880 --> 53:31.720
You're looking in the right area right now.

53:31.720 --> 53:32.720
You're warm.

53:32.720 --> 53:33.720
You're real warm, Wes.

53:33.720 --> 53:34.720
You're real warm.

53:34.720 --> 53:38.400
Well, there's no CD drive, but I don't think that's what you want.

53:38.400 --> 53:39.400
You're right.

53:39.400 --> 53:40.400
It's got SD card.

53:40.400 --> 53:41.400
It's got USB.

53:41.400 --> 53:42.400
It's got a DC in.

53:42.400 --> 53:43.400
That's important.

53:43.400 --> 53:44.400
That is important.

53:44.400 --> 53:46.760
It's got some seemingly mysteriously unlabeled switches.

53:46.760 --> 53:48.040
Yes, it does.

53:48.040 --> 53:49.040
Unlabeled switches, hardware switches.

53:49.040 --> 53:50.040
It's got HDMI.

53:50.040 --> 53:51.040
Yeah.

53:51.040 --> 53:52.040
Hmm.

53:52.040 --> 53:53.040
I don't know.

53:53.040 --> 53:55.960
There's one port that's not there that's pretty important to me.

53:55.960 --> 53:56.960
Ethernet.

53:56.960 --> 53:57.960
Oh!

53:57.960 --> 53:58.960
Yeah.

53:58.960 --> 54:02.920
Yeah, there's no Ethernet, and the one I backed specifically did list Ethernet.

54:02.920 --> 54:04.440
That's a bummer.

54:04.440 --> 54:09.160
It was one of those, like, little RJ-45 drop-down ports that, like, is a half-port that you

54:09.160 --> 54:10.160
have to, like, pry open.

54:10.160 --> 54:11.960
Pry open before you can actually use it.

54:11.960 --> 54:15.640
But in the crowdfunding version, it did list Ethernet.

54:15.640 --> 54:22.240
I don't like being live on the air and relying on Wi-Fi, so that was a bit of a bummer.

54:22.240 --> 54:28.060
It was the version I got, the edition I got, no Ethernet, and I've tried to track down

54:28.060 --> 54:31.880
when the Ethernet kind of disappeared, if it was the switch to Rev2 or not, but the

54:31.880 --> 54:35.240
initial report of Rev2, it would have Ethernet, and then there was another post where it doesn't

54:35.240 --> 54:36.800
have a few links in the show notes.

54:36.800 --> 54:39.520
So I was a little, I, you know, I...

54:39.520 --> 54:42.720
You'd have to probably use, like, a USB 3 adapter or something.

54:42.720 --> 54:45.520
Yeah, and it's one of those things where I, the only reason why I kind of mention it is

54:45.520 --> 54:49.040
because I wouldn't have bought it if it didn't have Ethernet, because Ethernet's actually

54:49.040 --> 54:50.040
a pretty big deal to me.

54:50.040 --> 54:52.040
I actually like gigabit speeds, not 802.11.

54:52.040 --> 54:54.640
And you want low latency for studio stuff, anyway.

54:54.640 --> 54:55.640
Yeah, exactly.

54:55.640 --> 55:02.080
So that was sort of my first impression, but outside of that, the metal coloring, like,

55:02.080 --> 55:03.080
this is not a small thing.

55:03.080 --> 55:04.080
Like, they nailed this.

55:04.080 --> 55:06.320
This looks, mine is not the dark metal.

55:06.320 --> 55:08.440
Mine is, like, an exact, looks like a MacBook.

55:08.440 --> 55:09.440
It really does.

55:09.440 --> 55:10.440
Yeah.

55:10.440 --> 55:11.440
Metal.

55:11.440 --> 55:12.440
Which is pretty cool.

55:12.440 --> 55:14.440
Yeah, it's not a bad looking machine at all.

55:14.440 --> 55:19.520
Couple other things, just first impressions that jumped out at me, is the version I looked

55:19.520 --> 55:26.700
at online, they had, and let's see if I can pull it up here for you, scrolling, scrolling,

55:26.700 --> 55:30.640
they show, there it is, there it is.

55:30.640 --> 55:35.520
They show what they call the purism key, which is the super key, which is where the Windows

55:35.520 --> 55:36.520
key is.

55:36.520 --> 55:37.520
To make sure everything's pure.

55:37.520 --> 55:40.480
I'm gonna go ahead and open the laptop up, which will wake it up, so you may start hearing

55:40.480 --> 55:41.480
it.

55:41.480 --> 55:42.480
Bum, bum, bum, bum.

55:42.480 --> 55:46.560
Wes, if you could just take a look at the keyboard, what does that look like?

55:46.560 --> 55:47.560
What key?

55:47.560 --> 55:49.960
Does that super key to you look like a square to you, or does that look like a Windows key

55:49.960 --> 55:50.960
to you?

55:50.960 --> 55:52.640
No, that looks like the Windows logo, Chris.

55:52.640 --> 55:53.640
Yes.

55:53.640 --> 55:54.640
So I was a little surprised at the keyboard.

55:54.640 --> 55:56.360
Are you running Windows on there?

55:56.360 --> 55:57.360
Did it come with Windows?

55:57.360 --> 55:58.360
No.

55:58.360 --> 55:59.360
Hmm.

55:59.360 --> 56:00.360
No.

56:00.360 --> 56:01.360
I was a little surprised that the keyboard had a Windows key.

56:01.360 --> 56:02.360
Not a big deal, but I was expecting the hardware.

56:02.360 --> 56:04.720
That's another, you're gonna have to get one of those little penguin stickers.

56:04.720 --> 56:05.720
Yeah, yeah.

56:05.720 --> 56:11.200
The other thing that's challenging about this is the specs that they list online do not

56:11.200 --> 56:15.800
match the specs that I was shipped, because I got an older model.

56:15.800 --> 56:18.720
And the main thing that's really jumping out at me about this one, I don't know if you

56:18.720 --> 56:19.720
can hear it, Wes.

56:19.720 --> 56:20.720
What's that?

56:20.720 --> 56:21.720
Is it windy in the studio, Chris?

56:21.720 --> 56:22.720
No, Wes.

56:22.720 --> 56:27.080
I've woken the laptop up, and so it is, that's the sound it makes.

56:27.080 --> 56:31.720
And it's loud enough, Wes, that like you walk into a...

56:31.720 --> 56:32.720
What the heck is that?

56:32.720 --> 56:33.720
That's the laptop.

56:33.720 --> 56:34.720
That's the laptop.

56:34.720 --> 56:35.720
And I don't...

56:35.720 --> 56:38.920
I gotta tell you, you walk into a room and you can hear this thing.

56:38.920 --> 56:39.920
Yeah, definitely.

56:39.920 --> 56:40.920
I heard it when I walked into the studio this morning.

56:40.920 --> 56:43.920
In fact, I'm gonna put it to sleep again so the sound goes down.

56:43.920 --> 56:44.920
But it's very loud.

56:44.920 --> 56:46.480
Are you holding it up to the microphone and shaking it around?

56:46.480 --> 56:47.480
Close to it.

56:47.480 --> 56:48.480
No, no.

56:48.480 --> 56:49.480
It's...

56:49.480 --> 56:50.480
No, it's...

56:50.480 --> 56:51.480
My mouth is much closer than the fan.

56:51.480 --> 56:52.480
I now have it off.

56:52.480 --> 56:55.600
It's very quiet when it's off, so that's a weird noise.

56:55.600 --> 56:58.760
It sounds like what other laptops make when they're like totally maxed out.

56:58.760 --> 57:01.680
Well, it might be a little weird, because the gate is trying to specifically filter

57:01.680 --> 57:03.720
it out.

57:03.720 --> 57:05.360
Yeah.

57:05.360 --> 57:06.360
So that was...

57:06.360 --> 57:07.820
It sounds like you're rendering a video or something, but...

57:07.820 --> 57:11.600
So that sort of almost immediately eliminates it for production use.

57:11.600 --> 57:15.720
Wes, however, brought over a mini screwdriver kit, and I'm considering opening the bottom

57:15.720 --> 57:18.480
of it and seeing if I can replace the fan.

57:18.480 --> 57:19.480
It's not driver-controlled.

57:19.480 --> 57:20.480
At least take a look, you know.

57:20.480 --> 57:21.480
So here's what I tried to do.

57:21.480 --> 57:26.480
It ships with Purism OS, and I thought, and which is using Cinnamon for the desktop.

57:26.480 --> 57:29.520
And the nice thing about that is you can actually manage the trackpad.

57:29.520 --> 57:34.920
So I reloaded with Ubuntu 16.04 and, you know, did all the installation, set everything up.

57:34.920 --> 57:39.560
The only proprietary driver in use is the Intel microcode stuff.

57:39.560 --> 57:42.080
It's got a Broadwell Iris 6100 graphics.

57:42.080 --> 57:43.080
That sounds nice.

57:43.080 --> 57:45.960
Yeah, it's a three gigahertz processor.

57:45.960 --> 57:49.720
There is nothing you can do thermal management-wise about that fan.

57:49.720 --> 57:51.200
So I could not...

57:51.200 --> 57:52.480
There was no driver to load.

57:52.480 --> 57:54.400
There was no LM sensors command.

57:54.400 --> 57:55.400
There's nothing you can do.

57:55.400 --> 57:57.720
It is just hard set to full blast.

57:57.720 --> 57:59.520
It's wired just on maximum.

57:59.520 --> 58:02.200
You probably won't have any overheating problems.

58:02.200 --> 58:06.000
So my hope is I'm going to pull off the bottom and see if I can replace that fan or whatever.

58:06.000 --> 58:09.920
I mean, with integrated graphics and whatnot, I just can't imagine it needs to be running

58:09.920 --> 58:10.920
like that.

58:10.920 --> 58:15.480
Especially when you're not actively really doing it.

58:15.480 --> 58:16.680
Ah, thank you.

58:16.680 --> 58:22.920
So FreeBSDSA says the email from 42715 states that the RJ45 was removed from Rev2.

58:22.920 --> 58:23.920
Yeah.

58:23.920 --> 58:24.920
Yeah.

58:24.920 --> 58:25.920
Is there UFI settings for it?

58:25.920 --> 58:26.920
Perhaps.

58:26.920 --> 58:27.920
Yeah.

58:27.920 --> 58:28.920
Go ahead, Wim.

58:28.920 --> 58:29.920
You had a question regarding the fan noise.

58:29.920 --> 58:33.040
No, I've got a potential solution for fan noise.

58:33.040 --> 58:40.720
Though Entroware ran into this fan noise problem when they were working on the same line of

58:40.720 --> 58:50.240
machines and it's a bug in the firmware from the ODM and you may be able to work around

58:50.240 --> 58:57.760
this by holding the power down for like 10 seconds and hard powering off the machine

58:57.760 --> 59:02.560
and that may reset the system and the fans may correct themselves.

59:02.560 --> 59:03.560
Okay.

59:03.560 --> 59:04.560
So I'm holding it down right now.

59:04.560 --> 59:09.680
Of course, I just went to sleep when I did that, but it actually just turned off instantly.

59:09.680 --> 59:11.160
Yeah.

59:11.160 --> 59:13.240
Yeah.

59:13.240 --> 59:14.920
That I'm willing to play around with.

59:14.920 --> 59:15.920
That is...

59:15.920 --> 59:16.920
Yeah.

59:16.920 --> 59:17.920
That'd be great.

59:17.920 --> 59:18.920
I did go through the BIOS and look for like thermal management settings and stuff like

59:18.920 --> 59:19.920
that.

59:19.920 --> 59:21.880
There's a lot of stuff going on there.

59:21.880 --> 59:22.880
The trackpad.

59:22.880 --> 59:23.880
Let's talk about the trackpad.

59:23.880 --> 59:25.280
I've heard some interesting things about the trackpad online.

59:25.280 --> 59:26.280
It looks pretty big.

59:26.280 --> 59:27.280
All right.

59:27.280 --> 59:29.020
So I'm holding it down for 10 seconds.

59:29.020 --> 59:31.840
The problem is it instantly turns off and then nothing happens.

59:31.840 --> 59:32.840
The trackpad is big.

59:32.840 --> 59:34.060
It works well.

59:34.060 --> 59:38.340
The problem is both GNOME and Ubuntu by default, they just only allow you to scroll on the

59:38.340 --> 59:39.640
very small side here.

59:39.640 --> 59:40.640
Yes.

59:40.640 --> 59:41.640
Right.

59:41.640 --> 59:44.460
If you use Purism OS, it comes with Cinnamon and Cinnamon's mouse control panel settings

59:44.460 --> 59:47.880
allow you to actually change it to two-finger scrolling, which works better.

59:47.880 --> 59:49.000
Keyboard is pretty good.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.380
The escape key on mine is a little mushy.

59:51.380 --> 59:52.380
Doesn't always register.

59:52.380 --> 59:53.380
Mushy.

59:53.380 --> 59:54.380
Yeah.

59:54.380 --> 59:55.380
My escape key doesn't always register.

59:55.380 --> 59:59.400
So I sometimes have to hit escape twice, which means sometimes I have to hit it four times.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:00.960
So it's not awesome that way.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:04.400
But I'm holding it down for 10 seconds.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.720
Let's see what happens.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.720
Maybe grub.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.440
I'll keep it at grub so it doesn't boot.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.440
All right.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.680
So I should be about five seconds in.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:13.680
This thing's really loud.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:14.680
Yeah, it is.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:15.680
Okay.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:20.620
This might be like a workplace hazard.

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:21.620
Still running.

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:24.800
It hasn't turned off yet.

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.800
I don't know if it's going to turn off.

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.800
I feel like I've been holding it for like 20 seconds.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:31.800
Feels like it's been like 10 minutes.

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:37.600
Yeah, it's still going.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.000
I know Mike's listening.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.480
Mike, telegram me.

01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:42.520
There's something else we should be doing.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:43.520
Did it get quieter?

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.520
Is it quieter now?

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.520
I don't think so.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.920
Well, what I was expecting is the machine should go off and once it's off, you can then

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.760
power it on again and it may.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:52.760
It's not guaranteed.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:53.760
It may.

01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:54.760
All right.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:55.760
So I just let off and turn off the fans.

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.760
No.

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.760
Huh.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.760
Yeah.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.760
Yeah.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.480
Your GQ is loose.

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.120
So FreeBSDi, you have yours.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.560
What have been your initial impressions?

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.920
It's not a bad piece of hardware.

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:17.160
If I'd have seen it in the store before, backing it, I probably wouldn't have bought it.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:20.840
All in all, it is nice except for, like I said, the loose GQ.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.940
And of course, when I'm running something other than PROS, I have trackpad problems

01:01:24.940 --> 01:01:26.440
that I'm going to work on.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.440
Yeah.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.280
That's been my experience too.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.760
Performance, pretty darn good.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.120
Performance, you thought it's been pretty performant on yours?

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.600
Yeah, it performs really well.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:43.200
I've done some full screen flash movies on it with no problem.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.840
Now Wimpy, I guess sort of the trackpad has a bit of a rep.

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:50.440
You know a little bit about some of its tricks already.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.440
Yeah.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:58.960
There's no mainline Linux kernel support for the trackpad that's in the Librems.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:06.000
So there's been a few of us working on a driver for the BYD trackpad.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.160
And that's currently an out-of-tree patch.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:18.640
And what Purism are doing is shipping a bespoke kernel with PureOS, has the full touch gesture

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.360
support in PureOS.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:29.720
But if you install any other version of Linux, then it will revert to a PS2 mouse.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.280
Sense the weird scroll and stuff like that.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.720
So I have a kernel patch I can send you.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:36.720
Wow.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:37.720
Take it back like 10 years here.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:41.280
This is not why you buy a laptop dedicated for Linux though, you know?

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.560
No, this is the point.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:51.600
And the other thing is, you know when in the past you've talked about System76 don't just

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:56.000
take the ODM equipment and stick their badge on it and ship it out the door.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.200
They actually work on firmware and BIOS enhancements and all the rest of it and get bespoke changes.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.200
Right.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.200
Yeah.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:11.640
So this is the same sort of thing that Entroware have done and they've overcome some of these

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:16.960
issues that you're discussing now, like the fan for example.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.680
And that doesn't seem to have happened here.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:26.040
So here's the rig I got, 8 gigabytes of RAM, 500 gigabyte SSD, which I paid a little extra

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.040
for.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.480
It's supposed to have a CD-ROM and DVD.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.920
It does not, which I don't care about.

01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:31.920
No big deal.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:40.200
I'm looking at the specs I bought on Indiegogo, it is listed as having a CD and DVD-ROM.

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:45.800
It also ships with like a 65 watt adapter, which I'm not sure is actually enough.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:46.800
It takes a while to charge.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:48.920
The nice thing is that's kind of small.

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:57.920
I paid for a core, this is a 3 gigahertz Broadwell CPU, Iris 6100 graphics, 8 gigabytes of RAM,

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:04.680
I would have preferred 16, 8 gigabytes of RAM, 1920 by 1080 display.

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.720
I paid $1,824 for this machine.

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.240
If I was going to spend $1,800 on a machine today, you could guarantee it's going to come

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.640
with Skylake.

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.640
You could guarantee.

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:22.040
Probably at least 16, with the RAM.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:24.520
Maybe dedicated graphics at $1,800.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.120
You might get that too.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:29.920
Now is it going to be something that has hardware switches for a webcam?

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.640
Is it going to have something that has hardware switches for the mic and stuff like that?

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:35.080
I actually do really like that.

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:39.320
I also like the idea of supporting a company who is pushing the conversation about privacy

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:44.600
and security forward and it's their primary leading cause.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:48.280
Those are things that my money went towards that I still like.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.960
Basically where I'm at right now with this thing, it has a strange USB-C port that I

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.960
wasn't expecting.

01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:53.960
Yes, I saw that.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.960
That's interesting.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.960
I don't know.

01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:57.280
It didn't come with any documentation.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.280
It just came naked.

01:04:58.280 --> 01:04:59.280
So there's no manual.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.280
There's no...

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:01.280
Naked in the box.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.960
And it's a very generic box.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:07.240
In fact, when I got the box, I immediately started to feel like, oh no.

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:11.560
I immediately started to feel like it was starting to set my expectations low because

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:12.560
the box was used.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.560
The finished kind of thing.

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:21.360
It had like five or ten other FedEx stickers on it and there was not even like a brochure

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.360
in the box.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.360
Right?

01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.360
It was no documentation.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:25.360
Nothing.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360
It was just backing our project.

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.360
Sorry it took so long.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.360
Nothing.

01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:32.320
And so that sort of was like, eh, I'm a little worried about that.

01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:35.520
That all aside though, one of the things I would have liked to have in the box is what

01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.640
is this USB-C port?

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.760
Because the one I backed doesn't have this port.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:42.520
The one I backed, where this port's at, was an Ethernet port.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.520
And is this USB-C?

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520
Can I charge the device with this?

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:45.520
Because it hasn't...

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.520
Is it real USB-C?

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.520
It's USB-C with an electricity bolt.

01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:51.000
Does that mean I can actually draw power from that port?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.640
What does that do?

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.640
I got nothing.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:58.360
Also, there's questions if this is actually HDMI 2.0 or not.

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:02.120
I'm not sure about that.

01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.120
Those are issues.

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.600
Have you tried the SD card slot?

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:05.600
No.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.240
But I think the other thing I like is it looks like perhaps that's a physical switch for

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.240
the SD card slot.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.240
Oh, wow.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.240
Perhaps physically turn it off.

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.280
I'm not sure.

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:16.560
If I could get this fan replaced, this is a pretty...

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.360
The thing I do like about this is it is a damn unique one-off laptop.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.360
Yes, it is.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.360
And it is...

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.360
It looks pretty special, whatever you are with it.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.520
It's a great showcase for a lot of really good stickers because it's completely unbranded

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.520
all over.

01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520
It really draws your eye.

01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.320
There's no big Mac logo or Dell logo.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.320
No Intel sticker.

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.320
No nothing.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:35.960
In fact, the only sticker on it, on the bottom, is a UPC barcode, a small one.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.440
And other than that, it is untouched.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.600
It is a metal housing that is untouched.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.940
It feels good in the hand.

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:44.280
It has that MacBook angular slope to it.

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.880
Yes, it does.

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:50.920
It's got one, two, three, four USB 3.0 ports plus the USB-C port.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:51.920
That's pretty good.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:52.920
It's like four times as many on that MacBook.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:58.680
It's got HDMI out, and it has headphones out, and it has an SD card slot reader.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:00.520
I like that.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:01.520
This could...

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:06.840
My XPS 13 doesn't have an HDMI port, or I'm sorry, it doesn't have an Ethernet port either.

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.160
If I can get this fan fixed, this could replace the XPS for me.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.160
But it can't...

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.080
I don't know if it can be a production machine without...

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:19.560
The lightning bolt by the Type-C port means it may support Thunderbolt, says North Ranger.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.560
Is that true, North?

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.560
Is that really a thing?

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:26.880
Yeah, a lot of vendors, especially if you have a Broadwell system, are using an Intel

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:35.960
add-on chip in the chipset that provides not only Type-C USB support, but also 40-gig Thunderbolt,

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.920
things like external graphics cards.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:38.920
That would be...

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.920
I was about to say that, yeah.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.920
If I could hook up...

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:46.360
See, that would make me feel a lot better if I could hook up a high-end Ethernet adapter

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.480
to that USB-C port.

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:51.120
Here's FreeBSA's.

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.760
He sent this to me when he got his.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.480
There he was listening to episode 131 of Unplugged, where we're like, where the hell is my laptop?

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.240
And there's his purism right there.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.160
What was your out-of-the-box experience like FreeBSD?

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:06.080
Was it the same kind of like rattle experience, or did you get some documentation, did you

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.080
get a nice...

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:09.200
What was your initial experience like?

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:13.280
Yeah, documentation, non-existent.

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.680
I haven't played with the hardware switches yet to figure out what they turn off, but

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.440
it would be nice if there was some information.

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:25.400
I even looked on the hard drive to see if there was documentation in the form of a PDF,

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:26.880
and I don't see anything on there.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:29.600
All right, so I'm turning it back on.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.600
I'm going to check...

01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.600
There's proof.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.600
Yeah.

01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:33.600
Wimpy wanted to know if...

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.880
Now, the BIOS, I want to give purism credit here.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:41.120
The BIOS is like, every setting you could ever want to tweak is available.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.120
That's cool.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:47.280
Some OEMs, basically all of them, they really kind of limit down the BIOS, and this one,

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:50.960
you can tweak everything from overclocking to everything.

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:55.760
So that being said, there's so much in here, it actually takes a little while to find stuff.

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:02.400
I'm looking through here right now, and I don't know if I see Bluetooth, chipset, security.

01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.400
Look at all this stuff, Wes.

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:04.400
I mean, look at all...

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.400
Wow.

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.400
And all of these have submenus to them, too.

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.240
Like, there's just a ton of stuff in here.

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:09.240
Yeah.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:13.520
What specifically are you looking for, Wimpy?

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:19.320
Does it have a Bluetooth device in it?

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.280
And the reason I'm asking you to look in the BIOS...

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:22.280
The BIOS?

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:25.840
Well, I believe it's a BIOS, isn't it?

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:26.840
Mm-hmm.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:27.840
Yeah, it has a BIOS.

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.840
Yeah.

01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:36.960
Is because I'm not sure if the Bluetooth device that's in the machine is supported by Linux,

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.800
so it may not go up.

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.800
Oh.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:40.800
I could...

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:44.120
Yeah, I don't see anything in the BIOS, but you know what I'll do is I'll boot into Antigros

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.040
Arch, which boots...

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.440
I mean, one thing, by the way, is once Linux is installed, this thing freaking flies.

01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:52.560
Like, it is nice to have a nice modern computer again.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.560
I tell you, it's been a while since I've had it.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:56.640
It looks like it got that Samsung SSD in there.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:09:58.280
And that thing is fast.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.280
So I'll see.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.280
I can log in right now, Wimpy.

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.280
It just boots that fast.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.280
I'm already booted.

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.280
I'm already in GNOME system settings.

01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.280
So I will take a...

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.280
Fucking yeah.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.000
It does look like it supports UEFI, right?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
It must support...

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Yeah, it does.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Actually, look at that.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.680
It is discovering the Bluetooth devices around me right now.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:14.680
So it must have Bluetooth.

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:15.680
Oh, right.

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:16.680
Okay, cool.

01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680
That works then.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680
That's great.

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.680
Yeah.

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.680
Cool.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:21.680
Yeah.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.200
That was something that they'd mentioned may not work at some point in the past.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.760
So they must have changed their...

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.920
You know, I haven't tried the webcam either.

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.040
Let me try the webcam real quick.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.480
Yeah, webcam works.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.480
Hey, look at that.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.480
It's me.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.480
Hey, look, Wes, there's you.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:35.480
See?

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:36.480
Well, it's me.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.480
Yeah, webcam.

01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:38.480
So the webcam works.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.480
That's good.

01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:40.480
It's a little slow.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.480
But I'm going to keep playing with it.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:46.640
I think my next big task is to see if I can alter that fan.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:49.280
And then on top of that, I'm going to just benchmark the shit out of this thing.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.280
Yeah.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.880
I mean, it's already going to sound super loud, so you might as well, you know, make

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:53.880
it do some work.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.880
Yeah.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.920
Well, it's funny how mentally in the back of my mind, I associate loud laptop with high

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.920
CPU usage.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:03.360
So like, after I've been working on this thing for about 20 minutes, I was sort of just,

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.280
you know, getting into the flow of things.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.160
And I remember thinking, I stopped my work phone and go, why is my computer working so

01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:09.160
hard?

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.160
No, it's just fine.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.160
It's fine.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.160
Yeah.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.320
So if anybody knows anything about the fan noise, I would, I would love to, I'd love

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.320
to hear you.

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.320
If you could get that solved.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.320
I mean.

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:18.320
Yeah.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.320
Yeah.

01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:20.320
But so I'm going to, but that side, I'm going to put that aside.

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.800
I'm going to keep working with it and see what kind of, what kind of things I can get

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:23.800
done with it.

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.560
So I, just to recap, I paid $1,800 for this thing.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.340
It did ship 286 days late.

01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:33.440
It was originally expected to ship on April 2015.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:36.960
I backed it in November of 2015, I believe.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.840
November 22nd, 2015, I believe was when I backed it.

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:40.840
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:41.840
2014.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.840
14, right.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:43.840
Sorry.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:51.680
I wouldn't necessarily buy it today, but that said, I think it would be interesting, like

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.720
I'm picturing bringing it to conferences and whatnot.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.720
Yeah.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:57.240
You would, you know, it might be a pretty good machine, especially if you can just a

01:11:57.240 --> 01:11:58.240
little quieter.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.160
And the feel in the hand is good.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.960
The hinge is good on the laptop screen.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.960
And it's nice to have something that feels like that.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.960
And it's not, oh, I bought a Mac book and I put Linux on it.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:10.520
It's like, this is something totally different.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.520
Yes, exactly.

01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:13.880
So that's exactly how I'm feeling right now about it.

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:14.880
So this is the Rev2.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.040
Oh, one more thing I wanted to show you, which I'm not super happy with.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:20.520
I'm going to talk more about this on last and I'll have visuals to show you guys.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:24.640
It does have a backlit keyboard and all of the FN keys work, but I want to show you what

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.400
the backlit keyboard looks like with.

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.360
Oh, hold on a second.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.360
It's not working.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.360
Oh, there you go.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.220
So that's the, so the keys are backlit, but the, the, the actual letters themselves are

01:12:33.220 --> 01:12:34.840
not translucent.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.880
So just there's light around the keys, but you can't actually seem like that would be

01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.120
that bright at night.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:42.480
It doesn't work because the keys themselves are black objects in the night and there's

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.200
just light around them.

01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:48.400
The keys have, there's basically an led light behind the keyboard, but the keys themselves.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.240
So if you were concerned about where the keyboard was, it would help you find that, but not

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:53.600
the individual keys.

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:54.600
Exactly.

01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:59.160
That's just a, you know, they were confused about that.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.160
Exactly.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.760
So if you ever need to find your keyboard, it can, it can do that pretty well, but you

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.520
can't find individual keys.

01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:13.440
So I guess the, at the end of the day, I would say if I was betting the farm on a laptop

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:19.360
right now and that was my machine, I could make it work, but I would be very disappointed.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.360
Chris.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360
Windows key.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360
I mean, all of that.

01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.360
Yeah.

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.360
Yeah.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:25.360
Go ahead.

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:30.260
Um, I, I don't know if this is because you're, you know, recording this and this is going

01:13:30.260 --> 01:13:36.040
out live and you know, uh, this will live forever on the internet or what, but I was

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:41.420
in your position, personally speaking, I would be somewhere on the barometer between mildly

01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:47.600
pissed off and incandescent with wrench about this because you didn't get what you paid

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.600
for.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.600
You paid a lot for it.

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:54.760
It came in a shitty box with no documentation and it's not up to par.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.480
I would be sending it back.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.640
I would be getting pretty pissed off and want to talk to someone about it.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:00.640
Yeah.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.640
I mean, I don't know.

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.440
You seem pretty, you're more chilled out than me clearly.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.000
Well, because when I, when I backed it, I knew it was a long shot and I backed it.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:11.240
I backed it for, I backed it for content because I wanted, I mean, I really liked the idea

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.400
of the ultimate Linux laptop.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.440
We always have, um, you're right.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:17.440
Linux suckers.

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:18.440
You're right.

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:22.100
Because that's somewhat of a unicorn, you know, and, and some companies, some very large

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.760
companies still don't get it a hundred percent right.

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:30.040
So it, yes, okay, it is somewhat surprising that a one man band can, can churn out something

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.760
better than a Dell, you know, Sputnik or, or system 76 or intro or whoever that would

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:36.760
be surprising.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:37.760
Yeah.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:41.880
But I still think they could have tried a bit harder.

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:42.880
Yeah.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:48.240
I mean, I really, I really want to be positive about this, but the, the, the honest truth

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:52.880
is, um, I guess the reason where it's a, where it's, I'm going to close the lid again cause

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.680
I really just can't stand the fan noise, uh, where, where, uh, where it falls down for

01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.200
me is it begins with Purism OS.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:05.240
Um, I bought this laptop to run Linux, not to run a specific distribution of Linux, and

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:06.560
that's a bit of a letdown.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.600
And so that's where my letdown begins.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:13.400
The fact that I also bought a rig with an RJ45 port and it doesn't have one is a bit

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:14.400
of a letdown.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:21.280
Um, there's that the, the, the issues around the fan, I mean, I, here I have an 1800 laptop

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:26.320
and my first order of business is break open the case and literally replace the fan with

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.120
something I buy off Newegg.

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.680
That's also not a great position to be in.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:36.400
Um, I look at it as a, like a, like a model kit car or like a, like a spec car or something

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.400
like that.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.400
Only it's a laptop.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.040
It's a spec computer and that's how I'm looking at it.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:45.440
And um, now my best hope is to make it usable.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.800
Uh, I think if, I think if there weren't other solutions out there, I'd be feeling pretty,

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:51.800
uh, desperate.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.160
I'd be feeling pretty bad right now.

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:57.400
But the fact that Entraware and System76 have solutions out there and Dell, I'm feeling

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.400
better about it.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.640
Plus this isn't your only computer.

01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:02.760
I mean, I realize, you know, you may have a bunch of old computers and some of them

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:05.960
are dedicated to other tasks, but this isn't your only computing device.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:11.480
I would imagine if you'd saved up your pennies and you know, you were a student and you know,

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.640
this was your one computing device, you might be a little bit more pissed.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.640
Oh man.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.880
I would be, I would be really, I would be up a creek right now.

01:16:18.880 --> 01:16:23.480
Now FreeBSDSA, um, okay.

01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:25.360
I thought it had NVIDIA graphics.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.280
So you remember that too, that it included NVIDIA graphics?

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:33.140
Oh yeah, it was, remember it was supposed to be for 2D, it was going to be the onboard

01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:37.200
Intel chipset, but for 3D it was going to be discrete graphics from NVIDIA.

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.920
I didn't think I'd buy a 15 inch laptop with integrated graphics.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:43.440
That's like, if I go integrated graphics, that's for my smaller form factor laptops.

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.800
When I go 15 inch and above, I'm expecting- That's a working machine.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:46.800
That's dedicated graphics.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:47.800
Yeah.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:48.800
I thought so.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:49.800
Oh.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:53.440
Do you remember the NVIDIA graphics issue?

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:59.680
Yeah, I remember that that was the original, you know, launch spec, but I think they got

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:06.040
a lot of negative feedback about how can this be a open source friendly laptop with NVIDIA

01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:11.240
chips and they went back on that and went with the Intel integrated instead.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:17.000
So if this Thunderbolt works, we can build you external housing that has a nice external

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.680
GPU and your ethernet port.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:20.680
Right, I'm good.

01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:21.680
I'm good then.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.840
I wonder if that really is Thunderbolt.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:29.720
My other question is if you do LSPCI, can you just tell us what the wifi card is and

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:31.720
what the Bluetooth card is?

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.360
I have that up on the screen right now if I can, let's see, I will, I will wake it back

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:36.360
up here.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.360
Okay.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:42.120
And Chris, Chris, while you're at it, I've also mentioned the LSPCI output for that Thunderbolt

01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:43.120
controller.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.840
Oh, clever boy, clever boy.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:46.840
All right.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:51.560
So we have a Broadwell U-host controller, let's see, audio devices, Intel Broadwell

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:57.560
U-audio controller, USB is the Wildcat XHC-i controller, communication controller for a

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.560
Wildcat point.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:00.560
Let's see, what are we looking for specifically?

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:03.440
Bluetooth and wifi.

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.440
Hmm.

01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:06.120
I don't actually...

01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:07.960
Bluetooth might be on the USB bus, of course.

01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:15.080
Yeah, I think it is because looking at LSPCI, I see an Ethereos AR9462 wireless network adapter.

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:16.080
Okay.

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:17.880
So there's our, there's our Ethereos wireless adapter.

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:19.680
Yep, that's the ATH9K driven.

01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.680
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:23.000
But I do not see the Bluetooth controller.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.000
Do you see that listed here, Wes?

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.000
No.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000
Yeah, I don't either.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:27.000
So yeah.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.760
Let's take a look, see if we can...

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:41.240
On the USB bus, I see, I see a light on Ethereos AR3012 Bluetooth controller.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:44.080
So AR3012 Bluetooth.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.800
And a Linux Foundation 2.0 root hub.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:46.800
Hey, how about that?

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:47.800
Ooh.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:48.800
Hey, how about that?

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.400
Everyone's favorite root hub.

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.400
Yeah.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:53.160
Yeah, exactly.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.400
And the CPU, just so that we have it all, I'll cat proc CPU info real quick and then

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:59.400
I'll shut it down again.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:01.920
CPU info.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:10.120
It is the, it is the Intel Core i7-557U running at 3.1 gigahertz.

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.400
And I'm closing the lid again because it's too loud.

01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:12.400
Is it only dual core?

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.400
It is, well, I think maybe the mobile is.

01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.160
But it says, I think it actually lists, it lists, I know, I just turned it off.

01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:21.960
It does list three CPUs, which if you count zero means four cores.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.840
So right, right, right, right?

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.840
If you count CPU, you know what I'm saying?

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:26.840
Yeah.

01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:27.840
Yeah.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.840
So let me bring it back up.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:29.840
I think it said three CPUs.

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:30.840
Yes.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:31.840
So it has four cores.

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:32.840
Okay.

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:33.840
Good.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.840
Yeah.

01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:40.080
I tell you what, I tell you what, the fan noise is really a killer for me.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.080
It really is too bad.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.080
All right.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:46.520
Any other, FreeBSD, any other thoughts on the, on your Libra before we wrap up the,

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.520
the session?

01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.400
No, not really.

01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.720
I'll have more as I really dig into it and play with it.

01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:53.720
Okay.

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:56.480
So it is two cores and it's just because it has Hypershred and the other, the other logical

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.480
cores.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:58.480
Yeah.

01:19:58.480 --> 01:19:59.800
I'll give you guys more on it too.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:01.920
I'm hoping to have more good things to report.

01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:05.920
Now I've got, so I've been primarily doing Ubuntu based OSs and now I've got Arch on

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:06.920
there.

01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:07.920
Do that for a couple of days.

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:08.920
You can try Korora.

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.920
Yeah.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:10.920
Try, install some Steam games.

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.920
See how those play.

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.080
See how it works from that perspective.

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.720
Actually getting work done.

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:19.240
You know, one thing that I have to admit, feels really good holding it.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.240
I'm holding it right now.

01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.400
It just feels good in my hand.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.480
It's really a good, a pretty good weight distribution.

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.480
Yeah.

01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.480
They really nailed that.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:30.120
The battery life real early, I'm getting so far and I've only done one, one full test

01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.960
about four and a half hours, but I, I don't have any optimization.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:34.840
I was going to say if you like power top or anything.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:35.840
Nope.

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:36.840
Nope.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.840
But I did turn the screen down to like 80% from a hundred, but other than that, no other

01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:44.180
tweaks, four and a half hours and I'm going to run it through a few more cycles.

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:45.180
It's interesting.

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:49.160
The different desktop distros, all are reading the battery differently for me.

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.160
Of course.

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.160
Yeah.

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.160
Purism reads it one way.

01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.160
It says seven hours.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:58.400
Ubuntu 16.04 gave me four hours and Arch said it's going to give me an hour and a half,

01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.400
even though it was way wrong.

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.400
Oh man.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.400
It was way wrong.

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:02.400
But yeah.

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.640
So each, each desktop I've installed has to give me completely different reads on how long

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.640
the battery is going to last.

01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:07.800
And the only way to really find out is you just got to run it for a while.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.800
So I have that in testing.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:13.160
If you have any questions, you can, uh, on, on linuxactionshow.reddit.com find episode

01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:17.400
132, ask your questions about the purism there, and I'll try to incorporate them into my review

01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:20.200
on a, on Sunday's episode of the Linux action show.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.360
Once you've really lived with it.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:23.360
Yeah.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:26.800
Once I get used to the track pad a little more and see if I can maybe install.

01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:31.160
You know, maybe if it's, if you won't have an editor, this is going to be an interesting

01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.200
Linux action show.

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:34.720
Maybe you should just use it as your, your show machine.

01:21:34.720 --> 01:21:35.720
Maybe, maybe.

01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:36.720
It'll be a loud show.

01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:37.720
We won't be able to hear you.

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:42.640
The audience won't be able to listen to the whole show, but, uh, I'll done it on a purism.

01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.640
Yeah.

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:44.640
Yeah.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:49.880
Well, I'm, I'm, I like the way the timing worked out because we got it right after we

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:51.000
covered it last week.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.960
And then, uh, I'm going to have a chance to actually really be fully like dedicated to

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:55.960
this.

01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:57.760
And then the entryware will show up and I'll try that for awhile.

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:00.000
So I think the timing is actually is pretty good.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.560
Um, and I'll, I'll give you guys an update.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:06.600
Um, I dunno, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm in process of deciding where I'm at.

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:08.080
I'm very happy to have it.

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:09.080
Yeah, definitely.

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.680
And if you have, if you've gotten yours out there, let me know how it's going.

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:12.680
Send us an email.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.880
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash contact.

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:21.280
You can send us in your feedback or linuxactionshow.reddit.com or you can always join us live.

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:22.800
Did you know the unplugged show is live, Wes?

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:23.800
Oh yeah.

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:24.800
It's a blast.

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:25.800
It's a big show.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:28.280
We, we've been having some big shows and the live contribution from our Mamba Room makes

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.280
all the difference.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:30.280
Go to jblive.tv.

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:33.520
We do the show 2 PM Pacific on a Tuesday.

01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:37.880
Go to jupitabroadcasting.com slash calendar to get that converted to your local time zone.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:38.880
What?

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:39.880
What are you laughing at?

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:40.880
What?

01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:41.880
What is it?

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:42.880
Specs on the, what?

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.120
Uh, thermal design at low noise.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.120
They say that on the site?

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.120
Low noise?

01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.120
Low fan noise?

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.120
It must be a firmware bug.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:49.120
It must be.

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:50.120
It must be.

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:51.120
We'll find out.

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:52.120
I dunno.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.120
I'll keep you guys updated.

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.480
Thanks for tuning this week's episode of Linux Unplugged and we'll see you right back here

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:11.880
next Tuesday.

01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:32.680
Aw, crap, Wes.

01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:34.880
What if I try out Windows and the fan noise stops?

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:35.880
Oh, you have to.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:36.880
Now you have to.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.440
No, I don't want to.

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:40.440
I'll install it for you.

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:43.040
Since Rekai will be gone, I know he normally does that.

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:44.040
The dirty deed for you.

01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:45.040
The dirty deed.

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:46.040
Yeah.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.040
I'll put Windows 10 on there.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:49.200
It'll be better than ever.

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:52.280
You could probably waste a whole weekend on this troubleshooting.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.280
I know.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.280
I know.

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:55.280
I know.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.280
That's why it's a Linux laptop.

01:23:56.280 --> 01:23:57.280
It gives you these little opportunities.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:27.120
It gives me something to do.
