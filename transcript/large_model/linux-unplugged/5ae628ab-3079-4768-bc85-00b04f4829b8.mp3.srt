00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 47 for July 1st, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,840
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's got all its updates applied

3
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,800
as it prepares to go offline and live in a cabin.

4
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,240
My name is Chris.

5
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
My name is Matt.

6
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
Hey Matt.

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,160
It is hot here now.

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,720
It's maybe not hot by like everybody's standards, but it's hot enough that we've got a brushfire

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,720
nearby.

10
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
I mean, that's hot, right?

11
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,720
Yeah, it's about 87 degrees in the studio today.

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,440
So it gets, and it gets wet.

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,560
It's like a wet hot, Matt.

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,580
It's like a humid kind of hot.

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,920
That's what makes it so miserable.

16
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,560
And of course I made my own predicament worse because I was barbecuing today.

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,780
So we had to close up all the windows in the studio because I didn't want to make the studio

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,960
smell like barbecue smoke.

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,960
And it was delicious.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
I'm not going to lie.

21
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,760
It turned out, Rekai gave me like, here is a bag full of burgers that I made.

22
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,000
Why don't you cook them all?

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,780
It was like, he threw down the gauntlet and I'm like, I'm going to cook all these burgers

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,580
before Linux Unplugged.

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,580
And I did it.

26
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,580
And it was delicious.

27
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,080
And we had copious amounts of bacon.

28
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,600
And I made, I took some of the, this is kind of gross, but I took some of the bacon grease

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
sauce.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,000
I took some of the, and made a sauce out of it with the barbecue.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It was just, it was just amazing all around, Matt.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's all I'm trying to say.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh my goodness.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So we got.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah, I kind of lucked out.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I pretty cool, pretty cool office.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh, nice.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Starting the show.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But it's still kind of warm.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So we got to just persevere.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,480
I'm glad you took, I'm glad you took a wise precautions.

42
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,920
I, on the other hand, was not so wise.

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
But that's okay.

44
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
We've got a good show.

45
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,240
We're going to follow up first and then we're going to cover a couple of items, a few updates

46
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,080
on some big news that's happened on stories that we've covered recently.

47
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,280
And then after that, we're going to announce a new community, we're going to call it the

48
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,220
Jupiter Colony Review Draft, where we're looking to expand our distribution reviews and cover

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,220
more distributions.

50
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,480
And we want to collate a group of folks out there that would like to get involved in reviewing

51
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,480
a distribution and perhaps come on our show via mumble and share their thoughts.

52
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,960
Now this isn't going to be necessarily an easy job because you're going to have to download

53
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,680
the distribution, try it out and note down your thoughts.

54
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,100
And then work with our team.

55
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,080
But we want to expand the distributions that we're able to cover.

56
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,320
And so we're going to talk more about that in today's show, including where you can sign

57
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,880
up and draft yourself to be in our Jupiter Colony Review panel.

58
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,720
We're going to talk about that a little bit.

59
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,420
But first, Matt, this is something that's been kicking around.

60
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,520
We talk about this a lot on the live stream.

61
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,200
We haven't talked a lot about it in a show for a while, but the audience might be familiar

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,880
that you and I have struggled with audio issues under KDE.

63
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,600
It's been a struggle to being calm.

64
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,240
Oh, yeah, that's that's being kind.

65
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,640
Yeah, you're right.

66
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,520
It's inexcusable because it's not just like one particular hardware setup.

67
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,800
It's multiple hardware setups.

68
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Right.

69
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Come on.

70
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,160
And I got to and I want to qualify that I want to completely back that statement up

71
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,560
to because I've tried it on multiple systems with USB sound cards, on board sound cards,

72
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,760
HDMI sound cards, you name it, different machines with NVIDIA, ATI, Intel, all the all the whole

73
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,880
stack has been laptops, desktops, all of it.

74
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,280
And I've had issues with switching my audio settings and things like that.

75
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,040
So WiggleWaffles wrote into the subreddit and said, in previous installs of KDE, I haven't

76
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,800
really had any troubles with phonon, especially running it on a VM.

77
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,480
But since I dedicated to switching from dual booting with Arch and Windows 8 instead of

78
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,280
running Arch in a VM, sound on KDE has been a nightmare.

79
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,640
It works in the most basic sense of the term, but hooking up headphones is spotty.

80
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,560
The volume buttons on the keyboard adjust the HDMI audio even when it's not plugged

81
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,560
in.

82
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,960
And it's reset to 100 percent every time I reboot, blowing out my eardrums whenever

83
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,600
I get an error message.

84
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,360
And then he goes on to ask if there's a way to overcome this.

85
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,200
And then the discussions didn't go the way they usually go.

86
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,600
Usually I see a ton of people saying, well, I run KDE and I never have a problem.

87
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,000
And then I just kind of check out because I'm like, OK, well, I know I've had it on

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,600
like a dozen systems, I've had these problems.

89
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,000
But actually, just about everybody in here sort of chimed in and said, yeah, I've had

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,480
some problems, definitely had some problems, you know, it's really bad, et cetera, et cetera.

91
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,740
There's something going on.

92
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,740
There's something going on.

93
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,720
I don't know if it's the way Phonon interacts with Pulse Audio.

94
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
I don't know.

95
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,840
It's exactly what it is, in my opinion, based on my experiences with it and actually experimenting

96
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,560
with it and just kind of troubleshooting, looking through the logs.

97
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,600
That's where the hang up is.

98
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,700
It's a one or it's either one or the other.

99
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,600
You don't do both, in my opinion.

100
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,060
OK, I have a suggestion because we can we can have a religious war about this or maybe

101
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,440
as a community, we could create a database of the hardware that people are trying it

102
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,960
on and the distributions and the versions of like Pulse and KDE and maybe we could come

103
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,600
up with some common threads and then as a group, we'd have something we could submit

104
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,160
as a bug report to the KDE folks so they could work on it.

105
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Sounds interesting.

106
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,540
So I don't know if people in the subreddit would be interested in that.

107
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,560
Maybe we could work together and all sort of come together and try to narrow this thing

108
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,680
down and submit a bug and maybe we can fix this for other people because it's it's one

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,000
of these functionalities that when it doesn't work, it's infuriating.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
It made me so frustrated because I got a new machine set up.

111
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,620
I got a brand new steam game and all I wanted to do was set my audio out to my speakers

112
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,600
and I probably spent two hours trying to make that work and I eventually gave up and it

113
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,840
made me just sit there and think, you know, why did I just do that?

114
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,240
I felt like I just wasted two hours of my life on something that shouldn't be a problem

115
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
at all.

116
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,900
And I think a lot of people have that experience and it can be very frustrating and it's something

117
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,280
I think if we all work together, instead of just banging our table about how upset it

118
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,400
makes us, maybe we can, as a group, figure out some commonalities.

119
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Like something like that.

120
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
What do you think?

121
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Yeah, it sounds interesting.

122
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Worth a try?

123
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Yeah, I think it's worth a try.

124
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,400
I'm skeptical.

125
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm really skeptical.

126
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,760
It's because I, every time it's ever been brought up, it's always been, well, it's just

127
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,760
not an issue.

128
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:06,040
And if we can get past that and we can get something legitimate out there, then I'll

129
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,720
be able to stand behind it and say, okay, that's cool, let's evaluate.

130
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,880
That's why I'm thinking those of us that acknowledge it's a problem, we band together and figure

131
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
out what it is.

132
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,160
Because it seems like there's so many moving layers and it could even be versions of things

133
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
that make a difference.

134
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Yeah.

135
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,400
I don't know, maybe it's more pronounced on Arch.

136
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Who knows?

137
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,400
While we're...

138
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
Possible.

139
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,600
Let's shift gears.

140
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's talk about KD a little more in the context of Mint 17, they just had the new release.

141
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,040
And producer of the show, Eric, has been trying out Mint 17 for a little while now and he's

142
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:40,560
kind of gone in and made us really kind of finely tune it to the way he likes it.

143
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
So Eric, what has been your impressions of using Mint now for a little while and what

144
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,480
was the first thing you had to change?

145
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:50,880
Well, I kind of went through it and the first thing I changed was the theme.

146
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,960
For some reason, the error theme for me is just way too bright.

147
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,960
So I changed it to one that you can download straight from the Get New Themes button called

148
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,920
AMAKAGE, wherever you pronounce that, I don't know.

149
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,480
So I've got that and then I got rid of oxygen.

150
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:15,360
The way I did that was I changed my widget style to Qt Curve and then I was able to install

151
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,040
on top of that, there's a Zekitwo, or Zekitwo, however you pronounce it.

152
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:26,800
I was able to download that and make that a theme for Qt Curve.

153
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,520
And on top of that, because Zekitwo, wherever it is pronounced it, it is available for GTK3

154
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,520
as well and GTK2.

155
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,720
So you get sort of the benefit of like the same benefit you get if you're using oxygen

156
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,960
only you can use the theme you want.

157
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Correct.

158
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
Yeah, exactly.

159
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,000
And it gets rid of that glow that people are so upset about.

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,280
And not only that, but I have not, at least in this KDE setup, experienced the audio issues

161
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,760
that are prevalent in the Arch KDE setup.

162
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,520
I don't know what it is about that setup.

163
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,080
So you've had issues on the same machine and then you've loaded Mint and haven't had issues?

164
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Correct.

165
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,920
I don't know how that is.

166
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,480
It's got something to do with the phonon and pulse audio implementation, but it's got to

167
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,440
be something with that.

168
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Hmm.

169
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
Hmm.

170
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,200
That sounds like something that needs to be a little investigated into.

171
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,040
So overall, toolset, performance-wise, you like it?

172
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,600
You think you're going to stay here for a while?

173
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
I think I might stay with it.

174
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,760
And the reason being is that I have actually run it up against Kubuntu.

175
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,660
And with Kubuntu, I don't know what the problem is there, but it just seems sluggish.

176
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,600
Like if I go to open the system settings, Mint KDE, I don't have that problem.

177
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,400
It just pops up right away and I was actually blown away by that.

178
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
So I don't know what they've been doing.

179
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,680
That'll be because we're sending all your data to Amazon.

180
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
That's what it is.

181
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Hey-oh.

182
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
I'm not talking about the Ubuntu.

183
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,680
I'm not talking about the Unity desktop.

184
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
I'm talking about the KDE implementation, Kubuntu.

185
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Kubuntu.

186
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Yeah.

187
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
I was trying to be funny.

188
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,680
Yeah.

189
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Oh, okay.

190
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,880
Popey, any thoughts you want to share with the crowd on KDE from your end?

191
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,880
I know you've been playing with it recently.

192
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Oh, man.

193
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Why did you set me up like that?

194
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm just curious.

195
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
I think KDE is a great desktop.

196
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I just have sound problems.

197
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,720
Honestly, KDE and Bay can go very well together.

198
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
I got to say that.

199
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
Yeah.

200
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Nice.

201
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
Nice.

202
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
I know KDE.

203
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,280
I mean, Popey, that might not be a fair question because you're obviously a Unity guy, I'm

204
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
sure.

205
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
I'll bash it.

206
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
It's okay.

207
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,720
Well, you know, I use lots of different desktops and I've tried KDE in the past, the distant

208
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,680
past, and I've tried it recently this week.

209
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:35,840
And I find it incredibly painful to use and verbose and far too many settings and the

210
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:44,680
layout of the UI is unbelievably painful with like bits scattered all over the screen and

211
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,680
weird dialogues.

212
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,040
I find it a horrible mess.

213
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,320
Now, let me ask you, though, would you be willing to...

214
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,480
Oh, somebody has open mic, hot mic, close your mic, there we go.

215
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,320
Would you be willing to, you know, entertain the idea of you're just coming at it from

216
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
a different angle?

217
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,600
Like you come at it with a different set of expectations of what a desktop should be.

218
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,160
So these things that don't meet that set of expectations really stand out at you.

219
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,160
But if somebody else came at it with a different set of expectations, those things would be

220
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,440
expected and they'd be missed if they weren't there.

221
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
What do you think of that?

222
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Yeah, probably.

223
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,600
I think if your expectations were, I'm a deeply technical user and I want to have absolute

224
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,320
control over every single pixel on my display and I want to be able to fiddle with every

225
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,200
possible setting that there is, sure, it's there for you.

226
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,840
But if you're someone who wants to turn the computer on and use it, I find it obtuse.

227
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:45,280
It just gets in the way and I was surprised how hard it was for me to find applications,

228
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:55,840
download updates, I just found it really got in the way and that's from someone who uses

229
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,840
Unity where everyone tells me that gets in the way of your workflow and it's hard to

230
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
use.

231
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
I'm lost for words.

232
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
Okay.

233
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,600
See, I like Unity too and I just like this also.

234
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Honestly, I'm the type of person who cannot decide between a desktop environment.

235
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
I'm a total desktop.

236
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
Because I like them all.

237
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,600
I'm such a desktop hooker.

238
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
It's crazy.

239
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Yeah, me too.

240
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,200
I'll load up Cinnamon for a couple of days and be like, this is it.

241
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,240
This is the perfect blend of classic and modern.

242
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,440
And then I'll be like, in Nome, I'll be like, oh, I'm in the future and it's finally working.

243
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
It's here.

244
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,640
And then I'm in KD and I'm like, I can do anything I want.

245
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,120
What is wrong with you people?

246
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,340
Why don't you just install iOS and just leave it alone?

247
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,340
It's a sickness, man.

248
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,540
Just get on and do your work.

249
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,760
Maybe there's a medication for it.

250
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
It's like some sort of OCD.

251
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
I don't know.

252
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
It's weird.

253
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
I don't know myself.

254
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
I'm compelled.

255
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,920
Although I do find myself in Nome pretty much all the time right now.

256
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,800
That's what my main DE is.

257
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,380
And the thing I love about Nome is I have several different machines with different

258
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,240
monitor sizes and I think Nome works great on my big 28-inch monitor and a 30-inch monitor

259
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
that I have.

260
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,880
I have one of those cinema displays that I bought used that Nome rocks that.

261
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,040
And then I've got a 14-inch screen that I've got Nome on and it rocks that too.

262
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,920
I mean, they all do good in that regard, but I just found that particularly works pretty

263
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
well.

264
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
I'm sorry.

265
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
I cut somebody off.

266
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Did somebody want to add something before we move on?

267
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Yeah.

268
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,240
I just wanted to say that I like KDE's functionality.

269
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,080
It's got a lot of awesome technical features like KDE Connect and the widgets and all these

270
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,080
things.

271
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,040
And it's so cool as far as functionality, but it looks awful.

272
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,320
Well, and I'm going to close the screenshots then and show you what I've got.

273
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Yeah.

274
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
If you've got them handy, yeah.

275
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
If the...

276
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,200
Like what you said, I completely understand that how you could make KDE look good and

277
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,280
it's possible.

278
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:45,280
You just remove oxygen completely and it's fine.

279
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,560
Oxygen is hideous, but also there's a few things that I don't like about the configuration.

280
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,760
It's confusing.

281
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,440
You can configure everything, but you can start a configuration and then right click

282
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,280
something in that and there's another configuration on top of it.

283
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,640
Well, they've explained the logic behind that, but yeah, I think it's like, well, people

284
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,160
expect it in both places, so we put it in both places.

285
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
I agree.

286
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,760
And I am watching the Plasma Next and Plasma 5 stuff to see like, what are they doing there?

287
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,840
Because Jen's in his team, like, what is their vision?

288
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,000
And I like where they're going with it.

289
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,920
I still, I think it's going to take, I think the next version of KDE is going to come out

290
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,920
in a big way.

291
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,400
They're going to try to keep it the same so that way they don't disrupt the Apple cart,

292
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
right?

293
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
They don't tip whatever the saying is.

294
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,280
But I wouldn't be surprised if once this next version of KDE is out and they consider it

295
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,360
sort of stabilized, if that's when they really start iterating on some of the more rougher

296
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
edges I think.

297
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,360
I think it's going to be a little bit.

298
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,360
You know what they could do?

299
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
They could add more options.

300
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,800
Yes, I can understand, I can understand why, you know, people use various desktops.

301
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,560
I can see why people use Gnome, Gnome Shell.

302
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:52,680
I can see why people like Elementary and Mate and Cinnamon.

303
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,800
The one that I just can't fathom is KDE.

304
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:02,880
I just can't figure out what psychology brings people to use KDE on a daily basis and like

305
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
it.

306
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,040
I mean, it's unfathomable.

307
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,540
Maybe you'll change your mind once all the Ubuntu apps are written in Qt and you're looking

308
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,280
for something that's a really solid Qt-based desktop.

309
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,720
Oh, I see what you've done there.

310
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
No, no, no, no.

311
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,280
KDE not equal to Qt, Qt not equal to KDE.

312
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,280
I do, I do.

313
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
All right.

314
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Well, look.

315
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
You trolley monster.

316
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,280
I'm sorry.

317
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
I'm sorry.

318
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
Look, before we move on, I should probably thank our first sponsor.

319
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,840
I wanted to talk about, did you guys hear there's huge, huge, huge news for CoreOS?

320
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
Huge news.

321
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,080
Like we were just, it's probably because they were on our show.

322
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,480
That's the only thing I can figure.

323
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,560
It's gotta be because they're on our show, but I don't know.

324
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,640
But first, let's take a little break and thank our first sponsor this week and that is the

325
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,440
great folks over at DigitalOcean.

326
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,040
Now, what the heck is DigitalOcean, my friends?

327
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,480
I will tell you DigitalOcean is simple cloud hosting dedicated to offering the most intuitive

328
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,880
and easy way to spin up a cloud server.

329
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:04,280
And most of you guys could probably get started in about 55 seconds, but if you're a pro and

330
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,480
I'm not trying to challenge you, I'm not trying to say, hey, it's the 4th of July, go have

331
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,000
a few drinks and then go spin up as many droplets as you can as fast as possible.

332
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,420
But if you were to infer that from this spot, I would understand.

333
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,440
But most people create a droplet in about 55 seconds and pricing plans start only $5

334
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
per month.

335
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,400
And that's what I've been using for months and months and months now.

336
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:28,840
And here's what you get for $5 a month, 512 megabytes of RAM, a 20 gigabyte SSD, one blazing

337
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,080
fast CPU and a terabyte of transfer.

338
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,920
And DigitalOcean has data center locations all around the world, New York, San Francisco,

339
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,040
Singapore and Amsterdam, tier one bandwidth in those locations and amazing hardware providers.

340
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,120
All of this connected to SSD drives running on top of KVM with their incredible control

341
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
panel.

342
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,460
Their interface is simple.

343
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,200
Their control panel has got to be one of the most intuitive experiences I've ever used.

344
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,960
And the best part is, is power users can really get at that with their straightforward API.

345
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,240
And they have a great development community and there's tutorials that help you get set

346
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,360
up with things like GitLab and there's one click deployment for a lot of great applications

347
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,080
that I know our community uses the heck out of.

348
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,300
You can create a droplet in less than a minute.

349
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
You can do backups.

350
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,680
You can do transfers.

351
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,200
You can set up the perfect Linux server and then template that and then deploy that Linux

352
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,960
server whenever you need it again.

353
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,000
And DigitalOcean has hourly pricing, so if you want to take advantage of our special

354
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,300
promo code, you can get a $10 credit or use that for the hourly pricing.

355
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,680
Use the promo code.

356
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,520
Now it's probably going to be changing because it's July now.

357
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,800
I haven't gotten the official new one, but it'll probably be Unplugged July.

358
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,280
If I was a gambling man, I would say Unplugged July.

359
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,680
Unplugged June will still work too, of course, if you're listening to this right as we're

360
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
changing over.

361
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,280
But use the promo code Unplugged July.

362
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,160
That lets them know that you appreciate them supporting the Linux Unplugged show.

363
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,960
You want them to keep sponsoring.

364
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,560
That way that keeps us on the air, but it also gets you that $10 credit so you can try

365
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,880
out what I've been talking about for so long now and see how amazing it is to get your

366
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,240
own server that you have root control over up in the cloud connected to tier one bandwidth

367
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,000
sitting on top of SSD drives powered by KVM.

368
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,840
I mean really, DigitalOcean.com, and a really big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring

369
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
Linux Unplugged.

370
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,040
I tell you what, Matt, I'm starting to feel a little bit like I have short timers.

371
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,400
Even though I'm only going to a cabin for two nights, as soon as this show's done, I'm

372
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
hitting the road.

373
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm out of here.

374
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
I'm going.

375
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
You're packed.

376
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
You're like Fred Flintstone going down the road.

377
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Totally.

378
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Totally.

379
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Okay.

380
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Check out the great news for CoreOS.

381
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,520
They just got eight million dollars in funding.

382
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,040
Eight million dollars.

383
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,560
So CoreOS, you guys know, we've just had them recently on the show.

384
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,180
We did a review of it as well.

385
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,920
They're the company that makes this, well now they're a company, that makes a scalable

386
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
version of Linux custom tailored for servers.

387
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:41,060
They just raised eight million dollars in a Series A funding round.

388
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,920
It's now offering support services for companies.

389
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,120
That's going to be their business model.

390
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,400
They call it a new commercial help service called CoreOS Managed Linux, which the company

391
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,920
describes as an OS as a service offering and they provide organizations with constant patches

392
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,720
and updates in case they don't want the responsibility, so they're going to manage that for you.

393
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,800
Sounds familiar.

394
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,920
And they're promising to help reduce the admin work for people deploying CoreOS.

395
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,920
The monthly charge will range from anywhere, forget this.

396
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,880
This is for companies that have big deployments.

397
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,160
Monthly charge ranges anywhere from a thousand to a hundred thousand dollars.

398
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
Wow.

399
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,640
For monthly.

400
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,920
That's a good business.

401
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,040
And so when Pulvey was asked about like who's your competitor here because this has got

402
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:30,040
to be a hot space, he says well one of them for sure is Red Hat.

403
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:35,920
Red Hat's project Atomic is a direct response to CoreOS he said.

404
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,120
And of course CoreOS relies heavily on Docker who's been working closely with Red Hat.

405
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,600
And of course Ubuntu and others too.

406
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,360
Huge news for CoreOS though, huge.

407
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,280
Eight million dollars for a Linux distro?

408
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:49,120
It's got to be because we just had them on the show, right?

409
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Absolutely.

410
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
Clearly.

411
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,840
The last bump.

412
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
It was totally.

413
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
Yeah.

414
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,600
Oh you know what, hey here's another last bump.

415
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,280
I'm kidding of course but the creator project announced that they just didn't really announce

416
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
it.

417
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
They just reached their funding.

418
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:12,160
This is the really nice, really nice illustrator program for that KDE desktop that Pulvey loves

419
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
so much.

420
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,720
They just reached their goal of $15,000 in funding and they still have eight days to

421
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,720
go too.

422
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
So now if you want to back a winner you can.

423
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,500
And this is really one of the greatest open source desktop applications out there for

424
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,160
people who are artsy fartsy.

425
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,720
And yeah there's GIMP and yeah there's Inkscape.

426
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,480
This is something unique, something different.

427
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,720
And congratulations to them.

428
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,440
Again the last bump I'm sure, I'm sure.

429
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,760
And responding to pressure from the Linux action show OwnCloud 7 we've gotten more details

430
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,960
on the server to server syncing.

431
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,000
I remember I said on last, I'd love to get more details on how OwnCloud 7 is doing the

432
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
server to server syncing.

433
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,360
We got some details.

434
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,680
So I thought I'd give you guys an update on that too because to me this is the coolest

435
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,240
feature of OwnCloud 7.

436
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,240
So the server to server sharing allows you to mount a share from another OwnCloud instance

437
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:06,240
and seamlessly collaborate on shared files from within each of your own OwnCloud instances.

438
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,320
Essentially combining your private clouds into one single public cloud between you two.

439
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,800
You can even have the folder locally synced to a client like through the OwnCloud client

440
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
sync.

441
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,720
No need to create accounts on your other instances.

442
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,260
Just once it's all shared up you can connect to each other's own cloud.

443
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,400
They use the example of a class.

444
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,960
You can have your classmates connect to your own cloud server, send them a shared folder

445
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,960
link the usual way.

446
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,040
Instead of them having to visit your own cloud each time and log in, they can opt to click

447
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,960
to save to OwnCloud button and add a folder to their own OwnCloud instance.

448
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,120
And then they can add this folder to the list of locally synced folders and it will sync

449
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,600
between your own cloud instances as if it was on their own own cloud server.

450
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Oh cool.

451
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Right?

452
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Yeah.

453
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
That sounds nice.

454
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
That's freaking awesome.

455
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
Yeah.

456
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
I mean they talk about performance improvements.

457
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,040
They talk about server to server syncing.

458
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,520
I am digging that.

459
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,320
I am thinking OwnCloud 7 is the one that this might be the time I switch.

460
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,920
I cannot wait to load it up into.

461
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,200
Clearly I'm spinning up another droplet.

462
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,360
I mean I think that's been settled.

463
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
There you go.

464
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,360
Right there right?

465
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Yeah it could.

466
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,360
I've been thinking you know I've been really trying to figure out like photos for my wife

467
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,200
and I and music and then moving them between the two locations.

468
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,480
It's not as easy as it should be.

469
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,000
And there's not like there's like you could do BitTorrent sync but then you have to we

470
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,040
have to run individual you have to configure each client application on each machine.

471
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,480
So like let's say I'm using Rhythmbox I have to scan that BitTorrent sync folder and add

472
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,200
it as a library on every machine and the metadata might be tracked differently or the podcast

473
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,320
or whatever it is right.

474
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,180
It's just not very smooth but the promise of OwnCloud where it could it could offer

475
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:41,420
that one central library for you know even if it was just for business contacts and business

476
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,080
events and things like that that sounds extremely compelling and essentially what I use the

477
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,600
Google Apps for right now.

478
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,960
And then if it does file sync on top of that gets us off Dropbox for some of our fixed

479
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,280
assets because we have like a lot of our art and fixed visuals in Dropbox because it's

480
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:01,040
just so easy to deploy Dropbox and have it sync up on the production machines.

481
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:06,160
But if OwnCloud offers something there too it might solve a few problems.

482
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
I'm really excited about it.

483
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,680
And I wonder too like if there wouldn't be a bit of a contracting business and going

484
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:17,560
around and saying hello this is Chris's OwnCloud installation and would you like an internet

485
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,240
that actually works for you and offers file sync and gets your staff off of Dropbox.

486
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,720
Let me introduce you to my OwnCloud installation package for only a thousand dollars I'll deploy

487
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,520
OwnCloud for you and get all your users migrated off of Dropbox.

488
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,300
Like that could actually be like a legitimate thing people go around and make money off

489
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,360
of because OwnCloud is getting serious.

490
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,120
And then if you offer like server sync that's a perfect solution for businesses to have

491
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,240
a few offices.

492
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,600
A small business has one or two offices OwnCloud sync between them.

493
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
Money maker.

494
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,280
I mean like especially when you think about like dental offices, real estate offices,

495
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,640
anything that especially when you're dealing with the at home people as well as at work

496
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,180
people multiple offices.

497
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,880
Yeah there's a lot of opportunity there.

498
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,240
Yeah you know very much so I mean I'm thinking very much of my workflow but I could easily

499
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:04,480
see like a you know a small business owner that wants a sync of the most vital documents

500
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,800
and things like that at their own house for backup right.

501
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,280
I mean that seems legit.

502
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:15,340
So it sounds like a good option for a couple clients I have that it can save a lot of effort

503
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,600
for me as well.

504
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,800
The other thing so OwnCloud right now is I'm going to look at for my for my all inclusive

505
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,360
sync solution and then the other one I got experiment more with is sync thing.

506
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,440
I've played with it a little bit.

507
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,720
The thing I not love about sync thing is you have to authorize each device you're going

508
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
to sync with.

509
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,000
So distributing things like podcast files you know I can't authorize every viewer out

510
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,220
there that wants to sync the Linux action show HD folder.

511
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,220
That's just that'd be crazy.

512
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,080
I'd be doing that all day long.

513
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:49,600
But so BitTorrent sync seems like that's still the go to thing for that.

514
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,160
It doesn't replace sync thing in the terms of like content distribution.

515
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:57,000
So then if I'm going to be running an instance of BitTorrent sync anyways should I just go

516
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,240
all in on that and just simplify my life instead of running BitTorrent sync and OwnCloud or

517
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,280
BitTorrent sync and sync thing.

518
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,440
I got too many sync options.

519
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,400
So I'll figure it out eventually and then we'll make an episode out of it.

520
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,640
Solve two problems with what you know just boom two birds one stone that hey speaking

521
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,960
of solving problems let me tell you about our next sponsor and then we'll get into the

522
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,540
community announcement the Jupiter review panel but first let me tell you about the

523
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:32,360
great Canadians over at ting.com go to linux.ting.com why because it's linux.ting.com own that

524
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,680
URL that is ours let's represent the Linux users at ting now here's really why you want

525
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:43,460
to switch to ting no contract no early termination fee and you only pay for what you actually

526
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,380
use you don't pay into some big contract where you have to kind of guesstimate how many minutes

527
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,240
and how much data you might use and how many text messages you might send you just pay

528
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,140
for what you use and it was interesting on tech talk today I had an email from a cellular

529
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,900
wireless engineer and he's like the ting model from the perspective of a person who builds

530
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,200
and maintains these networks is the only model that makes sense long term it's the only one

531
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,960
that can work and I feel like I am living a bit in the future when I use ting because

532
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,820
it's all the things I need in a cellular service my data is there I have hotspot and tethering

533
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,760
included I get the pick of some of the greatest Android devices and iOS devices and or just

534
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,060
feature phones all available through ting it's a flat six dollars per month then just

535
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:29,220
my usage build on top of that all managed through an incredibly easy to use dashboard

536
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,460
but also provides real insights and this is a big thing for me these dashboards this is

537
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,940
2014 there is no excuse for the dashboards that some of these cell companies use they

538
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,900
are just trash and the great thing about ting is they also support industry standards too

539
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,700
so they works well on mobile works well on your desktop they also have featured like

540
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,620
integration with Amazon payments to pay for your cell phone bill which is a really nice

541
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,260
feature and it kind of shows you how ting is hip to a lot of these types of technologies

542
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,780
and it's refreshing it's one of the things I appreciate the most and that's why I actively

543
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,500
follow the ting blog because there's always good information even if you're not a ting

544
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,020
subscriber on the ting blog and it's always worth checking out over there because they've

545
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,180
often post videos that are behind the scenes it's fun to see the ting crew get insights

546
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:15,300
into how the company operates and check out their devices too because when you go to linux.ting.com

547
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,020
they're gonna take $25 off your first device if you've already got a device they'll take

548
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,980
$25 off your ting service I paid for more than my first month now I've got two phones

549
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,520
on my ting program and it's barely cracking $30 a month because we're really conscious

550
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,980
about how we do it we're on Wi-Fi a ton we use Viber and Skype for our phone calls and

551
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,700
the little bitsies that we do use phone calls for we just pay for when we use it I love

552
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,900
it it's just worked so well for me linux.ting.com take $25 off your first device get or $25

553
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:49,420
credit and a big thank you to ting for sponsoring linux unplugged okay so this is a fun initiative

554
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,980
that the production team's been wanting to do for a while it not only is it a way for

555
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,900
us to sort of increase the distributions that we cover and give attention to maybe some

556
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,180
of the smaller ones that we wouldn't normally want to load up and install just for like

557
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,460
a smaller distro but sometimes when you do that like you find a diamond in the rough

558
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:12,700
so we are announcing the Jupiter colony review draft and this is an initiative that will

559
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:17,600
eventually eventually establish a kind of a reoccurring group of folks but we're going

560
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,860
to kind of take baby steps at first rotten do you want to jump in here at this point

561
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,300
and kind of mention how we're going to launch this with the pre-selected group and why we're

562
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:30,460
doing it that way yeah so it's the first the first week we're going to do to make it easier

563
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:35,620
to kind of instead of having to vet everyone to join we're going to do a just a kind of

564
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:42,060
a testing purposes of getting people to just a pre-selection of a few people maybe like

565
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:45,860
a list less probably less than a dozen or so but just as many people as possible but

566
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:51,220
then we're going to have it where they can we come on to like a show to get everybody

567
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,380
does show together you get you just you play with the distro however you would normally

568
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,460
would take some things like that yet take some notes maybe even try to beat it beat

569
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,980
it up a little bit and see where you find some flaws and then we have a community discussion

570
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,980
about whether you know whether they say it's something that could be good for a new user

571
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:14,540
or just the bit the pros and cons of the distro itself yeah and do you want to go ahead and

572
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,260
announce the first one no go ahead i'll let you do it okay the first dish we're gonna

573
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:28,060
uh put in this little round table review thing is uh chaos yeah chaos has been on our list

574
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,540
for a while but we just haven't gotten to it so that'll be a good one for people to

575
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:40,580
give a go and uh yes yes yes yes it is it's considered a lean kde distribution at that

576
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:46,780
uh yes is that even possible wow in the sense of how many packages they allow in their system

577
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,220
so they only allow kde specific stuff and they have anything other than that they force

578
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,620
it off and they have that interesting design aesthetic as well which i've been interested

579
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,700
to try out so the idea here is uh we get a wide sampling of opinions on this you guys

580
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,820
can look at it and some folks will look at it from very technical aspects some people

581
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,340
look at it from the design aspect others will look at it from like a usability and things

582
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,060
like that we'll get a nice rounded set of opinions and then we can accumulate it into

583
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:14,940
sort of a concentrated review for the linux unplugged audience and honestly there's an

584
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:20,700
opportunity here down the road where if a few folks stood out as you know really solid

585
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,380
contributors maybe there'd be a role where you'd come on last and do dedicated review

586
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,820
segments of specific distribution so there's opportunity for expansion and growth here

587
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,000
but it's just something to start with for fun so embedded in the show notes we will

588
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,920
have the jupiter colony review draft if you would be interested in reviewing a distribution

589
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,020
for us we like rotten said we've already picked our first distribution and our first crew

590
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:45,180
so that way we just kind of get things rolling but after that we'll be pulling from our draft

591
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,300
list and you'll find that in the episode 47 show notes it'll be linked and embedded in

592
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,580
there and it's also it'll be in the irc chat room for those of you watching live so are

593
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,020
we going to do the review next week rotten yes next week okay so we'll have chaos on

594
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:03,620
the show yeah you know what's coming up down the road in fact i want to put the word out

595
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:13,740
there i'm thinking about on july 22nd i see well we have something already scheduled but

596
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,340
i on the production calendar but i'm thinking about potentially being live from oscon in

597
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,820
portland oregon on july 22nd so i want to put the word out there for the jupiter broadcasting

598
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,500
audience if there's folks out there who might be interested in meeting up at oscon on july

599
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,620
22nd that it's like that's a wednesday or no it's a tuesday so we and if it worked out

600
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:36,300
it'd be really fun to be able to do unplugged live from there so kind of putting a feeler

601
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:41,440
out there seeing what people think we were accepted at oscon as media so we could go

602
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,300
in there we'd have media badges we could do interviews and stuff like that so there's

603
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,940
some reasons to go down there but i'd really love to do it if we knew we're going to meet

604
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,140
up with some folks oh yeah all right rotten is there anything else we want to cover on

605
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:58,500
the community review the jupiter colony draft as it were um yeah the the draft is going

606
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,000
to be um it doesn't we first want to make sure people that if they're interested in

607
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,880
doing it they don't have to worry about having an extra computer or anything like that it's

608
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,140
just like kind of play with it you don't need to remove remove your existing distro or anything

609
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:17,380
like that so we're going to do something yeah it can be a virtual box like some things might

610
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:22,140
will provide a virtual box image to make it easier for people or other other times they

611
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,900
could just buy the i mean not buy but download the iso some things don't work very well in

612
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,020
virtual box so we figure that out on the way to go yeah it might be distribution dependent

613
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,860
yeah because like for example you can't really review a distribution like core os in virtual

614
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,920
box so there's some yeah we were bouncing it around we found some uh some people had

615
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:46,000
some questions about maybe um you know having a whether you should like run it all the week

616
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,420
or is it just something we can just kind of like jump in and play with and if that's enough

617
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:55,660
and essentially uh it's not you're not trying to ask people to just you know run live with

618
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:01,340
it in a week or anything just to kind of you know play play with it use it see if you can

619
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,500
break it kind of things yeah i mean it's really going to be results depending on what insights

620
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,340
the audience that member brings and if like then if they bring something that we're like

621
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,840
yeah that was a really great observation will you join us for the next review you know that's

622
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,140
the kind of system it's going to be where uh solid contributions will be noted and appreciated

623
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,780
and i love the idea too of then eventually establishing a pool of folks and saying okay

624
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:26,320
we're looking for everybody who has intel graphics because we want to try out this wayland

625
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,180
distribution you know or something like that because we if we built up a little pool we

626
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,700
could maybe do stuff that is a little bit harder for ourselves to do because maybe i

627
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,820
don't have a machine with dedicated intel graphics right so i couldn't do that review

628
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:43,340
of of something that runs mere or wayland uh but if we had a resource out there of folks

629
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:48,300
that wanted to participate and wanted to do these reviews you know essentially uh you

630
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,140
don't even have to have experience but if you've done blogging too you're probably a

631
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,580
great candidate if you've blogged a distro review uh and just it's something fun we want

632
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,380
to do i'm looking forward to it i think it could be a great idea i think it could be

633
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,220
a good way for matt and i discover a few distributions we hadn't really thought of trying before

634
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:08,020
and then you never know like maybe we'll take a look at it and end up switching maybe i

635
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,720
don't know i'm a little i'm a little skeptical yeah i don't know matt you seem skeptical

636
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:17,580
so anyways uh form is in the show notes if you guys want to fill that out uh also uh

637
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:24,540
just a little plugsies check out tech talk today um tomorrow's episode because i pre-recorded

638
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:29,500
because i'm going to a cabin tomorrow's episode is a retro look back at two operating systems

639
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,700
that almost dominated the market one of which i'm sure most of you've heard of one of which

640
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:39,980
i would bet most of you haven't heard of and it'll be surprising who was making it and

641
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,900
what it was based on so uh check out tech talk today it's a new show on the jupiter

642
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:49,740
broadcasting network a daily technology podcast where uh me and my closest mumble friends

643
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,300
discuss the tech news from perspectives of open source enthusiasts and linux users now

644
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,880
that doesn't necessarily mean that every story is a linux story but what it means is instead

645
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,140
of getting that typical silicon valley bias where it's very heavily google influenced

646
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:09,140
or apple influenced and linux and open source are very often not considered not part of

647
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:12,700
their perspective or not part of the discussion this has been something that we've talked

648
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,400
about on linux unplugged for a couple of episodes the quality of journalism especially those

649
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,900
coming at it from a linux perspective is pretty abysmal so uh one of the goals i have with

650
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:26,940
tech talk today is to have a platform for us to have discussions around the tech events

651
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,180
the tech news of the day and it's the stuff that actually is we're talking about you know

652
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:35,120
it's not just rattling off headlines it's things that are actually worth discussing

653
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,980
from a perspective of a linux user and i hope it's an i hope it's an interesting recipe

654
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:45,460
i'd like you guys to check it out episode 18 came out today we talked about microsoft

655
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,380
shutting down the no ip service which screwed a lot of jupiter broadcasting audience members

656
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:53,420
i saw a lot of complaints about that in the form or in the threads in a couple different

657
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:57,460
of our subreddits so we talked that's an issue we talked about in today's tech talk today

658
00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:01,460
doesn't quite fit in linux unplugged or linux action show but it's an issue we could talk

659
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:07,820
about and then like i said tomorrow is the retrospective at the os's of futures past

660
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,820
and so i encourage you to check out tech talk today if you want more show but i think that's

661
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,780
everything we have for today i think we've gone through our list we kind of burned through

662
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,740
it pretty quick but i'm okay with that because that means i get to wrap up and head out to

663
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:24,820
a cabin so i'm not gonna complain man if you if you get my drift and it is hot i tell you

664
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:29,740
what i was gonna say oh it is hot off a costco thing of water in the back oh yeah oh i got

665
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,540
