WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.960
You might be familiar with Wine, but are you familiar with Twine?

00:05.960 --> 00:11.760
It emulates OS2 binaries, the same way that Wine can emulate Windows binary.

00:11.760 --> 00:16.480
It's named such to continue the fine tradition of programmers producing good code and bad

00:16.480 --> 00:17.640
product names.

00:17.640 --> 00:22.480
And it comes from the one, the only, Ryan C. Gordon, aka Ikyulus, so you know it actually

00:22.480 --> 00:23.860
might be a bit legitimate.

00:23.860 --> 00:27.040
He just posted this to his patrons on his Patreon page.

00:27.040 --> 00:31.080
And Wes, good news, they've got Unreal Tournament.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.080
Oh boy!

00:32.080 --> 00:35.160
Of all the things, right?

00:35.160 --> 00:36.160
That's what he goes with.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.960
But he's pretty fired up about it.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.800
He actually says this is a big deal.

00:40.800 --> 00:45.600
And Ryan does have quite a bit of experience porting games and 3D applications over to

00:45.600 --> 00:46.940
the Linux desktop.

00:46.940 --> 00:50.640
And you know, I gotta be honest, this does speak to me a little bit at a deep nerd level.

00:50.640 --> 00:54.920
Not because I'm planning to use OS2 for anything, but in a way like you hate to see this stuff

00:54.920 --> 00:55.920
die.

00:55.920 --> 01:00.080
And when it's all digital, like we have the means to preserve this stuff, and games and

01:00.080 --> 01:01.960
whatnot are art.

01:01.960 --> 01:02.960
That is definitely true.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.800
Even if you don't care about any of that, it's kind of just a fascinating read.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.000
He dives into a bunch of details about the progress he's made so far, why it's difficult,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.160
and why it might not be that difficult overall.

01:13.160 --> 01:17.600
Yeah, so I expect any week now, Popeye will be taking the Twine challenge and running

01:17.600 --> 01:20.560
everything on his desktop through an OS2 emulator.

01:20.560 --> 01:21.560
Hang on.

01:21.560 --> 01:22.560
Wait, what?

01:22.560 --> 01:23.560
OS2?

01:23.560 --> 01:24.560
Yeah.

01:24.560 --> 01:25.560
It's an OS2 emulator.

01:25.560 --> 01:26.560
OS2.

01:26.560 --> 01:27.560
Yeah.

01:27.560 --> 01:30.560
You want to take the challenge, Popeye?

01:30.560 --> 01:32.320
I can't get my head around this.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.840
Wimpy was more of an OS2 guy than I was.

01:34.840 --> 01:38.960
Yeah, I've got Arkanoa on my ThinkPads.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.720
You were a big OS2 fan, eh Wimpy?

01:40.720 --> 01:41.720
Well what do you say?

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
There you go, Wimpy.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.720
You take the challenge.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.720
You take it.

01:44.720 --> 01:45.720
You take it.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.440
I'll give it a go.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.320
I switched from OS2 to Linux.

01:49.320 --> 01:50.320
There you go.

01:50.320 --> 01:51.320
There you go.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.320
And now you can switch back.

01:52.320 --> 02:09.360
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 237 for February 20th, 2018.

02:09.360 --> 02:13.880
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show this week that's so packed with

02:13.880 --> 02:14.880
goodness.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.820
Well, we're going to give you an extra side.

02:16.820 --> 02:17.820
My name is Chris.

02:17.820 --> 02:18.820
My name is Wes.

02:18.820 --> 02:19.820
It's going to be a side of announcement.

02:19.820 --> 02:23.560
We'll tell you more about that in just a little bit, but first this week we'll cover some

02:23.560 --> 02:25.040
community news.

02:25.040 --> 02:29.240
The good folks over at KDE just got a surprise donation from the Pineapple Fund.

02:29.240 --> 02:30.800
We'll tell you about that.

02:30.800 --> 02:34.080
Our friends over at Canonical want to know a little bit more about how your computer

02:34.080 --> 02:37.440
set up, so we'll talk directly to the horse's mouth about that.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.720
I do love the horse's mouth.

02:39.720 --> 02:41.000
I always think of Mr. Ed.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
That's right.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
With the peanut butter.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
So tasty.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.520
And then later on, our good friends over at Elementary OS and System76 working on Pop

02:48.520 --> 02:53.280
OS are doing something that I think a lot of you are going to agree with, the turning

02:53.280 --> 02:55.420
on disk encryption by default.

02:55.420 --> 02:59.560
But this isn't a simple implementation, and there's a lot of user challenges to work through

02:59.560 --> 03:02.100
and edge cases that have to be thought through.

03:02.100 --> 03:07.100
So we'll talk to them about turning on disk encryption by default when you install Elementary

03:07.100 --> 03:09.800
OS or Pop OS in the near future.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.920
Gnome's got a new tool to check on your system.

03:11.920 --> 03:16.240
A big bogus Linux vulnerability is getting all of the attention this week.

03:16.240 --> 03:21.040
OpenStreetMaps has woes, and then we're going to wrap it all up with that side.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.600
It's going to be a tasty side.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.040
Maybe a berry flavor.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.520
It's an announcement here at the network.

03:25.520 --> 03:29.280
Something big on the build up to scale is coming back to Jupiter Broadcasting.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.840
You got to stay tuned.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.520
You got to listen to find out that.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.520
You know it.

03:33.520 --> 03:34.520
You know it.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.140
You know the drill, Wes.

03:36.140 --> 03:37.140
You know the drill.

03:37.140 --> 03:40.480
So Wes, before we go any further, it is our duty to bring in that virtual log.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.120
Time appropriate greetings, Bumble Room.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.120
What's up?

03:43.120 --> 03:44.120
Hello.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.120
Hello.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.120
Hello.

03:46.120 --> 03:47.120
How are you?

03:47.120 --> 03:48.120
All right.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.440
So how many of you are using the MumbleSnap today?

03:49.440 --> 03:50.440
Just say I.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.440
I.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.440
I.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.440
I.

03:53.440 --> 03:54.440
Sure.

03:54.440 --> 03:55.440
Whoa.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.440
Impressive.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.440
Dude, all of a sudden I'm having FOMO.

03:57.440 --> 04:00.480
I'm just feeling like I should be catching up.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.480
Wow.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.480
All right.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.780
We'll talk about production testing.

04:03.780 --> 04:05.360
We're going to put it through its paces this week.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.360
All right.

04:06.360 --> 04:07.840
Well, let's start with a little bit of good news.

04:07.840 --> 04:13.480
The KDE project is extremely pleased to announce that they have received 200,000 U.S. Greenback

04:13.480 --> 04:16.680
donations from the Pineapple Fund.

04:16.680 --> 04:20.720
Now, they go on to say that they're going to use these funds to further their cause

04:20.720 --> 04:26.720
to make free software accessible to everyone on all platforms, which is good because I

04:26.720 --> 04:29.360
was pretty convinced until they made that statement that they were going to use that

04:29.360 --> 04:32.680
money to fund proprietary software, so I'm pretty glad they made that clarification.

04:32.680 --> 04:33.680
Close call.

04:33.680 --> 04:34.680
Yeah.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.920
The money is going to help them realize their vision of creating a world in which everyone

04:36.920 --> 04:40.760
has control over their digital life and enjoys freedom and privacy.

04:40.760 --> 04:44.040
Well, apparently they're going to buy out Apple and Google.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.040
I think this is great.

04:45.040 --> 04:50.680
The Pineapple Fund says that KDE is a necessary community project which just has a general

04:50.680 --> 04:55.320
benefit to the public and advances the use of free software on all platforms, so that's

04:55.320 --> 04:56.320
why they were all in.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.800
Two hundred thousand dollars.

04:57.800 --> 05:01.480
The Pineapple Fund has been busy recently contributing money.

05:01.480 --> 05:05.320
I don't know a lot about the Pineapple Fund, but I need to do some more digging.

05:05.320 --> 05:08.680
I did a little bit of reading, so I have a rough idea, but is anybody kind of familiar

05:08.680 --> 05:11.200
with Pineapple Fund before I run my mouth about it?

05:11.200 --> 05:17.240
Anybody want to save me and just eloquently describe in a few short, beautiful sentences?

05:17.240 --> 05:18.240
Eloquently.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.920
What do you think, producer Michael?

05:20.920 --> 05:21.920
What do you think?

05:21.920 --> 05:22.920
You got a shot?

05:22.920 --> 05:27.680
Well, I mean, it's just like it's a Bitcoin-based philanthropist basically.

05:27.680 --> 05:31.320
Right, and when it came to the Free Software Foundation, they actually donated Bitcoin

05:31.320 --> 05:32.560
to the Free Software Foundation.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.120
OpenBSD is one of the beneficiaries.

05:35.120 --> 05:38.640
But in this case, for KD, I believe they donated cash.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.600
They converted it to cash.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.600
Cash.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.600
Yeah.

05:42.600 --> 05:43.720
Yeah, pretty interesting.

05:43.720 --> 05:44.720
Pretty interesting.

05:44.720 --> 05:45.720
So you can find it all out.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.560
They have raised fifty-three million dollars and donated to fifty-eight different charities

05:49.560 --> 05:51.680
so far.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.680
I like that.

05:52.680 --> 05:53.680
I think that's pretty cool.

05:53.680 --> 05:57.280
I think that's a great use of cryptocurrency, too, you know what I mean?

05:57.280 --> 06:00.640
And if you donate now and then they can use those funds down the road, well, today as

06:00.640 --> 06:05.440
we record, Bitcoin is back up to $11,000, probably because of manipulation via Popey's

06:05.440 --> 06:06.440
huge wealth.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.440
Ugh.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.440
That guy.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.440
I know.

06:09.440 --> 06:10.440
But, you know, it's going to a good cause.

06:10.440 --> 06:11.720
Now you can feel good about that and not just feel more poor.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.720
Yeah, exactly.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.720
Thank you.

06:13.720 --> 06:14.720
Thanks to Popey, really.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.320
I think that might be Mr. Dustin Kirkland you hear there coming in a bit.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.160
So let's talk to Dustin and Will Cook.

06:20.160 --> 06:26.320
They're both joining us from Canonical, and you may have heard of an email that Will sent

06:26.320 --> 06:32.720
out to the mailing list recently for the Ubuntu development in which he says that they're

06:32.720 --> 06:39.660
looking at how to focus future resources around engineering and realized, you know, we could

06:39.660 --> 06:45.020
use some information, some data, if you will, like what version of Ubuntu people are installing,

06:45.020 --> 06:48.960
if they have a network connection, the type of CPU that they have, how much RAM, how did

06:48.960 --> 06:53.240
they lay out their disks, what packages did they install, what GPU do they have, who built

06:53.240 --> 06:57.740
their computer, these kinds of things that they don't actually currently collect.

06:57.740 --> 07:03.160
But whenever you start talking about collecting additional data from users, it causes quite

07:03.160 --> 07:04.580
a bit of reaction.

07:04.580 --> 07:07.840
So I thought, instead of us just rampant speculation style here on the old show.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.280
Oh, but that was going to be so much fun.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.560
Dude, I'm happy to do it.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.560
Maybe we'll just save that later.

07:11.560 --> 07:15.280
But first, we'll get the information from Dustin and Will because they're in this thread.

07:15.280 --> 07:16.800
And this email came from Will Cook.

07:16.800 --> 07:18.200
So guys, welcome to the show.

07:18.200 --> 07:22.320
And Will, why don't we start with you and kind of let's hear your version of what you

07:22.320 --> 07:23.320
guys are proposing.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.320
Sure.

07:24.320 --> 07:27.040
So I mean, as you said, data-driven development.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.540
This is what we're all about.

07:28.540 --> 07:32.920
We need to know where we should be focusing our efforts, what things people like, what

07:32.920 --> 07:38.400
things people use, and they should get the lion's share of our engineering efforts so

07:38.400 --> 07:42.240
that we can fix the parts that are most important to those people.

07:42.240 --> 07:45.920
When I first saw this, I had a couple of different reactions.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.040
My first reaction was, oh, people aren't going to like this.

07:48.040 --> 07:52.600
But my second reaction is, you weren't collecting this already?

07:52.600 --> 07:54.280
You're not already collecting this information?

07:54.280 --> 07:58.800
That seems like information that would have been collected from day one.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.200
Well, yeah.

08:00.200 --> 08:05.040
So from day one, we've always had an app port running, which is the thing that pops up and

08:05.040 --> 08:06.600
says something went wrong.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.760
Would you like to report an error about it?

08:09.760 --> 08:10.760
That's always been there.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.280
PopCon was there for a little while.

08:12.280 --> 08:15.440
PopCon's been in Debian since forever.

08:15.440 --> 08:21.880
But the raw data about what sort of hardware that we're running on, yeah, we haven't ever

08:21.880 --> 08:23.200
gathered that.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.320
So the thing that you're also suggesting, well, actually, I have a follow-up question

08:26.320 --> 08:27.320
to that.

08:27.320 --> 08:31.960
The one metric I think that's probably getting the most strong reaction would be location

08:31.960 --> 08:32.960
information.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.600
What kind of specific location information would you be collecting?

08:36.600 --> 08:39.800
We talked about this internally before we sent the email.

08:39.800 --> 08:44.200
We decided that it would be useful to everybody to know where people are in the world.

08:44.200 --> 08:48.840
You know, if we find out that 90% of our users are based in India, let's say, then we need

08:48.840 --> 08:51.880
to be focusing on the translations for India.

08:51.880 --> 08:57.080
If we find out that everybody is in the US, then we need to be making sure that the English

08:57.080 --> 08:59.520
translations are up to date.

08:59.520 --> 09:03.420
We're not gathering IP address information.

09:03.420 --> 09:07.560
The location will be the location that the user chooses at login.

09:07.560 --> 09:14.000
So there's no sort of nefarious snooping on where we think you are.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.800
This is purely you tell us you're in this country.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.920
We take that on face value and that's what we record.

09:21.920 --> 09:27.740
And so it's not tracked to like a specific user and location.

09:27.740 --> 09:33.400
So you wouldn't necessarily get Chris F. in Arlington, Washington when you look back at

09:33.400 --> 09:34.400
the metrics?

09:34.400 --> 09:40.640
No, it's like purely country level, literally top level country level information.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.140
Okay.

09:43.140 --> 09:47.120
And then the other thing, so you mentioned it really in there quickly as PopCon.

09:47.120 --> 09:52.520
PopCon is a tool, if I'm correct, that sort of monitoring the user's packages that they

09:52.520 --> 09:58.120
install to give you guys over a canonical and aggregate overview of the most popular

09:58.120 --> 09:59.120
packages.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.720
The idea there, I suppose, would be, well, if we have an idea of what the most popular

10:02.720 --> 10:07.560
packages are, then we know where to dedicate patch time, backporting time, resource development

10:07.560 --> 10:08.880
time, integration time.

10:08.880 --> 10:10.560
Is that what PopCon is about?

10:10.560 --> 10:11.560
Exactly.

10:11.560 --> 10:17.200
And we have the archives and people hit the archives in order to get packages.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.640
But let's say that we could look at the web logs on those servers, which we don't.

10:21.640 --> 10:26.680
But if we could do, we could see that people were installing a specific package.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.840
A lot of people are installing a specific package.

10:28.840 --> 10:32.880
That doesn't tell us whether they install it once and then uninstall it or they install

10:32.880 --> 10:37.060
it and they use it every day or they install it and they use it once a year.

10:37.060 --> 10:41.540
That's the sort of information that PopCon gives us, and with that information, we can

10:41.540 --> 10:47.680
look at promoting packages that are in universe, which is the lowest level of support that

10:47.680 --> 10:51.840
we offer, up to main, which is something that our security team get involved in.

10:51.840 --> 10:58.300
So if everybody's installing a specific package from universe, they're using it every day,

10:58.300 --> 11:03.040
then we can look at promoting that to main and then the security team and whoever it

11:03.040 --> 11:08.400
is that's maintaining that package will be able to spend a lot more time making sure

11:08.400 --> 11:12.360
that security bugs are fixed, making sure that the latest versions are packaged, keeping

11:12.360 --> 11:14.120
that update for everybody.

11:14.120 --> 11:19.640
So yeah, that's extremely useful information for us and it's extremely beneficial to our

11:19.640 --> 11:20.640
users.

11:20.640 --> 11:24.960
So I think I have a couple of questions specifically for Dustin, but Will, one of my kind of bigger

11:24.960 --> 11:29.960
picture questions I have for you is the flip side of this is you've also stated that you

11:29.960 --> 11:33.820
plan to make the data public.

11:33.820 --> 11:38.520
Wouldn't that also mean that you plan to reveal exactly, roughly, pretty damn close how many

11:38.520 --> 11:44.520
Ubuntu installations there are, how many people are using Dell laptops versus an entryware

11:44.520 --> 11:45.520
laptop?

11:45.520 --> 11:50.520
Like isn't this going to result in a lot of speculation being answered?

11:50.520 --> 11:52.160
Because then you'll have real numbers.

11:52.160 --> 11:56.040
People have like, well, Ubuntu has X amount of users and there's never really been a big

11:56.040 --> 11:59.800
public number released about that.

11:59.800 --> 12:04.800
Will I'll jump in here actually at this point, yeah, I think that's exactly right and everything

12:04.800 --> 12:12.040
that we've put out so far has been our best guess interpolation on roughly how many users

12:12.040 --> 12:17.800
have downloaded the ISO from the Ubuntu.com mirror, not the mirror run by your local university

12:17.800 --> 12:26.920
because obviously we can't count package updates or ISO downloads from mirrors, for instance.

12:26.920 --> 12:32.280
So in a way, yes, there will be a lot more information available about the general usage

12:32.280 --> 12:36.120
of Ubuntu, how and where.

12:36.120 --> 12:43.160
I actually hope that there's some interesting conclusions that can be drawn by people outside

12:43.160 --> 12:45.440
of Canonical.

12:45.440 --> 12:50.000
I often look at the stats that are published by Docker Hub.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.200
If you go to, you hit Docker's API, you can see pulls of the Ubuntu image or the CentOS

12:55.200 --> 13:00.440
image or the Debian image or the Mongo or the MySQL image, and I think part of that

13:00.440 --> 13:06.560
is obviously those are statistics that were anonymously gathered by your usage of the

13:06.560 --> 13:12.520
Docker binary fetching an image from Docker Hub, but the fact that that information is

13:12.520 --> 13:20.920
also available for others to consume and graph and plot and interpolate is I think that's

13:20.920 --> 13:24.080
part of the important social exchange.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.480
That is an interesting idea.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.920
So I want to ask you a couple of specifics about that really.

13:28.920 --> 13:32.440
So what you're really talking about is essentially making all this data public and then making

13:32.440 --> 13:38.000
JSON feeds or some sort of queryable feed available so people can programmatically generate

13:38.000 --> 13:39.200
graphs.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.080
That brings me to the infrastructure question.

13:41.080 --> 13:44.560
All of this I'm on board with and in fact, like I said, it kind of seems like it should

13:44.560 --> 13:46.540
have been done from day one.

13:46.540 --> 13:53.920
The part that I take pause with is the backend implementation of storing this data and verifying

13:53.920 --> 13:59.600
that it is being abstracted away from user identifiable information.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.040
How is that being put together?

14:01.040 --> 14:05.360
Because it seems like we're late in the 1804 game right now for that to be built, but I'm

14:05.360 --> 14:07.160
only looking at it from the outside.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.600
Sure.

14:08.600 --> 14:12.840
So that backend infrastructure is not yet implemented.

14:12.840 --> 14:17.280
In fact, right now we put this out on the Ubuntu Devel list that will post it to the

14:17.280 --> 14:22.840
Ubuntu Devel list, which is where we discuss proposals such as this.

14:22.840 --> 14:29.320
And if we started transmitting that information and just sent it to a dev null, nothing to

14:29.320 --> 14:37.720
catch it just yet, that would be okay in that eventually we will have that infrastructure

14:37.720 --> 14:39.000
in place and set up.

14:39.000 --> 14:46.940
Of course, we're based in Europe and have lots of users in Europe, and everybody knows

14:46.940 --> 14:53.000
the GDPR requirements come into play this year.

14:53.000 --> 14:59.800
And so Canonical as a company, as a business, we're under the regulation of the EU and we're

14:59.800 --> 15:01.040
taking this very seriously.

15:01.040 --> 15:07.120
So there should be every bit of confidence here that this data will be dealt with as

15:07.120 --> 15:13.200
anonymously as possible, and not just because we feel that we owe that to the free and open

15:13.200 --> 15:17.480
source community, but also because it's EU law, frankly, at this point.

15:17.480 --> 15:18.480
Yeah, okay.

15:18.480 --> 15:24.880
I mean, that, yeah, I completely forgot about the new rules coming into place and that does

15:24.880 --> 15:25.880
make sense.

15:25.880 --> 15:31.360
So my question then, I guess I go from that to, and I'm not sure if this is maybe a will

15:31.360 --> 15:37.760
question or a Dustin question, but let's assume this all gets worked out, stuff gets built

15:37.760 --> 15:42.840
in, the option in the installer is there where people can uncheck it.

15:42.840 --> 15:48.560
How does it affect distributions that are based on Ubuntu that are maybe using the Ubiquity

15:48.560 --> 15:49.560
installer?

15:49.560 --> 15:50.560
Sure.

15:50.560 --> 15:53.180
So I will throw a spotlight on that first point.

15:53.180 --> 16:01.480
This will be as easy to disable on any machine as clicking one box to uncheck and that disables

16:01.480 --> 16:03.320
all diagnostic information.

16:03.320 --> 16:06.660
So what we'll describe, there's basically three sets of information.

16:06.660 --> 16:12.940
One is a set of pretty generic statistics about a machine, how many disks, how many

16:12.940 --> 16:15.600
network cards, what sort of CPU.

16:15.600 --> 16:21.600
What that enables us to do is to ensure that the Ubuntu experience is optimized for the

16:21.600 --> 16:27.160
sort of moving target of what does the system hardware that Ubuntu is running on generally

16:27.160 --> 16:32.080
look like, where are the outliers, where's the sort of center of gravity.

16:32.080 --> 16:37.480
That bit of information is more or less a one shot, here's the hardware profile.

16:37.480 --> 16:40.520
Can we underscore that for a second because that was something that wasn't totally clear

16:40.520 --> 16:46.220
to me but because the way it's sort of worded in the email to the mailing list is it sort

16:46.220 --> 16:51.540
of sounds like when I think of user collection metrics, I think of Windows 10 telemetry and

16:51.540 --> 16:56.440
I think of almost constantly sending as I use my computer, sending back information

16:56.440 --> 17:01.980
but with the exception of package installations, it's essentially a one shot data collection.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.960
Is that accurate?

17:03.960 --> 17:04.960
That's right.

17:04.960 --> 17:07.760
So where'd this all come from was we were looking at the Ubuntu installer and we were

17:07.760 --> 17:13.440
debating as to whether some of the installation options made sense anymore.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.600
There was a checkbox at the very beginning which says automatically download updates

17:17.600 --> 17:22.160
while installing, which I always check because sure, when I'm done installing, I want to

17:22.160 --> 17:27.360
have all the updates and so I asked the team, hey, do people check that box or not?

17:27.360 --> 17:31.720
I'm curious, can we just get rid of that box and automatically download updates while installing

17:31.720 --> 17:32.720
them?

17:32.720 --> 17:33.720
And as it turns out, we don't know.

17:33.720 --> 17:38.760
We don't know how many people check the box that says install the MP3, yes, I want MP3s

17:38.760 --> 17:40.480
to work on my Ubuntu machine.

17:40.480 --> 17:45.120
We actually don't know how many people opt to encrypt their hard disk.

17:45.120 --> 17:49.200
I'm really keen to hear from the elementary OS guys about their disk encryption plans

17:49.200 --> 17:51.800
and sort of a place where I geek out about.

17:51.800 --> 17:56.900
We didn't actually know and at that point, we started looking at just the installer and

17:56.900 --> 18:04.560
being able to know what does the average Ubuntu user select as their base set of installation

18:04.560 --> 18:05.560
options?

18:05.560 --> 18:08.760
Are there some options we could just get rid of because they just don't make sense anymore?

18:08.760 --> 18:16.560
And in doing so, we combined that effort with another set of questions we had around what

18:16.560 --> 18:21.540
desktop apps are installed on the most Ubuntu machines as well as what are the buggiest

18:21.540 --> 18:23.200
apps in the Ubuntu archive?

18:23.200 --> 18:31.480
And we realized all of this really comes together in a general send diagnostics or don't option

18:31.480 --> 18:37.320
that we see in every operating system, be it Windows or Android or Mac.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.600
We'd like to do that tastefully and we will do that tastefully.

18:39.600 --> 18:44.960
And I think the fact that we're offering to share that information publicly hopefully

18:44.960 --> 18:49.520
makes it valuable to the average Ubuntu user.

18:49.520 --> 18:53.320
The average Ubuntu user will see a better Ubuntu experience.

18:53.320 --> 18:54.320
Sure.

18:54.320 --> 18:59.760
It just clearly gives you a better path to follow when you can see, oh, look at everybody

18:59.760 --> 19:00.960
is installing Thunderbird.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.780
It's just Thunderbird is getting removed from almost every system.

19:03.780 --> 19:08.980
And I go back to something we covered this week in Linux Action News is 1804 is going

19:08.980 --> 19:14.120
to feature a minimal install option which removes like 80 packages including Rhythmbox

19:14.120 --> 19:17.960
and Thunderbird and a few others that I don't generally use.

19:17.960 --> 19:22.040
And of course Canonical would have no way of knowing if anybody is using that unless

19:22.040 --> 19:24.320
they turn something like this on.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.760
And you can see what options people are doing during installation.

19:26.760 --> 19:30.280
But Dustin, I just want to underscore and make it super crazy clear for everybody listening

19:30.280 --> 19:34.480
because I think this is a really important point.

19:34.480 --> 19:40.720
The only ongoing data collection if somebody checks this box is if an app crashes and it

19:40.720 --> 19:43.000
will submit the crash in the background now.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
That's right.

19:44.000 --> 19:49.160
If package states change and then those statistics will get submitted, that's the only ongoing

19:49.160 --> 19:50.160
collection.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.160
That's right.

19:51.160 --> 19:57.600
So when a package crashes, AppOrt catches that crash and would send Canonical a crash

19:57.600 --> 19:58.600
report.

19:58.600 --> 20:03.560
And Will can talk about how we've used that, how that has helped identify some pretty major

20:03.560 --> 20:08.360
breakages in Ubuntu and we've been able to stave that off early.

20:08.360 --> 20:13.200
People who enable the proposed repository will start catching those packages if you

20:13.200 --> 20:14.200
chose.

20:14.200 --> 20:18.880
And then we cannot roll out that buggy fix to the masses of millions of Ubuntu users.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.720
So yes, that would be ongoing.

20:20.720 --> 20:25.840
The other one would be a periodic, and I don't know what the period is, I don't know if it's

20:25.840 --> 20:32.720
daily or weekly, but think on the order of daily or weekly, anonymous submission of the

20:32.720 --> 20:36.260
packages installed on the system.

20:36.260 --> 20:37.260
So that's PopCon.

20:37.260 --> 20:41.040
PopCon is what we're going to use, which has been in Debian for ages.

20:41.040 --> 20:45.560
We've been using PopCon, but we suspect that the number of users who go out of their way

20:45.560 --> 20:51.160
to enable PopCon on Ubuntu is probably less than 5%.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.720
And so it's not very representative.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.160
And you know who does enable it?

20:54.160 --> 20:59.020
Geeks, like you and me.

20:59.020 --> 21:02.200
Probably not the Ubuntu user at large who's never heard of PopCon.

21:02.200 --> 21:06.480
So our statistical bias there is quite high.

21:06.480 --> 21:13.080
So what do you know, Vim and Emacs are super high on the PopCon statistics list, meanwhile

21:13.080 --> 21:15.880
VLC is relatively low.

21:15.880 --> 21:16.880
Who would have thought?

21:16.880 --> 21:17.880
Yeah.

21:17.880 --> 21:18.880
Hmm.

21:18.880 --> 21:24.280
So to your point about using that data to catch stuff, Will, is that sort of, to Will

21:24.280 --> 21:29.600
here, is that sort of, Dustin being polite and saying this is one of the reasons why

21:29.600 --> 21:33.520
we're not shipping Whalen in 1804 is because of this data we've collected with the app

21:33.520 --> 21:34.520
crashes?

21:34.520 --> 21:35.520
Yeah, absolutely.

21:35.520 --> 21:39.440
If you go to errors.ubuntu.com, then you can see the sort of crash reports that we're getting

21:39.440 --> 21:40.440
in there.

21:40.440 --> 21:43.480
And you know, at the top of that list are the buggiest applications.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.200
And that is what we look at every day.

21:45.200 --> 21:48.120
And those are the bugs that we focus our efforts on.

21:48.120 --> 21:49.120
So yeah, absolutely.

21:49.120 --> 21:52.600
This is invaluable information for our team.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.800
Look at that big huge jump right there.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.800
Oh, Wayland.

21:55.800 --> 21:56.800
That's great.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.800
Yeah, errors.

21:57.800 --> 22:02.560
I don't think I've ever actually looked at the graph there at errors.ubuntu.com.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.840
That is pretty cool.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.160
So what's next?

22:05.160 --> 22:13.520
This is exactly errors.ubuntu.com is exactly the sort of information that we make public,

22:13.520 --> 22:14.960
that we collect and we make public.

22:14.960 --> 22:20.040
And I think this is, you know, we're not hiding what we're doing with this information.

22:20.040 --> 22:24.200
We're trying to make Ubuntu better by studying graphs like this.

22:24.200 --> 22:28.960
So this is obviously pretty important to get into 1804 because that's the next big one

22:28.960 --> 22:32.000
that people are going to be using for five years.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.640
So what's the next functional step?

22:33.640 --> 22:37.680
You guys are collecting feedback, do you start actually like building out the code on the

22:37.680 --> 22:38.680
client side?

22:38.680 --> 22:43.880
Do you start looking at mocking up ways for users to possibly disable this after install?

22:43.880 --> 22:50.640
Yeah, the mockups are public in that same thread that Will started on Ubuntu Devel.

22:50.640 --> 22:57.160
Canonical's lead UI UX designer, Matthew Paul Thomas, replied with a publicly visible Google

22:57.160 --> 23:00.720
doc, which is the design doc for the overall Ubuntu installer.

23:00.720 --> 23:02.680
It's 40 or 50 pages long.

23:02.680 --> 23:06.760
But if you control F, search in there for diagnostics, you'll land somewhere in the

23:06.760 --> 23:07.760
middle of that document.

23:07.760 --> 23:13.160
You can see the rough mockups from our UI UX team as to what the wording will look like,

23:13.160 --> 23:18.880
where it will fit into the flow of installing Ubuntu, and how it's enabled and disabled.

23:18.880 --> 23:23.680
So I guess I just, I have, well, one piece of advice, if I could for a moment, if I could

23:23.680 --> 23:30.000
be so brave, is to make it clear that if there's some way to keep it short, but make it clear

23:30.000 --> 23:34.540
that it's not this crazy ongoing metric collection, I think that's what people are worried about.

23:34.540 --> 23:38.960
But the question, I guess, that I think of from an end user perspective is, so say I

23:38.960 --> 23:46.400
go buy a Dell Sputnik XPS 13, I would assume that Dell is probably going to turn this on

23:46.400 --> 23:47.740
by default.

23:47.740 --> 23:51.440
And I don't go through that installation process as an OEM customer.

23:51.440 --> 23:54.580
What is going to be my opt out option in that scenario?

23:54.580 --> 23:58.200
And how likely is that feature to ship?

23:58.200 --> 24:03.200
Will, you want to talk a little bit about how this will be enabled, disabled after the

24:03.200 --> 24:04.800
fact in the system center?

24:04.800 --> 24:05.800
Sure, sure.

24:05.800 --> 24:12.760
So yeah, you go to the GNOME control center, GNOME settings, and in there, there's a privacy

24:12.760 --> 24:16.280
tab or option down the left hand side.

24:16.280 --> 24:20.160
And in there are all the usual privacy stuff which exists today, and there will be some

24:20.160 --> 24:21.680
extra buttons in there.

24:21.680 --> 24:25.520
We're still working through the designs, as Dustin said, where we're working with design

24:25.520 --> 24:29.600
on how granular we get at that point.

24:29.600 --> 24:37.440
Do we allow people to individually toggle the Apple reporting and the popcorn results?

24:37.440 --> 24:41.400
Or is that going to be confusing to the average Joe, and it should just be on or off?

24:41.400 --> 24:43.560
These are decisions which need to be made.

24:43.560 --> 24:47.880
But those settings will exist, they will exist on day one, and they'll be there to switch

24:47.880 --> 24:49.560
on and off as you choose.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.560
Right.

24:50.560 --> 24:54.360
So the Apple-based approach would be the binary, send statistics or not, keep it simple.

24:54.360 --> 24:59.080
Just one thing, the slightly more Linux approach would be, well, let's actually dissect that.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.000
Would you like to send crash reports, yes or no?

25:01.000 --> 25:04.240
Would you like to send package information, yes or no?

25:04.240 --> 25:07.520
Would you like to send hardware information, yes or no?

25:07.520 --> 25:09.040
So I think we're going to work through that.

25:09.040 --> 25:14.400
But as I said, we're soliciting feedback, and we're keen to hear from your users, your

25:14.400 --> 25:15.480
listeners as well.

25:15.480 --> 25:18.480
What's the most constructive way for them to get involved if they're fired up about

25:18.480 --> 25:23.640
this, and they want to constructively contribute?

25:23.640 --> 25:29.720
So let's point them to the Launchpad bug tracker.

25:29.720 --> 25:30.720
Okay.

25:30.720 --> 25:31.720
I do have one question.

25:31.720 --> 25:34.560
Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.

25:34.560 --> 25:38.040
So is there anything being done for de-averaging?

25:38.040 --> 25:43.740
I just think about my personal use case, where I install Linux, and a lot of times it gets

25:43.740 --> 25:49.520
to be Ubuntu, in a lot of old machines, that it's not the primary driver.

25:49.520 --> 25:54.000
And of course, that will definitely skew the statistics saying, hey, we have a bunch of

25:54.000 --> 25:55.000
old machines.

25:55.000 --> 25:58.760
Yeah, people firing things up to try it out, things like that.

25:58.760 --> 26:01.760
I think that's super important information, actually.

26:01.760 --> 26:07.440
I think it'll all come out as we start treating this data, millions of records, potentially.

26:07.440 --> 26:11.720
I think it's super interesting if there are still people using Ubuntu and expect Ubuntu

26:11.720 --> 26:16.840
to run on an ancient Dell netbook or something like that.

26:16.840 --> 26:19.280
I think that's important.

26:19.280 --> 26:23.640
The data will show 32-bit lives!

26:23.640 --> 26:30.760
What I really wanted to know is if you can disclose what type of strategy and if that

26:30.760 --> 26:32.640
information will also be released.

26:32.640 --> 26:37.240
Because de-averaging is definitely one of the hardest things to do properly when you

26:37.240 --> 26:39.040
have large data sets.

26:39.040 --> 26:44.520
So I'm interested to hear that side, because for me, as a developer, I can go into that

26:44.520 --> 26:48.520
list of information you're releasing, and I would be able to say, oh, so people are

26:48.520 --> 26:52.520
building for these low-end computers, better not use these new fancy features.

26:52.520 --> 26:56.520
But reality is, my target user base would still be on the fancy computer.

26:56.520 --> 27:04.360
So the question is, to sort of pare this down, the question really is, will you publicly

27:04.360 --> 27:08.440
be disclosing the math being used to average all this stuff out?

27:08.440 --> 27:09.440
Sure.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.600
I don't see why not.

27:11.600 --> 27:20.520
I predict no fewer than five master's thesis written in 2019 based on Ubuntu.com statistics.

27:20.520 --> 27:23.480
Five thesis and 25 conspiracies, Dustin.

27:23.480 --> 27:26.560
So producer Michael, I want to give you the last question, then we should probably move

27:26.560 --> 27:28.640
on, because I think producer Michael has a good one.

27:28.640 --> 27:35.340
Yeah, I was just wondering, the data itself is interesting, and the opt-out is something

27:35.340 --> 27:40.540
I actually think is potentially beneficial in another way that might not be considered

27:40.540 --> 27:41.860
in some people.

27:41.860 --> 27:46.520
But I was wondering, if you have it so that someone has to opt-out, and they check it

27:46.520 --> 27:51.400
to opt-out, would that information be sent to Canonical as well so that people would

27:51.400 --> 27:54.240
know how many people opt-out versus continue?

27:54.240 --> 27:55.240
One ping only.

27:55.240 --> 28:01.400
Yeah, that's the proposal right now, that there's one ping that says opt-out or statistics

28:01.400 --> 28:02.400
equals false.

28:02.400 --> 28:06.980
Once again, we throw away the IP address and the location information.

28:06.980 --> 28:14.040
But the simple ping of this user declined is important in understanding the statistical

28:14.040 --> 28:21.760
validity and the statistical power, and those are statistics terms, of the data set, actually.

28:21.760 --> 28:29.160
If you don't know how big the data set is, the data is only so useful.

28:29.160 --> 28:30.160
I agree.

28:30.160 --> 28:31.160
Yeah, I agree.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.360
So let's start the ridiculous outrage right now.

28:33.360 --> 28:36.200
Canonical's even tracking me when I tell them not to track me.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.200
There you go.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.480
I said it first, so now you can make fun of anybody else who says it after me.

28:40.480 --> 28:42.800
It's a spyware.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.560
Guys, this is all fascinating.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.080
I'm really curious to see where this goes.

28:47.080 --> 28:50.280
Is there any other points you wanted to get out there before we move on to some of our

28:50.280 --> 28:51.280
other news?

28:51.280 --> 29:00.720
So I'm just curious, how much would this impact trying to get more OEMs to try to deploy Ubuntu

29:00.720 --> 29:02.880
on their machines as an option?

29:02.880 --> 29:08.320
Hmm, well we know until we see the data, that's really the thing.

29:08.320 --> 29:13.240
Potentially it has a lot of potential because they actually would have data.

29:13.240 --> 29:18.360
I've been around Canonical for over 10 years now, and in the early days it was trying to

29:18.360 --> 29:25.800
convince Dell and Lenovo and others to take a chance on this crazy open source Linux distribution

29:25.800 --> 29:30.500
at a time when Windows and Mac sort of dominated the market.

29:30.500 --> 29:37.920
There was no Chrome OS, there was no Android, and it was super difficult to show the size

29:37.920 --> 29:40.720
of the free and open source community.

29:40.720 --> 29:47.660
I think if nothing else, even non-Ubuntu users hopefully can understand and appreciate that

29:47.660 --> 29:53.520
this sort of information will help all open source projects make their case that, hey,

29:53.520 --> 30:00.640
we do deserve, we, the open source community, do deserve a seat at the table at any OEM,

30:00.640 --> 30:07.400
ODM discussion, and hardware enablement from your latest Bluetooth and Wi-Fi and graphics

30:07.400 --> 30:10.080
adapter just working out of the box with Linux.

30:10.080 --> 30:11.720
All of that has to happen upstream.

30:11.720 --> 30:13.460
Someone has to pay for that development.

30:13.460 --> 30:19.320
Some product manager somewhere has to make the case that there's enough Linux users out

30:19.320 --> 30:21.800
there to make this justified exactly.

30:21.800 --> 30:26.640
Yeah, that could be a huge contribution if you think about it.

30:26.640 --> 30:31.040
That could really be a massive amount of data because one of the things that seems to be

30:31.040 --> 30:37.580
definitely true just from an observational standpoint is nothing puts the stress on a

30:37.580 --> 30:40.160
project like Ubuntu shipping it by default.

30:40.160 --> 30:44.800
Once it starts, I mean, you can have, with all respect to the projects like Fedora and

30:44.800 --> 30:48.160
others that will ship Wayland and ship the GNOME desktop for years and do a really good

30:48.160 --> 30:52.840
job of getting that shipping, but there's nothing like Ubuntu shipping something by

30:52.840 --> 30:57.800
default because it puts a whole nother category of stress on something.

30:57.800 --> 31:02.080
And it's way more eyes, it's way more different flavors of users.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.840
It's a totally different world.

31:03.840 --> 31:10.480
And so if we could start to, as the community, get data from this huge distribution, massively

31:10.480 --> 31:13.480
beneficial, even if you're not using Ubuntu.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.920
And the fact that you guys are gonna make it clear and easy to uncheck the box, I just

31:15.920 --> 31:18.280
really, I can't find anything to be super upset about this.

31:18.280 --> 31:19.280
And I would love to.

31:19.280 --> 31:20.280
I love me a good ramp.

31:20.280 --> 31:21.280
It'd be a great story.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.280
Yeah.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.280
It sounds pretty solid.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.280
So guys, thanks for coming on here.

31:24.280 --> 31:25.280
Will and Dustin.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.280
I really appreciate hearing it from you directly.

31:27.280 --> 31:28.280
Thank you very much.

31:28.280 --> 31:33.600
And I'll be keeping an eye on how this all goes and see what goes, where things, where

31:33.600 --> 31:34.600
things develop.

31:34.600 --> 31:35.600
What do you think, Wes?

31:35.600 --> 31:36.600
Yeah.

31:36.600 --> 31:40.400
I think you're absolutely right and that we have this wonderful open source ecosystem.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.800
And so it seems like there will only benefit any number of different projects.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.800
It is the era of data and it's another way to contribute now.

31:45.800 --> 31:46.800
Yeah.

31:46.800 --> 31:47.800
It is data.

31:47.800 --> 31:48.800
And if it can be done in a tasteful way that doesn't like …

31:48.800 --> 31:49.800
Up front and …

31:49.800 --> 31:52.800
I like that the location stuff is country level too.

31:52.800 --> 31:55.240
That makes me feel way better about it.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.240
I like it.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.240
All right.

31:57.240 --> 31:58.240
Well, we'll let you guys know though.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.720
It'll be something we look at in our 1804 review.

31:59.720 --> 32:03.200
So we'll know when it ships, whatever state it does ship.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.200
Let's keep going though.

32:04.200 --> 32:05.840
We have so much more to get into.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.800
I wanna take a moment and thank Ting for sponsoring the program here.

32:08.800 --> 32:13.120
Ting is pay for what you use mobile, a fair price for how much you talk, text and data

32:13.120 --> 32:19.760
you use with nationwide coverage, no contracts, no sneaky agreements, anything weird like

32:19.760 --> 32:20.760
that in there.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.120
It's just simple pay for what you use.

32:23.120 --> 32:28.920
I think I pay somewhere around 40 bucks, usually just below that for three lines.

32:28.920 --> 32:30.760
Average Ting bill is $23 per phone.

32:30.760 --> 32:31.760
I know.

32:31.760 --> 32:32.760
And you know what, Wes?

32:32.760 --> 32:33.760
It's their birthday.

32:33.760 --> 32:34.760
Is it?

32:34.760 --> 32:35.760
It's happy birthday, Ting.

32:35.760 --> 32:36.760
I know.

32:36.760 --> 32:37.760
I know.

32:37.760 --> 32:41.780
And to celebrate, they're giving away shirts because you get presents for Ting's birthday.

32:41.780 --> 32:42.780
First 100 Ting customers.

32:42.780 --> 32:43.780
I gotta get them.

32:43.780 --> 32:44.780
That is.

32:44.780 --> 32:48.640
I actually should ask Kyra who did their swag for that, because that is legit.

32:48.640 --> 32:52.360
And I wouldn't mind getting that same person to do some swag for us.

32:52.360 --> 32:53.360
Koda Radio?

32:53.360 --> 32:54.360
Damn near 300 episodes.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.360
I gotta get some good...

32:55.360 --> 32:56.360
Whoa!

32:56.360 --> 32:57.360
I gotta...

32:57.360 --> 32:58.360
That's some legit swag.

32:58.360 --> 33:00.200
So the first 100 customers at Ting get that.

33:00.200 --> 33:06.960
I don't think I'm in the first 100, but I've been there for almost four years, so I gotta

33:06.960 --> 33:07.960
be in the range.

33:07.960 --> 33:08.960
I don't know.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.200
I wish I could be a Ting hipster.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.760
Anyways, they're still giving away some, so maybe I could still get one and you can too.

33:12.760 --> 33:18.120
If you go to the Ting blog, but start, do us a favor, start by going to linux.ting.com.

33:18.120 --> 33:23.600
That'll take $25 off a device or $25 in credit if you bring a device.

33:23.600 --> 33:28.300
They've got a great control panel, fantastic customer service, and tons of devices to choose

33:28.300 --> 33:30.200
from.

33:30.200 --> 33:34.180
And really, the best customer support ever, linux.ting.com.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.760
Go follow them on the Twitters, too.

33:35.760 --> 33:42.360
That's how I found out about their t-shirt giveaway, their Ting FTW on the Twitter, linux.ting.com.

33:42.360 --> 33:45.120
And a big thanks to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program.

33:45.120 --> 33:47.000
Boom-da-boom, boom-da-boom, boom-da-boom.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.680
I like the drums there, Wes.

33:48.680 --> 33:49.680
You knew where I was going.

33:49.680 --> 33:50.680
I sure do.

33:50.680 --> 33:53.920
Wes was air drumming while I did that.

33:53.920 --> 33:56.840
Dude, that's almost worth putting a camera on you just for that.

33:56.840 --> 34:02.200
All right, well, so you heard Dustin mention it there, and I teased it in the intro.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.080
The Crazy Cats over at Pop!

34:04.080 --> 34:08.340
OS in elementary got together and decided, you know what we need to do?

34:08.340 --> 34:14.640
We need to collaborate on making it possible to ship encryption turned on by default on

34:14.640 --> 34:17.200
future System76 machines running Pop!

34:17.200 --> 34:19.600
OS and elementary OS installs.

34:19.600 --> 34:25.260
So to tell us about this crazy work is Cassidy and Dan from elementary OS and slash System76

34:25.260 --> 34:27.120
in Cassidy's case to tell us all about this.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.840
So guys, where do you think we should start?

34:28.840 --> 34:32.600
Cassy, should we start with you and tell us about the work, sort of the collab work between

34:32.600 --> 34:33.600
Pop!

34:33.600 --> 34:34.840
OS and elementary on this here thing?

34:34.840 --> 34:35.840
Sure.

34:35.840 --> 34:36.840
Yeah.

34:36.840 --> 34:37.840
Okay.

34:37.840 --> 34:38.840
Okay.

34:38.840 --> 34:39.840
So how did that kick off?

34:39.840 --> 34:44.480
I mean, I know you are kind of, you're kind of in a good position there being involved

34:44.480 --> 34:50.360
in both elementary OS and working for System76 as an employee, but that didn't necessarily

34:50.360 --> 34:51.920
mean this had to come about.

34:51.920 --> 34:52.920
Right.

34:52.920 --> 34:56.560
Well, obviously I'm a secret agent for elementary within System76.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.240
It's a long play.

34:58.240 --> 34:59.240
That's a long play, Cassy.

34:59.240 --> 35:00.240
It's a long play.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.240
No.

35:01.240 --> 35:08.320
So, um, yeah, like I've been using, I had been using elementary OS at System76 for quite

35:08.320 --> 35:09.320
some time.

35:09.320 --> 35:14.000
Um, and you know, anytime you can collaborate with another project, it's a good idea to

35:14.000 --> 35:15.000
think about it.

35:15.000 --> 35:16.000
Yeah.

35:16.000 --> 35:17.000
Yeah.

35:17.000 --> 35:20.680
Really, especially if it's something like working on an installer together, that seems

35:20.680 --> 35:24.680
to be like a solid sort of collection of resources and efforts.

35:24.680 --> 35:25.680
Yeah.

35:25.680 --> 35:29.320
And so we had, we've done a little bit of collaboration in the past with like app center.

35:29.320 --> 35:33.960
So elementary developed app center and pop OS is using it as a pop shop, which is just

35:33.960 --> 35:37.840
a really simple front end for the, uh, repositories.

35:37.840 --> 35:38.840
Okay.

35:38.840 --> 35:45.480
But we decided, you know, elementary had designed this spec for an installer and we'd actually,

35:45.480 --> 35:46.480
we'd been working on it for years.

35:46.480 --> 35:49.880
Um, just kind of on as a back burner, like, Hey, someday when we get the resources to

35:49.880 --> 35:52.920
do this, we should, this is what we want the experience to look like.

35:52.920 --> 35:53.920
Yeah.

35:53.920 --> 35:54.920
Okay.

35:54.920 --> 35:59.080
Um, and System76 when they kicked off pop OS, um, they were kind of thinking the same

35:59.080 --> 36:03.560
thing like, Hey, we have a chance to really tailor the install experience.

36:03.560 --> 36:10.520
You have the people's first touch of pop OS and System76, um, with an installer and they

36:10.520 --> 36:14.320
looked at the elementary spec for our installer and they liked it.

36:14.320 --> 36:17.240
And so we got together and hacked on it for a week.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.240
Okay.

36:18.240 --> 36:19.240
Fair enough.

36:19.240 --> 36:20.240
So we did that.

36:20.240 --> 36:24.920
Uh, I forget when the first hack fest was, but that was, it was a few months ago.

36:24.920 --> 36:31.100
We did a first like initial hack fest, went over the spec and, uh, went over the designs

36:31.100 --> 36:33.000
that we had already designed.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.640
Uh, we, we updated them.

36:34.640 --> 36:39.320
The elementary guys worked on the front end and the, uh, System76 people worked on the

36:39.320 --> 36:43.760
backend and it, it got off to a great start.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.660
Um, I think we have an upcoming blog post about that.

36:46.660 --> 36:48.680
That one's not published yet.

36:48.680 --> 36:53.740
Um, but after working on that a bit, we decided to get back together and this was last month

36:53.740 --> 36:58.400
to continue working on it and discuss, um, kind of where we are and what we want to do

36:58.400 --> 36:59.400
next.

36:59.400 --> 37:00.400
Hmm.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.200
And is that when the topic of encryption came up?

37:02.200 --> 37:03.200
Precisely.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.200
Yeah.

37:04.200 --> 37:09.160
So, um, a lot of System76 customers actually require full disk encryption.

37:09.160 --> 37:14.800
So that's, you know, high security environments, some of the strictest security, uh, requirements,

37:14.800 --> 37:20.320
uh, they have to have their entire disk encrypted and that's something you can't really do out

37:20.320 --> 37:22.400
of the box well today.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.640
Um, it requires you reinstall the OS.

37:25.640 --> 37:29.240
So what we would have is we'd have customers who were getting the OS or getting, getting

37:29.240 --> 37:34.240
System76 hardware, then downloading the OS and then having to flashing into a flash drive,

37:34.240 --> 37:38.720
wiping their computer, reinstalling, and then probably forgetting to install the PPA and

37:38.720 --> 37:42.520
it's, you know, it's like the purpose of, you know, out of the box experience out of

37:42.520 --> 37:43.520
the box.

37:43.520 --> 37:44.520
Right.

37:44.520 --> 37:45.520
Yeah.

37:45.520 --> 37:46.520
Okay.

37:46.520 --> 37:47.520
So it was really important to System76 to have encryption out of the box cause that's

37:47.520 --> 37:49.000
a big requirement for a lot of our customers.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.000
Okay.

37:50.000 --> 37:54.800
So we started thinking, you know, if we're working on this installer, we have an opportunity

37:54.800 --> 37:58.120
to ship encryption out of the box.

37:58.120 --> 38:00.120
And so that's what that blog post was about.

38:00.120 --> 38:07.220
Um, and figuring out and really, you know what, when I, when I went through this, um,

38:07.220 --> 38:12.180
what I realized Cassidy is that it is way more complicated than just checking a box

38:12.180 --> 38:13.180
by default.

38:13.180 --> 38:19.040
Like you have stuff in here about recovery partitions and essentially like escape hatches.

38:19.040 --> 38:23.640
Can you talk, so what is that, what's the big, what's the big, what's the big problem

38:23.640 --> 38:24.640
by turning this on by default?

38:24.640 --> 38:27.440
Cause obviously if it was just checking a box, that probably would have been done five

38:27.440 --> 38:28.440
years ago.

38:28.440 --> 38:29.440
Right.

38:29.440 --> 38:32.800
So yeah, the biggest, I mean, there's kind of two things.

38:32.800 --> 38:36.360
There's the technical implications and the UX implications.

38:36.360 --> 38:37.360
Sure.

38:37.360 --> 38:38.360
Yeah.

38:38.360 --> 38:43.120
Um, the, the technical implications are that you can't ship a computer that's encrypted

38:43.120 --> 38:49.040
out of the box, uh, and have that actually be acceptable because the OEM then has the

38:49.040 --> 38:50.040
encryption key.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.040
Right.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.640
And they probably generate it from some sort of standard image.

38:52.640 --> 38:56.520
So if they have some sort of flaw in their process, it could become predictable.

38:56.520 --> 38:59.480
I would imagine that's something to worry about too, is like you have to make sure you're

38:59.480 --> 39:02.560
encrypting it in a way where the user owns the password.

39:02.560 --> 39:03.640
Yeah.

39:03.640 --> 39:08.040
And there can't be an opportunity for the OEM to get that password because then it's,

39:08.040 --> 39:11.280
it's not as, you know, it's just useless and you have to reinstall it anyway.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.280
How do you do that?

39:12.280 --> 39:15.000
How do you do that when you're, when you're shipping it pre-built?

39:15.000 --> 39:19.440
So we, uh, we started talking about this idea of a recovery partition and this is something

39:19.440 --> 39:20.840
other OSs do.

39:20.840 --> 39:26.000
Um, but it's where basically you have an install media as a small partition on the drive out

39:26.000 --> 39:27.000
of the box.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
Um, and this gives you, you know, if you totally screw up your system and need to reinstall,

39:32.000 --> 39:37.960
it means you can just reboot into the restore partition and reinstall without having to

39:37.960 --> 39:40.420
go get a flash drive or anything.

39:40.420 --> 39:46.040
And with that comes the ability to reinstall the OS as soon as you get it.

39:46.040 --> 39:49.440
So you're, you could still technically be reinstalling the OS when you get it, but it

39:49.440 --> 39:53.400
removes the need to go get a flash drive and download the OS again and everything.

39:53.400 --> 39:58.960
So with our installer, the idea is you can, when you receive the computer, you open it

39:58.960 --> 40:02.640
up and as far as, as far as the user is concerned, it says, you know, Hey, do you want to encrypt

40:02.640 --> 40:03.640
your drive?

40:03.640 --> 40:04.960
And you can say, yeah, sure.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.520
That sounds great.

40:06.520 --> 40:09.920
And what it's actually doing under the hood is reinstalling the entire OS.

40:09.920 --> 40:10.920
Wow.

40:10.920 --> 40:14.800
But you don't realize it and then you reboot and you're off and you set up your user and

40:14.800 --> 40:15.800
you're good to go.

40:15.800 --> 40:19.680
So it's still pretty close to the old out of the box experience.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.800
They don't have to go through all about the full installer.

40:21.800 --> 40:26.680
They get boot started halfway through, but under the hood it's all still new.

40:26.680 --> 40:27.680
Yeah.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.880
And so this installer has a mode like it, so it has an OEM mode and then it must have

40:30.880 --> 40:33.160
like a, like a, just a regular end user mode.

40:33.160 --> 40:37.780
If I download the ISO and I installed Juno or pop OS, I get the installer that lets me

40:37.780 --> 40:39.660
do it at the time of installation.

40:39.660 --> 40:44.880
But then there's like, there's, there's been allowances made for the OEM to set it up.

40:44.880 --> 40:49.800
And the settings at the OEM sets must translate through re-installation, I would assume.

40:49.800 --> 40:50.800
Yeah.

40:50.800 --> 40:53.340
That's the idea is that we precede as much information as we can.

40:53.340 --> 40:58.120
So if you know, if you choose a language or if you choose, you know, any settings that

40:58.120 --> 41:02.000
you choose get restored back when you do the re-install.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.400
New packages, different PPAs?

41:04.400 --> 41:07.640
I'm not sure what all that is right now.

41:07.640 --> 41:11.760
And is this going to be available in elementary OS as well as pop OS?

41:11.760 --> 41:14.480
Uh, hopefully, eventually.

41:14.480 --> 41:15.800
Good man.

41:15.800 --> 41:18.880
You don't want to say for sure, cause it's all like future stuff.

41:18.880 --> 41:19.880
Yeah.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.200
Our standard line is, you know, when it's ready.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.200
Yeah.

41:22.200 --> 41:25.800
When it's, I see that actually, it's literally the ending line to the blog post.

41:25.800 --> 41:26.800
Yeah.

41:26.800 --> 41:31.520
So the goal would be to ship it in the next version of elementary OS and pop OS.

41:31.520 --> 41:36.120
I think in both of those cases, we both, System76 and elementary have a backup plan of shipping

41:36.120 --> 41:39.960
ubiquity as is, if, you know, things don't get done in time.

41:39.960 --> 41:44.380
Because I think we're both aiming to release in April or as close to that as we can.

41:44.380 --> 41:48.680
So you know, there's that a little bit of a time crunch and you've got to figure out

41:48.680 --> 41:54.200
if it's worth shipping an entirely new and less tested installer or shipping the old

41:54.200 --> 41:55.200
and...

41:55.200 --> 41:58.320
Well, to that point, there must have been, I mean, there must have been some discussion

41:58.320 --> 42:03.720
between the teams there where you're looking at the things you need to accomplish.

42:03.720 --> 42:10.680
And I don't, because I wasn't there, the top three on my list installer wouldn't have been

42:10.680 --> 42:11.680
there.

42:11.680 --> 42:12.680
So why was installer number one?

42:12.680 --> 42:15.960
Like, what was the background to say, we really got to address this problem?

42:15.960 --> 42:20.240
And I'm particularly interested from the pop OS perspective, because to me, it seems like

42:20.240 --> 42:24.480
the majority of the pop OS customers are going to experience the OEM install.

42:24.480 --> 42:29.880
They're probably using pop OS pre-installed, but the installer was still a high priority.

42:29.880 --> 42:35.080
So do you have any background on sort of that and kind of what the goal is there?

42:35.080 --> 42:36.760
Sure.

42:36.760 --> 42:42.120
With pop OS, I mean, it is definitely, it's made for system 76, like first and foremost,

42:42.120 --> 42:45.300
but we definitely want it to be usable by anybody out there.

42:45.300 --> 42:49.440
So installing, you know, the first experience you get when you're installing is still your

42:49.440 --> 42:53.880
first experience with system 76, if you didn't buy a computer from system 76.

42:53.880 --> 42:57.800
So when you buy a computer, you're getting it in, you're going to the website, you're

42:57.800 --> 43:01.720
getting the packaging, you're opening it up, you're getting the first experience of the

43:01.720 --> 43:02.720
hardware.

43:02.720 --> 43:04.880
So you have a good first experience there.

43:04.880 --> 43:08.780
But when you're installing pop OS, you know, on some other machine, your first experience

43:08.780 --> 43:10.440
is really the installation.

43:10.440 --> 43:14.640
So we wanted to make sure that no matter how you experience system 76, it's a good first

43:14.640 --> 43:15.640
experience.

43:15.640 --> 43:16.640
Sure.

43:16.640 --> 43:18.920
And if I go through that and I go, damn, that was pretty smooth, I might think, I wonder

43:18.920 --> 43:20.720
what else they do that's smooth like that.

43:20.720 --> 43:21.720
Right, right.

43:21.720 --> 43:24.920
It's, you know, the whole interaction is important.

43:24.920 --> 43:31.560
And then even with the OEM installer, or even with the OEM installation, when you get it,

43:31.560 --> 43:34.880
you still do go through that first setup right out of the box.

43:34.880 --> 43:39.200
So you're still actually going through part of the installer process, especially with

43:39.200 --> 43:43.160
the full disk encryption, that was really important that you would actually have to

43:43.160 --> 43:44.160
go through an installer process.

43:44.160 --> 43:47.560
It can't be a user setup if you're going to fully encrypt the disk.

43:47.560 --> 43:50.960
So encryption by default, I think everybody in our audience is going to be pretty on board

43:50.960 --> 43:51.960
with that.

43:51.960 --> 43:54.920
A question from Noah that sometimes folks have issues when they're updating like Nvidia

43:54.920 --> 43:57.240
binary drivers and whatnot.

43:57.240 --> 44:00.280
Did you run into those issues and have to sort of test through that?

44:00.280 --> 44:02.800
I mean, we're always doing constant testing on things.

44:02.800 --> 44:06.400
We have a QA team that does that at system 76.

44:06.400 --> 44:11.120
But it's kind of to the point where technically it works really well.

44:11.120 --> 44:15.080
The people who know it doesn't work for them have an option to just not encrypt right out

44:15.080 --> 44:16.080
of the box.

44:16.080 --> 44:17.200
Sure, right.

44:17.200 --> 44:20.880
But I think, you know, pushing it by default, it's secure by default, like that's protecting

44:20.880 --> 44:24.400
user data by default is what you should be doing in today's day and age.

44:24.400 --> 44:26.920
So I think it's important to get it out there by default.

44:26.920 --> 44:32.420
And that also helps, you know, add a whole lot more testing in after we obviously test

44:32.420 --> 44:37.920
it at system 76, that also adds a lot of testing out there in the real world if it's shipping

44:37.920 --> 44:38.920
by default.

44:38.920 --> 44:43.040
Yeah, I mean, when you think about it, laptops are becoming more and more the primary machine

44:43.040 --> 44:44.680
for a lot of people doing work.

44:44.680 --> 44:48.680
And so that's really where the use case is to encrypt your data.

44:48.680 --> 44:53.840
Maybe if you have a desktop that's 75 pounds and sitting on your in your home office.

44:53.840 --> 44:54.840
I don't know.

44:54.840 --> 44:58.440
But for a laptop, like, you know, you you're always working on on your laptop.

44:58.440 --> 45:01.700
And especially I can imagine you have many clients, you know, that's a absolutely many

45:01.700 --> 45:02.700
standards required.

45:02.700 --> 45:03.700
And good on you guys.

45:03.700 --> 45:06.160
I think people are going to really like this.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.360
And it's pretty cool to see the collaboration there, too.

45:08.360 --> 45:10.280
It seems like a natural fit.

45:10.280 --> 45:18.160
I'm waiting for the day when I can buy a system 76 machine in the currency of my choice with

45:18.160 --> 45:19.520
elementary OS pre installed.

45:19.520 --> 45:20.520
That is going to happen.

45:20.520 --> 45:21.520
It's going to happen.

45:21.520 --> 45:25.160
Of course, the currency of choice will see it's always changing.

45:25.160 --> 45:26.160
But good stuff, guys.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.160
I'm here.

45:27.160 --> 45:31.560
I just want to add kudos to the elementary OS guys.

45:31.560 --> 45:32.560
That's fantastic.

45:32.560 --> 45:37.840
I've spent a lot of my career working on disk encryption and encryption in Ubuntu.

45:37.840 --> 45:42.080
And I applaud you for the work and development that you've done here.

45:42.080 --> 45:43.080
I think it's fantastic.

45:43.080 --> 45:44.080
Yeah, thank you.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.080
Yeah, I agree.

45:45.080 --> 45:50.160
And it's going to be great to get more end users banging on this for everybody.

45:50.160 --> 45:51.160
That's the thing.

45:51.160 --> 45:54.560
Plus, as Linux users, we love to talk about how secure our operating system is.

45:54.560 --> 45:56.920
But a lot of times it's far behind unless you know what you're doing.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.440
So this is a great step in that direction.

45:58.440 --> 46:00.240
And you know what else the takeaway story is?

46:00.240 --> 46:05.760
The big story is the 1804 installer and distros that are based on 1804 and their installers

46:05.760 --> 46:09.440
are about to get a lot more interesting in this next release cycle.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.240
There's new things that are coming.

46:11.240 --> 46:14.200
Just really quickly, too, while we're talking about new things that are coming.

46:14.200 --> 46:15.960
Did you see Gnome Usage?

46:15.960 --> 46:22.480
Gnome Usage and Gnome 3.28, speaking of 1804, and another distro shipping Gnome 328.

46:22.480 --> 46:23.660
There's a new app in there.

46:23.660 --> 46:25.240
It's called Gnome Usage.

46:25.240 --> 46:28.100
It's sort of basic at this point.

46:28.100 --> 46:30.560
It really kind of shows you two things.

46:30.560 --> 46:34.400
It shows you your resources and your storage.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.400
And that's...

46:35.400 --> 46:36.400
What else is there?

46:36.400 --> 46:37.400
That's kind of it.

46:37.400 --> 46:38.400
And it's current.

46:38.400 --> 46:39.760
It's real time like what's happening right now.

46:39.760 --> 46:41.720
It's not like historical.

46:41.720 --> 46:44.400
User usage, memory usage, network usage, and storage usage.

46:44.400 --> 46:46.480
It actually looks decent, though.

46:46.480 --> 46:49.600
It's something that's actually been in work for two years, as Joey points out over at

46:49.600 --> 46:53.200
OMG Ubuntu, and it does not replace Gnome System Monitor.

46:53.200 --> 46:54.200
Don't worry.

46:54.200 --> 46:57.080
Your beloved System Monitor is still there.

46:57.080 --> 47:00.840
In fact, it's getting a couple of new features, including improved support for dark themes

47:00.840 --> 47:01.840
in Gnome 328.

47:01.840 --> 47:02.840
So there you go.

47:02.840 --> 47:07.640
Even though I'm recording this on a plasma desktop, still giving you some Gnome updates,

47:07.640 --> 47:08.640
right?

47:08.640 --> 47:10.180
Hey, we can do that here.

47:10.180 --> 47:12.880
We may have done the plasma challenge and found it to be...

47:12.880 --> 47:14.680
Well, all of us except for Poppy.

47:14.680 --> 47:17.600
Rumor has it Poppy moved off like some sort of vagabond.

47:17.600 --> 47:18.600
Shut your filthy mouth.

47:18.600 --> 47:19.600
No, I didn't.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.600
Oh, really?

47:20.600 --> 47:21.600
Oh.

47:21.600 --> 47:24.200
I'm still using KDE Neon like a champ.

47:24.200 --> 47:25.200
It's great.

47:25.200 --> 47:27.600
In fact, I haven't even rebooted since I installed it.

47:27.600 --> 47:28.600
No kidding.

47:28.600 --> 47:31.080
I actually wouldn't have either, but we had a power outage over the weekend here at the

47:31.080 --> 47:32.080
studio.

47:32.080 --> 47:34.120
So a couple of my KDE machines did have to reboot.

47:34.120 --> 47:35.120
Okay.

47:35.120 --> 47:36.120
All right.

47:36.120 --> 47:37.120
Well, there you go.

47:37.120 --> 47:38.120
The rumors before the show were false.

47:38.120 --> 47:39.120
Yeah, there's been some false gossip.

47:39.120 --> 47:40.120
Wow.

47:40.120 --> 47:41.120
I don't know if we've ever had...

47:41.120 --> 47:42.120
Sorry about that.

47:42.120 --> 47:44.360
I don't know if we've ever had a challenge stick like this before.

47:44.360 --> 47:45.800
You know, I'll say this too.

47:45.800 --> 47:51.800
The other day, I had my machine up for a while and I went to go resize some windows and it

47:51.800 --> 47:53.560
was still fast.

47:53.560 --> 47:59.000
That sounds like a small thing, but it's all it takes to make me happy is that the fact

47:59.000 --> 48:01.320
that I can resize windows and it's not super...

48:01.320 --> 48:02.320
Responsive to the last.

48:02.320 --> 48:03.320
You know what?

48:03.320 --> 48:04.320
It has been.

48:04.320 --> 48:05.320
And I really like it.

48:05.320 --> 48:06.320
Well, there you go.

48:06.320 --> 48:09.560
A little update there and some new toys coming to the Gnome desktop in three, two, eight.

48:09.560 --> 48:11.360
Lots of goodies coming down the...

48:11.360 --> 48:13.040
Just a couple of weeks away, actually.

48:13.040 --> 48:14.920
I was going to say, coming down the river.

48:14.920 --> 48:17.600
Yeah, this sounds like the future, but it's basically tomorrow.

48:17.600 --> 48:19.280
It's like a few episodes out.

48:19.280 --> 48:20.280
Just a...

48:20.280 --> 48:21.280
Boy, we have so much to get to.

48:21.280 --> 48:22.280
I'm excited.

48:22.280 --> 48:24.360
You know what else is just a few episodes out is scale.

48:24.360 --> 48:25.600
Scale's coming up really soon too.

48:25.600 --> 48:27.480
And then shortly after that, it's Linux Fest.

48:27.480 --> 48:28.480
Whoa.

48:28.480 --> 48:30.280
Where will we find the time?

48:30.280 --> 48:32.840
You sure you don't want to jump on Lady Joops and just come down to scale, Wes?

48:32.840 --> 48:34.840
I mean, I'll put out the couch for you.

48:34.840 --> 48:35.840
Now that is very tempting.

48:35.840 --> 48:36.840
You know what?

48:36.840 --> 48:39.280
Take a little road trip in Lady Joops.

48:39.280 --> 48:41.680
There's nothing like traveling in Joops down to California.

48:41.680 --> 48:44.200
I'll tell you what, you know, you could keep Levi company.

48:44.200 --> 48:46.160
I was going to say, if there's Levi involved.

48:46.160 --> 48:47.160
All right.

48:47.160 --> 48:51.880
Well, before we get into the rest of the community news, including that bogus Linux vulnerability,

48:51.880 --> 48:57.080
OpenStreetMap woes, and my big announcement, let's talk about DigitalOcean, simplicity

48:57.080 --> 48:58.360
at scale.

48:58.360 --> 49:02.160
It's a platform you can spin up infrastructure on in seconds.

49:02.160 --> 49:06.580
Everything is SSD based, and they just recently revamped the pricing.

49:06.580 --> 49:08.560
And this just in from the back office here, Wes.

49:08.560 --> 49:09.560
Big news.

49:09.560 --> 49:11.200
Chris really blew it.

49:11.200 --> 49:15.160
Wes was here when I got the note, which you can hear is a physical is actually so fresh

49:15.160 --> 49:16.160
and clean.

49:16.160 --> 49:18.000
It's a physical note.

49:18.000 --> 49:22.280
And and I believe my exact words were, Oh, God, I am such an idiot.

49:22.280 --> 49:23.280
That's exactly verbatim.

49:23.280 --> 49:26.040
Yeah, I got an email here printed out for me.

49:26.040 --> 49:29.520
If you guys go to if you're a new customer, you got to be a new DO customer.

49:29.520 --> 49:31.640
Sorry, this is a new customer only thing.

49:31.640 --> 49:39.520
If you go to do.co slash unplugged for 60 days, you can get $100 credit at DigitalOcean.

49:39.520 --> 49:40.520
What?

49:40.520 --> 49:44.100
Yeah, I usually say a $10 credit.

49:44.100 --> 49:47.280
They update a little bit for because they've just recently rolled out a whole bunch of

49:47.280 --> 49:48.320
new features.

49:48.320 --> 49:51.000
They've made their pricing even more competitive.

49:51.000 --> 49:54.160
And they have new flexible droplets at $15 a month.

49:54.160 --> 49:57.440
You can mix and match resources the most appropriate for your application.

49:57.440 --> 50:00.780
They have their big memory and CPU optimized droplets and of course, my favorite the three

50:00.780 --> 50:03.600
cents an hour just got all the droplets got better.

50:03.600 --> 50:07.680
If you if you've been listening to the show for a while and you built a machine on DigitalOcean,

50:07.680 --> 50:08.680
go upgrade it.

50:08.680 --> 50:09.680
You just have to shut it down.

50:09.680 --> 50:10.680
Do the upgrade thing.

50:10.680 --> 50:13.080
And the reason why you have to shut it down is because they'll even re expand your file

50:13.080 --> 50:14.080
system.

50:14.080 --> 50:17.040
I mean, like it's the full, full upgrade.

50:17.040 --> 50:18.040
It's so great.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.240
$100 credit though.

50:20.240 --> 50:22.720
They've had this offer out here for a couple of weeks and I forgot to tell the audience

50:22.720 --> 50:24.440
because I didn't read that paragraph.

50:24.440 --> 50:25.440
So go get on it.

50:25.440 --> 50:26.440
Get set up.

50:26.440 --> 50:27.440
Yeah.

50:27.440 --> 50:28.440
Experience the joy.

50:28.440 --> 50:31.440
And now we sit around going, why is nobody taking advantage of a $100 offer?

50:31.440 --> 50:34.000
We don't do that very often, ever.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.000
So I'm just an idiot.

50:35.000 --> 50:41.840
Anyway, so you go to do.co slash unplug to get the $100 credit and you can try out something

50:41.840 --> 50:43.160
over there for whatever you want.

50:43.160 --> 50:45.520
I mean, go build a splurge, enjoy yourself.

50:45.520 --> 50:46.520
You want to build a GitLab?

50:46.520 --> 50:48.160
You want to go build the next cloud instance?

50:48.160 --> 50:49.400
You want to try out something?

50:49.400 --> 50:50.400
Just do it.

50:50.400 --> 50:54.520
DigitalOcean.com and they also have a ton of really good documentation.

50:54.520 --> 50:56.480
You hear us mention the Arch Wiki all the time.

50:56.480 --> 51:01.640
I would say only number two to the Arch Wiki, the only number two to Arch Wiki these days

51:01.640 --> 51:04.200
is DigitalOcean's documentation.

51:04.200 --> 51:07.880
Only because they're paying people to contribute and so that's good quality stuff and it's

51:07.880 --> 51:10.960
really well structured and they have like a style guide and all that stuff and it makes

51:10.960 --> 51:13.080
it really easy to read and follow.

51:13.080 --> 51:15.580
And that's just one of the perks of being a DigitalOcean customer.

51:15.580 --> 51:20.080
That's why Docker and Slack and Jupiter Broadcasting and many others are DigitalOcean customers.

51:20.080 --> 51:28.520
DigitalOcean.com, go use our promo code DOUNPLUGGED or DO.CO slash unplugged and hopefully you

51:28.520 --> 51:31.640
still have time because it was a limited time offer and I forgot to tell you guys for a

51:31.640 --> 51:35.440
couple of weeks because I speed read.

51:35.440 --> 51:36.880
You know how sometimes I mispronounce stuff?

51:36.880 --> 51:39.640
Yeah, it affects all things of life, including giving you a $100 offer.

51:39.640 --> 51:40.640
I apologize.

51:40.640 --> 51:44.040
Go to DO.CO slash unplugged and get a $100 DigitalOcean credit.

51:44.040 --> 51:46.400
I can't even believe I'm saying those words out loud.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.400
$100 DigitalOcean credit.

51:47.400 --> 51:51.200
I wish I was a new customer, except then I wouldn't have been enjoying DigitalOcean's

51:51.200 --> 51:52.200
all the awesome things.

51:52.200 --> 51:53.200
You've got multiple email addresses.

51:53.200 --> 51:54.200
Come on.

51:54.200 --> 51:56.960
All right, so let's just really quickly talk about this bogus Linux vulnerability.

51:56.960 --> 52:01.560
It's got Steven J. Vanhoch Nicholas really fired up and it takes a lot to get him fired

52:01.560 --> 52:02.560
up these days.

52:02.560 --> 52:06.400
So GoSecure, a company that's trying to make a name for itself, has claimed and discovered

52:06.400 --> 52:12.280
Chaos, a stolen backdoor rising again.

52:12.280 --> 52:13.280
That's their title for it.

52:13.280 --> 52:21.040
It's a pretty good name, actually, and here's sort of the dirty secret of this horrible

52:21.040 --> 52:25.480
vulnerability called Chaos that GoSecure has discovered.

52:25.480 --> 52:30.480
It just simply brute forces an SSH login.

52:30.480 --> 52:34.480
So you just basically get compromised if you have a bad password.

52:34.480 --> 52:38.300
If you've got a good password, it's not taking advantage of any zero-day exploits.

52:38.300 --> 52:41.680
It's not using some sort of side-channel timing attack to read the memory and parse together

52:41.680 --> 52:42.980
your password.

52:42.980 --> 52:45.720
It's just simply using a password database.

52:45.720 --> 52:47.200
Or just use keys.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.880
Yeah, I know, right?

52:48.880 --> 52:53.280
It's just in from 2006.

52:53.280 --> 52:57.280
Once your system's already been spread wide open because you used a bad password, then

52:57.280 --> 52:58.280
things tend to go wrong.

52:58.280 --> 53:06.120
It opens up TCP port 8338, which is accepting raw socket connections.

53:06.120 --> 53:10.960
And then once it has a bad password and it gets on there, if... Oh, I should mention,

53:10.960 --> 53:16.520
it can only open up port 8338, by the way, if it has root access, because it's Linux,

53:16.520 --> 53:18.420
which means you also have a weak root password.

53:18.420 --> 53:22.200
So if you have a weak user password and a weak root password, then it can get on there

53:22.200 --> 53:23.420
and cause some problems.

53:23.420 --> 53:26.760
And it's called Chaos, and it's getting a lot of print this week.

53:26.760 --> 53:35.600
So if you hear people talking about a new Linux vulnerability called Chaos, don't worry.

53:35.600 --> 53:36.640
Just make sure you have a good password.

53:36.640 --> 53:37.640
Or use keys like...

53:37.640 --> 53:42.160
I would suggest password123, just set that as root enable, root login over SSH.

53:42.160 --> 53:43.160
You'll be fine.

53:43.160 --> 53:44.160
All right.

53:44.160 --> 53:47.720
I don't want to get too down about this, but I actually kind of... I kind of want the

53:47.720 --> 53:52.980
mumble rooms take on this, because it seems like it's a problem for anything that wants

53:52.980 --> 53:57.480
to take on Google or Apple or what Amazon or Microsoft is doing.

53:57.480 --> 53:59.440
And I'm talking about OpenStreetMaps.

53:59.440 --> 54:04.200
It's a pretty great product, and I really like the way it displays information.

54:04.200 --> 54:08.400
I kind of prefer... When I'm looking at certain areas, I was checking out Pasadena recently

54:08.400 --> 54:13.560
trying to figure out if I could bark LadyJupes anywhere down there, and I just found the

54:13.560 --> 54:18.280
labeling system better and more accurate.

54:18.280 --> 54:19.280
Not accurate.

54:19.280 --> 54:21.800
I don't know.

54:21.800 --> 54:25.640
It's more useful, but it's missing data that it would be nice to have in certain...

54:25.640 --> 54:26.640
Yeah.

54:26.640 --> 54:27.640
There are some cases.

54:27.640 --> 54:31.000
It's got some data that other things don't have, but then it's missing a bunch of... Yeah.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
Yeah.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.000
Okay.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.000
Thank you.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.600
One of my friends, a computer, wrote up an article about some of the problems that he

54:36.600 --> 54:40.880
sees with OpenStreetMap, and he's a big fan of OpenStreetMap, so this isn't like a takedown

54:40.880 --> 54:41.880
piece.

54:41.880 --> 54:43.720
It's him being concerned about it.

54:43.720 --> 54:47.740
And he talks about unclear usage policies, about how they sort of discourage the use

54:47.740 --> 54:52.520
of the free map, but then if you ask for it, they'll let you, but then if you use more

54:52.520 --> 54:55.100
than 5% of their bandwidth, they'll shut it down.

54:55.100 --> 54:58.820
They really want you to use their data to generate your own map, and then there's things

54:58.820 --> 55:03.060
in the back end, like the geocoder that figures out different areas and helps you search is

55:03.060 --> 55:05.720
really bad and it's way out of date.

55:05.720 --> 55:11.080
It expects very clear syntax, like an exact address, and you can't say things like bagel

55:11.080 --> 55:13.520
places downtown Seattle.

55:13.520 --> 55:19.160
And then the killer one is there's no moderation or review model, which, as you could probably

55:19.160 --> 55:20.880
imagine for something like OpenStreetMap...

55:20.880 --> 55:21.880
It could be difficult.

55:21.880 --> 55:22.880
Yeah.

55:22.880 --> 55:29.680
Introduces a lot of problems throughout the entire system, including vandalism, bot abuse,

55:29.680 --> 55:31.880
all sorts of things.

55:31.880 --> 55:34.600
And then, of course, getting the data is hard.

55:34.600 --> 55:38.080
It almost... When you read this, it feels like that the author tries to wrap it up on

55:38.080 --> 55:42.600
a positive note and says, these are all warning signs, and if we take immediate action, maybe

55:42.600 --> 55:44.020
we can save the day.

55:44.020 --> 55:46.080
He calls them roadblocks.

55:46.080 --> 55:52.620
Boy, when I read this, I read this as OpenStreetMaps is screwed.

55:52.620 --> 55:54.560
It seems impossible this day and age.

55:54.560 --> 55:59.640
The data that you need, the proprietary information, the fact that once you build something like

55:59.640 --> 56:02.800
this, people come and vandalize it.

56:02.800 --> 56:04.560
Can OpenSource do this?

56:04.560 --> 56:08.000
Is this just something that OpenSource can't do?

56:08.000 --> 56:09.000
How do we do imaging?

56:09.000 --> 56:10.000
How do we do earth imaging?

56:10.000 --> 56:11.000
Well, go ahead, Whippy.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.000
Wasn't it Whippy?

56:12.000 --> 56:13.000
Oh, whoever it was.

56:13.000 --> 56:14.000
Go ahead.

56:14.000 --> 56:19.480
So OpenStreetMap has been around for a long time.

56:19.480 --> 56:25.160
I remember interviewing someone from the project many years ago on the Ubuntu podcast when

56:25.160 --> 56:29.240
we had little mapping parties because there were just great swathes of emptiness around

56:29.240 --> 56:32.120
our towns and cities in the UK.

56:32.120 --> 56:35.760
They were talking about, maybe by the end of the year, we'll have all of the UK mapped

56:35.760 --> 56:40.040
and there were entire continents that hadn't been mapped yet.

56:40.040 --> 56:45.000
But people came together and they worked together and they fixed those problems.

56:45.000 --> 56:47.640
A lot of these are, you need more bodies.

56:47.640 --> 56:52.200
They need to recruit more people to help moderate the submissions that are happening.

56:52.200 --> 56:53.200
I fixed things.

56:53.200 --> 56:56.440
There was a road that was wrong near me and I just logged in, tried to remember what my

56:56.440 --> 57:00.720
password was, fixed the road, done, and that's fixed for everyone forever who's using that

57:00.720 --> 57:02.000
map.

57:02.000 --> 57:06.360
I think they need a bit more of a recruitment drive to get more people involved in using

57:06.360 --> 57:07.360
it.

57:07.360 --> 57:09.960
They need to make the tools easier to use for sure because it is a little bit janky

57:09.960 --> 57:16.640
to do this and have some incentive for people to moderate these things and make it easier

57:16.640 --> 57:18.080
for people to get access to the data.

57:18.080 --> 57:22.240
If they can solve all those, those are mostly technical but also getting more people involved.

57:22.240 --> 57:24.240
I think they're fine.

57:24.240 --> 57:28.280
I'm more of a glass half full and I know you're quite a glass half empty kind of guy.

57:28.280 --> 57:31.920
But I think this is solvable.

57:31.920 --> 57:32.920
All of this is solvable.

57:32.920 --> 57:34.880
I certainly hope so.

57:34.880 --> 57:41.640
I tend to think that more bodies on the problem is only a part of the issue.

57:41.640 --> 57:48.200
I think some of this is like technology because you think about it, it's a data issue and

57:48.200 --> 57:54.360
the more Google is at a point now where they have millions of Android devices that are

57:54.360 --> 57:58.920
using Google Maps constantly setting real time feedback to Google Maps.

57:58.920 --> 58:02.400
How do you ever come close to anything like that?

58:02.400 --> 58:03.920
You know what I mean?

58:03.920 --> 58:08.000
They talk about their geocoder in here is sort of out of date and I guess you could

58:08.000 --> 58:12.400
somehow, maybe somebody could donate a new geocoder, maybe Nokia could come along or

58:12.400 --> 58:13.400
something like that.

58:13.400 --> 58:15.200
I think that makes it very...

58:15.200 --> 58:18.120
My takeaway from a lot of this is that they need to be clear about what they're trying

58:18.120 --> 58:21.480
to do and not do because it can be hard.

58:21.480 --> 58:25.280
Maybe that's something they can't do but they can still be really valuable as an open database

58:25.280 --> 58:29.600
for all these things even if it's not going to be GMaps level interface.

58:29.600 --> 58:34.480
I mean, technically, they can just use Google Maps data anyway because Google doesn't own

58:34.480 --> 58:41.320
the concept of the data that they collect data around usage, that stuff is they own

58:41.320 --> 58:45.680
but they can't own the map itself.

58:45.680 --> 58:50.480
They don't provide access to the data so the open street map guys can't just poke at Google

58:50.480 --> 58:54.240
and get the data out and they get a cease and desist because some of the data isn't

58:54.240 --> 58:55.240
theirs anyway.

58:55.240 --> 58:59.920
It's licensed from third parties but other people have tried to do, in the same way that

58:59.920 --> 59:05.560
Android devices crowd source a lot of the location and traffic data and so on, other

59:05.560 --> 59:06.560
people have tried this.

59:06.560 --> 59:07.560
Mozilla tried this.

59:07.560 --> 59:13.920
They had a thing that was baked into Firefox OS and actually you could optionally, I think

59:13.920 --> 59:18.160
it was called Mozilla Stumbler, you could install on your phone and just leave it running

59:18.160 --> 59:21.800
in the background and it would just constantly send updates about where Wi-Fi access points

59:21.800 --> 59:25.840
were and try and locate where you were so they can put all these dots on the map and

59:25.840 --> 59:28.420
show where roads are and all that kind of stuff.

59:28.420 --> 59:32.040
It's possible but you need a critical mass of people who are going to do it and obviously

59:32.040 --> 59:36.760
Google with a critical mass of billions of devices are already way out ahead.

59:36.760 --> 59:38.400
I wonder if it isn't a bit of a…

59:38.400 --> 59:44.320
And they also do one thing that I don't know of any voluntary organization or anybody

59:44.320 --> 59:45.920
else doing.

59:45.920 --> 59:51.360
They actually go to governments and ask for maps because governments have dense maps,

59:51.360 --> 59:57.440
infrastructure, detailed, just the data that governments need for defense.

59:57.440 --> 59:58.440
They have it.

59:58.440 --> 59:59.440
All right, fair enough.

59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.440
It's usually public.

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:06.080
But hopefully, I think that overall, if it's not going to help as much in terms of maps

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:13.680
but in other things, the new GDPR ruling actually goes and says that you as a citizen or as

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:19.560
a customer have the right to ask for the data that is about you but that essentially could

01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:25.160
make it easier to compete by you having the ability to export all of your data and importing

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.160
a second service.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:31.260
To Dan's point, like the hours that places are busy, if you could even get a thousand

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:36.480
users to export their hours when they go to stores and import that, that would be useful.

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.360
If you could even just get a small fraction…

01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:44.520
You just have to be able to get that enabled but enough because they've got it by default.

01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:45.520
Yeah.

01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:52.200
It still feels a bit like the Spotify problem in that Spotify is attempting to monetize

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:58.360
music streaming when Google, Apple, and Amazon can just do music streaming as part of their

01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.800
overall offering.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:04.000
And if it costs them to do music streaming, it doesn't matter because they're selling

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:07.480
you the block into the platform.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:11.320
And I wonder if that is the same with maps.

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:16.760
It is so expensive and it requires so much overhead to keep good competitive maps that

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:22.720
perhaps it's the vendors that have a platform incentive to have mapping like Google, Apple,

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.680
et cetera, that will be the best at it.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.640
And I mean, I hate to keep…

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.720
I hate to say this but maybe it's just not our…

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.720
Maybe it's not our bag.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.440
Go ahead, JJ.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:40.120
So I would say like for those who don't want to be dependent on Google services, just those

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:45.160
who root in ROM their devices, they would probably see more incentive into seeing these

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.160
open map platforms.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.160
Yes.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.160
And also…

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.160
But is that enough?

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.160
Is that enough, JJ?

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.160
Is that enough?

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:52.160
Because I'll give you an example.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:56.220
I would like to have an open street map that I could go to where I could get really good

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:59.760
like super specific information about cellular signal.

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.760
So I knew where I could go to get really good data signal.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:07.080
I would like to know where cops often hang out at so I could mark that on a map.

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.200
That's something I think that would be extremely useful.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:13.960
And just for me personally, I'd also like to know where I could park for 24 hours without

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:14.960
getting towed.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.160
And I'd like to mark that up on a map.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.800
And I don't think Google is ever going to do any of that.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:21.840
I mean, you're partially describing ways there.

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:23.560
Which is owned by Google now.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:24.560
Yeah.

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.560
But still, it's…

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:31.040
But there's still demand for those who want to be free from Google services such as yourself

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:34.400
trying to go away from Google Photos.

01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:41.400
There are plenty of people who've built things on top of open street maps like building…

01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:45.200
Whether it's making access to data about, like you say, where's parking.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:46.720
There are people who've built cycle maps.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.760
There are people who've built canal maps in the UK so you know where the canals are.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:55.320
And it wouldn't take a lot for someone to build on top.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:03:01.120
But as you've mentioned, it's difficult getting access to that map data without rebuilding

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:06.240
all the tiles yourself or licensing their API.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.120
So that is a difficult problem.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.440
So I have a question.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.440
Yeah, go ahead.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:14.880
Would you guys be willing to pay a bounty per se, right?

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:20.480
So you would introduce into the platform a bounty that says, I would like this such region

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:25.520
to be mapped, you know, and this bounty coverage a few kilometers, whatever, right?

01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:31.640
And ultimately, then there's people that could attempt to actually map out that thing by

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:34.280
trying to get the winning of that bounty.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.600
And that's a fascinating idea.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.600
That is a really…

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:41.720
As long as you have the moderation to prevent abuse of people just going out and wandering

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:46.280
outside their house for 10 minutes or strapping a phone to a dog and letting it loose in a

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.280
field.

01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:49.320
What you do is you build an AR game, right?

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.760
Yeah, exactly.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:56.120
I kind of have the sense that maybe I should try to reach out to some folks at the Open

01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.920
Street Map Project and get their take on this too, because this is Sergey's take, right?

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.080
And so I'd like to get their take and see where they…

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:08.120
So if time allows or if anybody out there has a connection, let me know on Telegram

01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.120
or Twitter.

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.840
I'd be more than happy to chat with somebody from the project and get their take on it

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:12.920
and see where they're going with this.

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:18.840
Because like Popeye was saying, there is so many great just esoteric uses that people

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:23.120
have built on top of Open Street Maps, it is worth it just for that to continue.

01:04:23.120 --> 01:04:28.540
I mean, I have my crazy reasons, but there's also really good reasons like biking and hiking

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:29.540
and others.

01:04:29.540 --> 01:04:32.640
So I would love to talk to somebody there because this is one of those projects where

01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:36.380
if there was anything I could do, I'd pay a bounty if there is anything I could do.

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:40.920
If I could run an app on my Android phone while I drive Lady Jups around the country

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.240
to help improve their maps, I'd be more than happy to do it.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:46.760
So if you have anybody out there, if you're listening to this show and you know anybody

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:51.480
out there that maybe I should talk to, I'd love it if you could help make the connection.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:57.840
Because jeez, if I just don't prefer the way they render the maps, I just prefer reading

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.840
Open Street Maps than I do Google Maps.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.560
Not that there's really anything super wrong with Google Maps, I just prefer the way they

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.560
look.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.560
They do look really nice.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.560
Yeah.

01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.560
I like them too.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:10.040
So you hate to see something like that fade away and it makes you wonder like what other

01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.040
things?

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:15.200
Like what if one day we all got off our arses and decided we wanted to have an open source

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.200
music streaming service?

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.200
Could we do it?

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:21.200
Impossible.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:24.180
What if we wanted to have like a peer-to-peer video streaming service to take on YouTube?

01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:25.440
Could we do it?

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.040
I'm not convinced we could pull it off.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.560
But Open Street Map is one of those things where we already have a beachhead.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.560
You know, we're-

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.540
There's a bunch of data plugged in there.

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:35.800
We already have momentum.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.920
So if there's anything we could do as a community to come together-

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:38.920
Let's not lose that.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.920
Yeah.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:40.920
Let's keep it going.

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:41.920
Let's keep that rolling.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.200
And I'd love to talk to somebody over there about that.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.320
LinuxAcademy.com slash unplugged.

01:05:46.320 --> 01:05:49.920
Go there to sign up for a free seven-day trial and support this here show.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.100
It's everything you need to learn more about Linux.

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:59.080
When I was first starting in IT because IT is like dog years, I don't know if you thought

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.340
about this, but I was recently thinking it's kind of like dog years.

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:07.720
Like 10 years in IT is like 25 years in the banking field.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:15.200
And one of the things that's so crazy about, because I'm just past my mid thirties now,

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:22.060
so it's not like I'm super old, but it is nuts to my face.

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:28.040
It is nuts to my face that when I first got into IT, the way we would look stuff up, I'm

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:33.600
a hundred percent honest with you here, is about once a month a couple of us from the

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:38.680
department would get together in somebody's car and we'd go out to lunch.

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:43.240
And then after lunch, when we're full and may or may not have had a beer in us, we would

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:49.080
go to the bookstore and we would buy a book, a couple of books each.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:54.640
And then we would bring these books back and we would stack them on the shelf and we would

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:59.160
never use them unless we were really desperate.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:03.320
Plus you probably got grease on them from the fries from lunch.

01:07:03.320 --> 01:07:04.640
You know me too well, Wes.

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:11.520
I couldn't even imagine a resource like Linux Academy and it would have at best been some

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:16.520
sort of half-assed feature that gets added on to some other training platform.

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:21.720
So you know, somewhere for corporate training or learning about active directory management

01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:26.840
or how to fix your sync and then they would have thrown on a few Linux courses.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:27.840
Go learn some more, Chris.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.860
We'll pay you some money to go do that.

01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:31.560
And that would have been it.

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:38.480
Later on in my career, what I did have some access to was community college training courses

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:44.320
that would be taught off of campus or on campus, depending on the course, that were about Linux,

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:48.680
but they weren't really about the career track that I was on, but they were just checking

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:49.680
the box.

01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:52.760
My employer wanted me to have continued education.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:55.600
We were deploying Linux servers.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.840
I needed to do something and they wanted results.

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:05.520
So I went and took basic Linux courses like Linux Plus and Introductions to Linux.

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:08.960
Meanwhile I'm sitting there setting up Linux firewalls and Samba servers.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.640
It just didn't match.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:15.020
That's where Linux Academy completely changes the game, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:16.560
You sign up for a free seven-day trial.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:21.240
It's everything you need to learn about any category of Linux from the basics all the

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:26.820
way up to the high level stuff like Azure, AWS, OpenStack, all of that.

01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:30.320
They have courses that are also created specifically to help you get certifications if that's the

01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:31.500
route you want to go.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:36.120
They have self-paced in-depth video courses and they have virtual labs they spin up on

01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:40.200
demand and if you ever get stuck, they have a real human being that can help you.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:44.920
It's completely different than anything that I saw many years ago and it's the kind of

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.580
tool that's come along now.

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:50.160
Now that Linux has enjoyed some success in the marketplace, somebody had to come along

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:54.760
and create this and I'm so thankful it's Linux Academy because it's created by Linux enthusiasts,

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:58.520
educators, and developers that came together to build the Linux Academy platform and you

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:07.520
can try it out seven days for free at linuxacademy.com slash unplugged, linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.600
So you know, I'm going to get into an announcement here, but I just wanted to do an infernal

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.380
poll with the mumble room.

01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:21.440
If we were going to make a decision today, guys, would you say go back to IRC or stick

01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.440
with Discord?

01:09:22.440 --> 01:09:25.640
It's not related to my announcement at all, but it's something we were talking about,

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:26.640
Wes and I, in the pre-show.

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:27.640
Now that we've been-

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.640
Can I cast the first vote?

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.200
Yeah, go ahead.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.800
I vote IRC.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:32.800
Go back to IRC.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:35.240
Yeah, and I think I can back that up pretty well.

01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.240
All right, okay.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.240
Let's hear it.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.240
Let's hear it, Mr. Noel.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.280
What is it?

01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:44.600
So I think anytime you look at a community, you have to look at the lowest common denominator

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.160
to which the community can centralize around and I think in the Linux community, the open

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:54.840
source world, Red Hat organizes their community on IRC and sure there are people that are

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.480
organizing on Discord and Telegram.

01:09:56.480 --> 01:10:01.280
We've seen when we go to these events, a lot of the abundant people are organizing on Telegram.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:05.040
So certainly there are other platforms in use, but the lowest common denominator, the

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:10.000
one thing that exists in basically every Linux company and every open source community is

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.140
IRC.

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:15.720
And I think that there are some, from a production standpoint, we're tempted to play with some

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.320
of the new toys because it looks better on screen, there's more animation.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:25.480
But I think that that direct community engagement is something that is so valuable, it's worth

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:28.920
giving up anything potentially else just to have that.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.360
All right, so I agree with everything you said.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:32.360
I'll give you the counter argument.

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:34.400
Discord is born in a mobile era.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.080
You can use Discord in your web browser, you can use Discord on a Windows box, Mac box,

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:41.480
Linux box, you can use Discord on a phone.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:47.600
Discord is born of a Slack era where you have contextual rich chat with URL previews, image

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:52.400
previews, emoticons, voice chat integrated.

01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:58.760
It's how IRC would be designed today if it had access to all of that feature set.

01:10:58.760 --> 01:10:59.760
I would agree.

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:00.760
I have all of that.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:01.760
I have all of that.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:02.760
I have all of that.

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.760
Go ahead, Poppy.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:04.960
Mine is voice chat.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.280
I have everything you just said in IRC.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.160
I thought you would be the Discord guy.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.160
Are you serious right now?

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:16.160
I was going to send to you to defend Discord.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.160
If you have the IRC cloud app on your phone, it's in sync with the IRC cloud up on your

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:21.400
desktop.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:24.840
The only thing missing from the list that you just gave is voice chat.

01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:25.840
So what do you think?

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.640
Do you think we should go back to IRC for Jupiter broadcasting?

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:34.640
I think you should use Slack.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:40.160
I would also just piggyback onto that and say that the vast, is there anyone that exists

01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:41.160
in the Discord?

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:46.720
Is there anyone that's in that community that doesn't already set up an IRC system?

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.760
I think a lot of those people, a lot of people I see in the Discord, they're the same people

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.080
that are in IRC.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:52.360
So they've already set that up.

01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:55.680
And yes, I would agree with the gentleman who said that it's a little more difficult

01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:00.600
to set up on the phone, and I'm using Quossel, and that also is very simple to set up on

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:01.600
the phone.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.600
Okay.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.560
I'd like to hear from Wimpy and Rotten.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.600
Wimpy, if you're available, just because you've been a longtime observer of JB, you've sat

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:10.360
back, you have some distance from this.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:14.280
I'd kind of like to hear your thoughts if you're there.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:25.400
So I'm in the Discord and IRC, but I pay more attention to IRC because the IRC chat is easier

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.720
to engage with than Discord chat.

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:33.040
Whenever I go to Discord, there's pages and pages and pages of irrelevant stuff, and I

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.160
can drop in and out of IRC.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:39.300
And as Popey says, I use IRC Cloud as well.

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:42.640
So what I have on my desktop and my mobile phone is the same.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:48.200
If anyone tags me in any of the channels I'm subscribed to, I get notifications on my phone.

01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.200
All right.

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.200
Okay.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.200
I can't argue with any of that either.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.200
Producer Michael, I wanted to give you...

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.200
Oh, Wes, did you want to say something?

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.160
I was just saying, does IRC Cloud have a free plan?

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.720
I think so.

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.720
Yes.

01:12:58.720 --> 01:12:59.720
I am also an IRC user.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:01.520
I would be curious with the opposite number.

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:06.840
I like the comparison idea, but I wonder too how many people have set up IRC just for JB

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:09.000
but already have Discord from other things.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.400
That is a great point.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:11.400
Okay.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:14.720
Producer Michael, I wanted to give you a chance, and then maybe I'll come back to you.

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:15.720
They both have problems.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:17.520
Discord and IRC both have problems.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:21.800
I mitigate the problems with IRC in the same way, but not with IRC Cloud.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:23.800
I use Matrix and Riot.im.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:24.800
Oh, man.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.480
You fancy bear.

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:30.680
You can use Riot.im without actually setting up your own server as well.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.480
You can just use the Matrix.org stuff.

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.640
So you are kind of in a roundabout way saying IRC, and if you want the fancy features, there's

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.920
ways to get that.

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:45.320
Well, I mean, in the sense of doing the displays and the previews, as far as the communication

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:51.600
aspect, IRC is easier, because a lot of people will say it's harder to set up, but if you're

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.800
just brand new to it, you can just go to a Kiwi IRC or something like that where you

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:01.360
just link to someone directly to a thing and they're instantly in the chat.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:05.160
There's ways to do that where you cannot do that in Discord, and then there's other ways

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.380
in, like, if you don't have a Discord account, you can't go to a Discord server, so there

01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:16.980
are aspects that, like, the only thing I would say is the previews and the log is not available

01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:17.980
directly in IRC.

01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:23.360
You'd have to use some way to mitigate that, such as, like, Matrix or IRC Cloud.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:24.360
Okay.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.160
I am going somewhere with all of this.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.920
This isn't just looking at our navel gazes.

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.280
Was that the same navel gaze in here?

01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:34.320
I am actually, I am going somewhere with this, but Wimpy, I know you were jumping in there

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.840
for a second, so I want to go back to you.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:41.040
No, Michael's touched on all of those points, really.

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:48.980
I've got nothing extra to add, other than the fact I recently re-added the Jupiter Broadcasting

01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:56.720
Channel to my IRC Cloud configuration because I can't submit show title suggestions through

01:14:56.720 --> 01:14:57.720
Discord.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:58.720
Right.

01:14:58.720 --> 01:14:59.720
Yeah.

01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:02.120
So I'm going to, you know what I'll do is I'll put a poll out there.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:05.640
It's embedded in the show notes if you want to vote because there's lots of people that

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:12.180
can't make it live that have a position on this that maybe sometimes can that could vote.

01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:17.780
What brought this up was the discussion that I was having behind the scenes with Wes just

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:25.920
today about, hey, what if for a hot moment we wanted to see if we could dynamically generate

01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:28.620
a live stream video feed on a droplet?

01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:34.840
What I mean by that, instead of using OBS here in the studio to capture the chat room,

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:41.080
we had a droplet that was headless that was monitoring a chat room and generating a video

01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:43.880
feed and streaming that to Scale Engine.

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:49.260
So I could just connect in with an audio feed from wherever I'm at and the droplet would

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:53.400
actually generate the chat room and the lower third and all of that.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:57.520
And as that conversation progressed, we realized, well, damn, that's a lot harder when you're

01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:02.500
using Discord than it is if you're using IRC.

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.640
And especially when it just comes down to stupid things like we have disparate rooms

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.720
in Discord for the different shows, which is nice because then it's very focused.

01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:13.200
But at the same time, like how do you programmatically plan for that?

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:18.120
Like how do you switch rooms and capture just that and what if the Discord API changes and

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:21.940
what kind of information can we get versus an IRC room where everything's just in one

01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:28.080
room and it's text, which is a lot easier to work with server side.

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:32.000
And so then I thought, well, you know, before we go kill ourselves, like what is the interest

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.000
here?

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:36.080
Right now, there's only been 19 votes by the live stream.

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:46.960
If you want to vote, strawpoll.me slash 1-5-1-1-5-4-9-6, 68% are voting to go back to IRC.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:53.560
And I wouldn't shut down Discord, but we would just wait for the live stream focus.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.240
What's up on the live stream?

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.240
What do we switch back to?

01:16:56.240 --> 01:16:59.400
How does that play into how title stuff is generated?

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.160
Is IRC primary more there?

01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:02.160
Yeah, I think so.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.120
I think it would mean everything goes back to primary being an IRC.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.120
I don't care either way.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:07.600
I just want to do whatever folks are happy with.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.760
Although, could we experiment with matrix?

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.720
Matrix is interesting.

01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:15.360
You can use the IRC with matrix so you can do both of those.

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:18.120
Yeah, that could be something down the road to look more into.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.120
Wow.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.120
Well, actually matrix IRC bridge is fantastic.

01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.120
I love it.

01:17:22.120 --> 01:17:23.680
I use it for so many different channels.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:25.040
So you're saying go play with that.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.040
Go ahead Noah.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.400
No, I just, that's interesting that this comes up.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.680
This is one of the things that I was kind of dragging my feet on it because I know.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.680
Oh, I know.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:35.040
This is partially your fault actually.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.600
Well, I heard some rumblings about this and so I was like, ah, just hold off for a little

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.680
bit and just see what happens.

01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:43.080
But yeah, we were talking about it because one of the things that matrix allows you to

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:47.680
do, and again, this is where I think there's a discussion to be had about software licenses,

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:48.680
right?

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:52.880
Because it's open source, it means that I looked at my team here at UltaSpeed and I

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:57.560
was like, hey, could we do some of these more competitive things from a production standpoint

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.560
and tie them in?

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:01.640
They're like, dude, you don't have no idea how easy that would be if we did it with matrix

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:05.480
and we could have these apps and all sorts of crazy things were coming up.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:09.680
And so I'd be tempted if you guys did decide to dig into that, I'd dig into it with you

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.800
and handle some of the heavy lifting because I know how much you love dealing with the

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.360
minutia of the projects, Chris.

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.360
You do.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:17.360
Yeah.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.360
Wes has got some great ideas too.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.560
We should, we really all need to get together and do a little powwow.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.560
I completely agree.

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.560
All right.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.560
Well.

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:29.320
I've been using matrix with IRC for Intergos, IRC for channel for years now.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:30.320
Huh.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.320
All right.

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.320
Don't convince me, Michael.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:35.120
I'm going to, I'm going to spend a little more time and consideration with that.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.120
Okay.

01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:40.920
So I've got a big announcement that I'm pretty excited about that I want to get into, but

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.600
before I do, I don't know.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:46.600
I wanted to make a little space here for Mr. Popey and Mr. Wimpy.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:51.040
Perhaps they would like to pre-tease some announcement.

01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.720
I know Curry just recently happened.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:56.480
The Ubuntu podcast has been on season break.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:00.240
Rumor has it the band may be getting back together.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:01.240
Yeah.

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:02.240
Yeah.

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:03.240
So.

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.240
That's it.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.240
No, go ahead.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.240
Maybe.

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.400
So yeah, we, for those who don't know, like Wimpy and I do this little podcast.

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:13.180
It's a little two bit show with.

01:19:13.180 --> 01:19:14.640
It's a wonderful show.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.640
Everybody should be listening.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:16.640
Thanks.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:17.640
Ubuntu podcast.

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.640
Thank you.

01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:23.440
And every year since we started 10 years ago, we stop recording at Christmas that we make

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:27.280
our last episode goes out over Christmas and then we take a break for a couple of months

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:28.800
so we can all have a rest.

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:34.120
And then we have a traditional go out for a curry and then at that curry we decide whether

01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.640
we're going to do it for another year and our plans for what we will change and what

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.640
will stay the same.

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:43.920
And we make loads of notes and we implement changes in the following week or so.

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.080
And then we start the new season sometime soon after that.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.080
Isn't that right Wimpy?

01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.080
That's about it, right?

01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.080
Yes.

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.080
Roughly like that.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.080
Yeah.

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.560
Can I ask you a question about that though?

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.560
Okay.

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:59.320
How many years have you done the show where after the curry you didn't return?

01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:02.840
But you never know.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:08.200
So far we have a hundred percent success rate of coming back after having a curry.

01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:09.200
But one year.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.200
Here's my suggestion.

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.200
One year.

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.200
Why not?

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.200
But I have a suggestion for you Wimpy.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:18.360
How about at the last episode of recording you just do it at the curry place and then

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:19.360
go ahead and decide right then.

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:20.360
That's adorable.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.680
We've got to have a break.

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:23.680
It's pretty intense.

01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:24.680
It's really hard work.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.680
You can have a break.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:28.080
You can still make a decision and then take a break as well.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.080
Yeah maybe.

01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:31.080
Doing one half hour show.

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.080
Listen.

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:36.480
Producer Michael you wouldn't understand this but doing one half hour show a week or recording

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:40.600
two of them every two weeks is a huge amount of work.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:42.440
Also you're suggesting we have curry at Christmas.

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:43.440
Are you mad?

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.440
Yeah.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:45.440
Speaking of curry.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.440
All seasons.

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:50.080
I was just going to say I'd like to lodge a complaint with my boss at Jupiter Broadcasting.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:52.560
Why is it we never have any sort of discussions around curry?

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:56.480
Oh I don't ever remember being invited to curry to discuss the next iteration of Vast

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.480
Noah or Lass.

01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:58.480
I know dude.

01:20:58.480 --> 01:20:59.480
It's not just this.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:00.480
There's another.

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.480
This and another.

01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:04.720
I am taking two lessons from the Ubuntu podcast and I will be integrating them into the announcement

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:06.680
that I have coming up in mere moments.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.680
Really.

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:08.680
I'm taking lessons.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:09.680
I'm taking notes.

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:10.680
But yeah guys.

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:12.680
It's good to know that we're so influential.

01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.600
I'm looking forward to it.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:19.720
But I do also want to give a mention to our buddies over at Late Night Linux.

01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:25.440
Episode 31 of Late Night Linux, they had Todd the CEO of Purism on to talk about a lot of

01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:29.160
the questions that I raised on Linux Action News and that Joe's been wondering.

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:32.560
And the guys over there just did a great job of asking Todd the questions and Todd did

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.480
a great job of answering them.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:40.840
So if you've been following the Librem 5 or if you've followed my journey with some of

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:44.560
their stuff, I want to just totally give you a recommendation here.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.560
Go check out episode 31.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:50.240
I had a fantastic interview with the CEO of Purism about a lot of the things that have

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.640
been on many of our minds.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.920
So that's episode 31 of Late Night Linux.

01:21:54.920 --> 01:22:00.720
Ubuntu podcast could be coming up, but I'm going to beat all of them with my new release.

01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:05.340
I'm very, very happy to announce the return of an old favorite to the Jupiter Broadcasting

01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:06.800
Network for a limited time.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:10.920
I'm doing something kind of different here and I think it's going to be fun.

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:16.240
It's just to the lead up and just a little bit after scale for a limited time, I'm bringing

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:22.240
back Tech Talk Today to the Jupiter Broadcasting Network and you can go over to techtalk.today.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:23.900
Now I know what you're thinking.

01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:25.420
Why Tech Talk Today?

01:22:25.420 --> 01:22:32.080
Why do Tech Talk Today when you could relaunch Plan B or come up with some other Linux only

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.080
show?

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:34.260
It's a good question.

01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:41.720
You know, we put Tech Talk Today on hiatus in September of 2016 so we could launch UserAir.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:48.920
And I thought surely somebody will come along, like that Joe Resington asshole or Tom Merritt,

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:52.120
and they'll launch another tech show.

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.120
You know what?

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.120
They're bastards, aren't they?

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.120
Those bastards.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.120
You know.

01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:57.120
I sure do.

01:22:57.120 --> 01:23:01.280
They'll launch another tech show that finally gives a perspective that's outside the Silicon

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:11.320
Valley bubble, that maybe even by some weird luck, somebody on the show has used open source

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:15.040
software once in their life or knows that they're using open source software.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:19.240
Surely by 2018, such a hero shall come along.

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:23.680
And yet no such Batman has arrived on the scene and it's always really bothered me.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:30.040
I've gotten on the soapbox more than a few occasions about tech journalism on this show.

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.280
There's lots of good tech shows.

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.280
There really are.

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:33.280
There's too many.

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.160
There's too many tech shows.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.880
But they all have a really strong Silicon Valley bias.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:41.960
They typically can't see beyond the apps on their smartphone, to be honest with you.

01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.160
And it drives me crazy.

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:50.200
So looking at the near term future of Jupiter broadcasting, we definitely have a content

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:51.760
problem.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.640
I'm going to be traveling to scale.

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.020
We're going to have Linux Fest Northwest.

01:23:56.020 --> 01:23:59.880
And if things continue in the direction that they're going, I'll have more interviews

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:05.440
at company like Microsoft and others that don't really fit into Linux Unplugged.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:06.560
They don't fit into LAM.

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.360
They don't fit into Coder.

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:11.300
So I'm going to launch a limited run of Tech Talk today.

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:12.560
Something new, just one season.

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:13.880
In fact, I'm doing seasons.

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:14.880
That's one of the-

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:15.880
Whoa.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.880
Yeah.

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:17.880
I'm stealing that from Open2Podcast.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:20.000
And they invented it and I'm taking it.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.500
I'm doing seasons and I'm going to do 10 episodes a season.

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:25.920
So I'm just doing 10 episodes and I really would like you to give it a listen because

01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:28.760
I'm going to use this as an opportunity to have a fun romp.

01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:30.680
Really just, what did you call it?

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:31.680
Self-referential tech coverage.

01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:32.680
What did you say earlier?

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.360
It was almost like it could have been a tagline.

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.040
Something you liked about Tech Talk today was the fact that it didn't take itself too

01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.040
seriously.

01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:39.040
Exactly.

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.040
It's a good fun show.

01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:42.640
I can't remember the words you used, but I should have written them down.

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.200
And that's what our goal is.

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:48.480
We'll have some curry later and we'll think about that.

01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:52.320
But because I'm doing a season, I'm going to have a bit of a story arc to it.

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:55.840
It's really going to be about getting my butt down to scale.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:25:01.280
And Noah and I specifically are going in with some things that we want to accomplish, some

01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.960
objectives ahead of time.

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.960
And some of-

01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:04.960
Like eating curry?

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:05.960
Yeah.

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:06.960
Yes, absolutely.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:07.960
That'll be in there as well.

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.200
So I'm relaunching a show for a limited run.

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.360
It's just going to be a lot of fun.

01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:15.040
I'm going to experiment with some stuff and we're going to talk lifestyle stuff, culture

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:19.500
stuff, tech news with somebody that comes with the perspective of the open source community.

01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:22.720
So if there's something in there from our perspective, I'm covering it.

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.880
That'll be the stuff that gets preferential treatment.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:26.520
It's going to be a fun experiment.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:30.920
And I may try doing a few things in there that you don't expect.

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:31.920
So check it out.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.460
I would love to have you subscribe.

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:39.400
The raw dog RSS feed, plug it into whatever you want, tech talk today or tech talk dot

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:44.800
today slash RSS, tech talk dot today slash RSS.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:48.520
There is going to be some exclusive content I'll generate for our patrons too at the Jupiter

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:52.400
signal Patreon page.

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:53.400
Working with seasons sounds interesting.

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.400
What do you think of that?

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.400
Is that crazy?

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.960
No, I think I think it makes a lot of sense.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:57.960
10 episodes.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:58.960
10 episodes.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:25:59.960
Can I ask you a question?

01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.960
Yeah, go ahead.

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:05.240
Is this something that you're doing live or is this something that it will be recorded

01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:06.680
offline then just published?

01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:11.200
So a bit of both because predominantly I'm going to be all over the place during these

01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:13.400
next 10 episodes.

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:15.000
Some of it's going to just have to be offline.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.600
In fact, I think the majority of it will be offline.

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.400
There won't even be a YouTube video of it because it's just going to be Chris on the

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:25.080
road talking about whatever I'm doing, talking about the news of the day, talking about the

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.080
events we're going to.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:27.080
It's going to be kind of raw.

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:28.080
I really like that.

01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:31.320
Yeah, I think that's going to be like tech vlog today.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.960
Yeah, it's going to be kind of a little bit actually a little bit like tech vlog today.

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.600
It's mostly drone reviews to be honest.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:43.520
But honestly, I think there's also the perfect opportunity to then have like special live

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:48.120
events because if we're not doing a live one all the time, like when we do a live one and

01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:53.200
I'd like to at least do a couple of season, then that's kind of like a special event and

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:55.360
we'll make a special event out of it.

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:57.540
So I do plan to do some live stuff.

01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:04.800
But I honestly suspect when Noah was here, he and I worked to install a microphone mount

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:05.960
in my truck.

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:11.600
I expect I'll be doing a lot of the tech talk today's from the passenger seat of my truck

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.440
while I'm going to do something.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:14.440
I'm going somewhere.

01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:16.120
I'm on my way to scale.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.680
I'm going to an interview.

01:27:18.680 --> 01:27:19.680
I'm going to wake up in the morning.

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:20.680
I'm going to look at the tech news.

01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:21.680
I'm going to think about stuff.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:22.880
I'm going to jump in the car.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.600
I'll either go park somewhere and do a show or I'll have somebody else driving and I'm

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.640
going to sit down and I'm going to record an episode.

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:30.680
Now that's not to say it's going to sound like shit because you guys know I'm not going

01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:32.160
to put something out that sounds like crap.

01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:34.240
So I'm going to also work on that.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:38.160
This will be another way for me behind the scenes to really kind of iron out the remote

01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:43.080
recording setup and whatnot, really get some of that stuff dialed in.

01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:47.960
Then we'll be documenting the journey to scale and kind of what that's been like.

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.000
So that'll be where some of the vlog element comes in.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.960
Some of the people I talk to, some of the events people would get to bump into, I'll

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:54.960
be in there.

01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:58.560
So I think it's going to be a particular kind of new show at JB, even though it's an old

01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.560
show at the same time.

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:00.560
Can I ask a question, Chris?

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:01.560
Yes.

01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:05.560
Will you be changing the show artwork or will you be keeping the thing where you've got

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:07.920
the jacket and the shorts and your weird feet stance?

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.400
I know the feet do look weird.

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.440
I was just looking at the feet and I'm not quite sure what happened with the feet.

01:28:13.440 --> 01:28:14.440
I don't really know.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:17.960
Because, Wes, I mean, look, my feet aren't, my feet's not that, it's not that weird.

01:28:17.960 --> 01:28:18.960
Totally normal.

01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:19.960
Normal foot.

01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:21.920
I mean, there's the extra things, but we don't have to get into that.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.160
Yeah, it's just webbing.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:33.400
So what I plan to do is implement a chest up approach to the artwork because it's the

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:34.640
weird feet, right?

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:38.280
Although then at the same time, I kind of like, I kind of like it.

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.720
It's kind of like Noah's dick in his AltaSpeed logo.

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.600
It's sort of, you remember the weird feet, you know?

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:48.160
So I learned from Noah, the savvy businessman that he is.

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:49.160
You know what?

01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:51.880
People talk about my, we're having a conversation about AltaSpeed and I didn't buy, I didn't

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.280
buy AdSpot on Linux Unplugged.

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:55.280
That's right.

01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:56.280
Exactly.

01:28:56.280 --> 01:29:01.360
But, Poby, if you have, if you have any artwork that you want to mock up for me, I'd, I'd,

01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.680
I'm the last person on the job.

01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.000
Maybe we can make it just the feet.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000
That might be what we need to do.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
There you go.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
There you go.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Yeah, man.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.400
So scale March 8th through the 11th.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.480
I know I'm just excited about it.

01:29:14.480 --> 01:29:16.160
I'm curious to see where they go with this thing.

01:29:16.160 --> 01:29:21.120
You know, it's been going in a certain direction that I wasn't super into and now they've

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.840
righted the ship and they seem to be sailing in a new direction.

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.960
So I'm curious to go see that.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.560
But more importantly, it's like, well, where the hell are things going?

01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:29.920
Really?

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:33.480
You've got, you got that crazy canonical shipping gnome.

01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.840
You got elementary OS encrypting their drives.

01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:37.780
You got containers for days.

01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:41.920
You've got all these different interests that have kind of really established their places

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:42.920
now.

01:29:42.920 --> 01:29:48.560
Where's all of this going, especially just in the next, I don't know, 10 months, where's

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:50.660
this all going for Linux and open source.

01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:54.040
And those are some of the things that I want to try to answer over the next few weeks on

01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:56.360
tech talk today and on this show.

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.880
And I believe that Noah and I will be on the same beat.

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:00.640
So you'll hear more about on ask Noah as well.

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:03.960
I think it's going to be really kind of a fun experiment.

01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:08.720
And the best part about it is only 10 episodes, right?

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:12.720
Like, it's just like a go for it and then like, you get in, you get out.

01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:13.720
Yeah.

01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:14.720
Like I just, I've never done anything.

01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:17.360
I'm just going to do 10 of them and then I'm going to go have curry.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.360
I think that's brilliant.

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.360
What do you think, Noah?

01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.360
Is that, is that crazy?

01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:24.840
I think there's one crucial part of that missing, but you really like, so when you look at the

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:28.320
way that you want to do that, I think the important thing is to craft is to get input

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:29.320
from outside sources.

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:32.920
And I think the best way to do that is to invite me along for the curry.

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.000
And other than that, I think it's a good plan.

01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:38.960
And maybe sometimes do a weekly show with our mumble room guys.

01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:39.960
Thank you for making it.

01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:40.960
I really appreciate it.

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:41.960
It was a good show with you.

01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:43.560
Stick around because the ask Noah program's coming up.

01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:48.160
If you didn't know the ask Noah show just moments away and you you can hang out here

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.800
and join him otherwise join us live.

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:52.800
We do this at 2 PM Pacific.

01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:58.400
The live show usually kicks off around 1 31 45 Pacific and all of that is converted to

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:04.080
the proper time in your local area at Jupiter broadcasting.com slash calendar and find the

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:10.080
tech talk today program, the relaunch at tech talk.today and it's tech talk.today slash

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:12.040
RSS for the feed.

01:31:12.040 --> 01:31:13.040
Give it a listen.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.080
Let me know what you think.

01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:18.840
We have some special stuff in the works and uh, I don't know.

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.720
It's fun to bring it back.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:22.640
It's fun to bring back people.

01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:24.600
You know, people are still subscribed to that show.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.240
People are still downloading that show.

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:30.840
It's still got a subreddit like it just, it needs to come back for even just a bit.

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:32.740
Tech talk yesterday.

01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:35.160
Tech talk yesterday tomorrow at tech talk.today.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:39.320
Go check it out and then find the calendar for the live shows, our contact page at Jupiter

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:44.000
broadcasting.com and we also have the subreddit linuxunplugged.letit.com and we got all the

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.000
things.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:46.000
We got all the things.

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000
No excuse not to reach out.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.840
You got the ask Noah show coming up and you can come over here on the Tuesdays and just

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:51.880
hang out for a nice old Linux meal.

01:31:51.880 --> 01:31:55.120
You get the unplugged program, which is a really nice long live stream.

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:57.680
Then you get the ask Noah show.

01:31:57.680 --> 01:31:59.200
It's a good Tuesday afternoon.

01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:03.000
Yeah, we had a long winded discussion that didn't really answer your questions.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.140
Just just ask Noah.

01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:05.140
Just ask Noah.

01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:06.140
Just ask Noah.

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:09.600
And then once you're done listening to all this live stuff, go check out techsnap.systems

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:14.880
for Wes and I talking about system administration and network building woes and the Ubuntu podcast

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.160
as well.

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:20.600
And go check out Tux Digital on YouTube because producer Michael is putting out stuff over

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:21.600
there.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:22.640
All right.

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:25.200
That concludes the plugs of this week's episode.

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:27.300
You know every now and then you got to get them out.

01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:28.300
You got to get them out.

01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.300
Props.

01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:31.040
It's like it's like a form of therapy.

01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:32.040
Just got to get it out.

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:33.040
Thank you for joining us, guys.

01:32:33.040 --> 01:32:34.040
Hope you and gals.

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.040
Hope you enjoyed the show.

01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.040
Go follow me.

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:37.040
I'm at Chris LAS on the Twitter.

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.840
We're talking about some of our projects.

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:40.040
The network's at Jupiter signal.

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.040
That guy right there.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.040
He's at West Payne.

01:32:42.040 --> 01:32:43.040
That's right.

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:44.040
I like that.

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.040
Damn.

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:46.040
That's almost as good as bacon, dude.

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:47.040
So good.

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.040
It might be.

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:49.980
I would like to see Payne versus bacon to see which one wins.

01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:50.980
Don't forget.

01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:53.360
While we're voting, we have the poll in the show notes.

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:58.200
Should we go back to IRC or stay on Discord for the live chat and the focus of the show?

01:32:58.200 --> 01:32:59.200
You decide.

01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.200
Let us know.

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.200
Let us know.

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:02.200
You can vote.

01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:24.800
We'll see you in the next one.

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:45.320
You don't need to install that.

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:46.320
Don't bother.

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.320
Don't bother.

01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.320
Don't bother yourself.

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:49.320
You got other things to do.

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:50.320
Haven't you heard of OS?

01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:53.240
It's just the primary platform for your tools.

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:56.400
All right, JBtitles.com, title suggestions.

01:33:56.400 --> 01:33:57.680
What do you guys think?

01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:59.920
What should we do?

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:04.520
What should we do, JBtitles.com?

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.520
Make IRC great again.

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.040
Metrics talk today.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:08.400
That is a pretty clever combo.

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:09.840
You came out there with tech nav.

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:10.840
Tech nav.

01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:13.980
All right, so you all have to go over and subscribe and listen to Tech Talk today at

01:34:13.980 --> 01:34:16.360
least for one or two episodes and then let me know what you think.

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.360
You got to give it like a two episode go because it's going to take me a little bit to find

01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.360
a groove.

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:23.360
So go over there and give it a two episode go for me.

01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:27.360
Should it be a new RSS feed or use the old one?

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:34.080
Well, it was going to use the old one and then there was a bit of a server failure on

01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:38.120
my part and as of right now, it's tech talk today.

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:41.680
It's tech talk dot today slash RSS.

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:46.600
The old feed may start working again and it may not.

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:47.600
If you're lucky.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:48.600
Yeah.

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.160
I'm sorry.

01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:55.920
One ping only was my title suggestion in reference to the canonical data collection.

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:58.200
Which I thought was kind of good because, you know.

01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:03.040
I mean, after today, I'm sort of like interested in trying to get one of these either matrix

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.560
or riot to work with IRC.

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.560
There you go.

01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.560
I'm still trying to figure out how.

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.560
You maniac.

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:15.920
So one ping only is, of course, I submitted that so I'm a little particular.

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:18.560
I like that and the metrics talk today is nice.

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:23.480
One ping only is elegant.

01:35:23.480 --> 01:35:25.880
I like that part a lot.

01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:31.760
And it also sort of reinforces the point that it's just one really kind of big data shot.

01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:37.040
But yeah, I don't know.

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:38.040
That's my thought.

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:40.880
I don't really have a strong sense.

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.760
I would like to see them publish that data.

01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.760
I would really like to see that data.

01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:46.760
Yeah.

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.880
I wonder what the granularity will be.

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:49.880
Yeah.

01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:50.880
Yeah.

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:51.880
Down to OEMs.

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:52.880
That's all really what I'd be happy for.

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:53.880
It's funny.

01:35:53.880 --> 01:36:01.880
Having that Apple thing go automatic, like when that Apple pop-up first landed in Ubuntu,

01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:07.160
people complained and said Ubuntu was more crashy than previous releases.

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.200
And that's because previous releases didn't have a pop-up that told you something was

01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:11.200
crashy.

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.880
And now it does, right?

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:17.040
And so there are so many blog posts out there that tell you how to turn that thing off and

01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:18.400
make Apple go away.

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:22.440
And it's so frustrating for me when I'm looking at the errors website and looking at all the

01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:25.880
crashes and thinking, what are the crashes that we're not capturing?

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.440
Because people turn that thing off.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:30.800
And so that's why I'm keen for that thing to be fully automatic.

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:33.360
So if people tick the box, they just get sent.

01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.680
And then we can look at the crash log, crash dumps, and we can fix them.

01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:37.680
Yep.

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:38.680
I agree.

01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:39.680
I agree.

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:42.840
Because I actually almost always just dismiss it because I don't want to go through because

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:47.520
I've had enough of those ask me then to log in or provide an email address or things like

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:48.520
that.

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:49.520
And so I just clear it.

01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.280
I clear it immediately as soon as I see it.

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:55.440
Because I'm just trying to get something relaunched and get back on air.

01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.440
But yeah, I agree.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:59.120
I would be more than happy to just send in the background and not bother me and let me

01:36:59.120 --> 01:37:14.200
get about my day.
