00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
This is Linux Unplugged, Episode 23 for January 14th, 2014.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,480
Hi everyone and welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show that's surrendering

3
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,440
to the CES plague right this very second.

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,440
My name is Chris.

5
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,440
And my name is Matt.

6
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,440
Hey there, Matt.

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,480
We've got a fun episode this week.

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,240
Not only has there been some big news in the Linux gadget space that is actually going

9
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:57,400
to impact our homes, but we've got our first in-studio guest for Linux Unplugged.

10
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,920
It is from Unfilter and GeekGamerTV and Minecraft, me, our very own Mr. Chase Nunes.

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,920
Hey there, Chase.

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Hey gents.

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,920
How are you?

14
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,920
Chase, it's great to have you in studio.

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Thank you.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,920
You know what?

17
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,960
For episode 23, by the way, I love the number 23 because I was born on the 23rd of January.

18
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
So I got to say, this is kind of like the perfect start, right?

19
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,600
It all comes together.

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
It is meant to happen.

21
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,280
You were going to join us on Sunday on the big show, Linux action show, but you got the

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
CES SARS.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,280
Yeah, CES SARS.

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,120
It was, I talked to you the night before and then the next morning I woke up, I was like,

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,320
oh my God, I cannot do this.

26
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,320
Well, it happens, especially when you go on a big trip and you walk like a million miles

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,640
and you talk to like a million people, you end up contracting.

28
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,920
I mean, I went to Linux Fest Northwest and I was sick within a few hours.

29
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,600
We literally thought we're going to have to get a wheelbarrow.

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
It was bad.

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Yeah.

32
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,040
It was funny because I went out to the truck and I'm like, well, man, I'm just going to

33
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
go for a lunch break.

34
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
I'm going to go out.

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,440
And then I leave the building and I immediately start throwing up.

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,720
I get like, I'm sorry, by the way, to the Bellingham, I did make it to the toilet thankfully,

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,640
but then I get out to my truck and then I'm like, I had like a cup out there.

38
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,240
I was throwing up and now I'm like, man, I don't think I'm going to make it back in.

39
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,240
So I got a great tip.

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,620
I got a great tip like, and I didn't follow through on it was to have my own personal

41
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,340
bottle of hand sanitizer and it didn't happen.

42
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,920
And so obviously, by the way, the whole crew is sick.

43
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
John is sick.

44
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Joe got sick.

45
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,720
Actually, John is on my couch right now because he's been out of it since Saturday, pretty

46
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,720
much.

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
Wow.

48
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,720
He really got it.

49
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Yeah.

50
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
He really got a hit hard.

51
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
So the tip is bring hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer, maybe wear a mask, actually head to the health

52
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,600
and fitness pavilion first.

53
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Oh, they have one?

54
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Yeah, sure.

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,840
And then talk to them and say, Hey, what kind of new technologies and innovations do you

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,080
have to keep me healthy?

57
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,960
You grab that first, then you hit the rest of the convention.

58
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
So you're ready to go.

59
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,960
Wow.

60
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,960
That's good.

61
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
Thank you.

62
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
Well, I'm feeling educated.

63
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,960
Yeah, I know.

64
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Yeah.

65
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,440
Now I feel like I have a little insider's tip on if we ever go to CS how to handle that.

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,600
Go to the health pavilion first.

67
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
You have to go.

68
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,520
I mean, it's one of those experiences that, by the way, I believe I was reading a stat

69
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,080
that this year, CS was the largest attended ever.

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
Really?

71
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,600
Because I heard a ton of people couldn't make it because of the snow and ice storms and

72
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
stuff.

73
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,600
Well, a lot of people showed up late.

74
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Oh, yeah, yeah.

75
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,080
But no, it was very, very highly attended.

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
Oh, that's cool.

77
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,880
Depending on the hall that you were in, of course.

78
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,600
So I want to pick your brain on Linux loving gadgets that you saw and just cool stuff you

79
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
saw there.

80
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,240
But as is per tradition here on the Unplugged show, we start with feedback.

81
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,820
We do the email up top because statistically, email is the thing that makes people tune

82
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,120
out the most because it's a little boring for a lot of people who aren't interested

83
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
in that topic.

84
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,580
So what I figured to do is we put at the top of the show, that way we spill off as many

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,720
people as possible right at the beginning.

86
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Get rid of them.

87
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,780
And we stuck with that format since episode one, so damn it, we're going to continue on.

88
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,280
So Michael wrote in, and Chase, I know you're going to have some opinions on this because

89
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
you saw these at the convention center.

90
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,680
I know Matt's got opinions on these, especially in terms of the economics.

91
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,760
Michael wrote and he said, the most exciting feature for Steam Machines, hi Chris and Matt

92
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,820
and Chase.

93
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,400
In my humble opinion, the best feature of the new Steam Machines is that the devices

94
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,640
will still be usable in five to seven years when the current console cycle ends.

95
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,380
It bothers me that companies like Microsoft and PlayStation move away from their old consoles

96
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,120
to the new ones and the leftover hardware is just virtually useless.

97
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,060
The hardware is still decent and could be used to serve a purpose if Linux could be

98
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,480
easily installed on them.

99
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,600
Example, why can't the Xbox 360 be refurbed and set up as a desktop computer for a kid

100
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,400
who's parents can't afford a regular computer?

101
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,800
With Steam Machines, this would not be a problem, as the console is already running Linux.

102
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,960
So once finished with the device as a gaming machine, it could still serve a useful purpose

103
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
rather than sitting in the trash heap.

104
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,040
Looking forward to another great show on Sunday, Michael.

105
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,240
What do you think of this, Chase, of you saw these Steam Machines.

106
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,080
I'm going to pick this email apart.

107
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,560
And you have some problems with these.

108
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
Yeah.

109
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,480
Okay, so what was your problem with the Steam Machines and tell me your thoughts.

110
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,280
Okay, well first off, can I respond to the email?

111
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,280
Michael?

112
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
Yeah.

113
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,080
First off, as a gamer, first and foremost, to say that the old Xbox 360 will be completely

114
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,960
useless since Microsoft and Sony have moved on to the new generation of consoles.

115
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Or PS3.

116
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,680
It is completely unfair because of the fact that, I don't know, there's an entire incredible

117
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,580
library of games alone that need to be played on the 360.

118
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,840
So to say that it's virtually useless-

119
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,840
That's true.

120
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,840
I mean, I still play SNES games.

121
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,840
Yeah.

122
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,560
So to say that it's completely gone, and not only that, there are some incredible apps

123
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,440
that work on the Xbox 360, even Plex works incredibly just fine.

124
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,600
But what about this ability?

125
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,280
What if you could put a DVD in that drive and you could install the desktop Linux distribution,

126
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,560
you could be browsing the web, you could be checking your email and use it, it's got PowerPC

127
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,560
processing in it.

128
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Yeah.

129
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Wouldn't that be nice?

130
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
Yeah, it would be nice.

131
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
And actually, Sony had that for a long time, remember?

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
They had the ability-

133
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,560
They pulled it, yeah.

134
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
And they pulled it.

135
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,360
So maybe, here's the thing, if they could pull it, maybe they can put it back on, right?

136
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,720
Maybe once the life cycle has completed for the PS3 and it's completely gone, then Sony

137
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,200
goes, all right, well, what we're going to do is we're going to give you guys the ability

138
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,440
to install your own custom OS like we did before.

139
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,640
So that could happen in the future, we don't know.

140
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,720
So we can't say automatically that they're going to cut it off and not make it happen.

141
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,960
The Xbox, the original Xbox, by the way, heavily moddable, you can make your own custom machine.

142
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,600
A lot of people, that's how Xbox Media Center, XBMC got started, remember, the original modded

143
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Xbox.

144
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,860
So you got that.

145
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:20,320
At CES, we saw loads, about 15 different Steam machines from all major manufacturers, Alienware,

146
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,240
Falcon Northwest.

147
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,960
Beautiful boxes, by the way, very, very well-innovated.

148
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,360
Right, I was pretty impressed by that.

149
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Micro-ITX designs.

150
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
They're really trying hard.

151
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,360
They look great.

152
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,160
But here's some of the problems that I foresee happening.

153
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,360
First off, you have a wide price range of boxes.

154
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
From 500 to 6,000.

155
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,400
From 500 to $6,000.

156
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,160
Now, obviously, they think that if you're going to buy the low-end, you're going to

157
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,040
be streaming from a higher-end compatible gaming machine that is not really meant for

158
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
you to game on.

159
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,720
Now, I don't know about you, Chris, but when I purchased a machine, say a computer, say

160
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,400
five to seven years ago, how honestly usable is it today other than basic web browsing

161
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,860
and email and stuff?

162
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,460
So it's very hard to say.

163
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:11,240
One of my issues is I don't know where Valve and Steam is going with this because of the

164
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,520
wide price points and the wide variety of what you can get.

165
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:21,520
They recently interviewed, I believe it was Engadget, they interviewed the CEO of Microsoft's

166
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,960
gaming division and asked him what he thought.

167
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,000
And he goes, well, first off, I know better than go head-to-head against Gabe Newell.

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
I know that.

169
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,960
But he says, I'm not really too worried because they're not really in our target because of

170
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,080
the wide variety of different platforms.

171
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,720
Well, Matt, let me ask you this.

172
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,020
So do you think if the Steam console, after two, three years of use, can be repurposed

173
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,480
as a desktop computer that could do email and web browsing running a Linux desktop,

174
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,160
does that change the value equation for you?

175
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,840
Because I know you've been critical of the high prices and you think they've got to get

176
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,160
that down to about $300.

177
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,860
Does a $600 Steam box seem more reasonable if two, three years down the road it can also

178
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,720
become a decent desktop?

179
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,400
I think that's delayed value.

180
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,840
I mean, the value is certainly there and there's no question of that.

181
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,600
And you'll certainly be able to get some value out of that.

182
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,080
But I'm not entirely sure that the person that initially dropped $600 in a gaming console

183
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:14,660
is looking for longevity value coming from a Linux box that's going to be then dated

184
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,180
specs at that point.

185
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,480
You're kind of mixing your apple juice and your orange juice there.

186
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,240
It just doesn't really make any sense.

187
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,520
Someone buys a mid-range box, maybe, but $600, I don't know.

188
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,480
Yeah, I guess people aren't going to look at that as a desktop replacement later on.

189
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
Yeah.

190
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,020
Although there's one scenario.

191
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,080
You're fairly affluent.

192
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Things are grooving.

193
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,520
You buy your $600 box.

194
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Then you lose your job.

195
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,840
Everything goes to crap.

196
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,840
And you now are trying to repurpose your existing equipment, Ben, there.

197
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,640
So yeah, absolutely.

198
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,040
Now then I could see it making sense.

199
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,720
And if that's a business model, the way the economy is going, it's certainly possible.

200
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
I mean, that could work out for them.

201
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Well, OK.

202
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
So I know Chase is critical of the streaming component of it.

203
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,800
But don't you think that the fact that you could buy, so say you get the mid-range, say

204
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,040
you get a $600 Steam machine today.

205
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,800
Well, that would be a low range, actually.

206
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Right.

207
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,000
And maybe it's got, maybe it has discrete graphics in it.

208
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,880
Maybe it's the Iris 5200 Pro.

209
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,880
It's somewhere in that range.

210
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
Integrated stuff there.

211
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Yeah.

212
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,560
But if this Steam box, if your primary goal is to play side-scrolling platformers, and

213
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,480
if your goal is to play controller-based games, maybe this isn't a big issue.

214
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Because again, it only has to send a 1080p signal.

215
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
That's correct.

216
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
It doesn't have to go beyond that, right?

217
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
No.

218
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
So that lowers it a little bit.

219
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,240
It doesn't have to do a 1440p display.

220
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,440
And then on top of that, this machine continues to be relevant because maybe you buy a Steam

221
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,760
box, a mid-level Steam box for a couple of years, and then after a couple of years you

222
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,280
buy a new desktop PC, and now you use the streaming capability, and all of a sudden

223
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,320
you're playing the latest games again on your Steam box.

224
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,560
You know, there's another problem here.

225
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,880
And it hasn't really been touched on too much, and the chatroom brought it up a little bit,

226
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,960
and then talked about the controller.

227
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,600
The recommended controller, I should say.

228
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,480
And they had a demonstration unit there.

229
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Did you get to try the controller?

230
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Yeah, but...

231
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
You did?

232
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Yeah, but...

233
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
What did you think?

234
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
Here's the thing.

235
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,560
It's a controller, so if I'm playing a first-person shooter, say like Half-Life 2, I believe the

236
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,280
demo was Portal 2, but it's a controller, right?

237
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:16,520
For us who play first-person shooters, especially on PCs and Linux machines, it's all about

238
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,620
the keyboard and mouse, right?

239
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,360
And so if they came up with a...

240
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,040
And a lot of people said, well, you could just plug in your own keyboard and mouse into

241
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
it.

242
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Okay, that's great.

243
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,280
You could have a 10-foot USB cable or a wireless, but then when you have something that's wireless,

244
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,600
it always introduces latency.

245
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,960
Well, let me flip that question around.

246
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,600
If you could plug that into your Xbox One today, wouldn't you?

247
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,760
Well, yes, and actually we saw something like that at the show too.

248
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,760
Okay, all right.

249
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,840
But you see what I'm saying.

250
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
You would do it.

251
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,080
You'd be willing to do it, and isn't the option to be able to do it nice?

252
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Yes, and cleanly.

253
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,620
And I think one of the things that's cool about the Steam Box is they're willing to

254
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,680
work with outside innovations like the Oculus Rift.

255
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,560
Valve has been working directly with the Oculus Rift.

256
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,080
It would be cool if the first thing that supports Oculus Rift is Steam Boxes, because it's not

257
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,520
going to be the Xbox One or the PlayStation 4.

258
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,760
They might come up with their own solution mid-product cycle and release it, kind of

259
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,640
like Microsoft released the Kinect towards the end of the Xbox 360's life cycle.

260
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,600
But Valve could be there day one with Oculus Rift support, and that could sell a few Steam

261
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Boxes too.

262
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
That would help.

263
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,600
That would help.

264
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,000
I think, like we've talked about before, the prices are too high now, and they're going

265
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,800
to remain too high for about at least a year.

266
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,000
It depends.

267
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,300
This is the weird thing, right?

268
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,840
What is their goal?

269
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,440
What is their target market here?

270
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,560
Are they trying to compete directly with consoles?

271
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,120
Well, if that answer is yes, then they have to compete on price point and features.

272
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,840
But couldn't you have flipped this conversation around ten years ago and said, what is this

273
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,560
gaming company doing making this distribution platform?

274
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,200
They've got a couple of games on there, it's wrapped in this horrible DRM, and what happens

275
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
to the used market?

276
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,040
Like, I go down to GameStop today, and I sell my old games, and I buy a new game.

277
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,480
You can't do that with Steam.

278
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
This is never going to work.

279
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,000
Well, they were able to do that.

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That was the conversation ten years ago.

281
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,240
Yeah, but they were also able to do that from the beginning, because PC gamers were always

282
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,840
kind of, we were kind of brainwashed in a way of like, once you put your code into the

283
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,920
computer, you can't move it anywhere else, right?

284
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,520
So that happened from the very, very beginning.

285
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Early enough.

286
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,720
And so when Valve came in with their distribution platform and said, hey, we have a way that

287
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,960
you can keep all your games in one place, you can always reinstall them whenever you

288
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:26,080
want, we're not going to go anywhere, that's why they've been successful with that.

289
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,880
But on the console side, you know, you've never, well, you've never had to, with the

290
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,000
exception of a few games, put in a code to be able to play them.

291
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yeah, you're starting to see it now, actually.

292
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,920
Well, EA, EA said, well, we're not going to do that anymore.

293
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,400
They actually said we're getting rid of the codes for online play.

294
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Oh, good.

295
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,000
Like, for example, if you bought the newest, I know you're a football fan, Chris.

296
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,480
Yeah, I like the sports ball, too.

297
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,000
Actually, if I'm ever going to watch football, it's going to be this weekend.

298
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yeah.

299
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The games could be incredible.

300
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah, I know.

301
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Let's say you bought Madden.

302
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,480
Well, the only way you could play Madden online is by entering the code that came with the

303
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,040
game, and EA is doing that to prevent resale.

304
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
Yeah.

305
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,200
So let's say you went and bought that game used, you would have to buy a new code from

306
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
EA to play that online.

307
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Which is just crap.

308
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,000
But they said they're going to discontinue that practice.

309
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh, how nice of them.

310
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah, isn't that nice?

311
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yeah.

312
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Thank you, EA.

313
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, Michael, good email, and thank you for saying that to the show.

314
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, totally.

315
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,840
And it's going to be definitely a watch and see thing, because there's, you know, and

316
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,040
then that's not even getting into the ecosystem or the marketing.

317
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,040
Right.

318
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Well, will I buy one?

319
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
Yeah.

320
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
Oh, yeah.

321
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Probably for sure.

322
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
Or build one.

323
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Yeah, or build one.

324
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,040
And that's the best part, right?

325
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Yeah, it is.

326
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
You can build your own and then have that back end ready for you.

327
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,400
Well, and see, this is, like Gabe said himself, he's not too worried about their 63 million

328
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,080
or whatever it was, Steam users, it's bigger than PS4s or the Xbox online.

329
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:41,260
And to be honest with you, if they could just sell to a few small percentages of that existing

330
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:47,440
market, who are just radically passionate about Steam and want to hook up a Steam box

331
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,440
to their TV to just to get a very trouble-free gaming experience.

332
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,600
I floated this idea on last, I kind of came up with it on the spot, and I was wondering

333
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
what you thought about it.

334
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,320
I think Mac users could be the perfect target for Steam boxes, because they hate Windows,

335
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,880
they don't want to futz with a PC, they don't even want to bother with Bootcamp because

336
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,560
they literally hate Windows, a lot like some of us Linux users do.

337
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,440
And so why not avoid all of the Windows hassles and just buy a Steam box appliance, that way

338
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,440
you get your PC games and you still get to have your pretty Mac.

339
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,720
Well, wait a minute, what if I just bought a Mac Mini?

340
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,920
I mean, what's the difference there then?

341
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,920
Put Steam OS on that panel.

342
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Right, exactly.

343
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
Well, I just buy a Mac Mini, right?

344
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Yeah, you could.

345
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,920
You could dual boot it, I suppose, or something like that.

346
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,360
I'm just saying, I think there is a market, but I think initially that market is going

347
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,080
to be people who are willing to pay that premium price, and that's really my point.

348
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
Right.

349
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
No, absolutely.

350
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,880
And then once we're through that phase, we're really going to see what Valve's end game

351
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
is.

352
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
Yeah, no, totally.

353
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,880
All right.

354
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,440
Well, Jay wrote in, and I think we'll bounce this one around for a little bit.

355
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,240
He says, Gnome still has a lot of an uphill battle ahead of it.

356
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,120
In your recent Gnome 3 defense episode, you mentioned a theory that people that are adverse

357
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,160
to Gnome 3's changes are those that resist change in general.

358
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,760
This isn't true for everyone.

359
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,840
Some have valid complaints, others just complain because they can.

360
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,560
Personally, I'm someone that loves change.

361
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,560
In fact, I crave it.

362
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,220
But Gnome 3's changes are just plain bad.

363
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,240
And I think that's the first problem with Gnome 3.

364
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,960
Tweak tools and extensions should not be required in order to make this experience usable.

365
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,040
Now, Matt, I think you probably agree with that, right?

366
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,600
I would agree with the fact that I think they should include them.

367
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,320
I don't have a problem with them existing.

368
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,520
I just think the fact that they're not provided by default doesn't make any sense to me.

369
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,040
Yeah, especially the really popular ones.

370
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,600
And of course, desktop environments continue to have the fanboyism.

371
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,720
As soon as you say anything about X, Y, Z, desktop environment, they come out of the

372
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,720
woodwork.

373
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
And that's just an expected thing.

374
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
It's kind of sad.

375
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,120
But it is what it is.

376
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,280
I kind of agree with them, though.

377
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,800
I think it's got a lot of growing pains from growing room.

378
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,320
It's going to have to kind of find its way.

379
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,320
I don't know.

380
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,360
I think that it's almost as if developers are saying, yes, we know the default user

381
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,520
experience is bad.

382
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,600
But that's OK, because we have a tweak tool and extensions.

383
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,040
It's easy for the Gnome developers to not be concerned with backlash when they're basically

384
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:55,160
telling their users to install extensions and fix the problem themselves.

385
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,760
And I, of course, go back to the, if you don't like it, don't use it.

386
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,000
I mean, at the end of the day, that's kind of my big thing.

387
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's like, I don't necessarily care for Gnome 3.

388
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,280
But rather than becoming emotionally invested in it, I'll revisit it later and see if I've

389
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,080
become more interested in it at that point.

390
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,440
But I don't see a lot of value in going off about it, because it's just like, yeah, it's

391
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
not for everybody.

392
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
I think they do a lot of things right.

393
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,720
I like the unification idea.

394
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
I think that's very cool.

395
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,520
It's something to watch.

396
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,800
But it's not quite there yet.

397
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
That's OK.

398
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
But why rip on it?

399
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
That's my big thing.

400
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:29,320
We got an email from a guy who's been using Gnome 3 on his Archbase Touch laptop.

401
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,700
And he says that it works OK, but there's still a few areas that it seems like the code

402
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,760
just hasn't been hooked up yet.

403
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,360
The Plum is not quite done yet.

404
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
Sure.

405
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,400
He says, he went on to say, anyways, awesome show.

406
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,440
And I hope Gnome gets their act together.

407
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
They have a long way to go.

408
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,600
He says, he predicts that someday Gnome will probably be completely awesome.

409
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,920
By that time, it happens, though.

410
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,280
I wonder if they'll have any user base left.

411
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,120
You know, I've been using Gnome 3 since our episode in defense of Gnome 3.

412
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,360
And what I've decided to teach myself is every couple of days, I learn a new keyboard shortcut.

413
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,560
And now I've got windows down where I can snap them to the different edges of the screen

414
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
with the keyboard.

415
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,640
I can move them between workspaces.

416
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,880
And then somebody else, and I'm sorry I forget their name right now, but somebody in our

417
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,360
community said, Chris, think of the activities as, any time you start something a little

418
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,680
bit different, do it in a new virtual desktop, because you can create them and destroy them

419
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,800
on will.

420
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,960
So what I have done is if I open up a new tab, sometimes I'll think, well, maybe this

421
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,080
is actually better to be done in a new workspace.

422
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,080
And I'll move it to a new workspace.

423
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,960
And I've been working that way.

424
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,480
So I've been trying to get Gnome 3 down towards muscle memory so I can then really say, OK,

425
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,720
if I retrain myself to do the Gnome way of things, is it usable?

426
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,280
And the things like super key M and it shows the notifications and stuff like that, I'm

427
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,120
actually really starting to dig it.

428
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,560
But it does require that you change the way you use it a little bit and you kind of learn

429
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,560
its new way.

430
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,640
But I am trying to find out that if I totally subscribe to their philosophy, do I become

431
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,720
more efficient?

432
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,400
But it's one of those things that just takes weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks

433
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
of usage.

434
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Yes, it does.

435
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,600
That is where I'm at right now.

436
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,600
All right.

437
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,800
Well, before we move on, we had a great post in the subreddit.

438
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:06,160
And it came from Shimmy C. And he says, DigitalOcean posted droplet distro usage

439
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
stats.

440
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,000
It's pretty much exactly what you would expect.

441
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,160
And we were talking last week on Linux Unplugged with Mr. Popey in the mumble room.

442
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:22,040
And we were talking about how CentOS and Red Hat had merged and how right now the stranglehold

443
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
that...

444
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
Oh, dang it.

445
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
I changed that.

446
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,280
The stranglehold that Ubuntu has on cloud providers is strong.

447
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,200
Maybe that's one of the reasons Red Hat wanted to work closer with CentOS.

448
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,920
Well, DigitalOcean posted their droplet stats.

449
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,760
Ubuntu has 66% of active droplets on DigitalOcean.

450
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:48,040
Debian has 12%, CentOS has 18%, and Arch is coming in at a mighty 1.34%, only to beat

451
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,080
out Fedora at 0.81%.

452
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Wow.

453
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
So there you go.

454
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,640
Ubuntu rocking 66% of the DigitalOcean droplets.

455
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,440
A lot of that is direct LAMP stack.

456
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,280
Sometimes it's WordPress deployments.

457
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:06,440
Docker, actually since this is the first year of Docker, a respectable 1.74% of deployments

458
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
use Docker.

459
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,640
Now what is DigitalOcean?

460
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,880
DigitalOcean is a simple cloud hosting provider dedicated to offering the most intuitive and

461
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,240
easy way to spin up a cloud server.

462
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,640
Users can get started with a DigitalOcean droplet as in little as 55 seconds.

463
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,840
Now I'll make a personal challenge to you, dear listener.

464
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,440
I was able to do it in 44 seconds.

465
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,440
That's right.

466
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,580
I'm dropping the gauntlet right here on the Linux Unplugged show.

467
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,840
Can you do it faster?

468
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Perhaps go over to DigitalOcean and find out, and while you're over there, take advantage

469
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,200
of our brand new promo code, Linux Unplugged January.

470
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,560
That's going to get you a $10 DigitalOcean credit, and if you use the $5 rig like I've

471
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,280
been using, that's going to get you two months of the DigitalOcean service.

472
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,360
They have a super intuitive interface with any power users can even replicate on a larger

473
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,840
scale with their straightforward API.

474
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,440
Chris, I'm confused here.

475
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,640
I know I'm a noob in this arena.

476
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,320
What does DigitalOcean do?

477
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,700
If you wanted to go over to DigitalOcean's site, you could spin up a full-fledged server

478
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,320
in under a minute, and you could have an Ubuntu rig.

479
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,560
You were recently playing around with Airtime, which we got going finally, and it's really

480
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,600
easy to get them running on Ubuntu.

481
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Did you do it on CentOS?

482
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
No, no.

483
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
We had to go to Ubuntu.

484
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,800
We couldn't do it on Cent.

485
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,460
For example, you could go over to DigitalOcean.

486
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,460
You could log in.

487
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,200
If you use our promo code, Linux Unplugged January, you'll get two months of DigitalOcean

488
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,780
for free with a $10 credit.

489
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:26,520
That gets you 512 megs of RAM, a 20-gigabyte SSD, one CPU, and a terabyte of transfer,

490
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,400
which is great for an audio streaming rig.

491
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:33,800
You could deploy it immediately from the get-go with Ubuntu 13.10 ready to go, and then you

492
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,400
could get Airtime installed and get everything configured just the way you want it, and then

493
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,720
you can save that droplet and then deploy it later, like next time if you want to deploy

494
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,160
a secondary stream server to do a lower bit rate.

495
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,160
Wow.

496
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Yeah, it's really simple.

497
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Where are they located?

498
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,300
Well, Chase, I'm glad you asked because DigitalOcean has data centers located in New York, San

499
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,320
Francisco, and Amsterdam.

500
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,840
This wasn't planned, by the way.

501
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
I'm honestly inquiring.

502
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,240
Well, actually, I don't know if you knew this, but so for the Unfilter show, I distribute

503
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,960
the supporter show via BitTorrent Sync, and I host it here at my house on the FiOS connection,

504
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,120
which is a 50-50 connection.

505
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
It's pretty good.

506
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,560
And then, because I'm on the West Coast, I have a DigitalOcean VPS on the East Coast

507
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,800
that has a copy of the BitTorrent Sync so that way folks can get seeding it from both

508
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,120
sides of the United States, and it really helps with performance, and it's really straightforward.

509
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
But guess what?

510
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,080
This is so freaking awesome.

511
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,700
DigitalOcean is really excited because they have a contest going on right now.

512
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,080
They're giving away $10,000 in free hosting credits to the user that spins up the millionth

513
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
droplet.

514
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
That's right.

515
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:41,560
You get $10,000 of DigitalOcean hosting credits if you spin up the millionth droplet.

516
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Now, look at this.

517
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,400
Right now, 983 million is at their end change.

518
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,040
So they're really, really close, you guys.

519
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,920
So go over to DigitalOcean.com, use our brand new promo code, Linux Unplugged January, get

520
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,680
the $10 credit, and maybe, just maybe, you can spin up the millionth droplet and get

521
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
$10,000.

522
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Wow.

523
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,680
Wow.

524
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,680
That's pretty incredible.

525
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
Pretty cool.

526
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Yeah.

527
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
You know what, Chase?

528
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
That does deserve a ding.

529
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
Stand by.

530
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,680
There you go.

531
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,680
So go check it out.

532
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:15,480
Go over to DigitalOcean.com, and a big thank you to DigitalOcean for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

533
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,280
Ever since I put my BitTorrent sync over there, it's just boom.

534
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,480
People are downloading the show, and it absolutely saturates their connection.

535
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,480
That is awesome.

536
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
Yeah.

537
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
It really makes the shipping of files super quick.

538
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
Okay.

539
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
All right, guys.

540
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,120
Well, there's a lot of things to talk about, but Chase, before we get into some of the

541
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,760
other topics I had on the agenda, now that we've got you here in studio, I just wanted

542
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,520
to pick your brain on what was, if you could just narrow it down to, is it possible?

543
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,120
Is there one thing that you really thought was just amazing at CES, or one theme?

544
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
Well, well.

545
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
Was it wearables?

546
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
Let's be honest.

547
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
Wearables was there.

548
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:53,760
4K TV Ultra High Def was everywhere, especially in the north and central halls where you had

549
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,760
all the manufacturer, Sharp, LG, Sony.

550
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,920
NVIDIA had a big booth, too, showing off their Tegra technologies inside cars.

551
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:09,040
Obviously, they had a demo set up in the parking lot where BMW had their electric cars running

552
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,800
on NVIDIA with the front patch.

553
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
It's incredible stuff.

554
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:17,560
Was anybody dropping the Linux name or BOM, or did you see any TUX logos anywhere?

555
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:23,520
Didn't see any TUX logos anywhere, but Linux was obviously the underlying operating system

556
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
on a lot of platforms.

557
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:31,560
I mean, you could see it with the Sharps and the LGs and stuff where they have their customized

558
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
overlays with-

559
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,480
Yeah, like LG was actually running webOS.

560
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,360
Yes, yes, and we saw that.

561
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,600
What did you think?

562
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
You know what?

563
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,440
For such a, I call it beta right now, obviously it's not out there in full-frame, but it was

564
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,440
very, very smooth and it worked very, very well.

565
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,440
One of the things I hate about all TVs that have these built-in interfaces, it feels sluggish.

566
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:56,840
It's like, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, and then it finally kicks in and it's like the overlays

567
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,680
are not as smooth.

568
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,400
This looked very, very good.

569
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,560
Well, one of the things I've heard is a nightmare with these smart TVs is every smart TV, even

570
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,880
like the different models have their own SDK and they're super complex to write for, but

571
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,040
if you had webOS with HTML5 and that kind of stuff.

572
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,000
Did you happen to see any of the TVs that run in Firefox OS?

573
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,080
No, I didn't see one.

574
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,160
I'm really curious how that works out.

575
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,680
I guess, so these LGs with webOS were the ones that would only, these were the TVs that

576
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,480
Netflix said will support 4K streaming.

577
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:36,400
So here we have, once again, Netflix doing 4K streaming to a Linux box, webOS is a Linux

578
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,280
based OS, meanwhile, it's Linux users out in the cold, got to hack Silverlight together

579
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,720
in order to watch Netflix, but they're using Linux.

580
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,920
They're using it, but they're, oh, come on, I mean, they got to pay for a house of cards,

581
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,920
right?

582
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,920
They got to pay for it somehow.

583
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,840
They got big money, they got to pay Kevin Spacey too.

584
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,640
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

585
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,080
I'm going to bring in the Mumba room here in case they have any questions about CES,

586
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:03,080
but I just, you know, I was curious, what did you think?

587
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,720
But there were definitely some items at CES.

588
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:11,320
We were talking about this in the pre-show, a company by the name of Ativitas makes a

589
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:17,240
handheld, a customizable controller, and it's for PC and Linux.

590
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,400
By the way, you know, Chris was telling me, hey, we're going to bring you on the Linux

591
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,000
action show.

592
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,920
Part of the thing in the back of my head was look for, you know, Linux items as well to

593
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,440
bring back for the show.

594
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:35,640
And not only we saw this company, they make something called the Sinister and it's a great

595
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,640
thing.

596
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,400
And for those who are watching the video feed, basically it's a handheld controller.

597
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,580
It's fully customizable.

598
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,120
You can extend it out, but also has these little modules with buttons on them, joysticks

599
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,960
or whatever, and they're literally plug and play and you can do it while it's plugged

600
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,960
into the system.

601
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,480
So this is a USB controller, does this replace the keyboard or what does this do exactly?

602
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,800
Yeah, basically it does.

603
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,760
So you plug your mouse into this.

604
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,440
So there is a USB port so you can use your favorite USB mouse.

605
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,080
And then this is a handheld control.

606
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,600
So remember a Logitech made a couple of years ago, I think it's like the G19 or G58, you

607
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,160
know, one of those monikers.

608
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
With all the keys.

609
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
With all the keys.

610
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,000
Well, take that, add haptic feedback to it, which is very, very cool.

611
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,720
So you feel the pulsation of every single bullet that you fire, but then you could also

612
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,040
move the modules around on the fly and like, all right, I need to pull out this button

613
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,360
controller module and put in a joystick module and just pop it in.

614
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Oh, yeah.

615
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,120
Set that up with the Oculus Rift.

616
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,800
Oh, now wouldn't that be a good combo?

617
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,880
So right now, as you can see by the picture, these parts have been 3D printed.

618
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,880
What?

619
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,160
Yeah, so they're still working on this right now.

620
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,520
This is a very early days.

621
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
This is Alpha.

622
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,600
They told me they are six months out.

623
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,940
They are six months out.

624
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,600
Basically these are held in place by magnets and it works.

625
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,560
I was actually playing some Call of Duty, so I had one of their mice and I was using

626
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:08,080
that and we moved some modules around while I was playing and it worked seamlessly.

627
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,440
And while you were there, they specifically stated Linux support?

628
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,440
Yeah, they did.

629
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,280
And actually, I believe they stated on their website too, PC and Linux.

630
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,080
They specifically say that.

631
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,360
This is interesting because I don't know if it would replace the keyboard for me, but

632
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,360
I don't know.

633
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,360
I wonder if I could have...

634
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,000
I mean, you can see the thumb.

635
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,160
He's also got buttons here.

636
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
There's all their images.

637
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,400
Let me scroll through.

638
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,560
But as you can see, here's another better image.

639
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,800
Here on his...

640
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,000
He moved the little thumb stick module that was here.

641
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
He moved it here.

642
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Interesting.

643
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,520
So he had a little bit of a look button.

644
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,640
So yeah, this is one of those pieces of technology that they don't even have a price point for

645
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,800
yet, but you can fully customize the length of it.

646
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,080
You plug your mouse into it and it works great.

647
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,280
I'm really fascinated by these alternative inputs for the computer because it feels like

648
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,480
the keyboard and mouse, awesome as it is, is very old school.

649
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,000
And there has to be a more efficient way to almost more instinctively and organically

650
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,720
interact with these computers because I feel like the only thing now at this point, I know

651
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
this sounds stupid.

652
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
There's a good picture there.

653
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
That is a really good picture.

654
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,360
You can see that as more of a controller there.

655
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,800
I feel like right now, I was playing very briefly.

656
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,200
Do you remember when we went to PAX, I picked up that pedal switch?

657
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Yeah.

658
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Oh yeah.

659
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
What was it though?

660
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
The stinky foot.

661
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Yeah, the stinky foot.

662
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,200
Yeah.

663
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,200
And for a brief period in time, I was using that.

664
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,000
I would drop my foot on that.

665
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,640
It would drop down a terminal screen for me and I could type in the terminal and I'd tap

666
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,480
it again and it would bring the terminal back up and it would slide up and down on my screen.

667
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
Yeah.

668
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,680
That was awesome for about two days.

669
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,160
And then I did the show, I talked about it and I left it out in the studio and I didn't

670
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,680
bring it back to my desk and I never hooked it up again.

671
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:45,680
Oh, I thought you were going to say you got some sort of repetitive foot injury from using

672
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
it so many times.

673
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
No.

674
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
No.

675
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,680
I mean, my foot was fine, but it was neat to interact with the computer in a different

676
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,680
way.

677
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,320
I mean, at the end of the day, it's like, well, I can't have this at every computer

678
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
I use, right?

679
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Yeah.

680
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,000
And this is a problem I see with a lot of this stuff is where voice and hand gestures

681
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,520
and movements eventually could be integrated into every computer that has the appropriate

682
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
sensors.

683
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,080
These types of controllers are going to require that every computer you sit down at has this

684
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,240
device connected to it and I just don't see that happening.

685
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
Yeah.

686
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
Yeah.

687
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,440
No, it's one of those situations where, as we're seeing it with the Oculus, right, is

688
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,160
the different ways to interact, different input devices, but it's still encouraging

689
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,280
to see that you have a company.

690
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,800
Now, I don't think I touched on it enough.

691
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,680
This device also has haptic feedback.

692
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:36,000
So you could be playing a game or doing something where you fire upon something and you feel

693
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,120
feedback in your fingertips depending on what you're shooting at.

694
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
That's cool.

695
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
Yeah.

696
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
That is pretty cool for gaming.

697
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,680
Yeah, but also you could use it for other purposes, I guess.

698
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:50,480
I wonder if there's some way accessibility-wise, like if there was a way to provide feedback

699
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,760
to maybe a blind user.

700
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Yeah.

701
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
I could see that for sure.

702
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
That could be pretty cool.

703
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
Yeah.

704
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Like they know that they're in the sentence or they're typing.

705
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
I'm not sure.

706
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,560
I don't use much accessibility stuff, but no, it's one of the most interesting things

707
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,760
I saw.

708
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,120
Another thing which I don't have any pictures of, I have to post the interview up still,

709
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:16,880
but there's a company that was basically creating a new controller that will supposedly work

710
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,640
on PC, Linux, and also next-gen consoles.

711
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Another controller?

712
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
Yeah.

713
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:30,160
But this particular interface is essentially based upon ultrasonic waves and sound.

714
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
What?

715
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
What?

716
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,160
They were talked away.

717
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,160
No one covered this.

718
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
No one found it.

719
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
I haven't heard of this at all.

720
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,840
But basically, you know how the Kinect works, right?

721
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Or the-

722
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Cameras and infrared and whatnot.

723
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,840
Cameras and infrared and stuff.

724
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:46,200
Well, this is using ultrasonic waves, so it pings back and forth between you-

725
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Like a submarine?

726
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Essentially.

727
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,840
One ping only.

728
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,080
One ping only, for silly.

729
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,040
One ping only.

730
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,960
So the controller, there's these sensors that are placed on top of the TV and on the sides

731
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,040
of the TV, and it knows, based upon proximity to those sensors, how close or far away that

732
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
controller is.

733
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,400
So if you're making an aiming motion or a shooting motion-

734
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,280
Like if I'm holding a gun sideways like a gangster?

735
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,120
It knows that you're holding it sideways-

736
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
And I'm a gangster.

737
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
And that you're a gangster.

738
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
Yeah.

739
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,160
And it knows it within one one-hundredth-thousandth of an inch.

740
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Wow!

741
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,440
That's way better than I would know it.

742
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Right.

743
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,520
So part of the problem, I guess, and they explained it to me in the interview, a lot

744
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,740
of it's over my head right now, but they explained to me that the problem with Kinect and these

745
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:35,000
other services, it doesn't have, it's not very good at depth perception, per se.

746
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Oh, interesting.

747
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It's not very accurate.

748
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,280
While it can emulate and knows that your arm's going up and down, it doesn't know necessarily

749
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:45,920
that you're, let's say if I move my hand from one foot behind to one foot forward, it doesn't

750
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,200
necessarily know that I've moved my hand one foot forward.

751
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,240
So with the ultrasonic, it actually is, you know, it knows that all the time between my

752
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,500
hand being here and here has changed, it can emulate that onto the screen.

753
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:03,580
So you have just told Matt and I in the mumble room about two different types of interface

754
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,280
devices, not even counting Oculus Rift, but let's throw that in there.

755
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,440
So three different types of brand new ways to interact with your computer.

756
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,640
And I can't help thinking all of these, you'd, you could see working on the steam box before

757
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,200
you see them working anywhere else.

758
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
That's true.

759
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,280
All valve has to do is place a call to these guys, these little guys, right?

760
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,600
I mean, dude, if you're making this controller on your 3d printer and Gabe calls you up,

761
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,200
yeah, you're going to answer that call.

762
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,520
And if Gabe says, hi there, we'd like to work with you to integrate support for this into

763
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,740
steam OS, shit, yeah, you're going to do that.

764
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:37,120
And you see how they have such an advantage here if they take, if they just grasp it by

765
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,700
the sack and they don't, you know what I want to see?

766
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,880
So we, this was talked about in the mumble room before the show.

767
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,560
Razer was there, big gaming company showing off one gaming related item and one non gaming

768
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,960
related item.

769
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,840
The gaming related item is called project Christine, right?

770
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,000
The modular PC.

771
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
We talked about this on last.

772
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,960
We, we had a, we had a actual private interview.

773
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,760
We got a, we got an interview, we got pictures, we got the whole thing that's going to be

774
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,760
a video to watch.

775
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
Yeah.

776
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,880
Now we weren't able to actually touch any of the modules.

777
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
Well yes and no.

778
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,040
So they had a, they had two systems pre set up.

779
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
Okay.

780
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,440
So basically I don't know if you've seen pictures of project Christine, but it's, you know,

781
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,640
it's a modular based system.

782
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,320
That is of course a concept at this point for them.

783
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,320
Right.

784
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
Very much so.

785
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,320
Very much so.

786
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,000
However, it looks phenomenal.

787
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
And you know what?

788
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,040
I take that back when I said I didn't see Tux, Tux was there, Tux was there at the Razer

789
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
booth.

790
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Oh really?

791
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,640
Because on the front of projects Christine's box is a touch screen.

792
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
Yeah.

793
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
We were talking about this in last.

794
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,080
It looked very, it looked very high tech.

795
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,160
In fact, Matt said he'd buy it because of the screen alone.

796
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:52,080
Well, the screen actually had three, three logos on it.

797
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,160
It had a Tux logo.

798
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,400
It had a Windows logo and I forget the third logo.

799
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,680
It wasn't steam or anything.

800
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,520
But yeah, it is fully modular.

801
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:08,720
So on the back you, you pop in your SSDs, you pop in your, your memory and your CPU.

802
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:14,080
The power supply is also module and it just looks very, very sexy.

803
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,080
It's a very, very nice.

804
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,560
Now granted though, it's very, very proprietary.

805
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Sure.

806
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
Sure.

807
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:27,080
You know, we were, Blackout 24 probably an OSD Warp logo, sorry, haven't seen that busted

808
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,400
out in a while.

809
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,920
So they obviously didn't have a price point for us, but they did tell us some really cool

810
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,880
details on what they, their thoughts were on this.

811
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Oh yeah.

812
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:44,160
But it's, it's one of those things where it'd be good for the beginner, quote unquote.

813
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:51,400
And Joe and I, the, the, the co-host on Minecraft Me, and we were talking about this in a theoretical

814
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
sense.

815
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,120
What if they set this up like a cell phone where you buy the system.

816
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,520
So for say $200 to $300, you sign a two year agreement, you pay a hundred dollars a month.

817
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,760
And as they update modules, they, that you get, you get an upgrade.

818
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Yeah.

819
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,560
In fact, I think Razer was even talking about a subscription service.

820
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,560
Yeah.

821
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:13,860
So I, I thought Matt, Matt made a throwaway remark on the Linux action show on Sunday

822
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,120
that I thought was really poignant.

823
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:20,580
And Matt said, if people will buy the Mac pro, people might buy this Razer PC because

824
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,160
it has a lot of the advantages of a Mac pro with that, with that oil cooling.

825
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Right.

826
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,360
It's, it's super, it's super slick looking, but it's way more powerful.

827
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,280
But, but here's the big, but right.

828
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
Well, potentially more powerful.

829
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
Yeah.

830
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,960
Big, but here with Apple, you know that they're not going to go away tomorrow, right?

831
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,200
You know that, I mean, they've been around for a while.

832
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,360
You know, they're going to support their devices for a while.

833
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,760
The parts that you buy for it are not really proprietary.

834
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,000
Do you really know the Mac pro is going to be around for a while?

835
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I don't think they do.

836
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Yeah.

837
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,400
They, they, they change and drop stuff enough to where it's kind of like the company itself.

838
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,400
But I think that form factors and such, it's like, you know what we need, we need a garbage

839
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
can that runs software.

840
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,400
And they put that out there, you know, it's just like, wow, really?

841
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,580
If you came to me from five years in the future and you said, yeah, well that was the last

842
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,080
Mac pro Apple ever made.

843
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,560
You would not surprise me.

844
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Yeah.

845
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,840
I mean, I see what you're saying, whereas like razor could start it and then never make

846
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,840
another one.

847
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:19,340
Very, very afraid because if I wanted to get a new hard drive, I would have no, no choice

848
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:20,340
but to go through razor.

849
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,340
I have no other, right?

850
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,340
That sucks.

851
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,340
That's actually a good point.

852
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,340
Yeah.

853
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,340
That does suck.

854
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,100
I mean, obviously, you know, I think it was, I fixed it at the breakdown of the new Mac

855
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,100
pro.

856
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,100
Yeah.

857
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,320
Granted, there is no way of doing it at this point, but you could drop out the parts, drop

858
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,560
in a new CPU or a new SSD.

859
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,240
That's going to be such a closed environment on the, on the razor side of things.

860
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,920
You've got to buy a razor component.

861
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,360
You're going to have to buy a razor component.

862
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Yeah.

863
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,360
With that oil cooling hookup.

864
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,160
Or without avoiding your warranty and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

865
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,840
So we'll, we'll have to see.

866
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,840
Wow.

867
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,840
Cool.

868
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Cold water port on that one.

869
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,840
Sorry.

870
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,840
I just thought it'd be the ultimate Linux rig.

871
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
No, I bet it would.

872
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
I bet it would be incredible.

873
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,840
I mean, the thing is right.

874
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,200
I mean, here's the only thing though.

875
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,000
If you're going to buy one, if they ever come out with it, first off, if you're going to

876
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,360
buy it after it comes up, maybe, uh, maybe wait six months and then buy it, don't, don't

877
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,680
be an early adopter on it.

878
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,440
Even though it's very, very cool, Matt, even though that's awesome.

879
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,520
Got away.

880
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,520
Got away.

881
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,320
Well, so, uh, we, I feel like we're doing a disservice now.

882
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,600
I don't really, we got to talk about 4k, but I don't mean in a TV sense, did you see any

883
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,800
computer monitors you could actually see yourself buying?

884
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,440
I'm picturing gnome 3 on a 4k display.

885
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
Yes.

886
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
Yes.

887
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,960
Uh, LG had an incredible is a 21 by nine ratio.

888
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,640
So 21 by nine.

889
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,720
That makes me uncomfortable on the inside.

890
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,480
It's ultra wide, Chris.

891
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,480
It's very ultra wide.

892
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,480
That sounds ultra wide.

893
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Yeah, I know it is.

894
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,780
Uh, but, uh, the, uh, LG had a few monitors there, uh, and actually I think you're going

895
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,760
to, uh, bring it, bring up one of the, ah, yeah, I saw that there.

896
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
There's 30 inch guy.

897
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
What'd you think of this?

898
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
Oh my God.

899
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:00,920
So you could put literally four, 10 ADP screens on, on here.

900
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
Four 1080p.

901
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,920
Four 1080.

902
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,400
So, so corner, corner, corner, corner.

903
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,120
I mean, for video editing, this is, this is all, all, you know, I, when I went over there

904
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,440
in the, the, uh, I think one of their spokes models, uh, and yeah, she was pretty hot.

905
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,320
I was like, I was like, I so want this right now.

906
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,880
Um, it's, it's, it's so cool.

907
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,360
Now granted though, the problem is when you're looking at super high def or ultra high def

908
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,380
or 4k or however you want to explain it, you got to make sure that you have a pretty good

909
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,320
video card that can push this thing.

910
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,800
Because remember, it's not just the size of the monitor.

911
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
It's the size.

912
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,800
It's the resolution.

913
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,800
It's the pixels.

914
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,800
And that's so much bandwidth.

915
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Oh, oh it is.

916
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Yeah.

917
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,840
And I've, I've heard like in some cases what they're doing is they're splitting it into

918
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:46,400
two 1080p signals and they're, and they're, what they're doing is, or not even, that's

919
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,860
not even a fair way to say it, but they're essentially having it.

920
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,360
So you have, uh, sort of like we used to have dual-

921
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,800
Half the screen's handling, handling one side, half the screen's the other.

922
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,800
Yeah.

923
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,800
Thank you.

924
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Yeah.

925
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
Yeah.

926
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
So maybe that makes it a little more, uh, accommodable, but

927
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
Well, here's the good news, right?

928
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,520
The port, I believe handles 4k signal just fine.

929
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:09,360
I also believe the new HDMI spec 1.4, uh, I could be wrong there, uh, also handles that

930
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,360
new spec as well.

931
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,280
So you still just have one cable going to your monitor.

932
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:18,600
But the thing is, like you, Chris, I see this as a great production tool.

933
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
For gaming, probably not.

934
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,440
And the, sorry gamers, and the reason for that is simple.

935
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:29,600
While it'd be great to have that, that big real estate, you can get big real estate now

936
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,360
and don't need 4k high def.

937
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,960
I mean, a lot of games will probably not even right now with the current graphics that are

938
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,480
out there, but would probably struggle with that kind of resolution.

939
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,280
I'm looking at how wide this is and there's really no way to visualize this unless you're

940
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,760
looking at the video version of this show, but

941
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
No, no.

942
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,400
And not, and not even the quality either.

943
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,280
It's like two 16 by nine displays put together in length and width.

944
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
It's beautiful.

945
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,200
You could watch, for example, a theater movie without bars because it's at the correct theater

946
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
aspect ratio.

947
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:00,720
I was just thinking, you know, when I'm doing this show, you know, I've got one, two, three,

948
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,840
four, five.

949
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,080
You could do it all on one, Chris.

950
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,080
Yeah.

951
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,080
I got five screens going right now.

952
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,600
You could literally do this on one or maybe just two because you know you want to.

953
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Well, yeah.

954
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,200
It's got to look like a cockpit after all.

955
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Yeah.

956
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,440
I'd like you to try to mirror that twice.

957
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
I know, right?

958
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,440
Right?

959
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
Yeah.

960
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,840
It's going to make a mirroring displays to the live stream capture a little more difficult.

961
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,280
Of course, 4k live streams are going to be a little ways out there.

962
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,720
Well, you know, I've heard podcasters go like, hey, I want to do a 1080p live stream.

963
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,760
I'm thinking, no one's going to be able to watch it.

964
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,760
Right.

965
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,760
And now 4k?

966
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
Yeah.

967
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,640
I mean, who's going to want to see the pores on my skin?

968
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,640
Exactly.

969
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,640
Come on.

970
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,480
But for video game reviews and software reviews, I'd want it.

971
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,960
Well, you know what?

972
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,600
It reminds me of...

973
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,360
Maybe the web's going to be okay with HD for a long time.

974
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,600
You know, we saw this already.

975
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:51,880
And Back to the Future 2, when Marty sat down from his long day at work, he says, show me

976
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,160
17, 45, 37, and then Weather Channel.

977
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,840
And it was all on one big panel, right?

978
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,560
So we're seeing the future come to light.

979
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,560
So true.

980
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
So true.

981
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,480
Well, we got to shift gears here.

982
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,960
I want to talk about some big news.

983
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,520
There was a really big Linux gadget for the home that was purchased recently.

984
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,440
And I want to talk about that briefly.

985
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,960
But before we get to that, I've got to thank Ting.com, another sponsor of Linux Unplugged.

986
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,360
And Ting is mobile that makes sense.

987
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:22,680
My mobile service provider and Matt's mobile service provider, Matt's rocking the Note

988
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,680
2.

989
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,680
I'm rocking the Nexus 5 right here.

990
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,840
What do you think, Chase?

991
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,840
You know what?

992
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:32,800
Speaking of phones, my HTC One's coming back, but I'm really close to jumping ship to something

993
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,800
else.

994
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,800
Well, you might consider the Nexus 5.

995
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
I know.

996
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
I mean, that weight and that...

997
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,800
It definitely beats the HTC One there.

998
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,800
And I love the screen, too.

999
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,800
And the thinness.

1000
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,800
Yeah.

1001
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
Yeah.

1002
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
So let's talk about Ting.

1003
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,800
So go over to Linux.ting.com.

1004
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,360
That's how you're going to get started.

1005
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,800
If you go to Linux.ting.com, that'll take $25 off your first device if you don't have one.

1006
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,440
If you've got a Sprint compatible device, they've got a BYOD page.

1007
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,040
You can check out what is compatible with the Ting network.

1008
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,600
If you bring your own device, they'll take $25 off your first month of service.

1009
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,880
Now average for Jupiter broadcasting switchers, the average monthly bill is about $33 a month.

1010
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,880
How do I know that?

1011
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:09,800
Because hundreds of Linux action show and Linux Unplugged and Koda Radio and TechSnap

1012
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,680
fans have switched over to Ting.

1013
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,960
And there's a good reason.

1014
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,240
You only pay for what you use.

1015
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,600
They take your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes at the end of the month.

1016
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,080
They add them all up, whatever bucket you fall into.

1017
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,680
That's what you pay over at Ting.com.

1018
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,120
Plus they have an incredibly powerful dashboard.

1019
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:27,920
And if you've struggled managing your wireless account, setting up where calls go, setting

1020
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,320
up call forwarding, setting up and deactivating phones, let me tell you, Ting refreshes all

1021
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
of that.

1022
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,560
They bring it into the 2000s and even into 2014.

1023
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,560
That's right.

1024
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,040
Ting has a 2014 compatible dashboard.

1025
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,340
And I suggest you go over to Linux.ting.com to get started.

1026
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:44,560
And by the way, now's a better time than ever.

1027
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,800
They have a savings calculator that's linked right at the beginning, right there at the

1028
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,200
front when you go to Linux.ting.com.

1029
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,720
If you use that savings calculator, plug in your existing wireless bill, like Mr. Chase

1030
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,720
over here.

1031
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,720
He has one of the top two.

1032
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,600
And if you went over there and plugged in his wireless bill-

1033
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
I have.

1034
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,600
He might shed a tear.

1035
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,600
Actually, you know what?

1036
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,600
A singular tear.

1037
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
I will say this.

1038
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:08,040
I'm very, very close to my unlimited data because I'm one of the few people that still

1039
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,040
have it.

1040
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,040
And I have done this.

1041
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,160
If I honestly didn't have unlimited data, then I would do this.

1042
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,160
Well, see, and this is great for me because I was in your same position.

1043
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:22,260
But what I realized is that I had this massive voice contract that I was using a tiny fraction

1044
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,260
of.

1045
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:24,260
I was paying-

1046
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:25,260
Oh, we have the voice.

1047
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:26,260
We overpay for voice so much.

1048
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,580
I was paying $120 per month for my smartphone plan.

1049
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,440
Now I pay around $30 per month.

1050
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,120
I get tethering and hotspot included, which is amazing, uses just the built-in Android

1051
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:37,120
features.

1052
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,960
So if you try out their savings calculator and you tweet out your results, you'll be

1053
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,880
entered into a drawing to win a Samsung Galaxy S4 for free.

1054
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,760
Plus there's going to be other lucky Ting contestants who get a $50 Ting credit.

1055
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,960
So if you go over to linux.ting.com, use that savings calculator, which is linked right

1056
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:55,520
there in the middle of the page with all of the happy people.

1057
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,220
You try that out, tweet out your savings results, Bob's your uncle.

1058
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:03,360
You can get entered to draw a Samsung Galaxy S4 from Ting.

1059
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,720
And I'm telling you, you're going to be so happy.

1060
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,520
It's the beginning of a new year, folks.

1061
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,520
2014 just started.

1062
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,080
Now is a better time than ever to go save by going to linux.ting.com and find out what

1063
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,760
I've been talking about and why I've been a happy customer for over a year now.

1064
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,440
Linux.ting.com and a huge thank you to Ting for sponsoring Linux Unplugged.

1065
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,440
I'm serious, you guys.

1066
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,440
Bob's your uncle.

1067
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,240
This is a cell phone company that is doing it right and we should support them for doing

1068
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,240
it right.

1069
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,800
They're going to clean up the wireless industry one customer at a time, and I really mean

1070
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,800
it.

1071
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,800
Okay.

1072
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,080
So Chase, since you're here.

1073
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,080
Yes.

1074
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:39,320
Well, like it would only be appropriate in the spirit of Linux Unplugged, we should play

1075
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,360
a news clip.

1076
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,160
So right now on the show, I know, right?

1077
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,160
Breaking news.

1078
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,160
Wait, wait, wait.

1079
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,160
Today's Tuesday, right?

1080
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,160
I just want to make sure.

1081
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,760
Here we go.

1082
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,440
Google buys Nest Labs for $3.2 billion.

1083
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,000
In a surprising move, Google is getting into the home appliance business.

1084
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,280
The internet company announced Monday that they're buying Nest Labs for more than $3

1085
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,280
billion.

1086
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,480
Nest is known for reinventing home products like high-tech thermostats and smoke detectors.

1087
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,320
This is Google's second largest acquisition to date, and it's all part of its expansion

1088
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,320
into your home.

1089
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
So let's talk about this.

1090
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,520
Let's obviously bring back in Chief Vince's correspondent, Christine Romans.

1091
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,520
Surprising?

1092
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:22,520
Do you think it's a surprising move?

1093
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:27,200
You know, I think this is Google wants to be a part of this home appliance interconnected

1094
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,200
world.

1095
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,820
Look, what Nest does, it's this really cool device that it knows.

1096
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:34,760
It starts to learn your behavior and changes the temperature of your home based on what

1097
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:35,760
you're doing.

1098
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,280
It also has these really cool smoke detectors that are not annoying.

1099
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,560
There's actually a woman's voice that says, there is smoke detected, and it's not like

1100
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:44,560
screaming at you.

1101
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,600
You can wave your hand, and it will go off.

1102
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,640
So it's very user-friendly stuff.

1103
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,640
It's interesting.

1104
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,320
The guy who runs the company, used to be at Apple, helped design the iPod.

1105
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,200
You know, changed the clunky Walkman into something that's cool and user-friendly.

1106
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,160
Now doing the same thing with home appliances, I think it's a total natural fit for Google

1107
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,520
to get into this.

1108
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,960
What's so cool about Nest is Nest getting to know about you.

1109
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,480
Nest discovers you.

1110
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,480
Sounds like.

1111
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,740
Google obviously does the same thing.

1112
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:11,980
Is that the synergy here?

1113
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,920
Is this just a way for Google to get more places and find out more stuff about you?

1114
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,440
I mean, Google will now know what the temperature is in your bedroom, John Berman, if they, if

1115
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,440
you have a Nest.

1116
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,440
Hot, hot, hot.

1117
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,440
Oh geez.

1118
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,880
Yeah, so Google has bought one of the biggest internet of things, let's put lots of air

1119
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:36,320
quotes around that, device manufacturers, Nest Labs, for $3.2 billion.

1120
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,320
That's right.

1121
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,120
The maker of the smart thermostat and smoke detectors, and they've paid for it in cash.

1122
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,120
Wow.

1123
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:48,200
Nest has raised around $800 million from investors, including Google Ventures as one of the people.

1124
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,700
Now it's not exactly clear how Google plans to use Nest, but the company obviously sees

1125
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,520
it as an important part of its future.

1126
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:59,160
A combination of Nest Home Solutions coupled with Google's language recognition could give

1127
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,080
Google its strongest path yet to the, into your home.

1128
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,360
And this is a quote here.

1129
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:08,240
Google will help fully realize our, Google will help us fully realize our vision of the

1130
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,860
conscious home and allow us to change the world faster than we could if we continue

1131
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,840
to go it alone, wrote the owner of Nest Labs.

1132
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,520
We've got great momentum and now we've got a rocket ship.

1133
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:22,520
So guys.

1134
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,520
I'm afraid.

1135
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,520
I'm sorry.

1136
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:25,520
Are you a little comfortable?

1137
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,280
Google's already, Google's already everywhere.

1138
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,440
We don't need them in our homes.

1139
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:36,400
Do you guys remember those, there was like a comic strip a while back with the Google

1140
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,680
toilet where Google was analyzing what you were eating and recommending restaurants for

1141
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,680
you.

1142
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,680
Oh, geez.

1143
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,680
I guess it's becoming real now.

1144
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:49,200
I think that we should get it out of here.

1145
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,200
Nice.

1146
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,080
I see you're indirectly asking for a, get it out of here, or a mess quote.

1147
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,120
I think we should rename the show Linux Unfiltered.

1148
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,200
Well, so let's be honest.

1149
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,960
Don't we all want to live with Jarvis?

1150
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,640
Don't we all want the Starship enterprise where when something bad happens, we can look

1151
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,520
around and we can just say, what happened?

1152
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,520
I want to know.

1153
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,840
I want to have Major Barrett at the ready and say, you know, tea, Earl Grey, hot.

1154
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,360
And maybe Google's the company to make all of this happen.

1155
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,840
Matt, what do you think?

1156
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:21,160
Honestly, I think that this is going to be about as compelling as, I don't know, an ultra

1157
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,400
Vista purchase or something like that.

1158
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,840
I don't really see this as being that big a deal.

1159
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,960
First of all, Nest doesn't work very well.

1160
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:28,960
I'm just going to put that out there.

1161
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:35,100
I know people that have tried it and used it and it's kind of like an Android powered

1162
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,100
crockpot.

1163
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,840
It's cool for a while, but it's not really going to be as cost savings as people think.

1164
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,040
Be careful making fun of Android powered crockpots.

1165
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,800
I saw one at the show.

1166
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,800
They exist.

1167
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,800
Put the food in it for me, though.

1168
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:46,800
Unfortunately, it does not.

1169
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,760
And my wife brought up a very good point.

1170
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,960
If you left your food raw, sitting in that crockpot for an extended period of time, and

1171
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,280
then you're turning it on, is it safe to eat?

1172
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,280
You know?

1173
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,280
Yeah.

1174
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,280
So there's little things like that.

1175
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,280
I don't know.

1176
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,280
I definitely am.

1177
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,280
Yeah.

1178
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,280
You know, I'm kind of lukewarm on it.

1179
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,520
I think it was a big drain.

1180
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:06,480
Where was Android when Google bought Android?

1181
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,200
Well, nowhere.

1182
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,360
The same place the guy that created DOS was before Microsoft bought it.

1183
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:19,000
Here's what I ask you, my friends, is are we concerned at all about, and let's abuse

1184
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,640
the term, quote unquote, Internet of Things, are we all concerned about the Internet of

1185
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,960
Things being these Linux based devices that we have no control over, we have no access

1186
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,360
to the source code, and now that we are putting them in our home, we're installing them into

1187
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,480
our home, we're putting them on our walls, we're integrating them in with our daily lives.

1188
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,520
As a homeowner, as a homeowner, don't you want to be able to build and extend your deck?

1189
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,840
Don't you want to be able to alter the way your furnace works?

1190
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:47,000
Aren't we becoming the operators of the devices instead of the controller of the devices in

1191
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,440
our very own home?

1192
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:54,280
Aren't we surrendering control of our homes to, even if it is just in the smallest degree,

1193
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:58,280
even if it's just in the most minute way, aren't we surrendering control of our homes

1194
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,320
to corporations?

1195
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,560
I think the omnis had it right.

1196
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,360
You know, technology has just taken over us.

1197
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,320
We don't need it really, the omnis.

1198
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:09,120
Well, let me ask you, Chase, and I'll ask you this.

1199
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:15,240
I honestly am pretty much a stupid hairless monkey, and I can barely keep my shit together,

1200
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:16,240
and I'm amazed.

1201
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,240
You have a luscious beard, though.

1202
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,080
And I got to tell you, it impresses me that I manage to show up and do a show every single

1203
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,080
day.

1204
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,080
I don't even know how that happened.

1205
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,080
Right.

1206
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,640
And I believe it is only because of technology that I can get this far.

1207
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,280
So maybe this stupid hairless monkey, who's only been out of the jungle for a few thousand

1208
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,760
years, maybe I need more technology to make me more of a superior being.

1209
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,480
Am I just being afraid to change?

1210
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,960
Am I just, this is new, this is different, I don't like it.

1211
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,400
See, I like Nest.

1212
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,000
I don't have one yet, and I want to get one, just because of the fact that there's some

1213
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,200
really cool innovations in the home automation world and the home technology front.

1214
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:54,880
And to have those abilities to help make your life easier, I mean, let's say, for example,

1215
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,680
you're cooking in the kitchen, okay?

1216
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:59,960
I know you like to do the paleo thing, you're making some really good ribs, you're making

1217
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,760
some good stuff, but let's say you accidentally burn something.

1218
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,200
Maybe the bacon catches on fire.

1219
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,200
Maybe it does.

1220
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,200
Grease fires happen, Chase.

1221
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,280
And they do, unfortunately.

1222
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,600
So let's say that your detector's going off, right?

1223
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,600
What do you do today?

1224
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:19,240
You open up all the windows, you clear it out, you wave a towel, wouldn't it be easier

1225
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:24,120
just to pop up your phones, oh, false alarm, done, and it's off.

1226
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:29,800
It's those innovations that help make your life easier, and I don't see Google, this

1227
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,520
is where I kind of get weird by it.

1228
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,040
It's like, what is Google going to be doing with this?

1229
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,760
A lot of people forget, in the past, Google had, they worked with some power companies,

1230
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,800
I don't know if it's called Google Power, but you had the ability to track your power

1231
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:44,800
usage.

1232
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
Right.

1233
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,000
And by the way, during this time, during this study, which I believe this has actually now

1234
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,760
been discontinued by Google, Google figured out, and this is not a joke, you can look

1235
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,240
this up, they figured out what shows you were watching based on the power draw of your plasma

1236
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:05,000
TV, because when your plasma TV is brighter, it draws more power, and they would watch

1237
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,760
which shows had more white in them, they could figure out an algorithm, and then watching

1238
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,840
your power draw, they could figure out what shows you were watching at what time.

1239
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,680
Yeah, no, I like this technology, actually, I got some Kicksters that I still have yet

1240
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,680
to get here.

1241
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:22,240
One's a plug that works off of Wi-Fi, you plug it in the outlet, and it tells you the

1242
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,800
draw from that outlet.

1243
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,800
Yeah, I like that a lot.

1244
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,800
Kilowatts are great.

1245
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,600
I like one that runs off of the meter itself, so you know the measurement of the house coming,

1246
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,600
the power coming in your house.

1247
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,600
Really?

1248
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:32,600
Creepy, man.

1249
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,560
But I like having that information, because it makes me a smarter person.

1250
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:38,960
That's why I'm wearing a Fitbit right now, I like to track my sleep.

1251
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,400
So why wouldn't you want that on a house level?

1252
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:44,800
Why wouldn't you want that kind of customizable information on a house level?

1253
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,720
I do, but I don't want it reporting back to some central cloud computing company.

1254
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:50,720
Exactly.

1255
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:58,440
So as someone who plays with thermostats quite a bit, I can tell you that most of what Nest

1256
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:08,400
is doing, you can achieve by using Arduino with a Bluetooth shield, and it's not that

1257
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,060
hard to do.

1258
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:17,920
What they provide is just a nice box and a solution that you can just plug in and it

1259
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:18,920
works.

1260
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:24,200
With a little bit of effort, you can have the same thing running that's open source,

1261
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:29,400
open hardware, and you have full control over what information it's collecting and where

1262
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,600
that information is going.

1263
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:32,280
True, but you have to set all that up yourself.

1264
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:36,880
Matt looks familiar, he's bringing it up in the chat room, but in a post-Edward Snowden

1265
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:40,560
world, where we know that the NSA is working with all of these companies, Google being

1266
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:46,280
one of them, should we be worried about some sort of privacy invasion here from government

1267
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,280
overreach?

1268
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,280
I think so.

1269
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:53,040
I think it's cool for the very, very minute part of the population that really cares.

1270
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,960
I think that it's very cool, but for Google to spend this much money on it, I think they're

1271
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,120
kidding themselves.

1272
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:03,120
As someone that works in this industry, I'm telling you, they don't have any idea how

1273
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,280
hard it is to get people to adopt stuff like this.

1274
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,920
They have no concept.

1275
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:13,160
They went into this blind, they overpaid, and they have a really great way of doing

1276
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:14,160
it.

1277
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,960
Don't get me wrong, as far as interface and equipment and all that, it's really glossy,

1278
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,960
really sexy stuff.

1279
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,160
There's no question there, and it is cool to be able to turn your smoke detector off.

1280
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:25,680
But as far as there's other variables regarding to, especially with thermostats and stuff

1281
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,360
like that, energy prices, weather outside, there's a lot of things going on that people

1282
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:32,520
don't realize that Nest does not address.

1283
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:36,480
The gentleman that brought up the whole point on managing your own thermostat, that's what

1284
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,160
Nest does.

1285
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,120
That's literally their big claim to fame.

1286
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,120
It's really weak.

1287
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:48,120
$3.2 billion is not that much for Google, and I think a lot of it was patented, too.

1288
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,120
They probably did it for patents.

1289
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,100
I think they did it as a preventive measure.

1290
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,040
They know right now it has no value.

1291
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,440
They know that in the future it has a huge value.

1292
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,300
So look at just the straight tie-in with Google Now.

1293
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:05,040
So Google Now knows where you're at, when you're at that place, and maybe you're on

1294
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:11,840
your way home, Google Now would say, has detected, by the way, you've set home on your map destinations,

1295
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,360
so we will automatically turn on the heater in your house so your house is comfortable.

1296
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:20,240
Of course, the only thing I can think about these days is the new studio for Jupiter Broadcasting.

1297
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,660
I think about the fact that wouldn't it be cool if some thermostat learned when I showed

1298
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:29,960
up to do shows and made sure that I was comfortable when I got there and then saved money when

1299
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,080
I left.

1300
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:34,480
I look at this and I think, I don't like all the privacy implications, but I sure like

1301
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,600
not having to worry about one more thing.

1302
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,600
One more thing that I don't have to think about is worth a lot to me.

1303
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,600
Right, exactly.

1304
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:46,840
Well, once again, you could do that, like something as simple as this can actually be

1305
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:54,560
done with any programmable thermostat that you can buy in any hardware store.

1306
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,860
That's fine for you and I, but you're not going to convince grandma and grandpa who

1307
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,160
are shopping at Walmart to buy this.

1308
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:07,880
But what will happen in five years, in ten years, if you look at Android, at the beginning

1309
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,880
it was nothing.

1310
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:15,120
Look at it now, in the meantime it was all open source great, now it's closing to Google

1311
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,120
now.

1312
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,120
What will happen with this?

1313
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,120
Right.

1314
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,120
This is the big concern.

1315
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:22,840
And not only now, it's one thing when we're talking about our laptops and our desktop

1316
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,240
and we're talking about closed and proprietary software that we can't do anything about,

1317
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,280
but it completely is different when it's a piece of hardware that controls my home.

1318
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,000
If there's ever been a case for the GPL, it's right there in my opinion.

1319
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,560
And it's hardwired in your home.

1320
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,560
That's the other thing.

1321
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:42,120
The other thing that I want to point out and you mentioned the whole post Snowden thing.

1322
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:48,880
I think it's just a matter of time now before products start appearing on the market as

1323
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,680
competition to Google, as more people become aware of their personal information being

1324
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:59,520
reported back and used for marketing and sometimes being reported to governments.

1325
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:07,080
There's going to be a competitive market where they use words like respecting your privacy

1326
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:11,440
as something that people will want to buy.

1327
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,880
It's a feature that can become competitive.

1328
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,960
The same way people buy stuff because it's green now or organic.

1329
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,600
Yeah, I can see that for sure.

1330
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,600
Yeah, exactly.

1331
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,100
Boy, that's a great sort of like things are labeled organic, you could have things that

1332
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,200
are labeled secure in that same sort of marketing sense.

1333
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,200
Exactly.

1334
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:34,440
And then of course there's certified organic and then there's organic.

1335
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:39,080
Certified to be, and Mozilla has been making this case right this very week, Mozilla has

1336
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,440
been calling on the internet community to say, look, there's only one browser that is

1337
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:46,560
truly open source top to bottom that is used by the majority of users on the web and that's

1338
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,560
Firefox.

1339
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,360
Chrome's great, but if you want top to bottom transparency, you've got to come to Mozilla.

1340
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,920
Now obviously there's other browsers out there that are open source, but in terms of usage,

1341
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,920
Firefox aka Mozilla makes a very good point here.

1342
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,800
And this could be a point, and you already see people that are using this as a feature,

1343
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,800
right?

1344
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,360
John McAfee, he's all over the web right now talking about how he's building an NSA proof

1345
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,360
appliance.

1346
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:10,560
In our subreddit right now, there's a thread about the NSA proof Twitter.

1347
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:13,120
This is becoming a marketing buzz.

1348
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,720
So yeah, I think maybe we've got it nailed here.

1349
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:20,640
Some people buy devices that are tied in with this overall monitoring network and there'll

1350
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:25,320
be users like us who are willing to maybe go a little bit extra through the trouble,

1351
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,400
a little bit extra.

1352
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,720
We have to get a specific image, maybe we have to buy a Raspberry Pi, but we can roll

1353
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,720
our own solution.

1354
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:35,400
What a great way to kickstart the economy, create a problem, offer a solution.

1355
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:41,320
And I think this is going to become a push not only for open source software, but also

1356
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:49,040
for open source hardware because then the manufacturer or the company can say, hey,

1357
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:55,480
people can actually review what goes into our products and tell you, yes, this actually

1358
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,080
respects your privacy.

1359
00:58:57,080 --> 00:59:01,680
This doesn't report anything you wouldn't want to anyone else.

1360
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:08,040
The only problem with all that is obviously the end company or the maker of that wants

1361
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,040
to make money, right?

1362
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,680
Of course, that's what drives a lot of people.

1363
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,360
And when you completely make it fully open like that, how do you protect IP?

1364
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:20,880
How do you protect your intellectual property on that kind of a system if you have it completely

1365
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,880
wide open?

1366
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:22,880
Right.

1367
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,840
You can do that in some cases for like a server load where you got Red Hat and they can sell

1368
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,240
commercial support.

1369
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,840
But how do you make it work?

1370
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,760
And let's go into the future here.

1371
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:34,340
How do you make it work in a world?

1372
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:38,600
How do you make it work when anybody can download a spec off the Internet and print their own

1373
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,600
device?

1374
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:40,960
And then they load the software themselves.

1375
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,340
How do you stay competitive?

1376
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,880
Because that is a reality we are facing.

1377
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:44,880
It's very big.

1378
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,760
Well, I can tell you right now, and you've admitted to this yourself a few minutes before,

1379
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:55,840
sometimes just because it takes a little bit more effort, it's already too much for some

1380
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:58,080
people to be interested.

1381
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:08,160
If it takes you building your own Arduino with a shield to make a secure nest like thermostat,

1382
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,800
it's already too much work.

1383
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:16,440
So you prefer to pay someone else to do that work for you.

1384
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:29,960
And it's the same if someone else creates a fork of some open source project, then it

1385
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,640
doesn't necessarily mean that it will be done as well.

1386
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:39,360
Like Arduino being a great example here, there are many copies of Arduino.

1387
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:47,440
Many of them are good, but no one actually provides as good of a quality product as the

1388
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,080
original makers of Arduino.

1389
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,080
Right.

1390
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,080
Yeah, that's a great point.

1391
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:56,800
I'm just waiting for the day that Jarvis becomes reality.

1392
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:57,800
That would be awesome.

1393
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:59,840
Google is definitely working on it.

1394
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:03,840
And you know, speaking of Jarvis becoming reality, one of the things that sometimes

1395
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:07,120
feels a bit like the future is when your computer talks to you.

1396
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,760
And there's a really important kick, or actually it's an Indiegogo campaign that just kicked

1397
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:16,800
off this week, bringing digital site to the vision impaired by the Accessible Foundation.

1398
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,400
This is an Indiegogo project.

1399
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,640
They got 31 days left.

1400
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:21,320
They're trying to reach $100,000.

1401
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,320
They got $4,400.

1402
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,720
Now, I'm a big believer in these types of campaigns being a great way to fund open source

1403
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,400
development and what these guys really want to do is they want to get Orca screen reader

1404
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,400
to the next level.

1405
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,200
They want to bring it to the next level to make it accessible for the blind.

1406
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,480
And if you've got any kind of extra funds and a soft spot for this kind of thing, I'm

1407
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,480
going to link to it in the show notes.

1408
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,320
I just wanted to give it a plug now.

1409
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,840
You can go over to Indiegogo.com and also search for bringing digital site and I think

1410
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,480
that'll bring you to the project as well.

1411
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,840
They're only at $4,400, 31 days left to go.

1412
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:56,200
Orca screen reader is a great project and it just needs some more love.

1413
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,200
Well they're trying to get to 100k.

1414
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,720
I submitted it to the subreddit earlier.

1415
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,200
It looks like it's actually doing pretty well.

1416
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,760
It is, yeah.

1417
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,680
The big issue here is a lot of people think, yeah, but that doesn't really affect me.

1418
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,140
It's kind of like, well, here's the deal.

1419
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:09,560
So proprietary desktops have this solved for years now.

1420
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,880
It's really not an issue.

1421
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:12,860
It's a non-starter for them.

1422
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:18,080
For Linux, it's something we've tripped over for years and we've seen all these quasi half

1423
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:22,460
done kind of sort of started projects that then falter and fall apart and never really

1424
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:23,460
become a thing.

1425
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:27,840
Orca's the only thing that's really ever stuck around and stayed, but it has kind of hit

1426
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,680
a glass ceiling and it does need some serious fundage.

1427
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:31,680
Yeah.

1428
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:34,080
So I'll put a link down in the show notes if this is something you guys have some interest

1429
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,080
in.

1430
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:40,400
I'd love to see these guys get somewhere because, you know, it really is and it's about making

1431
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:45,240
Linux accessible to a whole new class of folks who really deserve it.

1432
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,240
And then we got an email.

1433
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,160
I want to just wrap it up with an email from George where he says, hey guys, congrats on

1434
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,160
the show.

1435
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,560
It's become the highlight of my week online.

1436
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,380
I wanted to say something about your reviews.

1437
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,380
Don't get me wrong.

1438
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:59,300
I completely understand the big development team slash company like, you know, SUSE, Canonical

1439
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:03,000
versus the smaller development teams like your Mints and your Manjeros.

1440
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,280
It's a situation that these smaller distros might not, they might not exist one day or

1441
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,280
in the near future.

1442
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,480
But I believe that there is innovation in usability ideas and custom solutions comes

1443
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,000
from these smaller teams.

1444
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,480
And the only thing that they have in mind is the target of how to offer the user something

1445
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:21,440
completely new and different from the established.

1446
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,040
There are distros out there that offer exactly that.

1447
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:25,040
And you know what?

1448
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:29,840
It doesn't matter that they disappear from one day because plenty will replace them and

1449
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,560
innovation never ends.

1450
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:35,240
Having said that, it would be nice to do a review of some of the smaller distros that

1451
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,640
are simply wonderful to use.

1452
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:42,400
How about Sabian 1401 for rolling or Netrunner 1312 which beats Kubuntu by a long way.

1453
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,680
Just give me food for thought, keep up the good work.

1454
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:52,280
So Matt, I have created in the show notes, just like a boss, I embedded them right in

1455
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:56,760
the show notes a survey that folks, actually not even a survey, it's a quick form that

1456
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,960
folks can fill out and answer which distro they think is the innovative little guy.

1457
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:07,160
Is there a small distro that just at some point has impressed the heck out of you?

1458
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:10,120
If you've been impressed by a little distro and you want to see it get a review on the

1459
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:13,360
Linux Action Show, there is an embedded form in the show notes.

1460
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:17,640
I'll also paste it in the IRC chat room for those of you watching live right now.

1461
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,640
You can go out there and fill it out.

1462
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,640
It's three simple questions.

1463
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:24,320
The name of the distro, the website URL, and what you thought was great about it.

1464
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:25,520
You submit those to us.

1465
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,880
I'll collect all of them and then we'll do, whichever one kind of comes ahead, we'll do

1466
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,600
a review on the Linux Action Show in the future.

1467
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:32,600
What do you think of that, Matt?

1468
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,600
I like that.

1469
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:34,600
It's a good idea.

1470
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,600
Yeah.

1471
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,320
I mean, personally, I'm kind of throwing my hat into Hannah Montana Linux, but that's

1472
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,320
just me.

1473
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:40,200
I mean, it's a struggling distro.

1474
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,480
What about Rebecca Black Linux?

1475
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,160
Well, you know, I like the pink of the Hannah Montana.

1476
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:46,480
You know, it really, really pinks up the whole situation.

1477
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:47,480
That's true.

1478
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:48,480
I do like the pink.

1479
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,480
That's a good point, Matt.

1480
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:50,800
So go fill out that form.

1481
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:55,360
We'll have it embedded in the show notes and in a future episode of Linux Action

1482
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:58,680
Show, we'll give that distro a review right there.

1483
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:02,520
And you know, I'd really like to find something that does something new and unique, something

1484
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,640
really kind of innovative that we haven't seen before.

1485
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,280
And see, that's the real challenge I have with a lot of the distro reviews is that people

1486
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:12,560
will say it does, but they never really identify what it is.

1487
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,920
So I mean, like with Arch, it's readily identifiable.

1488
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,920
They did package management in a unique way.

1489
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,400
They did a basic installation in a unique way.

1490
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,400
Everything was done in a very, very good way.

1491
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,400
They did everything right.

1492
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,400
Arch is the master distro.

1493
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,400
I agree.

1494
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,400
It really is.

1495
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,960
And then finding other ones that are basically, it's kind of like, oh, it's kind of like this

1496
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:27,960
other one.

1497
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:28,960
I don't know.

1498
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:29,960
We'll see.

1499
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:30,960
We'll see what they come up with.

1500
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:31,960
Well, I agree.

1501
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:32,960
And I think it could be a fun segment.

1502
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,400
We're going to call it the innovative little guy and we'll give it a review.

1503
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,640
Maybe we could make a whole series out of it.

1504
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,640
You never know.

1505
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:37,640
Never know.

1506
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:38,640
Never know.

1507
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,640
Well, I want to thank you, Mr. Chase, for joining us.

1508
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:40,640
Oh, it's been a pleasure.

1509
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:41,640
You're going to have a ton of CES coverage.

1510
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,880
Where can people find that?

1511
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:43,880
All week.

1512
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:44,880
GeekGamer.tv.

1513
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,600
It'll be out over the next week to two weeks.

1514
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,640
Should be a lot of great stuff on there.

1515
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:54,960
And probably you'll give notices on Twitter, where can people follow you on Twitter?

1516
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:55,960
At Nunes.

1517
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:56,960
N-U-N-E-S is the best place to follow me on the Twitters.

1518
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:57,960
Very good.

1519
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:58,960
All right, Matt.

1520
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,240
Well, if everything goes as planned, on Sunday, we're going to have an interview with an amazingly

1521
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:06,520
talented photographer who does his entire workflow under Linux, including HDR photography.

1522
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,520
I'm going to watch that.

1523
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,080
And we're going to pick his brain and get his workflow.

1524
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,080
Awesome.

1525
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,080
Cool.

1526
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,080
That's really cool.

1527
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:13,080
I can't wait for that.

1528
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,080
That's going to be a great show.

1529
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,080
All right, Matt.

1530
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:16,080
Well, I'll see you on Sunday, okay?

1531
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:17,080
See you Sunday.

1532
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,080
All right, everyone.

1533
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:21,240
If you love Linux Unplugged, we'll see you right back here next Tuesday.
