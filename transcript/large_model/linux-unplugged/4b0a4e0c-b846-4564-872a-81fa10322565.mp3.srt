1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
Shop dot gnome dot org. I know should I say gnome or gnome?

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,840
I you know, I was wondering that when you're referring to a web URL. Do you say?

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,580
Do you which one do you say?

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,240
Gnome or gun? Oh, I would say gnu but it's just me who cares. They have a merch store and that's all that matters

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,160
Hello friends and welcome into your weekly Linux talk show. My name is Chris. My name is Wes. Hi, Wes. Wow

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,760
Did you put those fancy boots on for me? Of course I did

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,600
I wanted to welcome you back from your grand adventure. Thank you

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:37,080
It is really great to be back and we have a great show so much to catch up on some more

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,720
Fun stuff coming up in the next episode. So stay tuned for more fun stuff coming up in the next episode

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:48,200
Adventure. Thank you. It is really great to be back and we have a great show so much to catch up on some

11
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,000
Solid feedback and some great picks this week. It's a real classic and before we get any further

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,080
I want to say hello to drew and cheese. Hello, gentlemen. Thanks for being here. Well, hello there. Hello

13
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,520
Hey, you both are also quite dressed up cheese. I don't think I've ever seen you in a suit before and the bowtie

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:10,280
I know dude, it's weird. Yeah, I actually think the bowtie is working. I think it's working drew in a tie though

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,720
That's gonna take some getting used to but you're supposed to put it around your neck

16
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,040
Not your forehead drew also before we go

17
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:23,320
I have to say a huge hello a hearty time appropriate greetings to our mumble room. Hello virtual lug. Hello

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,360
Tuesday happy Linux Tuesday to y'all and

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,880
It's true. I'm I'm back

20
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:37,360
Back in the Pacific Northwest. It's really nice to be back in the studio. It was about 5,000 miles

21
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,560
almost 50 days of traveling

22
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:47,960
Tricky keeping everyone healthy and safe during all of that while also visiting family and working and of course

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,080
Trying to also make it a memorable experience for the kids and do the shows

24
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:56,320
this is a lot, but it was maybe one of the

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,120
greatest road trips of our family's lifetime, so I really enjoyed it and

26
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,880
awesomely while I was out and about

27
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,560
Angela managed to get the roof replaced on the studio

28
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,680
So we got some really really important work done for the studio that we've been needing to do for a long time

29
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
Taken care of while I was out for so long

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,760
So that's pretty great big old thanks to and for pulling that off because I never would have got it done

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,560
No, or you would have scheduled it for the same day. We were doing a Linux unplugged

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,560
So there would have been roofing noises in the recording

33
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,080
Yeah, that was really the strategy of it

34
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,560
But now that I'm back, I don't know. I guess I was I was so stupid

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,700
I thought I would I don't know

36
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,300
I would spend 50 days on the road and I would be in such different conditions that when I got back I wouldn't have

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,080
RSI, but within a couple of hours of sitting back at my desk. I

38
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,240
was having

39
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Significant bad RSI again. I mean seriously from my fingertips into my wrists into my elbows all the way up to my shoulders. There's

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:07,040
intense pain and I I have trouble now holding stuff

41
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,960
so I need some RSI tips from the audience because I was trying to pretend like this was gonna go away if I just

42
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
changed things up for a bit and

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,800
it's like even now I haven't really done I've tried not to be at my desk a ton this morning and

44
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,720
My hands are stiff and sore

45
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,120
Exercises anything people could give because you know

46
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,800
This is starting to freak me out because I'm worried

47
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,760
I'm not gonna be able to use the computer for more than an hour at a time without hurting myself

48
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,520
so I mean I've had issues and I know that

49
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Previously, I was really bad about putting my elbow on my desk and then like resting my chin on my elbow

50
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,440
Yeah, I do that on my armchair. That's really bad

51
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,320
but you know one one suggestion I would say is get yourself a motorized desk where you can stand and then

52
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,680
Alternate between sitting and standing. I do that about every hour hour and a half

53
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,640
You know sit down for an hour and a half stand up for an hour and a half and that seems to help out a lot

54
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,240
you cannot buy any personal fitness stuff on Amazon really right now because of the pandemic, but

55
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
you can pick up a

56
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,280
It's like an elastic band set that you just throw over the door

57
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,640
And then that way you can do like a couple of you know, like different kind of strokes

58
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,480
Using these bands and it'll help out a lot, too

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,800
It'll strengthen all the muscles that are kind of in the front of your chest and down your arms and your biceps and help out

60
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,040
a little bit so that's helped me out a lot, but you know ultimately I did have to have a surgery

61
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,480
Related to my neck and I don't know if it's connected to that

62
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,800
We're not years of being at a computer desk

63
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,120
But it certainly could be Neil some of us Linux users are just aging a bit

64
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,760
Think it's gonna be something that happens to a lot of us. Is this something you've struggled with?

65
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,840
I've dealt with this quite a lot. It got much worse once I started working from home

66
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,880
because my setup at home is not optimized for

67
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,320
Continuously doing the same kinds of things I do at work

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,240
It's actually more optimized for me to just sit and play games, right? Yeah chill

69
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,040
My desk is actually a little too tall. So typing is like quite painful

70
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,960
so a couple of things that I wound up doing the first was I

71
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,600
I did some awful work to slightly lower my desk a little bit so that the height wasn't

72
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,560
exactly at eye level for me for the because my my I have no stands or

73
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,800
Auxiliary whatever's but like getting my keyboard to be lower so that I don't always have to like prop up

74
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,840
My arms to type helped

75
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,720
Also getting a very soft wrist rest across the whole keyboard

76
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,800
So that whenever I'm typing it can rest and not feel like I'm digging into my wrists

77
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,560
Having an ergonomic keyboard making sure you have a good wrist rest

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,680
Actually making that making it so that you don't have to prop up your arms to like type on your keyboard

79
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,680
It also makes it so that you have less

80
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,760
You're less likely to like dig into and put pressure across everything at least in my experience that has made it better again

81
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:09,600
Not medical professional, please go seek a doctor but so that's helped for me

82
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,000
It's kind of fascinating. It just makes me think about when I was a youngster taking piano lessons

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,320
And you know you got to learn the proper form and despite many of us being professionals or just hobbyists

84
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,560
Either way spending all of our time sitting at the computer

85
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,360
We don't think that we need to invest in that and you know get the forms, right?

86
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,200
If we're gonna be doing it all the time. I wish I had taken it seriously sooner

87
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,480
because it's gotten to the point where I

88
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,160
Was out doing some yard work in the junkyard just because while I was gone it turned into a jungle

89
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,800
And even 15 minutes of holding the whacker thingy

90
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,800
My elbow was was done for the night

91
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,280
It was really it just stinks like so I got to get ahead of it or or at least I I mean

92
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Maybe I'm not ahead of anymore, but I got to do something about it

93
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,280
anyways, I

94
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,320
just wanted to put it out there because I think a lot of us who are into Linux are very intense about the amount of

95
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,800
time we spend at the keyboard and I

96
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,440
do want to try to get the word out there because I

97
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,440
I think one of these it's one of these things if you don't take care of it before it starts once it starts you're at a

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,280
Basically a stage of mitigating and managing it from that point forward instead of preventing or curing it. Maybe I'm wrong

99
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,320
That seems to be what I'm discovering moving on though because we have some really good news

100
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,380
And that's jellyfin has a brand new release that looks pretty great in general

101
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:35,200
But one thing that Wes and I both noticed is it introduces a new feature called sync play

102
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:41,360
sync play allows you to create a room that other users can join in order to share

103
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,800
Essentially a common viewing experience and there seems to be no limit on the number of users in a room

104
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,680
You're all free to join its jellyfin

105
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,640
so there wasn't there's a login but you can share that same user account or you could be the same user on multiple devices and

106
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,800
We had a chance to try it out this morning. Yeah, we did

107
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,360
I mean, this is something that both you and I have been looking for it. Now. There's various solutions for there's a there's a plugin system

108
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,120
For VLC there's stuff for Netflix. There's stuff for YouTube, but none of them really kind of hit the sweet spot

109
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,560
I think jellyfin sync play is getting close because you and I were able to watch

110
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,320
Co watch an episode of Picard this morning. I guess I should maybe step back if you're not familiar with jellyfin

111
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
It's a media management

112
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,400
System for your videos it indexes them it goes out and gets the metadata a lot like Plex one thing

113
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,640
I like is it's you know, it's it's just a little more lightweight Plex is amazing

114
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,380
Don't get me wrong, but you know, it's it's tied into the company. It's tied into the web servers

115
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:42,280
Jellyfin was forked off MB and you know, you just start up the doctor container get it going

116
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,760
You can make a guest account. You can make local user account

117
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,320
so it's really easy to share with people even if they're not totally bought into the whole

118
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,480
Ecosystem and now the supports getting way better. It works with the Chromecast

119
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,720
I don't think it has integration with many of the clients yet

120
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,440
But hopefully that will that will come down the road and really a huge

121
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,960
Thank you both from from me from Chris and I think from the jellyfin community to first-time contributor

122
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,240
Andre Hanka, who's a computer science student over at a university in Italy

123
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:19,200
He submitted pull requests for both the server changes and the web client changes that laid the foundations for all of this

124
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,540
And I think it's a really cool open source success story because they've actually been like a feature request for something like this feature

125
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,320
Since all the way back till like 2018 and it just took someone stepping up

126
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,980
Doing the work putting it in and then the project was you know

127
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,700
Happy to include it and actually shipped it out where we can all go test it and abuse it

128
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,180
Yeah

129
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,820
And the timing is pretty good right because this is a time when people maybe would get together and watch something that are now

130
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,820
Spending time apart, but there's still

131
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:53,260
options like this to do some kind of remote viewing party and

132
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,500
The great thing is is there wasn't something that was free software and readily available and didn't require cloud services

133
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,660
Until this came along so I'm really glad the jellyfin project proceeded

134
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:10,580
With implementing this because I know there was some people in the community thought oh, maybe this isn't something we should really do

135
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,980
We don't think we can get it right, but I'm here to tell you it works pretty well

136
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,980
Wes and I were pretty quick to get it set up and going we both had control over the player

137
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,820
We could skip ahead and skip back play pause and it worked really well

138
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,540
It seems like one of the little tricks they do is when you skip ahead

139
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:32,660
They pause the playback for everyone which probably gives the players time to sync up and then when you hit play by then

140
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,940
They've already kind of figured out their positioning and it picks right back up

141
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:42,380
When you consider how far apart folks might be the various latencies introduced between locations and how close you are to the actual server

142
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,660
It's pretty impressive

143
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,500
There were a few little details that you kind of have to get used to and I did find in my own testing that you know

144
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,820
If someone's watching something you join in the sink will be a little a little rougher

145
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,980
But once you've paused and then resumed playback, it was really tight

146
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:04,860
Yeah, and we immediately just started chatting in a separate text chat about the show. We were watching there's no chat aspect to it

147
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,100
So you provide that separately and I like that?

148
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:13,220
I don't want them to try to integrate some sort of web RTC voice chat into this thing

149
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Just focus on the video playback and we'll use the existing communications channel

150
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
We already had to set the whole thing up in the first place

151
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:26,340
There's also just traditional improvements. They're working on a more modern web client

152
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:32,580
It's it's had a lot of technical debt. It's really kind of just coming from a fork of MB and then implementing it themselves

153
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,660
There's just old technologies in there at this point

154
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,980
so some of those until recently prevented them from being able to use modern JavaScript tooling which

155
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,740
They have taken a whacking to thanks to a contributor who worked on improving the way they build the web client

156
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,700
They can now get to some of this also Wes

157
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,700
It looks like some of this

158
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,420
greatly simplifies the support for some of their legacy clients and the reason why that's sort of notable is that means they could

159
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,660
Extend support back to web OS and Tizen versions of the client

160
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:08,420
And I just love that because if you've got devices like that laying around and they have the means to make it work

161
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,940
I think it's pretty great to see them put the effort into it

162
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,620
Yeah, you know once you've got some of this additional tooling available

163
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:20,820
That means you can target older versions of JavaScript, you know other ancient clients that they still have the hardware to do it

164
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,860
They just don't support the latest standards

165
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,020
But with a tooling cleanup now that can be a lot better and actually, you know

166
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:31,900
This is a pretty big change. Once it's complete. It should make the web client a lot simpler

167
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,340
I already think the web clients I mean pretty decent although you can tell there's some rough edges

168
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,400
Sounds like eventually jellyfin wants to migrate over to view one of the hot new JavaScript frameworks and really just you know

169
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:48,340
Do a good summer cleaning of all this code that they've inherited lots of good stuff

170
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,780
Lots of old stuff

171
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,500
But if you want it to be shiny and fast and new

172
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,900
You got to make sure you tackle that technical debt and it's really nice to see the project trying to take that on

173
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,740
It still feels like there's more to be done in that area

174
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,380
significant work to be done in that area, but

175
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,020
They're really making it attractive and if you've thought about Plex

176
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,880
But you're not comfortable with it for whatever reason take a look at jellyfin. We'll have a link in the show notes

177
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,880
Well, let's change gears and talk about Proxmox. Proxmox is an enterprise class

178
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,260
Virtualization system based on Linux. I used to use it in the studio

179
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,300
Now we run on arch and just put it all in containers

180
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:32,340
But I really like Proxmox and it's developed nicely over the years and this last week

181
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,500
They announced the Proxmox backup server. This will be an enterprise grade

182
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,740
Backup server for your virtual machines containers and the physical hosts

183
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:48,740
It is specifically optimized for the Proxmox virtual environment platform and allows you to back up and replicate

184
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:55,580
the data from that platform securely and it has easy management and command-line tools got a web user interface as well and

185
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,260
It's licensed under the GNU a GPL version 3. Hey, those are all good things

186
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:08,860
Other good things about the Proxmox backup setup and especially on the server side is that it supports incremental backups

187
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,860
deduplication compression and authenticated encryption

188
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,160
Plus Chris you'll love uses rust as the implementation language

189
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,440
So that there's good performance and low resource usage and maybe a high quality code base time will tell on that one

190
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,980
It also has strong encryption on the client side. Hey, that's where you want it

191
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:33,200
So you can back up to something you might not fully trust what I love about rust is

192
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:39,260
It's used to sell a tool as production grade just because you name drop rust. Have you noticed that? Yeah

193
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,220
I don't know that that's really fair because any new code base is likely to have bugs

194
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,340
Even if you have an amazing compiler like you do with rust

195
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,780
Yeah

196
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:52,300
But then again if you were to come to me and say hey Chris if you want us to build some really nice high-performance

197
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:59,220
Low-level enterprise grade tools. What language do we write it in? I'd probably say rust and here I thought you like to see plus-plus

198
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,180
All right, well that concludes the rust watch for this episode, you know, I'm not a huge Proxmox user

199
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,180
But I do know a lot of folks who found it useful

200
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,620
You know, maybe you don't like the license

201
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,060
Maybe you just don't like the tooling but it gives access to a lot of the you know

202
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:20,020
Ecosystem that we talked about here on Linux unplugged and I just like seeing in general

203
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,820
Making backups easier for folks, right?

204
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,540
If you're gonna have to go do it yourself or learn a whole bunch while that might be valuable

205
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:32,500
It might also mean delaying taking those backups. So if you can just integrate with you know with these new features, that's great

206
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,100
Yeah, I wish we had a reason to use it here

207
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,140
Like if that arch box would screw up a whole bunch

208
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:42,900
I'd say we should Proxmox it up if I wasn't all piled up in the RV and with x86

209
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,100
I'd probably use Proxmox underneath whatever I ran

210
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,300
But I just haven't had that use case for it yet

211
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,380
And the reason why it kind of bothers me is I want to talk about it more on the show

212
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,140
Because it's really good and we just don't talk about it enough, but I just haven't quite

213
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:06,260
Found that use yet before we kind of changed everything up and went on a free NAS tear for a while and all that

214
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,820
We used to use Proxmox to do a lot of what we now do in

215
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,340
containers

216
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:17,540
But that just made sense to use containers for the types applications we're doing if you have a good use case out there

217
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,540
Let us know linuxonplug.com

218
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,620
slash contact

219
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,340
Alright now for the Microsoft watch

220
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,580
Those crazy cats at Microsoft have released Procmon. No, no, no not that old sis internals one

221
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,260
Procmon for Linux. It's a process monitor tool and it's in preview now

222
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:42,260
They write process monitor is a Linux reimagining of a classic Procmon tool from sysinternals suite of tools

223
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:49,620
That were for Windows Procmon provides a convenient and efficient way for Linux developers to trace the syscall activity on the system

224
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:53,620
And I have to say I was shocked to find

225
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:00,140
It is not in the AUR at least when I checked yesterday. Wait, what how is that possible?

226
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:07,220
I I don't know. I don't know not enough ARCH users over at Microsoft. I guess I mean they do have a PPA

227
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,740
Yes, they do. They do. So what do we think about this story?

228
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:17,260
Is it still a big deal when Microsoft is releasing some of these classic tools as open source on Linux?

229
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,900
It feels to me like kind of routine at this point. I think that means things have really shifted

230
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:29,140
You know, this would have been huge massive news what two years ago, but just feels like it's been a long time

231
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:35,420
But just feels like a regular week with some new stuff from Microsoft. So that's kind of how I feel about it

232
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,620
Neil what about you?

233
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:43,500
What about seeing some of these classic Windows tools that were honestly some of the gems of Windows coming from Microsoft to Linux?

234
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,100
I started on as a Windows developer and I did do

235
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,940
Windows systems administration as well

236
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,380
So like these tools were things that I relied on when I did a lot more Windows stuff when I was younger

237
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:02,500
It's nice for me to see that these are coming to Linux. I personally relied a lot on Procmon when I did Windows stuff

238
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,260
so when I when I saw it was released, I tried to grab it and build it and

239
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:12,980
Package it up for Fedora, but alas it actually doesn't build. There's a couple of things wrong with it

240
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,180
They have bundled copies of libraries that don't compile and it tries to fetch stuff from the Internet

241
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,940
Which is a no-go for shipping it in any Linux distribution, right?

242
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,580
I know that a lot of people think this is kind of the good way to do things now

243
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,580
But like it feels real bad

244
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:35,020
especially from a company like Microsoft who should at this point know the value of reproducibility and stuff like that

245
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:43,260
And this also kind of showed a little bit of like they don't really get how to make open source software that people can

246
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,580
easily consume because they

247
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:50,500
They made it so that it's it's just like a bunch of silly putty thrown over the wall

248
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,060
Yeah, I think it's pretty early days. You know, if you look at the commit

249
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:59,860
It does seem like it's something developed maybe internally not introduced into any sort of build system and just yeah now

250
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,220
It's out there and Neil is that criticism fair?

251
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,820
Holy like if you balance expectations with how large corporations work

252
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:13,380
Maybe this is the best that's going to get for jumping code over the wall because think about it from this standpoint

253
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,580
this is probably after a long series of discussions about

254
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:25,340
This strategy this tool how this developer will spend their time and there's even like legal analysis, right?

255
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,940
Like a complete version of the project to an extent that has to probably be reviewed by several parties before they can release it

256
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,940
Sure. Sure. No that that's all good

257
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:39,020
Well and good, but but Microsoft is not new to this whole trying to release open source software thing

258
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,380
Microsoft today is not a company that I would consider

259
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:49,180
completely unaware of how you do free software or open source software or whatever term you'd like and

260
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,580
They continue to struggle with this in frustrating ways

261
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,860
with dotnet with MS build and

262
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:04,400
Monodevelop like they're not new to this it this is something that I expect from somebody who's really new to this and has no

263
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,500
Experts or no people from the community. Yeah

264
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,860
I think it's a fair criticism on how the code is released and that they've had time to adapt

265
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:16,940
So I follow you there. Let's talk about something that I think those of us on this show

266
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,000
We're pretty pleased to see although we'll wait to see how it ultimately plays out, but it's official

267
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:28,500
It's been approved for fedora 33 to switch the desktop variants default file system to butter

268
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:36,460
Fs the fedora engineering and steering committee formally signed off on this which means we're going from extended for to butter fs

269
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Oh my god. Yes

270
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,740
But having it formally approved it all the T's are crossed and all the eyes were dotted

271
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,640
We're now, you know, we're just proceeding forward and getting everything working

272
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,900
Crossing my fingers. We'll actually have it in G in beta and GA. I'm pretty confident

273
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
It'll be at least in be a bit in beta. I

274
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:01,980
have no reason to believe that it won't make it to GA so I am I'm really happy about this and

275
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,700
Man years and years of effort are finally paying off. Well, it is very exciting and congratulations, and I

276
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:14,620
Thought it was sort of driven home recently because we just got an email from Steven or Stefan

277
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,620
I'm sorry Stefan if I'm getting it wrong

278
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,020
He was upgrading from open Sousa 42.1 to 15.2

279
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,740
And he said butter fs and snapshotting were a total lifesaver

280
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,180
He writes I've never had to start over on my main machine

281
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,420
Anytime I hosed the system by making a big error or an upgrade went awry

282
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:40,060
I just reboot into an older snapshot and use snapper to roll back once I'm in a working system

283
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,940
Of course the implementations would eventually be different in fedora once it got to that point

284
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:51,740
But just think about how critical a snapshot and rollback option is for a distribution that is

285
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:57,420
Updated as frequently as fedora and not just major releases which are frequent

286
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:04,380
but significant package updates including new versions of the kernel come down while you're running a current release of fedora and

287
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,260
While it generally works really well and dnf is pretty great at catching stuff

288
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,540
There's nothing like that belt and suspenders where you also have the reliability of those snapshots

289
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,420
And I think it makes the risk of upgrading to the next release of fedora even less now

290
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:26,220
So i'm excited to see where this goes. Yeah, um right now. We're not doing the automatic snapshotting stuff. That's down the road

291
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:31,980
That's down the road. I'm trying to be methodical about how we how we move forward and integrate these things

292
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:37,500
Well, it's kind of like I said recently you have to get the file system shipping before you can start building the tools based on

293
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:42,140
It exactly and like we can take advantage of the lessons learned from open susa

294
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,920
From other companies who have been rolling it out into production on nas devices

295
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:55,100
In in server fleets and stuff like that and we can hopefully make better decisions and and and optimize for our use case a lot better

296
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,540
With all of this, you know knowledge and experience and that's what i'm hoping to go towards like

297
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:05,420
Some of the choices that are a little bit weird from my perspective on open susa for their layout

298
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,020
We're probably not going to do those on fedora because we don't need to

299
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,780
Uh, and we're making already some enhancements are coming down the pipeline

300
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:19,340
There are some patches written for libvert to better handle the creation of virtual machines on butterfs making them no cow

301
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:24,000
For the disk images is disk image files. So that'll happen automatically

302
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,640
So that means that you won't be impaired by butterfs just out of the gate

303
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,560
Um in that sense and there's other things that we're working on across the board

304
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,960
Things for like improving performance when dealing with sqlite postgres mysql all the things

305
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,480
So like we're we're looking at it. We're actively doing these things

306
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,680
Um, i'm i'm confident. It's going to be a great experience

307
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,160
Um by the time fedora 33 rolls out it won't be like super fancy

308
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,120
The idea is that you won't notice anything, but it'll be there making things better

309
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,000
That's what i'm so excited about is that you know, suddenly without the user having to do anything

310
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,540
You've got all of these additional things like copy and write snapshots

311
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,680
File system compression optimizations for ssds built-in raid

312
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You might not need any or all of these

313
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,520
But they're all at your fingertips now and you don't have to know about it before you go install your linux system

314
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,920
You can opt into it later. Yeah, I look forward to trying it in fedora 33 to tell you the truth

315
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I think it's going to make it an exciting release

316
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,840
Just because of this even though nothing really fancy is going to happen and it's pretty much transparent to the user

317
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,400
I'm still looking forward to it and wes while we're shucking and jiving about fedora

318
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:35,920
One of the things we liked about the previous release was they shipped a user space out of memory killer

319
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,080
Which in our testing actually made a significant difference if you're on a linux box with some memory pressure

320
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,480
and now it seems

321
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
That this is going to be built into

322
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:54,480
System d yes, you guessed it because of course it will now I believe this is actually uh, some of the

323
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,080
Original code that was developed by facebook, right? Yes system d o m d is the out of memory demon developed by facebook

324
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
And now system d developers

325
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,840
They're aiming for this to be better linux handling of out of memory or just low memory situations

326
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,360
And while facebook originally wrote this code for their servers

327
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,320
And it's continued to be refined and adapted so that now it works pretty well on desktops, too

328
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,000
Now neil do we notice this likely mean that fedora will stop using their version and switch to this

329
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,520
I've been keeping a close eye on this as I told you when we were putting early oom into fedora

330
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,120
Last release cycle. We were actually also tracking this this this came up as part of it

331
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,680
Things are actually moving faster than I expected

332
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:44,080
Like I originally expected that uh system d oom d would not land for another eight months

333
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,640
And it looks like it might land in a few weeks

334
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,320
So this means that we're probably going to start looking at it in fedora 34. That makes sense

335
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,960
Wes one of the things that's kind of neat about having it down there at the system d level is it's also c group aware

336
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:07,040
Yeah system d o m d pulls system d for out of memory enabled c groups to monitor them and then kill based on memory pressure

337
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:11,920
Which is that that new measure that facebook helped add to the kernel or swap usage?

338
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
So I think it'll be interesting to see you know

339
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,960
If this solution that is already in place or this new system d based solution

340
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,040
I wonder if that might find different use cases that work a little bit better, especially, you know

341
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
It does say this works well for the desktop

342
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,880
But in the facebook world, you know

343
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,280
They could opt into all this stuff make sure that all their utilities on the server side were playing nicely with c groups

344
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:36,880
It may vary a little bit on desktop environments, uh, how well all this stuff works?

345
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,840
Why don't we stop now and do a little housekeeping just to change it up a bit

346
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,600
Because that was a lot of information to go through i'm out of memory

347
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,640
Yeah, and we're gonna kill it right now. Uh, I don't want to get the word out about guatic 2020

348
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,640
It starts july 22nd, which is tomorrow as we record this and goes to the 28th of 2020

349
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,560
The guatic is the gnome community's largest conference and it's online this year. So I would imagine

350
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,360
This could be the first guatic I ever attended if I had given it any thought and maybe I still can

351
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,800
Uh, i'll look into that and you can too with the link in the show notes

352
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,340
Also, if you want to join us live you'll find out when did you know that calendar jupitabroadcasting.com

353
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,900
Slash calendar link for that's in the notes as well and we do it over jblive.tv

354
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:27,380
Every sunday the lup lug the folks in the mumble room get together and hang out at noon pacific

355
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,900
That's the same bat time. We do this show. It's just on a bat sunday

356
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,540
We hung out last sunday. I talked about how I reflashed the computer in my rv for more performance and uh,

357
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,860
It made for some good stories

358
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:46,340
Uh lots of good stuff. We had some new folks show up. Of course as always we talk a little butter fs

359
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:48,580
so the lup lug is

360
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,900
It's often a multi-hour event, but you can show up for as little or as much as you like

361
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,220
Every sunday at noon pacific. It's also on the calendar if you just want to check that

362
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,780
so we'd love to see you there and

363
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,820
I've made it easier than ever

364
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:07,380
To get the mumble server info. You just go to linux unplug.com slash mumble

365
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,700
And it's all there the quick stuff

366
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:15,060
Or there's a link at the top of the page and the extended guide is still available at the jupiter colony page

367
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:19,940
If you want the full thing if you're brand new to mumble and you you want a guide on how to set up all the audio

368
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:25,860
Interface stuff the full guide is still available. But if you just need the quick server info linux unplug dot com

369
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,420
slash mumble

370
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,660
There we go see that doesn't that feel better west so much cleaner in here

371
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:40,900
And did you put an air freshener in the studio? Yeah, that's just levi. I gave him a shower. Yeah, he's much better now

372
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:46,820
So let's talk about element. This is something we've been watching really closely the riot chat

373
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:55,220
Program and the company actually has been renamed to element, which is a matrix chat

374
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:01,300
Client element, which I don't know if that's any easier to google than vector. I guess we'll see

375
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:07,700
It's the new flagship secure collaboration app for the decentralized matrix communication network

376
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:14,660
Element lets you own your end-to-end encrypted chat server. Well still connecting to everyone else in the wider matrix network

377
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:20,260
Yeah, that's right. That's the big federation play. We did know this name change was in the works

378
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,100
They explained it

379
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,980
Um, even a few weeks ago mostly in a in a blog post talking about some of the issues they had with

380
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:30,660
Gigantic game companies who blocked them from being able to trademark the name

381
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,660
Which then had a knock-on effect of them being unable to go after abusive forks in the google play store

382
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,580
And it just essentially came down to also being associated with

383
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,340
Violence rather than a more constructive form of chaos that they're into

384
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,940
As they write on their blog, and I think that's nice because the name doesn't really matter in the end

385
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,900
I got used to riot

386
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,700
I'll get used to element and I think it's great because they've also renamed the company now to just sort of keep it simple

387
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,140
Right. It's a little more consistent and you're right. We just got to we got to get used to these things

388
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:02,340
You had to put a label and naming is hard. Don't we all know it?

389
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,580
It's the worst part about coming up with a new podcast is coming up with the name. It's the worst

390
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,820
Uh, they said they wanted to future proof it as well. So this is their rationale for it

391
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:15,800
They said as matrix.org announced last month p2p matrix is in heavy development

392
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:23,380
And we see a world where element will literally be an element of matrix running your own home server within the app

393
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,380
So you can communicate if you don't have a server or even internet that actually is pretty cool

394
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,600
That is really cool. And that's one of the things, you know, the whole matrix ecosystem is filled with fascinating ideas

395
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:40,980
And a lot of potential the math names. I kind of love too. Hmm, and they're not just doing name changes west

396
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,420
They're rolling out pretty big improvements on their mobile apps and a massive refresh

397
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,780
To their web ui, which looks really good

398
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:56,180
I am seriously eyeballing matrix right now as the chat platform for jupiter broadcasting

399
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:02,340
The telegram group is still going jupiter broadcasting.com slash telegram. We haven't plugged it a lot recently because i've kind of just been

400
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:09,460
Watching how the chat ecosystem is unfolding because for self-hosted and the unfilter show

401
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:16,100
Discord has been very successful. So that gave me pause. I didn't want to just write discord off

402
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,380
But at the same time when I look at what would be a proper fit with this show

403
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:28,020
When I look at what would be a proper fit with this show, I think something like matrix which interconnects to all the different platforms

404
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:32,020
Which is the kind of thing our audience can geek out on but also it's free and open source

405
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,180
and

406
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,700
It's self-hostable

407
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:43,140
All these things sort of stack my general bias towards matrix as a chat platform that would potentially replace irc and telegram

408
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:48,500
And we would just use this for all of our primary text-based communication with the community

409
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,900
But at the same time

410
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:58,580
there's that network effect to consider so I have to look at things very seriously like irc telegram and discord and so i've been

411
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:07,380
Keeping an eye on matrix for a while and sort of mentally doing the math on how it would play into a wider ecosystem for us

412
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:15,700
And with element now making these improvements to the web ui and the mobile clients you have the general connected nature of matrix

413
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:22,580
And this new p2p stuff they're working on I find that to be a really compelling package all in we need it to be easy

414
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,220
Frankly, you know, it's got to be it's got to be worth the install

415
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,860
So the client can't be gross you got to be easy to connect with us

416
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:35,700
When you live in a world of so many solutions, that's how you differentiate. So elements of thing now no longer will be called riot

417
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:40,660
Now I don't really have much to say about this last one. It's just a little weird

418
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,960
There's a job posting over at microsoft's

419
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
jobs page

420
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
about a program manager

421
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,600
for a cloud pc project

422
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,640
That would be a desktop delivered

423
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:00,680
From azure and managed by microsoft at a flat per user price

424
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,960
They call it the microsoft cloud pc

425
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:10,520
A new offering that would be built on top of the windows virtual desktop to deliver desktop as a service

426
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:17,420
It would really be targeted to business customers that are looking for a modern quick workstation experience that have high connectivity

427
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
And I have to tell you

428
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:26,440
I could see this being appealing because I know of companies that sell versions of this based on aws right now

429
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,400
and you go into the businesses and

430
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:36,120
They don't have any on-premises services other than a switch a router and a wi-fi access point. There's no file server

431
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,200
There's no directory server

432
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,440
It's just a flat network that provides high-speed internet access

433
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,880
And I think you can hear that in the first sentence of that description that you read there that

434
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:50,840
This is the azure and microsoft managed solution that this already exists

435
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,480
And yeah, clearly it's interesting because as anyone who's administered windows pcs knows

436
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:02,200
It's kind of a pain and if you can just let microsoft handle it if you already have to be an internet connected company anyway

437
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,300
From all the other sas products that you buy that makes your company run in 2020

438
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,820
Yeah, all right. Why not use the desktop and maybe maybe

439
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,420
Microsoft can do this better than others since they control all the pieces

440
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:21,420
What's funny is I know that linux has all of the pieces to do this because I rocked linux terminal servers way back in the day

441
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:28,380
And we have all kinds of means to accomplish this now and there are companies out there working on it. But

442
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,660
Where microsoft is going to have this this sort of?

443
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,700
home turf advantage

444
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,180
Is they're going to sort of package it all up with microsoft's office 365 offering

445
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,420
which it's it's sort of like this obvious solution you have

446
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:49,100
All your data in the ecosystem of office 365 word excel teams

447
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,860
One drive is your storage or teams. It's weird and

448
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:58,860
You just need essentially a chrome pc, but instead of getting that google stuff

449
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,700
That's all connected to the google ecosystem. You get microsoft's version of it

450
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,060
You get microsoft's version of it and this one's a step further

451
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:12,540
And it's maybe even a more pure version of that chrome experience where it's a complete remote cloud pc

452
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:20,540
Managed by microsoft as part of your office 365 subscription. You know what? I want to know is wsl going to work on cloud pc

453
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:29,420
Brent i'm sure you'd get one of these wouldn't you? Well, it means maybe I'd I'd need less fancy hardware all the time

454
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,100
But uh, no, I'm sorry. I'm not in my hand is not raised

455
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:39,500
I would like to see a vendor come along and offer this up with mate as the desktop experience

456
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,540
Libre office as the office solution connected to some sort of central cloud storage

457
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:50,060
So that way you can have multiple users from a workspace use the same storage

458
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,740
maybe create some sort of user id system for them, I mean there's

459
00:35:53,740 --> 00:36:00,460
Small versions of this have been implemented or there's amazon's implementation of these but there's not a complete

460
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:06,860
Package of you need office and a computer and you just need these storage services for your company

461
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,860
And here's another alternative for you. That's not google or microsoft the business ready

462
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,420
All wrapped up ready to go stuff

463
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:13,980
Yeah

464
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,100
And all of the pieces are there and it's something that linux could be particularly good at because I don't know which

465
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,860
System you'd want to use a remote desktop system or a linux terminal services setup

466
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,900
but the cool thing about a linux terminal services setup

467
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,980
is a lot of those programs run locally in memory and

468
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:36,140
They will use your local gpu if you have one which means you can make thin clients that have gpu acceleration

469
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,820
But additionally if libre office is loaded in your local ram

470
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:46,860
Your internet can blip or your latency can be bad and you're completely unaffected on a linux thin client setup

471
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:51,820
Now if you're doing something like xrdp or another type of remote desktop protocol that wouldn't be the case

472
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,940
So it just depends on the implementation, but there's so much opportunity here

473
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,140
it makes me wish I had the time to like start a business because

474
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:08,460
there is a whole area of small business in the states that is somewhere between five to 25 people and

475
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,580
These annual subscriptions just stack up and they're a little allergic to them

476
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:19,580
And they just need somebody to show them a solution that works for them and give them an implementation. That's not some sort of

477
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:26,220
Moral choice they're not choosing microsoft because of some moral reason it's just they don't have any other options presented to them

478
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,780
Right, they have the most hand holding that way and that's what they need

479
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,860
But kudos to microsoft. I think it's probably going to be a successful product if they launch it

480
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:36,780
They've tried stuff like this in the past, but I think you know now is the time

481
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,260
I wonder if it's you know, we've kind of talked about other microsoft assets like office 365

482
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:46,140
You know things you used to have to have a windows desktop to use or maybe a complicated wine setup that

483
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:52,460
Since they've migrated to the cloud into an online offering while we might not love having to use them from the free software world

484
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,740
It's good for people trying to use a linux desktop and still get work done

485
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,900
And I mean this almost seems like it's it's the ultimate in that it's making windows the same thing

486
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:05,180
I I somewhat recently had to go for an unfortunate reason go spin up a windows vm

487
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:08,860
And I did it on azure because I didn't want to clutter up any of my local systems

488
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,420
And it was kind of a painful process with all of the pains of using windows

489
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:19,180
If I could just have a cloud pc pop it up get my windows specific stuff done and then go back to my pure linux world

490
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:25,900
Yeah, all right. I'll I'll pay microsoft a couple bucks for that. So do you rdp into a azure windows vm?

491
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:30,060
How does that work? They've got like a web um a way to view it on the web, too

492
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,900
Of course, but yeah, I just rdp'd up uh up in there got my work done

493
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,140
And uh got the heck out of there

494
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,820
But it took forever and of course, you know

495
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,060
I was doing updates and had to spin all the way up and getting it actually installed and booted up took

496
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:47,980
Much longer than an equivalent linux vm. I was honestly surprised by how painful it was, huh?

497
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,500
That's a that's an interesting experience. Wes. Thanks for sharing that with the class

498
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:52,780
All right

499
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,780
So if anybody out there knows of a service like this for linux where you could go set up an account

500
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,940
It'll spin you up a virtual desktop and then you can remote desktop into it

501
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:07,660
Let me know linux unplug.com slash contact or chris lass on twitter because i'll give that a try and I want to give it a review

502
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,460
Because that's a product that should exist for linux desktop as well

503
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:16,540
We can do it better. Maybe rdp is actually kind of legit, but we can use xrdp. So we could probably do it better

504
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,980
What do you say we do some picks before we get out of here because we got some good ones and we got some

505
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:28,460
Feedback too and we start with poly bar a fast and easy to use status bar

506
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,580
And I think a couple of you had some experience with this one. Yeah

507
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,620
Well, actually I just stumbled across it the other day and I was thinking to myself man. This would be

508
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:43,660
A great addition to something like open box or i3 and then after mentioning it to you guys

509
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:49,600
I believe drew didn't you try it on i3? Yeah, i've used it a number of times on i3

510
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,740
i'm not using it right now, even though i'm on i3 but

511
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:58,060
It is a really great and good looking bar

512
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:04,460
That's easy to get going and easy to add like custom blocks and stuff too and change

513
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:07,260
the way it looks and give it a nice color scheme and

514
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:14,700
All around it's just a little slicker and more fully featured than you know, the stuff that like comes stock with i3

515
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,540
The orange one's been using it for about a year. So give us the the why i've been using it for a year review

516
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:27,340
Originally when I started with i3 naturally I found a rust implementation of those bars and it's really nice

517
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,200
But the nice thing about poly bar is there's just tons and tons of extensions

518
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:40,640
And the fact that you can have it show spotify cpu you see volume time current window. Everything is just great and

519
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:48,480
Massively like beats like the windows taskbar and what you'd normally expect from a taskbar like that. Hmm

520
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:54,880
That's a pretty hardy plug. So check out poly bar. We'll have a link in there and then

521
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:01,920
We have a fun one for those of you who like your stats. It's called y-top and it's essentially go-top

522
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,520
Only this time it's in rust

523
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,200
And you thought we were done with the rust watch heck no

524
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,160
Yes

525
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:19,200
Another system monitor only this one is written in rust. It's it's familiar to those of you who have been enjoying batchtop

526
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
I think we mentioned that in episode

527
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,180
351 so it's been a little bit, but this is another one now. There's go-top out there as well

528
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,580
But this is y-top and yes, it's it's rust based, you know

529
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,980
I think our unofficial goal here on the mix unplugged is to just find every single possible top

530
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:41,620
Implementation out there and talk about them on the show and i'm interested in what each one chooses to show because yeah

531
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:45,780
Okay, you're all just going to go scrape the kernel for a whole bunch of information display it for the user

532
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:51,060
But how you display it that kind of counts and you know y-top. It's a decent contender

533
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,060
It's got a really nice cpu graph going

534
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:59,060
I also like the network usage graph that it displays because hey right now i'm chatting with you. I can monitor my connection

535
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:03,860
Yeah, and the hit on the system seems to be very minimal, which is always my thing

536
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,820
I don't want the monitoring tool to put abusive load

537
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:12,420
On the box, which is really actually kind of an issue on the raspberry pi you you have to be careful

538
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:15,860
Like on the raspberry pi 3, uh, you could run net data

539
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:22,020
But it basically will can start consuming the device, especially if you're running off the sd card

540
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:27,620
But something like this is so much so much lighter. And if you just need quick information over a terminal session

541
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:33,380
It's hard to a bash top might look a little better, but it's uh, I don't know. It's it's hard to beat this one

542
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,860
I like it a lot. So get a link to those in the notes and

543
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,020
Feel free to send yours along. Why don't we get to a little feedback west? Do you want to take this first one about?

544
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,180
Some next cloud follow-up and questions. Oh boy, eric, aka

545
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,900
Pedestrian had some feedback for us about our recent discussion around next cloud

546
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,260
Hello chris and wess. I really enjoyed the next cloud discussion

547
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,700
But I have a few questions and comments to share

548
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,020
One are you using redis? If not, it might go a long way towards addressing any concurrency issues

549
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:08,660
You're still seeing. Yes, we are using redis. Although I don't know that we've tuned it a whole bunch

550
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:12,980
We're using a docker compose stack setup from the next cloud project itself

551
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:19,620
So we haven't spent a ton of time going outside those bounds, but we are running a redis container. That's a good tip though

552
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,660
Number two using the s3 compatible storage background has been great for me

553
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:31,380
The interesting part is that any s3 compatible storage provider will work. I've been using redis for a long time

554
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:37,380
S3 compatible storage provider will work. I've been using a do droplet with wasabi as the back end and it's both cheaper

555
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,780
And more performant than spaces

556
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,740
That's also probably a good tip. You know, we went with spaces because well, we were already a do customer

557
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,340
We had access to it. We had account set up for you know, access to the team all that stuff

558
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,340
So it made sense to plug right in

559
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:56,180
But the whole beauty of using something that is s3 compatible is you have options there including s3 itself

560
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:03,140
Of course now i've not used wasabi, but I will say we've received a couple other items of feedback that are also recommending it

561
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:10,520
Yeah, like rick here writes in and he said in your recent episode when you talked about your expensive next cloud implementation

562
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,060
I found it totally unacceptable. I cringed when I heard the price

563
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:22,420
This is homework for you and the jb crew to do he says 10 terabytes of hot aka active storage on wasabi's service

564
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:29,700
Is fifty nine dollars a month combine that with the 15 a month droplet and it should be just about 80 a month

565
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:31,520
with tax

566
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:37,780
Overages if any would be much more affordable and manageable can next cloud integrate with wasabi. Hell. Yeah

567
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,260
Here's what I found to get you and the crew started

568
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,060
And he says it also allows you can pick a cdn in front of wasabi

569
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:51,300
He says I have an idea use the storage on a droplet for temp storage and then move it to wasabi instances as needed

570
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,020
You just figure out a storage strategy and create docs for the crew

571
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:59,140
Save your hard-earned money. I agree with that. We are going to fix it for the record

572
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,700
I'm not affiliated with wasabi or any storage company

573
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,540
I think this is something we'll have to look at because we're either going to have to stop using it

574
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:13,060
Or switch to something cheaper and if this math is right, I mean around 80 a month

575
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:16,600
It's still more expensive than dropbox

576
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,600
But not by much, especially if you consider how many users we have because dropbox

577
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,240
charges by the user

578
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:28,680
Right if you consider how many users we need our cost is probably around a hundred dollars a month for dropbox if you were to

579
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:33,720
Take the annual cost and spread it out. So 85 would be cheaper. It's still it's still a lot of money

580
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,880
It's still a lot of money

581
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,720
And I wonder if what we really need is something that's just a small tiny storage of in progress files

582
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,800
I think that's big a big part of this is we got to go we should go do some pruning and see

583
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:51,000
Go do some pruning and figure out like what do we need to have hot and what can be left in archival storage?

584
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,320
And then invest in

585
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,840
Storage at the studio in the physical box here that we can add to

586
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,320
But then it just sort of changes the backup scenario here in the studio. So I got to think about that

587
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:09,720
It's a can of worms, but we do appreciate uh, the feedback guys. It's given us something to think about

588
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,040
Now, uh west there was somebody wrote in asking for time stamps. You want to take that one?

589
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,160
Yeah, oh, yes. Okay. I guess this is a request for me then

590
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,800
as it writes in

591
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,100
Wanting time stamps. Here's a humble request that time stamps be included in the podcast description

592
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,960
So I can go right to the segments. I most want to hear. Thank you. Love the show great work

593
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:37,080
Okay. Hey, that's pretty reasonable. We do have them, you know available as chapter markers and we've got them on youtube

594
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,760
But that might not be everywhere

595
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,420
I guess that's something we could consider because I guess we could just extract it from the chapter information

596
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:49,820
And there's just put it in the description. Yeah, we can add it to the long form description. That shouldn't be too big a problem

597
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,420
That's something we'll think about uh

598
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,540
But this also is just a good chance to remind you that we do have chapter markers for almost all our shows all our shows

599
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,980
Yes, and um, you can jump right past any segment you like or you can jump to a topic

600
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:09,580
um using those and they should be in just about every mobile podcast player and uh, we'll we'll start

601
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:15,340
Um looking into embedding it in the show notes. There's a possibility too there because we already have the information

602
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:22,940
All right. Now we have one last feedback that I will read and it's a plug for a audience member's own project

603
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,780
But it's so dang cool

604
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,380
I wanted to talk about it

605
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:31,180
He said i've created an app just for linux that I think fellow space nerds like you would be interested in it's called

606
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:37,260
Astro ninja and it's written in python using mostly pi q5 and scrappy spiders

607
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:43,820
I love it. It has the full worldwide launch schedules industry news hubble images

608
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:51,600
Launch tallies and spacex live streams built in the project just reached its alpha release and i'm trying to invite like-minded individuals

609
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,060
To check it out and seeing how I really oh, geez now he's bragging now

610
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,100
He's talking nice about it

611
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,820
He loves the show and he sees he's been listening for years

612
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,180
And he said he first thought of thought of us and wanted to pass it along

613
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:09,020
So in the show notes will have a link to his email where he has links to a youtube video that shows it off

614
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,340
And we'll put a link to his github repo

615
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:16,220
Um, which you can go check out the project if you're a space nerd want to geek out on that stuff

616
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:21,100
It's astro ninja and it just hit alpha and it's up on github kind of cool

617
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,820
This looks pretty handy as a little dashboard and it's not another electron app

618
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:31,740
So you just need python and uh cubed installed and away you go. Yeah, most linux desktops are gonna have that

619
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,080
So thanks for sending that along tom and congratulations

620
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:40,300
On the release it does look like it's a pretty cool project astro ninja is a good name, too, right?

621
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:45,180
I love that. I love watching those spacex launches too, right? And you know, they use a bunch of linux

622
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,180
So clearly linux and astronomy

623
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,820
They're just made to be together

624
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,100
All right. Well that brings us to the end of this week's official program. Thanks so much for listening

625
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,040
We'd love to have you tune in live over jblive.tv

626
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,900
or if you can't

627
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:02,860
Thanks for listening on the download. We like that too. That's just fine

628
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,980
In fact, why not share this podcast with a linux loving friend?

629
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:11,980
That'd be great, too. You can find links to everything we talked about at linux unplugged dot com slash

630
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:20,460
363 63. Yeah. Thanks wess. I was gonna get there 363 linux unplugged dot com slash 363

631
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:22,620
And the show is at linux unplugged on twitter

632
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:27,820
Thanks so much for tuning into this week's episode of the unplugged program and we'll see you right back here

633
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,820
next tuesday

634
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,820
So

635
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,980
So by bitten you were

636
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:13,500
Chatting in the irc that there is a linux desktop service out there called ubi desktop

637
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:21,420
Yeah, so I stumbled upon it and it is kind of neat for uh 10 years a month you get a uh, single core

638
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,540
3.4 gigahertz 2 gigabytes ram

639
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:32,140
Uh 32 gigs of ssd storage and one terabytes a month of trap traffic at one gigabits a second

640
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:39,020
How do you know how much your desktop traffic's gonna that's that's a tricky one, but a terabyte you'd think would be enough. Yeah, and uh,

641
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:44,300
It is depending on if the rdp or uh, what kind of uh,

642
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,980
Uh vnc kind of service if that data gets counted, uh against it or not

643
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:55,660
Uh, but it is very easy and they have a free to try option

644
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:03,020
And if you scroll a bit more down, they have a discount coupon code and they have an extreme version at 43

645
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:11,340
90 a month you get four virtual cpus eight gigs of ram 128 gigabytes of ssd and five terabytes of traffic

646
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,900
That ssd is a little tight though

647
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:18,620
That's interesting. If you were a new business that was starting up. You didn't have any machines

648
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:24,300
Right and someone was going to sell you this service. Would they just run on thin clients? Yeah, exactly

649
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,300
I mean think about another way

650
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:32,940
Isn't it silly to buy 800 pcs with 125 monitor and a mouse and keyboard?

651
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,180
That you then go license software for then you have to have an it person manage it

652
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,220
How silly is that for an office of five people or 15 people or even 100 people?

653
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:46,940
And if you scroll down far enough, do you need a vdi try desktop as a service?

654
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:55,020
They even support those kind of things. Yeah, it's pretty wild. Um, so it's coming and obviously it doesn't mean it's going to replace

655
00:51:55,740 --> 00:52:00,220
Traditional computers because there's so many reasons why you still need a traditional computer at a desk

656
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,580
But you got to figure if chromebooks have been pretty successful

657
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:08,620
There's probably a market for this kind of thing too. And i've heard from listeners in the past that

658
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:14,780
Use this as a daily driver as part of their work. It's some other vendors virtual desktop solution right now

659
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:20,300
But it's already out there to some degree and being widely used one challenge. I can't get around is the

660
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:25,580
Necessity for always connected internet. I run into this all the time even at home, you know, okay

661
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:30,940
I've got this stable connection and it just you know drops and so if i'm in the middle of something that is one of the

662
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:37,900
Biggest productivity killers ever. That's why I think it's so office focused, you know, you picture someone in a downtown office suite

663
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,220
Their building has fiber connection

664
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,780
Probably, you know the best case scenario

665
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:46,080
It's basically the opposite of wherever Brent is. Yeah, or me
