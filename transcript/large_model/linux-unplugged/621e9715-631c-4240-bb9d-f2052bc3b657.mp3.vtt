00:00.000 --> 00:02.200
Going back to Popey's argument about filing a bug,

00:02.200 --> 00:04.400
this is not one I think,

00:04.400 --> 00:06.560
and I don't know, maybe it's my bias.

00:06.560 --> 00:07.760
I've been around for a while.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.800
This is not one I think is worth my time.

00:11.000 --> 00:12.520
Because it's-

00:12.520 --> 00:15.040
Yeah, that's what I heard for six months

00:15.040 --> 00:16.880
from the people complaining about wireless on 1604.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.160
I disagree with that.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.000
I didn't actually have that problem, but that would've been-

00:20.000 --> 00:20.880
Oh my God.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.000
That would've been one that would've been.

00:23.000 --> 00:24.360
But that's exactly the problem.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.880
Like not everyone had this problem.

00:25.880 --> 00:28.800
There were people like very close to you

00:28.800 --> 00:32.000
ranting about how wireless on 1604 was completely busted

00:32.000 --> 00:34.240
and everyone should avoid it on 2604.

00:34.240 --> 00:36.320
It turns out, no, it's not busted for everyone.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.440
It's not busted for anyone in Canonical.

00:38.440 --> 00:40.360
It's only busted for certain select people

00:40.360 --> 00:41.920
with certain chipsets in certain environments.

00:41.920 --> 00:42.760
That's crazy.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.200
Those fuckers wouldn't tell us

00:44.200 --> 00:46.040
what the details of that system was.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.360
If you don't tell us, we can't fucking fix it.

00:48.360 --> 00:49.640
I think this is a real problem.

00:49.640 --> 00:53.680
I think the core problem that that issue,

00:53.680 --> 00:56.400
the thing is, is I'm not gonna spend my time.

00:56.400 --> 00:58.280
I'm not gonna spend, I'm not gonna, like I said,

00:58.280 --> 01:00.200
if I'm working 65 hours this week,

01:00.200 --> 01:01.920
I'm not gonna work 67 hours

01:01.920 --> 01:03.280
so that way I can report a bug

01:03.280 --> 01:05.280
and then watch them tell me it's an Nvidia problem.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.120
I'm not gonna do it.

01:06.120 --> 01:10.000
Doesn't Canonical maintain a list of certified hardware?

01:10.000 --> 01:10.880
We do, yeah.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.280
So if you're buying outside of that list,

01:13.280 --> 01:15.720
but you don't wanna spend time there to report the issues,

01:15.720 --> 01:17.360
like that's kind of seems like.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.680
Also, it's a bit cheeky to say

01:20.680 --> 01:22.800
that you're not willing to put in the extra hours

01:22.800 --> 01:25.160
when all these people who are working their day job

01:25.160 --> 01:28.000
and then in their spare time, in their evenings,

01:28.000 --> 01:29.160
are working on open source projects.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.000
I agree.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.720
I'm just telling you, I think that's what's happening.

01:32.720 --> 01:33.760
I think that's it.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.280
And I think that's just human nature.

01:35.280 --> 01:38.800
People are, they're at their wits end with so many things,

01:38.800 --> 01:41.520
especially in the US, that I think that's the issue,

01:41.520 --> 01:42.920
is people are out of bandwidth.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.320
That you gotta buy the certified hardware.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.040
Right, I mean, there's a little, and there's other,

01:46.040 --> 01:48.280
I mean, there's a lot of different answers,

01:48.280 --> 01:50.240
but I think the core problem

01:50.240 --> 01:52.000
of people not reporting what's going on,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.720
like they're not gonna get a bug report from me on this.

01:54.720 --> 01:58.440
I'm just gonna either move on or, you know,

01:58.440 --> 01:59.280
I don't know what.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.560
So this is one of the reasons,

02:00.560 --> 02:02.080
and it's a slight change of topic,

02:02.080 --> 02:03.280
but this is one of the reasons

02:03.280 --> 02:06.200
why we want that crash reporting information from people.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.560
Cause it's not just like, you know,

02:07.560 --> 02:08.920
weirdness that happens on your display,

02:08.920 --> 02:11.840
but when shit crashes, we want to know about that

02:11.840 --> 02:12.880
so we can fix it.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.640
And we know there are plenty of people.

02:14.640 --> 02:15.920
I can sit here and berate you

02:15.920 --> 02:18.000
and encourage you to file a bug,

02:18.000 --> 02:20.840
but I know there are, for every one of you,

02:20.840 --> 02:22.560
there's a hundred or a thousand,

02:22.560 --> 02:25.720
or maybe a hundred thousand people who will not file a bug,

02:25.720 --> 02:28.280
don't know how, didn't know it's even possible, right?

02:28.280 --> 02:31.240
But if under the covers, when something crashes,

02:31.240 --> 02:34.280
if we can, in a tasteful way, take that crash report

02:34.280 --> 02:36.440
and aggregate it with all the other crash reports

02:36.440 --> 02:38.440
that are similar, and we can analyze that and say,

02:38.440 --> 02:40.320
okay, we've got a problem.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.720
We need to fix this thing.

02:41.720 --> 02:43.880
We don't even ever have to interact

02:43.880 --> 02:45.760
with human beings out in the field.

02:45.760 --> 02:46.760
Which is how it should work.

02:46.760 --> 02:48.040
Fix that code, right.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.560
But not everything is a crash, right?

02:49.560 --> 02:51.720
And what you're experiencing is not necessarily a crash.

02:51.720 --> 02:55.600
And that's the problem, is not everything can be captured

02:55.600 --> 02:58.040
and fixed via crash reports.

02:58.040 --> 02:59.120
Well, this is my long way of saying

02:59.120 --> 03:00.560
I'm switching to elementary OS.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.160
Sweet. Boom.

03:02.160 --> 03:03.000
Awesome.

03:03.000 --> 03:03.840
You know how many-

03:03.840 --> 03:04.680
You're still gonna have Nvidia problems.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.120
So don't fuck it up, Dan.

03:07.120 --> 03:11.600
May you have a nice time and the Nvidia RNG gods bless you.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.200
I'm just worried you're gonna screw this whole thing up.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.440
You got a good thing going, that's all.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.520
So just keep it going, Dan.

03:15.520 --> 03:16.360
Don't mess things up.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.360
Or thinking about putting an Amazon search in.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.280
Oh yeah. Oh, that would be so handy.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.120
Yeah. Yeah, good.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.680
That's great timing.

03:22.680 --> 03:24.200
Generates revenue, mate.

03:24.200 --> 03:27.200
Whatever you might think, it generates revenue.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.080
This is Linux Unplugged, episode 244.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.600
Welcome to Linux Unplugged, your weekly Linux talk show

03:34.600 --> 03:36.560
that's sitting in front of so many Linux rigs,

03:36.560 --> 03:38.720
I'm starting to lose track.

03:38.720 --> 03:39.560
My name is Chris.

03:39.560 --> 03:40.960
My name is Wes.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.080
Hello, Wes.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.040
That's a little bit of a behind the scenes joke,

03:44.040 --> 03:45.120
I suppose. It sure is.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.560
But I'll tell you what, Wes,

03:46.560 --> 03:47.760
everything we have to talk about

03:47.760 --> 03:50.040
is gonna be in front of the scenes this week?

03:50.040 --> 03:51.240
Out in the open.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.480
Wes and I are gonna be out in the open

03:52.480 --> 03:53.320
coming up really soon.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.280
We'll tell you about where you can come hang out with us

03:55.280 --> 03:59.880
and perhaps watch a live taping of this very show.

03:59.880 --> 04:02.840
ZFS on Linux has a bit of a butterFS bug.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.080
We'll tell you what's going on,

04:04.080 --> 04:05.960
and no, it's not actually that bad.

04:05.960 --> 04:09.400
And Steam Machines are perhaps not so dead?

04:09.400 --> 04:11.920
We kind of got down on Steam Machines last week,

04:11.920 --> 04:13.400
so we gotta follow up on that.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.560
NVIDIA is taking away your cookies,

04:15.560 --> 04:18.840
and there's a new tool out

04:18.840 --> 04:21.560
that let's just say it's gonna make your stuff look better.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.000
It's gonna make your stuff look better.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.680
The stuff you back up,

04:24.680 --> 04:26.600
the stuff you back up off the web

04:26.600 --> 04:28.120
is gonna look better with this.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.520
I'm not gonna say any more than that

04:29.520 --> 04:31.160
because the copyright lawyers may be listening right now,

04:31.160 --> 04:32.680
but we'll move on.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.280
Then later on in the show,

04:34.280 --> 04:36.920
we have a new segment called Plasma Corner,

04:36.920 --> 04:40.040
which changed a little bit before the show started,

04:40.040 --> 04:41.680
but we'll talk about Plasma Vault,

04:41.680 --> 04:44.240
which is a really sweet Plasma applet

04:44.240 --> 04:47.320
that gives you a front end to creating encrypted vaults

04:47.320 --> 04:49.600
and some new features that are coming to Plasma Vault

04:49.600 --> 04:51.800
really soon that I think you're gonna love,

04:51.800 --> 04:55.880
and then we'll discuss, I think,

04:55.880 --> 04:57.440
the only dock you should be using

04:57.440 --> 05:00.880
if you should so choose to do so on the Plasma desktop.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.080
Now, I'm not saying you should.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.920
I'm not saying you should, but I found a dock,

05:04.920 --> 05:07.160
replaced my Plasma panel with it, and I'm loving it.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.000
I'll tell you about that,

05:08.000 --> 05:11.920
and then we'll talk a little bit about Falcon,

05:11.920 --> 05:15.400
a cross-platform QT web browser

05:15.400 --> 05:18.160
that, not bad, it's not bad.

05:18.160 --> 05:19.160
So how about that, Wes?

05:19.160 --> 05:21.120
That is a full show.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.320
That's some things, that's some things.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.160
Let's get into it.

05:23.160 --> 05:24.000
So let's not go any further

05:24.000 --> 05:25.560
without bringing in our virtual lug time.

05:25.560 --> 05:27.440
Appropriate greetings, Mumble Room.

05:27.440 --> 05:28.280
Hello. Hello.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.120
Hello.

05:29.120 --> 05:29.960
Hello.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.280
Hello.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.120
Jeez, hi, guys.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.480
It's good to be connected with all of you.

05:33.480 --> 05:34.720
Thanks for being here.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.280
I wanna just start the show out with a plug skis

05:37.280 --> 05:42.280
for Linux Fest Northwest 2018,

05:42.280 --> 05:46.240
which will be April 28th through the 29th this year,

05:46.240 --> 05:47.720
and Wes and I will be there,

05:47.720 --> 05:51.000
as well as many others from the Jupiter Broadcasting crew,

05:51.000 --> 05:56.000
including Noah and Alan Jude and Angela and others.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.600
We'll be doing some live shows from there.

05:57.600 --> 05:58.440
We'll have a booth.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.800
We'll have some swag.

05:59.800 --> 06:00.840
We'll be chatting with people.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.520
We'll be drinking beers and hanging out

06:02.520 --> 06:05.080
and doing all the things you do when you're in Bellingham.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.120
So join us there, Linux Fest Northwest.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.720
You can find out more at linuxfestnorthwest.org.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.200
Just a little bit left.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.440
I think, just a little bit of time left,

06:13.440 --> 06:15.280
but I think not so many rooms left.

06:15.280 --> 06:19.680
So that's why I camp in the parking lot in my RV.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.400
Linux Fest Northwest 2018.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.040
Go check it out, linuxfestnorthwest.org.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.520
It looks like it's already the biggest Linux Fest this year.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.160
I mean, this year's already the biggest.

06:28.160 --> 06:29.000
You know what I mean?

06:29.000 --> 06:29.840
It's the biggest one yet,

06:29.840 --> 06:31.000
because they've sold out of all the things,

06:31.000 --> 06:33.880
and we'd love to see you there and hang out with us.

06:33.880 --> 06:34.920
I think that'd be a lot of fun.

06:34.920 --> 06:35.760
I'm looking forward to it.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.120
We may just try, I don't know.

06:37.120 --> 06:40.360
We may just try to do like a weekend edition of this show,

06:40.360 --> 06:43.520
and do it live there at the Fest.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.360
That'd be a lot of fun.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.760
So stay tuned for that, linuxfest.org, if you wanna go.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.160
And I may try to make it down

06:49.160 --> 06:51.600
to Southeast Linux Fest this year too.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.560
So may see you down there as well.

06:53.560 --> 06:55.040
There's other events coming up,

06:55.040 --> 06:56.920
but I think Linux Fest Northwest is one of the best,

06:56.920 --> 06:58.080
and Bellingham is a ton of fun.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.320
Just before the show, Wes and I were talking

06:59.320 --> 07:00.160
about how much we're looking forward

07:00.160 --> 07:01.800
to just going back to Bellingham.

07:01.800 --> 07:02.640
It's just a great place to hang out.

07:02.640 --> 07:03.720
It's such a wonderful place.

07:03.720 --> 07:04.560
It's a college town.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.920
There's a lot of different breweries there.

07:06.920 --> 07:08.040
There's just a lot going on.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.120
It's a cute quintessential Pacific Northwest place.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.800
All right, so now let's talk about destroying your data.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.920
Now that that's out of the way, you know me.

07:14.920 --> 07:17.800
I'm a pretty big fan of the ZFS,

07:18.880 --> 07:20.200
but you knew this day was coming.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.680
You knew a reckoning was in the works,

07:23.680 --> 07:27.040
and let's be honest, you still rolled the dice.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.320
I've never installed GNU slash Linux.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.480
Okay, well now not all of us have rolled the dice,

07:31.480 --> 07:36.160
but there is a disappearing files issue

07:36.160 --> 07:37.960
on ZFS on Linux right now.

07:37.960 --> 07:41.160
On certain distributions, and I want to do a breakdown

07:41.160 --> 07:42.800
just so you can be aware of what's going on.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.800
The ZFS team is already well aware of it,

07:45.800 --> 07:50.800
but if you are on ZFS version 0.77 on say like CentOS,

07:52.040 --> 07:56.120
you should absolutely seriously consider downgrading to 7.6,

07:56.120 --> 07:57.840
or if by the time you're listening to this,

07:57.840 --> 08:00.120
7.8 is available upgrade.

08:00.120 --> 08:02.240
Gen2 is also affected.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.760
Ubuntu and Debian users are not affected

08:04.760 --> 08:06.800
because they are on older versions of ZFS.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.800
Ubuntu specifically is on version 0.75,

08:09.800 --> 08:13.720
but it's a regression that's been introduced in ZFS 0.77

08:13.720 --> 08:16.120
on some Linux systems.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.880
It's sort of complicated,

08:18.880 --> 08:20.600
but it's kind of a combination issue

08:20.600 --> 08:22.680
as a lot of times these problems are.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.320
It's a combination of a change

08:24.320 --> 08:26.520
that was made in GNU core utils

08:26.520 --> 08:29.120
in the way that CP works, yeah,

08:29.120 --> 08:33.760
and a patch that was made to ZFS,

08:33.760 --> 08:36.520
and the two things collided.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.280
So I talked to Alan Jude last night,

08:38.280 --> 08:40.840
and he says that, he went through this whole thing,

08:40.840 --> 08:43.520
and he's been kind of been following this from day one.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.400
The team's been working on this.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.200
They're already working on the patch.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.560
He says they found part of the problem

08:48.560 --> 08:50.480
is based on a change to core utils,

08:50.480 --> 08:51.800
but it doesn't go to,

08:51.800 --> 08:53.600
and that's why some people can reproduce the problem,

08:53.600 --> 08:54.920
some people couldn't.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.600
So you had to have a certain version of ZFS,

08:56.600 --> 08:58.560
and you had to have a certain version of core utils,

08:58.560 --> 09:01.600
but in the version of core utils that CentOS is using,

09:02.680 --> 09:05.280
there is a hard limit that was accidentally introduced

09:05.280 --> 09:08.600
with a recent patch to ZFS.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.560
They limited the attempts to expand the ZAP,

09:10.560 --> 09:12.400
which is the, when I asked Alan,

09:12.400 --> 09:14.160
what the hell, Alan, is a ZAP?

09:14.160 --> 09:16.560
It's the ZFS Attributes Processor.

09:16.560 --> 09:17.680
It's basically, yeah.

09:17.680 --> 09:18.720
Well, of course, Chris.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.000
Yeah, so the ZAP is a ZFS Attributes Processor

09:22.000 --> 09:24.760
that's basically a key store value, yeah, okay?

09:24.760 --> 09:28.200
And it's how directories are stored in ZFS,

09:28.200 --> 09:30.360
and this bug that was introduced

09:30.360 --> 09:33.600
limited the attempts to expand the ZAP to two,

09:33.600 --> 09:35.280
which is not enough.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.840
And so that means two attempts.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.640
And so when you're copying thousands of files,

09:41.640 --> 09:43.040
after a couple of attempts, it would just say,

09:43.040 --> 09:44.160
oh, can't do it anymore,

09:44.160 --> 09:46.960
and it would just start dropping the files, essentially.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.880
And so the ZFS team, Richard Yao, is a part of this,

09:50.880 --> 09:51.720
is working on the fixes.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.560
We've dropped everything.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.720
We have a dozen people around the world

09:54.720 --> 09:56.040
who are working on this.

09:56.040 --> 09:57.360
We have a fix.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.800
We're kind of narrowing in on the exact circumstance,

09:59.800 --> 10:02.000
because you had to have a certain version of core utils,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.640
you had to have a certain version of ZFS on Linux,

10:05.640 --> 10:09.320
and you had to be doing a certain kind of copy of new files.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.680
This didn't impact existing files.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.840
And some people had to test, like, does it matter

10:14.840 --> 10:15.680
if I'm in a mirror?

10:15.680 --> 10:17.880
Does it matter if I'm in a RAID, you know, whatever?

10:17.880 --> 10:19.840
Like, all this different testing had to happen,

10:19.840 --> 10:22.480
but you can watch, we'll have a link in the show notes,

10:22.480 --> 10:23.920
you can watch them work through this

10:23.920 --> 10:26.320
over the process of days as they narrow it down.

10:26.320 --> 10:30.360
I asked Alan, like, what triggered this upstream change

10:30.360 --> 10:34.120
in ZFS that accidentally triggered this zap limit?

10:34.120 --> 10:36.280
And he says, well, they were actually just trying

10:36.280 --> 10:39.160
to make some changes to how it all worked

10:39.160 --> 10:40.880
on a case-insensitive file system.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.520
Yeah, optimizing for a totally different case.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.000
Yeah, and then that's what caused all of this.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.520
And it really shows you what a house of cards all of this is.

10:49.520 --> 10:53.240
So the moral of the story is, if you're on Gentoo or CentOS

10:53.240 --> 10:56.480
or Scientific Linux or Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

10:56.480 --> 11:01.480
you need to either be on ZFS 7.6 or ZFS 7.8,

11:01.800 --> 11:03.160
and you won't have this issue.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.880
So that's my breakdown of it.

11:04.880 --> 11:06.880
Unfortunately, there's really no other coverage of this,

11:06.880 --> 11:09.480
so I can't link you to, like, a Ferronix post

11:09.480 --> 11:10.560
or anything like that.

11:10.560 --> 11:11.840
This is it.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.640
We had to do the original reporting on this for you,

11:13.640 --> 11:16.200
but all of the information, including a better description

11:16.200 --> 11:18.640
and quotes from Alan Jude, are in the show notes.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.560
If this impacts you, if you're using this in production,

11:21.560 --> 11:26.560
just go to linuxunplug.com slash 244 for that information.

11:26.560 --> 11:29.760
I mean, it says a lot that this is the first thing

11:29.760 --> 11:31.400
of this scale we've seen for a long time

11:31.400 --> 11:34.000
with our handy-dandy friends in ZFS.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.320
The other thing that was really fascinating

11:35.320 --> 11:37.120
is because all of this is on GitHub,

11:37.120 --> 11:40.400
so all of the GitHub utilities are immediately put into play.

11:40.400 --> 11:43.080
Like, they're finding the exact commits,

11:43.080 --> 11:44.520
like, they have the code highlighted,

11:44.520 --> 11:45.600
they're linking everybody to it.

11:45.600 --> 11:46.760
It is fascinating to watch.

11:46.760 --> 11:48.600
Yeah, everybody's on the same page.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.440
So you can say a lot of things about GitHub

11:50.440 --> 11:55.440
and about open source projects being on a commercial platform.

11:55.560 --> 11:57.240
Boy, was that useful, tracking this thing down.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.720
You could really see how the team was just busting

11:59.720 --> 12:01.960
through this at a breakneck pace, figuring it out.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.640
And then to really see Richard Yao,

12:03.640 --> 12:05.680
just to mention to Richard Yao,

12:05.680 --> 12:09.120
who is really just tackling this thing.

12:09.120 --> 12:12.800
He's just being a real leader in this situation,

12:12.800 --> 12:15.720
and he's going to the Hacker News and Reddit comment threads

12:15.720 --> 12:17.560
and he's answering sysadmin's questions

12:17.560 --> 12:19.280
that are in there saying, so this is my scenario.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.400
Do I need to worry about this?

12:20.400 --> 12:23.280
And he's specifically addressing their exact questions

12:23.280 --> 12:25.280
while he's working around the clock

12:25.280 --> 12:28.520
to help the team get the patch together, so.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.560
It's impressive.

12:29.560 --> 12:33.000
It's unfortunate, and it shows you that even things like ZFS

12:33.000 --> 12:36.720
are not, you know, infallible.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.560
And of course, Alan had to get a dig in there

12:38.560 --> 12:39.960
that it only affects Linux.

12:39.960 --> 12:43.280
Of course.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.440
You're welcome, Alan.

12:44.440 --> 12:45.520
I made that into the show.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.600
Anyway, so if you're running ZFS on Linux,

12:47.600 --> 12:48.440
you need to know about that.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.280
We wanted to let you know.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.960
Just a little bit of heads up here on the Unplugged program.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.200
And we got links to everything in the show notes

12:54.200 --> 12:58.240
if you want to see the whole thing or where the exact,

12:58.240 --> 12:59.880
I'm showing it on the screen right now, that exact,

12:59.880 --> 13:01.240
right there, right there, that's it.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.160
Oh, don't do it, no.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.040
I know, that's it.

13:03.040 --> 13:04.720
Now everybody's been infected, Wes.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.200
Oh no!

13:06.200 --> 13:08.280
Oh wait, it doesn't work like that at all.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.880
But you know what does work like that?

13:09.880 --> 13:12.240
An idea, an idea like Ting.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.120
That's right, linux.ting.com.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.760
Go there and get $25 off a Ting device

13:16.760 --> 13:19.120
or $25 in service credit.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.080
That'll probably pay for more than your first month.

13:21.080 --> 13:24.200
I brought over one of those old EVO 4Gs,

13:24.200 --> 13:26.720
you know, the ones that had, what was it?

13:26.720 --> 13:27.920
WiMAX.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.240
WiMAX, yeah.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.400
And I was like, I had no use for this thing.

13:32.400 --> 13:33.920
So I brought that over to Ting and I'm like,

13:33.920 --> 13:34.760
all right, well, you know what?

13:34.760 --> 13:36.200
We'll give you $25 in service credit.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.560
I'm like, wait, what, really?

13:37.560 --> 13:38.680
Like, yeah, just put it on that device

13:38.680 --> 13:39.840
and see what you think for a month.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.880
And you know, I'm like, a month?

13:42.880 --> 13:43.720
All right.

13:43.720 --> 13:45.760
At the end of the month, I hadn't even used all $25.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.000
And I was like, oh, oh, I get it.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.160
I get it now.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.320
And you can too, linux.ting.com.

13:51.320 --> 13:52.400
It's smarter than unlimited.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.240
If you use less, you pay less.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.480
$6 a month for your line.

13:57.480 --> 14:00.320
Then your minutes, your messages, and your megabytes.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.720
Whatever you use, that's what you pay.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.720
And they have a nationwide networks, GSM and CDMA,

14:05.720 --> 14:07.920
no contracts, no other termination fees.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.240
That's what I love about Ting.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.040
And you're in control all of the time

14:11.040 --> 14:12.920
from the control panel to the great customer service

14:12.920 --> 14:15.480
or if you wanna use CDMA or GSM.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.520
And because they support both networks,

14:17.520 --> 14:19.160
you probably wanna check their BYOD page.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.080
They probably support a device you already have

14:21.080 --> 14:22.360
and then you can really save some money.

14:22.360 --> 14:25.200
But if you don't wanna use an old device,

14:25.200 --> 14:26.680
you wanna get something new,

14:26.680 --> 14:29.160
they got a sale going right now on those motos,

14:29.160 --> 14:31.560
those moto devices, like three or four different

14:31.560 --> 14:33.960
moto devices that are really nice.

14:33.960 --> 14:34.800
So go check those out,

14:34.800 --> 14:36.960
cause those are great value and it's no contract

14:36.960 --> 14:38.520
and you're just paying for what you use.

14:38.520 --> 14:39.760
linux.ting.com.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.720
You go there to support the show,

14:41.720 --> 14:43.960
get the $25 in either service credit

14:43.960 --> 14:47.880
or off a hardware device, which that's a great deal.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.360
And then you're good to go.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.120
You start going and you see, you know what?

14:51.120 --> 14:52.600
This is a totally different way to do mobile.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.440
You'll see it.

14:53.440 --> 14:57.320
And it's like the veil has been lifted,

14:57.320 --> 14:58.440
you're woke all of a sudden.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.160
You're staying woke over at Ting.

15:01.760 --> 15:02.840
They gotta take that.

15:02.840 --> 15:04.080
They stay woke at Ting.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.520
linux.ting.com.

15:06.520 --> 15:08.680
A big thank you to Ting for sponsoring the Unplugged program

15:08.680 --> 15:11.000
and go check it out because it's really,

15:11.000 --> 15:12.320
it's a totally different way to do mobile.

15:12.320 --> 15:13.680
It's a better way to do mobile

15:13.680 --> 15:15.960
if they had to hit the reset button today.

15:15.960 --> 15:16.880
That's how they do it.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.680
linux.ting.com.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.520
My millennials, stay woke.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.280
So go check it out.

15:23.280 --> 15:26.880
All right, so Mr. Daniel Foray, as he is one to do,

15:26.880 --> 15:29.720
joins us here on the show, which we always love having him.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.680
And this week he talks about something

15:32.680 --> 15:33.920
that's near and dear to my heart,

15:33.920 --> 15:36.280
because you've often, if you've listened to this show

15:36.280 --> 15:38.560
or Linux Action News, you may have heard Joe say,

15:38.560 --> 15:40.640
Chris, you ought to just use XFCE.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.120
Oh, you having some plasma problems?

15:42.120 --> 15:43.160
I feel bad for you, son.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.720
Oh, gnome's getting a little weird on you?

15:44.720 --> 15:45.640
I feel bad for you, son.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.440
You ought to just use XFCE.

15:47.440 --> 15:51.600
And I'll sit here and go, Joe, I don't want to use the damn XFCE.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.160
I'd rather go back to the 90s.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.080
So this is a conversation that happens all the time.

15:56.080 --> 16:00.640
And part of my reluctance to go to i3,

16:00.640 --> 16:05.040
which is great, or XFCE, which is fantastic,

16:05.040 --> 16:07.880
but my personal reluctance, it's just

16:07.880 --> 16:09.840
this dumb thing of somebody I think

16:09.840 --> 16:12.760
that's unique to somebody that's probably my age

16:12.760 --> 16:18.920
or around my age, and that when I started using computers,

16:18.920 --> 16:21.720
you could only run one application at a time.

16:21.720 --> 16:25.080
My first computer got hooked up to a television.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.680
I put cartridges in my first computer,

16:27.680 --> 16:29.840
and it could do one thing at a time.

16:29.840 --> 16:34.120
It was delightful when I could make the damn thing beep.

16:34.120 --> 16:40.240
So I've just been through a lot of iterations of the shit pile

16:40.240 --> 16:42.680
that we call modern technology.

16:42.680 --> 16:45.920
And I've been through a lot of promises

16:45.920 --> 16:48.120
about the next great thing that's

16:48.120 --> 16:50.760
just around the corner that's going to finally make

16:50.760 --> 16:53.720
the computer better and finally make it user friendly.

16:53.720 --> 16:58.520
And I've been listening to that promise since I could read,

16:58.520 --> 17:00.680
since I could take in information.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.920
I am just at a point in my life where

17:03.920 --> 17:09.900
I'm done with computers being below a certain standard.

17:09.900 --> 17:11.480
And it doesn't mean I'm a Mac user

17:11.480 --> 17:14.160
or I'm some Windows 10 power user

17:14.160 --> 17:15.680
writing PowerShell scripts.

17:15.680 --> 17:19.480
It just simply means I've been through iterations

17:19.480 --> 17:22.800
of this entire industry now.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.600
And I've gotten to a point where I just

17:24.600 --> 17:27.520
expect a certain standard of living on my desktop

17:27.520 --> 17:28.800
environment.

17:28.800 --> 17:32.000
And it's not that I couldn't make do and go camping in XFCE

17:32.000 --> 17:34.960
and be totally fine with a weekend in I3.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.600
It's simply if I'm going to build a home

17:37.600 --> 17:40.960
and I'm going to live there, I got a certain standard.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.560
Because it's where I live.

17:42.560 --> 17:47.000
And it's just XFCE, I3, these other desktop environments

17:47.000 --> 17:50.560
are simply unappealing to me in that regard.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.520
It's nothing about the excellence of the projects,

17:53.520 --> 17:56.080
the functionality that they serve for other individuals.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.640
It has no statement on your use of them.

17:58.640 --> 18:01.960
It's simply my esoteric preferences

18:01.960 --> 18:04.280
as somebody who has gone through the life experiences

18:04.280 --> 18:05.320
that I have.

18:05.320 --> 18:09.180
So I am really at a point where if it's not

18:09.180 --> 18:11.800
of a certain standard that's my own personal standard,

18:11.800 --> 18:13.240
I'm not interested.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.000
And that's why I'm on Plasma right now.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.760
That's why I stayed on GNOME 3 for a really long time.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.640
And it's why I follow the elementary project

18:20.640 --> 18:22.240
with keen interest.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.660
And they really kind of hit my note this week

18:24.660 --> 18:27.440
when they started talking about improving

18:27.440 --> 18:29.640
the look of the applications and start

18:29.640 --> 18:32.960
talking about building the next generation of applications

18:32.960 --> 18:34.080
for their Linux desktop.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.160
And this is something that they've been working on

18:36.160 --> 18:37.560
for over seven years.

18:37.560 --> 18:40.120
And they've introduced multiple generations.

18:40.120 --> 18:42.760
And it's really something to see.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.520
So I'm going to put a link in the show notes

18:44.520 --> 18:47.300
to encourage you to go look at the screenshots.

18:47.300 --> 18:50.040
Because visually, it's, again, one of these posts

18:50.040 --> 18:52.460
where you could just really see the progress visually.

18:52.460 --> 18:55.040
But there's so much more than just the visual aspects of it.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.360
So Dan is joining us.

18:56.360 --> 18:58.960
And I loved this post, Dan, because you start out

18:58.960 --> 19:01.320
with Generation 1, which is really

19:01.320 --> 19:03.920
the first version of an elementary OS,

19:03.920 --> 19:05.900
like the best shot for a new team.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.160
And they were pretty good.

19:07.160 --> 19:10.040
I think maybe that's where some of the early criticism

19:10.040 --> 19:11.480
about design copying came from.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.240
But GTK2 was limited.

19:13.240 --> 19:14.920
And you could only get so far.

19:14.920 --> 19:19.040
But now in 2018, we're in a totally different place.

19:19.040 --> 19:22.760
One of the things that I think is kind of central to the story

19:22.760 --> 19:24.760
that I wanted to present in this post

19:24.760 --> 19:27.160
is that when we first started out,

19:27.160 --> 19:30.320
we didn't really know how to be a good code shop.

19:30.320 --> 19:33.640
And we actually went to the Ubuntu Developer Summit.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.440
And we wanted to pitch some of our apps

19:35.440 --> 19:37.720
for being included in Ubuntu.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.160
And one of the Unity developers kind of sat us down

19:40.160 --> 19:41.240
and gave us a talk.

19:41.240 --> 19:45.160
And he was like, hey, listen, you guys are bad at coding.

19:45.160 --> 19:48.200
And he told us all the things we were doing wrong

19:48.200 --> 19:49.920
and how to step up our game.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.640
And we came back from that.

19:51.640 --> 19:54.880
And we picked a standard language.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.940
We created code style guides.

19:56.940 --> 19:58.680
We started doing code reviews.

19:58.680 --> 20:00.280
We started getting really serious

20:00.280 --> 20:04.920
about the quality of the code that goes into our applications

20:04.920 --> 20:08.440
and not just what goes on top as far as design.

20:08.440 --> 20:11.760
Yeah, and boy, do I appreciate that as an end user.

20:11.760 --> 20:19.160
That's why I did this whole setup is I think this is the solution

20:19.160 --> 20:22.240
to the problem where I've seen these promises over and over

20:22.240 --> 20:23.000
again.

20:23.000 --> 20:26.000
And then we do these hard resets,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.120
or we have these big focus changes.

20:28.120 --> 20:30.460
And what is clear now, especially

20:30.460 --> 20:32.160
as we're getting close to the next release

20:32.160 --> 20:33.880
of elementary OSes, you guys have really

20:33.880 --> 20:36.720
been on a trajectory where I'd say it's refining focus over

20:36.720 --> 20:37.680
and over again.

20:37.680 --> 20:41.040
And you could definitely see it in Gen 2 of your applications.

20:41.040 --> 20:41.960
They're solid looking.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.880
They're GTK3 by Freya.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.040
Is that true?

20:45.040 --> 20:46.240
Yep.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.940
So you give us some hints where things are going.

20:48.940 --> 20:52.200
So where do we go in Gen 2 to Gen 3?

20:52.200 --> 20:53.920
What kind of is the next thing that we

20:53.920 --> 20:56.360
might see in future versions of elementary OS

20:56.360 --> 20:57.640
that may not yet be released?

20:57.640 --> 20:59.360
Where is this going?

20:59.360 --> 21:01.080
So one of the big things that happened

21:01.080 --> 21:03.480
is we came out with App Center.

21:03.480 --> 21:06.400
And when we did that, a focus for us

21:06.400 --> 21:09.120
was making sure we had a lot of automated tests in place

21:09.120 --> 21:11.520
so that when developers submit their applications,

21:11.520 --> 21:13.360
we could run them through these tests

21:13.360 --> 21:15.480
and get their apps published very quickly.

21:15.480 --> 21:19.000
And when we did that, we kind of set a set of standards

21:19.000 --> 21:21.320
for them as far as naming.

21:21.320 --> 21:25.440
We forced developers to use the reverse domain name notation

21:25.440 --> 21:30.920
so that, for example, their binaries and the names of files

21:30.920 --> 21:34.400
like.desktop files or AppStream data files

21:34.400 --> 21:40.680
all follow this RDNN notation, where it's like com.github.username.

21:40.680 --> 21:42.320
So what's the benefit there?

21:42.320 --> 21:45.400
That sounds good, but what's the benefit?

21:45.400 --> 21:47.540
So the point of this is to ensure

21:47.540 --> 21:50.360
that we don't have any sort of naming conflicts,

21:50.360 --> 21:53.600
not only when developers are publishing their applications

21:53.600 --> 21:56.240
on elementary OS, but also when we're talking

21:56.240 --> 21:58.360
about upstreams, repackaging.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.520
Yeah, I bet.

21:59.520 --> 22:02.840
And this is something that the GNOME team has embraced as well,

22:02.840 --> 22:05.960
and it's pretty common on Android and other platforms

22:05.960 --> 22:06.920
like that.

22:06.920 --> 22:09.680
So we're going to a point where not only are we

22:09.680 --> 22:12.580
enforcing this for all of our third-party applications,

22:12.580 --> 22:15.560
but we want to practice what we tell other people to do.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.520
And so all of our first-party applications

22:17.520 --> 22:19.960
are going to be using RDNN from now on as well.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.520
Can you expand on that a bit?

22:21.520 --> 22:24.000
So you're working with GNOME, or it's kind of the same thing,

22:24.000 --> 22:25.360
or what's that about?

22:25.360 --> 22:28.000
I think it's more of just kind of a de facto standard

22:28.000 --> 22:30.160
that everybody's moving towards as we realize

22:30.160 --> 22:34.160
that we want to have this world eventually where we're shipping

22:34.160 --> 22:36.440
not just like a few thousand applications,

22:36.440 --> 22:39.160
but where we have millions of applications, right?

22:39.160 --> 22:42.700
And in order to get to that world with the constraints

22:42.700 --> 22:44.960
of file-based package managing, we

22:44.960 --> 22:46.600
have to make sure that these files do not

22:46.600 --> 22:49.200
conflict with each other.

22:49.200 --> 22:53.520
Well, I'm glad you're thinking about it, that's for sure.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.800
The hype train, it's successful, this one.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.040
I mean, just think of it.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.520
I got a machine that's destined for this.

23:00.520 --> 23:01.720
I think that's the case.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.880
Well, Dan, is there anything else we should mention?

23:03.880 --> 23:05.480
Well, real quick, I do want to plug

23:05.480 --> 23:06.800
that there's a bunch of other stuff

23:06.800 --> 23:08.520
that we talk about that people can check out

23:08.520 --> 23:11.080
in the article, which you said will be in the show notes.

23:11.080 --> 23:15.320
But I want to make a point that our continuous integration

23:15.320 --> 23:17.800
suite that we've developed for App Center,

23:17.800 --> 23:21.160
we're now making it available as something

23:21.160 --> 23:23.840
that you can run through Travis CI on your own projects.

23:23.840 --> 23:26.760
So anybody can use this full testing suite

23:26.760 --> 23:29.320
that elementary is working on, even if you're not planning

23:29.320 --> 23:30.320
to publish in App Center.

23:30.320 --> 23:31.600
Thank you for mentioning that.

23:31.600 --> 23:32.440
That's great.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.280
Yeah, no kidding.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.040
That's totally worth it.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.320
We were just talking about Travis CI.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.840
That's so cool.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.120
Yeah, all right, so that's good.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.640
That's definitely great, so check that out.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.840
The link, like you said, is in the show notes.

23:43.840 --> 23:47.040
And now I want to just kind of, just

23:47.040 --> 23:51.960
from a big picture perspective, how do you, as a project,

23:51.960 --> 23:54.120
how do you feel like, yep, this stuff is ready to go.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.240
You must have a lot of people besides yourself testing this,

23:56.240 --> 23:59.120
maybe a small group, 10 people, 1,000 people.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.960
How does the beta process work for elementary OS?

24:01.960 --> 24:05.760
Yeah, so right now, we're kind of in a pre-release state

24:05.760 --> 24:09.880
where we just have some builds that we're running internally.

24:09.880 --> 24:11.760
And we just publish those on our Slack

24:11.760 --> 24:14.600
channel, which has a little over 100 people in it,

24:14.600 --> 24:16.400
I think, right now.

24:16.400 --> 24:19.840
And so we've got a small group of just developers testing.

24:19.840 --> 24:23.800
We have projects up on GitHub, which you can actually see.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.080
It's a public project where we're tracking regressions

24:26.080 --> 24:27.440
and things like that.

24:27.440 --> 24:30.160
And so once we get through those tasks

24:30.160 --> 24:32.880
and we feel like we've handled all the regressions we

24:32.880 --> 24:35.480
know about, then we'll go to public beta.

24:35.480 --> 24:38.000
And that'll be an open public beta anybody can download.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.360
And then we'll figure out from there

24:40.360 --> 24:41.880
how much we have left to do before we

24:41.880 --> 24:43.480
can do final release.

24:43.480 --> 24:44.800
I'm excited to hear that.

24:44.800 --> 24:45.680
Well, neat.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.880
Well, thank you for coming on and explaining this.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.480
I like the fact that you guys.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.120
So it's called FlightCheck.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.760
Is that what it's called?

24:53.760 --> 24:55.760
So that's the name of the component.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.960
The full application is called Houston.

24:58.960 --> 24:59.920
Houston.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.520
Yeah.

25:01.520 --> 25:02.320
Love it.

25:02.320 --> 25:05.400
And so this part, we're calling it Houston CI.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.320
OK.

25:06.320 --> 25:07.160
That's great.

25:07.160 --> 25:08.660
And you're making it available for anybody

25:08.660 --> 25:10.540
if they want to integrate into their projects.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.120
That's so cool.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.800
And this is all regular open source standard stuff.

25:14.800 --> 25:18.800
Like this checks, validates metadata for.desktop files

25:18.800 --> 25:20.000
and app data files.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.000
And it does a lot of good open source citizen stuff.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.600
And we're looking to integrate tests

25:24.600 --> 25:26.280
that other platforms use.

25:26.280 --> 25:29.440
Like the Debian maintainers have a good set of tests

25:29.440 --> 25:31.080
that they use for packages.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.000
So we really want to make sure this is all

25:33.000 --> 25:34.800
open source standard stuff.

25:34.800 --> 25:35.640
That's fantastic.

25:35.640 --> 25:36.400
Yeah.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.440
And it's using computers for what they're good at,

25:38.440 --> 25:39.560
which I'm always a fan of.

25:39.560 --> 25:40.980
It's like, might as well if you can.

25:40.980 --> 25:42.980
If you can have some of this stuff tested for you

25:42.980 --> 25:46.440
statically, even if it doesn't replace actual testing,

25:46.440 --> 25:47.680
it's just another data point.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.320
And it's pretty valuable.

25:49.320 --> 25:50.200
It's good to hear.

25:50.200 --> 25:50.740
That's good to hear.

25:50.740 --> 25:51.240
All right.

25:51.240 --> 26:00.480
Well, last week, we may have reported too soon.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.640
Steam machines were dead.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.680
Although I'm actually not sure it's not the case,

26:03.680 --> 26:05.420
in my personal opinion.

26:05.420 --> 26:09.560
But Valve took to the web after last week's episode

26:09.560 --> 26:12.240
and said, we've noticed that what started out

26:12.240 --> 26:15.360
as a routine cleanup of our Steam store, where we removed

26:15.360 --> 26:18.560
all links to Steam Machines, all references to Steam Machines

26:18.560 --> 26:22.400
and SteamOS, and buried them, we noticed that some of you

26:22.400 --> 26:23.640
interpreted that incorrectly.

26:23.640 --> 26:27.240
I may have editorialized it a little bit.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.200
Wrote a little bit, yeah.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.240
I may have a little bit of editorializing.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.320
But while it's true Steam Machines aren't exactly

26:32.320 --> 26:34.240
flying off the shelves, Reed, we haven't sold any

26:34.240 --> 26:36.120
for the last couple of months, our reasons

26:36.120 --> 26:38.520
for striving towards a competitive and open gaming

26:38.520 --> 26:42.920
platform haven't significantly changed, Reed.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.600
We're working on fundamentals.

26:44.600 --> 26:48.360
We've taken a lot of feedback and have been heads down

26:48.360 --> 26:50.880
on addressing the shortcomings we've observed.

26:50.880 --> 26:53.480
Reed, Linux was a bit of a dumpster fire.

26:53.480 --> 26:54.000
Nap.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
Taking a nap, for sure.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.260
And we think an important part of that effort

26:58.260 --> 27:02.080
is our ongoing investment in making Vulkan a competitive

27:02.080 --> 27:04.820
and well-supported graphics API, as well as making sure

27:04.820 --> 27:06.920
it has first class support on those platforms.

27:06.920 --> 27:07.620
I think that's great.

27:07.620 --> 27:08.880
I completely think that's great.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.600
I think that is true.

27:10.600 --> 27:14.460
And they say now, here's the part that got my attention.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.160
Tell me what you think about this, Wes.

27:16.160 --> 27:17.800
You ready for this one?

27:17.800 --> 27:19.280
They go on about how we're continuing

27:19.280 --> 27:22.560
to invest significant resources in Vulkan ecosystem and stuff.

27:22.560 --> 27:25.480
But then they just throw this in as one sentence.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.480
It's not even a complete sentence.

27:27.480 --> 27:33.960
They say, we also have other Linux initiatives in the pipe

27:33.960 --> 27:36.360
that we're not quite ready to talk about yet.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.040
Fascinating.

27:38.040 --> 27:38.960
What does that mean?

27:38.960 --> 27:40.000
What now?

27:40.000 --> 27:44.840
We have other Linux initiatives in the pipe.

27:44.840 --> 27:45.960
Not the pipeline, the pipe.

27:45.960 --> 27:47.040
The pipe, yep.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.720
That we're not quite ready to talk about yet.

27:48.720 --> 27:49.560
Maybe they're stuck in the pipe.

27:49.560 --> 27:50.660
That's why they can't talk about them.

27:50.660 --> 27:52.120
They need to get them out of the pipe.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.240
I think it's VR on Linux.

27:53.240 --> 27:54.320
That's what it seems like, right?

27:54.320 --> 27:56.000
I mean, what else could it be?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.380
Does anybody else in the Mamba room

27:57.380 --> 28:00.800
have speculation on what might be in Valve's pipe?

28:00.800 --> 28:03.960
What could be in Valve's pipe that's regarding Linux?

28:03.960 --> 28:06.760
It's not SteamOS, it's not Vulkan,

28:06.760 --> 28:10.080
it's not the Steam client, it's not the Steam controller.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.840
Steam TV.

28:15.840 --> 28:17.440
Maybe.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.160
Steam Kodi?

28:19.160 --> 28:21.160
I would so be down for that.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.500
If SteamOS could be Kodi, basically,

28:23.500 --> 28:26.560
with SteamOS, Steam integration, that

28:26.560 --> 28:29.520
would be such a product for me.

28:29.520 --> 28:32.160
Halfpipe 3.

28:32.160 --> 28:33.800
All right, so nobody's got any ideas.

28:33.800 --> 28:36.280
You guys are no good.

28:36.280 --> 28:37.360
What a mystery.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.960
It is a bit of a mystery.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.480
What would Valve have in their pipe?

28:40.480 --> 28:43.440
So let us know, linuxunplug.com slash contact,

28:43.440 --> 28:47.760
and send us in your ideas for what might be in Valve's pipe.

28:47.760 --> 28:49.100
I don't know.

28:49.100 --> 28:51.680
I'm thinking it's VR or AR.

28:51.680 --> 28:55.240
And sort of as a related note, screw you 32-bit users.

28:55.240 --> 28:58.020
NVIDIA is giving you the middle finger this time

28:58.020 --> 29:00.800
and is ending support for 32-bit OSes.

29:00.800 --> 29:04.880
It's not just Linux users, it's everybody.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.960
So it's equal screwing.

29:06.960 --> 29:09.160
The times, they aren't a-changin'.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.040
Yeah, they're going to halt GeForce GPU driver

29:11.040 --> 29:12.680
support at the end of April, meaning

29:12.680 --> 29:15.640
users will lose access to new GeForce experience

29:15.640 --> 29:17.840
features and game updates.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.840
But more importantly, and you got a little more runway

29:20.840 --> 29:25.800
on this one, NVIDIA will end security updates January 2019.

29:25.800 --> 29:30.640
So you can continue to use your 32-bit OS with a GeForce card

29:30.640 --> 29:33.240
at least until 2019 and get security updates.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.400
And then really, in theory, you could keep running it

29:35.400 --> 29:36.480
probably for a lot longer.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.580
It's just there's going to be security things

29:38.580 --> 29:40.560
that they won't fix, like, I don't know,

29:40.560 --> 29:41.640
new versions of Spectre.

29:41.640 --> 29:44.200
I'm not sure what that would be, I guess.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.520
I mean, what kind of security?

29:45.520 --> 29:46.680
Actually, I take that back.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.100
Now that I think about TechSnap, there's

29:48.100 --> 29:51.160
been a few stories where NVIDIA drivers have been involved,

29:51.160 --> 29:55.080
including even running cryptoware on the NVIDIA GPU.

29:55.080 --> 29:58.000
Oh, no.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.120
Yeah, but Wes and I were just talking

30:00.120 --> 30:02.280
about all kinds of speculative execution attacks

30:02.280 --> 30:03.600
on the TechSnap program.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.280
That'll be coming out later this week,

30:05.280 --> 30:09.440
TechSnap.systems slash 363, I think it was, if you want to.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.240
I think you're right.

30:10.240 --> 30:10.760
Yeah.

30:10.760 --> 30:12.920
And speculative execution, turns out,

30:12.920 --> 30:15.240
is going to be a fun bag for lots of people.

30:15.240 --> 30:18.040
And we talk about some of the new exploits in that episode.

30:18.040 --> 30:19.860
So let's now talk about DigitalOcean,

30:19.860 --> 30:21.320
our sponsor for this week's episode

30:21.320 --> 30:22.720
of the Unplugged program.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.680
DigitalOcean is what I use for a lot of our back

30:24.680 --> 30:25.640
end infrastructure.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.520
We're recording portions of the show using DigitalOcean.

30:28.520 --> 30:31.780
We're streaming portions of the show using DigitalOcean.

30:31.780 --> 30:33.880
In fact, the bot that manages our titles

30:33.880 --> 30:35.080
is using DigitalOcean, Wes.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.200
It sure is.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.280
Talk about jog foodin'.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.320
Yeah, we really do.

30:38.320 --> 30:40.520
And it's because it's great infrastructure.

30:40.520 --> 30:42.880
You can deploy in seconds, and it's super fast.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.880
You can develop locally and deploy globally.

30:45.880 --> 30:50.600
DigitalOcean, go to do.co slash unplug to get a limited 60

30:50.600 --> 30:51.400
days.

30:51.400 --> 30:53.760
But yet, it's kind of great.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.400
$100 credit.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.480
I can't believe I even get to say that.

30:57.480 --> 31:01.440
You have to go to that URL, do.co slash unplugged.

31:01.440 --> 31:04.000
That arms your web browser with the knowledge

31:04.000 --> 31:05.520
of the $100 deal.

31:05.520 --> 31:08.160
Once you create a new account, you get the $100 deal.

31:08.160 --> 31:11.040
I think you might have to have a legit credit card on file,

31:11.040 --> 31:13.120
although I don't know if that's actually true.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.840
But you do get the $100 credit if you

31:14.840 --> 31:17.360
go to the do.co slash unplugged, and it's a new account.

31:17.360 --> 31:20.460
You create the account, and then you can really play around.

31:20.460 --> 31:24.200
Because really, my favorite system is $0.03 an hour.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.400
And so when you think about $100,

31:26.400 --> 31:29.720
I mean, you could really try out their new high CPU droplet.

31:29.720 --> 31:32.240
You could be like Westpain and be spinning up VPN systems.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.240
All the time.

31:33.240 --> 31:34.040
What's the last?

31:34.040 --> 31:36.120
Do you remember the last droplet you created?

31:36.120 --> 31:38.200
It's got to be sometime earlier this week.

31:38.200 --> 31:38.880
I know.

31:38.880 --> 31:39.640
I know.

31:39.640 --> 31:42.640
We'll be sitting here discussing an idea for the Tech Snapshow,

31:42.640 --> 31:44.880
and we'll be like, well, let's go spin up a droplet

31:44.880 --> 31:46.240
and try that real quick.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.200
It's like, OK.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.200
That's a great idea.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.960
And that's what I love about it, because it's so fast.

31:50.960 --> 31:54.000
They have a really easy to use web interface,

31:54.000 --> 31:57.160
a super straightforward, well-documented API,

31:57.160 --> 32:00.040
and then just tons of well-constructed documentation

32:00.040 --> 32:03.760
on top of that to make it easy for beginners or experts

32:03.760 --> 32:05.480
to go all the way with DigitalOcean.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.760
You can deploy a single bare Linux rig

32:07.760 --> 32:09.800
or an entire application stack.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.280
They have tutorials.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.880
They have a lot of community meetups, surprisingly.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.380
That's a big thing I never actually

32:15.380 --> 32:17.000
have mentioned about DigitalOcean,

32:17.000 --> 32:19.360
is there is a large meetup community.

32:19.360 --> 32:20.240
Seattle has some.

32:20.240 --> 32:21.640
Wow, I had no idea.

32:21.640 --> 32:22.800
Yeah, it's a big thing.

32:22.800 --> 32:23.320
Fantastic.

32:23.320 --> 32:24.120
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.840
There's all kinds of neat things about DigitalOcean.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.120
We only get to touch on parts of them,

32:27.120 --> 32:29.520
like the fact that they provide back-end infrastructure

32:29.520 --> 32:30.920
for tons of the open source projects

32:30.920 --> 32:32.640
that we talk about here on this very show.

32:32.640 --> 32:33.960
And of course, the fact that they're

32:33.960 --> 32:37.120
supporting, for a long time now, this crazy Linux

32:37.120 --> 32:39.340
podcast that's barely structured that just talks

32:39.340 --> 32:40.960
about frickin' Linux things.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.760
I mean, that's just kind of great in itself.

32:42.760 --> 32:47.160
Go to do.co slash unplugged to get the $100 credit,

32:47.160 --> 32:48.680
and then play around.

32:48.680 --> 32:51.180
Try out their flexible droplets where you can mix and match

32:51.180 --> 32:51.680
resources.

32:51.680 --> 32:52.560
It's pretty cool.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.920
Do.co slash unplugged.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.280
And a big thank you to DigitalOcean

32:56.280 --> 33:00.000
for sponsoring this here humble Linux program.

33:00.000 --> 33:04.020
So prominent Ubuntu community developer, Mr. Simon Quigley,

33:04.020 --> 33:08.440
has joined us in the Mumble Room to talk about his proposal

33:08.440 --> 33:14.020
to dramatically change the release cycle of Ubuntu's

33:14.020 --> 33:16.760
early builds, like the alphas and the betas.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.900
So Mr. Simon, Mr. Prominent Ubuntu developer community,

33:19.900 --> 33:21.720
thank you for joining us on the show today, sir.

33:21.720 --> 33:23.760
Actually, very much thank you for making the time.

33:23.760 --> 33:24.760
I do appreciate it.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.100
But what is the Quigley proposal?

33:26.100 --> 33:28.760
Because Feronix tells me it's going to fundamentally change

33:28.760 --> 33:33.160
the way beta releases work for Ubuntu, and I'm intrigued.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.840
So right now, the way that milestones

33:34.840 --> 33:39.020
work in Ubuntu, we have two alpha releases,

33:39.020 --> 33:41.880
and we have two beta releases.

33:41.880 --> 33:45.320
So the alpha 1 and the alpha 2, the first alpha 1

33:45.320 --> 33:50.080
comes a couple months after the release cycle opens up.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.720
Then a month after that, typically, is alpha 2,

33:52.720 --> 33:55.160
and then there's a beta 1, and then a final beta.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.080
And then from there, we get release candidates

33:57.080 --> 33:59.600
and that sort of thing, and actually go into the release.

33:59.600 --> 34:03.000
So with this proposal, as of right now,

34:03.000 --> 34:07.200
Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server,

34:07.200 --> 34:10.360
they do not participate in the first two alphas

34:10.360 --> 34:11.560
and the first betas.

34:11.560 --> 34:15.160
So basically, they've been, for the past couple release cycles,

34:15.160 --> 34:19.120
not longer, they've been opt-in milestones.

34:19.120 --> 34:24.120
So the goal here is to just evaluate

34:24.120 --> 34:26.840
to see if these are still necessary,

34:26.840 --> 34:30.720
to see if these are still something that we need.

34:30.720 --> 34:35.280
So looking at the past release cycle,

34:35.280 --> 34:36.800
we didn't have alpha 1 and alpha 2

34:36.800 --> 34:40.280
because of the Spectre meltdown stuff.

34:40.280 --> 34:44.120
Beta 1, well, Ubuntu had some issues.

34:44.120 --> 34:48.080
Other flavors had a release, but otherwise, I looked at this.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.280
I looked at what happened during this release cycle,

34:50.280 --> 34:53.200
and I sort of analyzed to see what

34:53.200 --> 34:57.760
the benefit would be to taking these optional milestones away

34:57.760 --> 35:01.320
because, like I said, it's been optional,

35:01.320 --> 35:02.600
and flavors really drive these.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.440
So Ubuntu, Ubuntu Chillin, Ubuntu Monte usually

35:06.440 --> 35:09.320
comes in around beta 1, that sort of thing.

35:09.320 --> 35:13.920
So the goal here would be to just get rid of these milestones

35:13.920 --> 35:18.480
completely, and instead of having a release cycle where

35:18.480 --> 35:22.400
we have set release times, we would

35:22.400 --> 35:24.000
have a coordinated testing.

35:24.000 --> 35:29.040
Now, the advantages of this are with the milestone releases,

35:29.040 --> 35:34.400
it's basically you could pick any day in a month,

35:34.400 --> 35:38.360
and you could pick a daily out of that month's span

35:38.360 --> 35:43.520
of dailies, the ISO, and you could label that beta 1,

35:43.520 --> 35:45.840
and people would install that, but that's

35:45.840 --> 35:49.080
an image that's frozen in time, and that's a blessed image.

35:49.080 --> 35:51.520
But with the nature of Ubuntu release cycle,

35:51.520 --> 35:54.320
things go fast enough that the next day, you

35:54.320 --> 35:56.280
could have fixes.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.800
So if you install beta 1 on a system,

35:58.800 --> 36:01.080
you just update your system, and there's really

36:01.080 --> 36:04.240
no advantage to having it frozen in time ISO.

36:04.240 --> 36:07.040
So the main goal of this would be

36:07.040 --> 36:10.120
to also make things a little bit faster

36:10.120 --> 36:12.120
and make our automation a little bit better, because

36:12.120 --> 36:16.400
at the moment, after I made this proposal,

36:16.400 --> 36:18.000
someone followed up on the mailing list

36:18.000 --> 36:20.640
and said that Ubuntu Desktop and Server,

36:20.640 --> 36:23.120
while they don't participate in these initial milestones,

36:23.120 --> 36:24.760
they do have some automated testing.

36:24.760 --> 36:27.520
So they have some testing where it just

36:27.520 --> 36:32.320
does some smoke tests that the flavors would usually

36:32.320 --> 36:33.560
do manually.

36:33.560 --> 36:36.600
So it's just overall just looking

36:36.600 --> 36:39.880
at the different milestones that we do

36:39.880 --> 36:43.600
and making sure that what we do and what we spend our time on

36:43.600 --> 36:44.280
is useful.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.480
So the goal of the testing weeks would also

36:46.480 --> 36:49.440
be to coordinate everything together.

36:49.440 --> 36:51.800
And while you're not releasing something,

36:51.800 --> 36:54.880
it would also be an opportunity for flavors to announce changes

36:54.880 --> 36:57.640
that they are making in the dailies

36:57.640 --> 36:59.640
without actually having to release something.

36:59.640 --> 37:02.800
Yeah, I like this idea of the test week or test weeks,

37:02.800 --> 37:03.520
I suppose.

37:03.520 --> 37:05.080
That's pretty clever, and I think

37:05.080 --> 37:08.480
it's reminiscent of a hack fest in a way,

37:08.480 --> 37:10.120
but it's protracted a little bit.

37:10.120 --> 37:13.240
It's not quite as intense, and it sort of

37:13.240 --> 37:15.600
elicits community participation and gives people

37:15.600 --> 37:16.680
a time to focus.

37:16.680 --> 37:19.580
And it's also, in its very nature, kind of a reminder,

37:19.580 --> 37:21.080
hey, the next release is pretty close.

37:21.080 --> 37:23.000
This is kind of your last chance to make sure

37:23.000 --> 37:24.240
this thing's working right.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.320
I like that idea, Simon.

37:26.320 --> 37:29.120
And Michael Irobel liked it too, apparently,

37:29.120 --> 37:31.640
because he wrote it up and tossed it up on Ferronics.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.480
Seems like there's some decent reception so far.

37:33.480 --> 37:34.160
Yeah.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.680
Well, Simon, thank you for coming on and explaining it

37:35.680 --> 37:37.880
in your own words, because I really like it.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.600
When I hear your idea, and the other thing

37:39.600 --> 37:40.900
I like what you're doing about it

37:40.900 --> 37:43.000
is you're just kind of rethinking this process.

37:43.000 --> 37:46.040
I think it's one of those things that is just sort of easy.

37:46.040 --> 37:47.840
It's a decision that's been made,

37:47.840 --> 37:50.000
and let's just move on and just get the job done.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.160
And you're kind of revisiting something

37:52.160 --> 37:54.520
that's been assumed for a long time and going, well,

37:54.520 --> 37:55.480
why are we doing it this way?

37:55.480 --> 37:56.640
What if we did it this way?

37:56.640 --> 37:58.440
Right, and that was sort of the point of it,

37:58.440 --> 38:01.760
just to sort of see if we can improve anything.

38:01.760 --> 38:03.960
One other thing that I do want to mention is that,

38:03.960 --> 38:05.420
I don't think I mentioned before,

38:05.420 --> 38:08.480
is that it's the goal, because these are optional milestones,

38:08.480 --> 38:11.600
the goal would be for, in my proposal,

38:11.600 --> 38:13.520
the goal would be for desktop and server

38:13.520 --> 38:15.720
and everybody to participate in these testing weeks.

38:15.720 --> 38:18.980
So you would see, we would improve our automated testing,

38:18.980 --> 38:22.700
but we would also have a wide variety of flavors

38:22.700 --> 38:26.440
participating, rather than just a few people who feel like they

38:26.440 --> 38:29.360
have something to release, like two or three people

38:29.360 --> 38:33.040
release one blessed image, and then that's just put out there.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.480
No, the goal would be for everybody to participate,

38:35.480 --> 38:37.480
so we could all collaborate and we could all

38:37.480 --> 38:39.120
work together on that.

38:39.120 --> 38:40.640
I like that idea too, especially when

38:40.640 --> 38:42.560
you've got these different flavors now that are beginning

38:42.560 --> 38:44.760
more and more prominent, and more and more larger user

38:44.760 --> 38:47.360
bases, so their feedback on some of this would be.

38:47.360 --> 38:50.280
Get some critical mass and get some bugs fixed.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.160
Exactly.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.920
I have a question for you, Wes.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.440
What is your process?

38:54.440 --> 38:56.280
I mean, theoretically, I'm not saying

38:56.280 --> 38:58.360
that Wes Payne, the actual individual, does this,

38:58.360 --> 39:00.920
but Wes Payne, the presenter, theorizing,

39:00.920 --> 39:04.120
in his personal opinion, what is your process for backing up

39:04.120 --> 39:06.920
movies to, say, a storage medium?

39:06.920 --> 39:09.320
Do you do this, and do you have a process?

39:09.320 --> 39:11.480
You know, I haven't done it for a long time.

39:11.480 --> 39:14.680
Back in the day, I'd certainly ripped some DVDs,

39:14.680 --> 39:16.040
archived them, if you would say.

39:16.040 --> 39:19.440
Do you now more rely on the public backup?

39:19.440 --> 39:21.720
Yeah, or streaming services.

39:21.720 --> 39:24.360
Yeah, that's what I primarily do too.

39:24.360 --> 39:27.520
But I have picked up a few.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.980
I'll tell you, there's a thing about the kids,

39:29.980 --> 39:32.640
is they don't have a high preference.

39:32.640 --> 39:33.840
Like right now, they're young enough

39:33.840 --> 39:34.680
where they just don't care.

39:34.680 --> 39:35.500
They just need something.

39:35.500 --> 39:36.340
Yeah.

39:36.340 --> 39:37.540
Kind of colorful and fun.

39:37.540 --> 39:40.600
Family members are passing down a lot of DVDs to us,

39:40.600 --> 39:42.680
and we're picking up some Blu-rays at Garage Sale.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.740
Ange is always good at picking up, like,

39:44.740 --> 39:45.720
she's part of these, have you heard

39:45.720 --> 39:46.960
of these Buy Nothing groups?

39:46.960 --> 39:47.800
No.

39:47.800 --> 39:49.360
Oh, yeah, it's a big thing on Facebook,

39:49.360 --> 39:52.980
especially with the people that are really kind of thrifty.

39:52.980 --> 39:55.040
It's a real, it's a big thing in the rural towns

39:55.040 --> 39:55.880
that are short.

39:55.880 --> 39:56.700
They're saving some money.

39:56.700 --> 39:57.540
Yeah.

39:57.540 --> 39:58.380
People use some resources.

39:58.380 --> 39:59.720
Yeah, so instead of throwing something out

39:59.720 --> 40:01.440
that's still perfectly good, you put it up

40:01.440 --> 40:03.580
on a Facebook group and say, hey, I got this thing.

40:03.580 --> 40:05.520
And people, hey, I got this thing, all the time, right?

40:05.520 --> 40:06.360
All the time.

40:06.360 --> 40:07.240
So like a distributed Goodwill.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.480
Yeah, I wanna get rid of all my young kids stuff

40:09.480 --> 40:10.960
that we've had in the garage for the last 10 years.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.400
Would somebody like to just come grab this?

40:12.400 --> 40:13.520
It's distributed Goodwill.

40:13.520 --> 40:15.320
It's P2P Goodwill.

40:15.320 --> 40:19.080
And so you get DVDs, Blu-rays, you get all VHS,

40:19.080 --> 40:19.920
all kinds of crap.

40:19.920 --> 40:20.740
Sure, right?

40:20.740 --> 40:21.920
Like a bunch of, here's a bunch of kids movies.

40:21.920 --> 40:22.740
Have at it.

40:22.740 --> 40:24.360
And my kids love all of it.

40:24.360 --> 40:26.500
And you know, we just went on a spring break trip recently.

40:26.500 --> 40:29.920
I took the kids down to Seaside, Oregon, and Lady Joops.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.200
Loaded up Lady Joops.

40:31.200 --> 40:34.720
And I am ridiculously proud of this.

40:34.720 --> 40:36.600
And it's not even all of that elegant,

40:36.600 --> 40:39.260
but I am super proud of the fact

40:39.260 --> 40:42.720
that I can disconnect Lady Joops from shore power,

40:42.720 --> 40:45.480
is what they call it, which would be like utility

40:45.480 --> 40:46.520
from like the city, right?

40:46.520 --> 40:48.040
You power.

40:48.040 --> 40:51.320
And Lady Joops can go into battery mode.

40:51.320 --> 40:56.320
And this transition does not interrupt the TVs or the land.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.480
Ooh, that's lovely.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.440
The land, the TVs, and the Black Server.

40:59.440 --> 41:01.120
He just hot swappin' and boom.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.120
They all stay up.

41:02.120 --> 41:02.940
Not a blink.

41:02.940 --> 41:06.920
I can fire up our on-board generator, and it can kick in.

41:06.920 --> 41:09.840
And so technically, the entire, this is kind of a big deal.

41:09.840 --> 41:13.320
The whole house will switch from DC to AC.

41:13.320 --> 41:14.540
Wow.

41:14.540 --> 41:17.200
And the TVs, the Black Server, the land,

41:17.200 --> 41:19.560
the internet connection, all stay up.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.040
So I'm pretty proud of this.

41:21.040 --> 41:23.080
And it's just so awesome because we have these

41:23.080 --> 41:25.480
built-in screens in Lady Joops, these flat screens.

41:25.480 --> 41:27.200
And so when you're going down the road,

41:27.200 --> 41:28.780
the kids can like chill on the bed,

41:28.780 --> 41:31.360
like in the master bedroom, and they can like just,

41:31.360 --> 41:33.620
quote-unquote master bedroom, it's a queen-size bed.

41:33.620 --> 41:35.720
They can chill on the bed and watch TV

41:35.720 --> 41:37.560
and do whatever while we're going down the road.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.160
They're not distracting you while you're driving.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.320
Yeah, it's great, it's great.

41:41.320 --> 41:43.140
And so I wanted to get some of the stuff

41:43.140 --> 41:48.140
that we collected recently into my Plex server.

41:48.160 --> 41:49.000
Right, you already have a system.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
You don't need to be hauling DVDs all around.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.740
Side note, funny enough, Plex took a total shit on me

41:53.740 --> 41:55.800
for an unrelated reason, because of an Android update,

41:55.800 --> 41:59.240
and so I ended up just using Kodi, but that's a side note.

41:59.240 --> 42:01.540
But I needed to encode a lot of this stuff.

42:01.540 --> 42:05.500
I use MakeMKV and other tools to sort of encode this stuff.

42:05.500 --> 42:07.880
But I needed a way to, or to get it onto my system,

42:07.880 --> 42:08.920
but I needed a way to encode it.

42:08.920 --> 42:12.400
And I'm a long-time Handbrake user, really like Handbrake,

42:12.400 --> 42:14.400
because really underneath the scenes it's using FFmpeg

42:14.400 --> 42:17.240
with just a bunch of same presets and stuff like that.

42:17.240 --> 42:20.960
And they're using like good codecs, like x264 and stuff.

42:20.960 --> 42:25.760
And so this week they've released Handbrake 1.1.0,

42:25.760 --> 42:30.560
which has a total UI overhaul, a redesigned main window

42:30.560 --> 42:32.800
with consistency that's just, I don't know,

42:32.800 --> 42:34.440
I just think it looks a lot better, I'll say.

42:34.440 --> 42:36.880
And I like the way they preview the video image.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.860
They've redone the way you select presets,

42:38.860 --> 42:41.200
no more old like kludgy drawer system.

42:41.200 --> 42:43.760
It's an updated user interface, updated icons,

42:43.760 --> 42:45.860
high DPI support.

42:45.860 --> 42:49.400
They've added newer presets for Vimeo and YouTube

42:49.400 --> 42:53.580
and in some TV playback boxes.

42:53.580 --> 42:54.660
But there's been some nice,

42:54.660 --> 42:57.680
actual specific Linux improvements too.

42:57.680 --> 42:59.520
They've added an option to configure

42:59.520 --> 43:02.740
a low disk space warning level, which this is nice

43:02.740 --> 43:06.080
because I've actually, with this version,

43:06.080 --> 43:10.400
we've moved over encoding the BSD Now program to Handbrake,

43:10.400 --> 43:11.880
and Angela's doing this on Handbrake.

43:11.880 --> 43:12.920
And so it's nice to have this,

43:12.920 --> 43:13.760
because she has like that.

43:13.760 --> 43:14.580
That's fantastic.

43:14.580 --> 43:15.760
Yeah, she has like a bin that she sends these to.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.180
And when that fills up, she needs to know.

43:17.180 --> 43:18.240
And so this gives her a warning now.

43:18.240 --> 43:20.000
That's just like the timing, it's a small thing,

43:20.000 --> 43:22.380
but the timing was just aces.

43:22.380 --> 43:25.040
They also added Intel QuickSync video encoding support.

43:25.040 --> 43:26.200
It's experimental.

43:26.200 --> 43:28.480
It requires a very specific version of the Intel driver.

43:28.480 --> 43:29.840
So I haven't tried this yet,

43:29.840 --> 43:31.720
but that could be great. That would be really nice, yeah.

43:31.720 --> 43:32.560
That could be really great.

43:32.560 --> 43:34.560
If it's meeting your quality, you know, nice and fast.

43:34.560 --> 43:37.280
Yeah, and also check about,

43:37.280 --> 43:38.480
check just that, just like being like,

43:38.480 --> 43:39.920
just talk about being, that's what I'm trying to say.

43:39.920 --> 43:42.080
Talk about being ahead of the curve here.

43:42.080 --> 43:44.280
Official support for 1804.

43:44.280 --> 43:45.700
Beautiful. Yeah.

43:45.700 --> 43:48.760
Oh, it looks like they just, as we're covering it,

43:48.760 --> 43:51.200
they just uploaded 110 to the PPA.

43:51.200 --> 43:53.160
I wasn't there right earlier in the show.

43:53.160 --> 43:54.000
Sweet.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Go get your hands on it right now.

43:55.000 --> 43:55.820
Check it out. Sweet.

43:55.820 --> 43:56.660
You know what, Wes?

43:56.660 --> 43:59.880
That's officially like some Linux unplugged

43:59.880 --> 44:01.080
breaking news right there.

44:01.080 --> 44:03.440
Like we just broke a little handbrake news

44:03.440 --> 44:04.600
on the unplugged program.

44:04.600 --> 44:07.640
This is CNN breaking news.

44:07.640 --> 44:08.640
Unplugged.

44:08.640 --> 44:09.480
Breaking news.

44:09.480 --> 44:11.160
Yeah, come on. Unplugged breaking news.

44:11.160 --> 44:12.720
Yeah, and then there's been some updates

44:12.720 --> 44:15.440
for something called Windows.

44:15.440 --> 44:17.460
Not familiar with it, but we'll find out later.

44:17.460 --> 44:19.600
No, that's why I look outside.

44:19.600 --> 44:23.280
And Mac, which is something that McDonald's makes,

44:23.280 --> 44:24.740
but they have some improvements too,

44:24.740 --> 44:26.000
but they look like bullshit stuff

44:26.000 --> 44:27.920
that I wouldn't want to use anyways.

44:27.920 --> 44:29.880
Anyway, so handbrake, new release,

44:29.880 --> 44:31.640
link in the show notes, super great.

44:31.640 --> 44:34.360
And I use that, so once I got the,

44:34.360 --> 44:35.720
so this is Chris's quick,

44:35.720 --> 44:38.480
if I could just summarize my long story I gave you earlier.

44:38.480 --> 44:41.200
My quick tip is use the right tool for the job.

44:41.200 --> 44:44.840
So if it's a Blu-ray and a DVD, I recommend Make MKV.

44:44.840 --> 44:47.080
Bring those onto your hard drive.

44:47.080 --> 44:50.120
And then people have asked me a lot,

44:50.120 --> 44:51.960
should I just keep that MKV

44:51.960 --> 44:55.920
or should I re-encode it as an MP4 file

44:55.920 --> 44:59.880
or something like an MKV file with an H.265 for video?

45:01.120 --> 45:03.200
You know, having tested a lot of it,

45:03.200 --> 45:06.320
X.264 at a high quality bit rate,

45:06.320 --> 45:08.120
if you do two pass encoding,

45:10.400 --> 45:14.400
I would challenge you to really see the difference

45:14.400 --> 45:16.720
between that and what you rip directly off the Blu-ray

45:16.720 --> 45:18.000
using Make MKV.

45:18.000 --> 45:21.680
And there is a substantial, substantial,

45:21.680 --> 45:24.680
substantial file size difference, substantial.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.960
I would tell you to focus more

45:26.960 --> 45:28.560
on what you're doing with the audio.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.600
Are you doing pass through audio?

45:30.600 --> 45:32.280
Are you re-encoding that audio?

45:32.280 --> 45:35.320
Are you accidentally mixing down multi-channel to stereo?

45:35.320 --> 45:37.320
Pay attention to that, my friends.

45:37.320 --> 45:39.800
Because the number one question you guys are sending me is,

45:39.800 --> 45:41.760
should I encode it or not encode it?

45:41.760 --> 45:43.680
And you're not even asking me about the audio stuff.

45:43.680 --> 45:46.200
Having tested this back, you know, from doing like,

45:46.200 --> 45:47.320
I'm just taking the Blu-ray,

45:47.320 --> 45:51.400
which is like an AVC H.264 encoded file.

45:51.400 --> 45:52.800
Keep in mind.

45:52.800 --> 45:53.960
Having taken that Blu-ray

45:53.960 --> 45:56.280
and looked at just raw Blu-ray versions

45:56.280 --> 45:58.600
versus re-encoded using Handbrake,

45:58.600 --> 46:00.960
I really, I cannot tell the difference.

46:00.960 --> 46:03.320
And I am particularly picky about that kind of stuff.

46:03.320 --> 46:05.000
And I'm looking in like water scenes

46:05.000 --> 46:07.280
where there's a lot of motion and fire.

46:07.280 --> 46:08.600
I mean, I'm talking like, you know,

46:08.600 --> 46:10.440
really paying attention to specific scenes

46:10.440 --> 46:12.000
where the encoding should break down.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.480
And it looks good to me.

46:13.480 --> 46:16.640
So I really, I give a really, really hearty recommendation

46:16.640 --> 46:19.280
to Handbrake and the presets that they have been including

46:19.280 --> 46:21.760
because they've really tuned those presets

46:21.760 --> 46:24.520
with this new release and the stuff just looks so great.

46:24.520 --> 46:28.240
If you do the 1080p high quality, it will be double pass.

46:28.240 --> 46:29.480
It will be good audio.

46:29.480 --> 46:32.240
It's like, it's really what I think

46:32.240 --> 46:34.680
a professional video encoder would recommend.

46:34.680 --> 46:37.240
Yeah, my MB setup, it's not the beefiest.

46:37.240 --> 46:38.480
So if I can get it to a format

46:38.480 --> 46:39.960
that's like widely recognized already

46:39.960 --> 46:42.120
and then just direct play, that's all the better too.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.080
Exactly, that's another nice thing about this

46:44.080 --> 46:46.240
is it'll let you target certain types of devices.

46:46.240 --> 46:47.880
So if you knew you're gonna be playing it back

46:47.880 --> 46:50.800
on a Roku, for example, you could target that device,

46:50.800 --> 46:53.360
you could play it on MB, it'll do direct pass through,

46:53.360 --> 46:54.840
nothing's getting double encoded.

46:54.840 --> 46:56.360
It's the best quality possible.

46:56.360 --> 46:58.760
That stuff really does make a difference.

46:58.760 --> 47:01.360
So anyways, that's hopefully just answers

47:01.360 --> 47:02.760
a bunch of questions that come into the show

47:02.760 --> 47:03.920
and it's a really handy tool.

47:03.920 --> 47:07.000
And it's something that we're now using on a weekly basis

47:07.000 --> 47:09.400
for one of our Jupiter broadcasting programs too,

47:09.400 --> 47:10.280
the BSD Now show.

47:10.280 --> 47:11.800
Yeah, congrats on the new release.

47:11.800 --> 47:12.640
Yeah, great software.

47:12.640 --> 47:15.120
Yeah, and apparently a new new release, breaking news.

47:15.120 --> 47:16.360
All right, well, let's take a moment

47:16.360 --> 47:19.300
and talk about something new coming from Linux Academy.

47:19.300 --> 47:23.980
They have a huge batch of updates in the month of April.

47:23.980 --> 47:26.400
Linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

47:26.400 --> 47:28.360
Go there to sign up for a free seven day trial

47:28.360 --> 47:31.560
and support the show.

47:31.560 --> 47:33.080
It's an advanced training tool

47:33.080 --> 47:35.160
that gives you all of the knowledge you need

47:35.160 --> 47:37.640
for Linux and the things built on top of Linux.

47:37.640 --> 47:39.720
A full featured training library.

47:39.720 --> 47:42.360
They have hands-on scenario based labs

47:42.360 --> 47:44.740
that they spin up on demand that you log in

47:44.740 --> 47:47.040
over SSH to a Linux box and you start working

47:47.040 --> 47:49.440
on the real applications and technologies.

47:49.440 --> 47:51.720
You write the real config files.

47:51.720 --> 47:53.240
You see the real results.

47:53.240 --> 47:55.200
They have self-paced in-depth video courses

47:55.200 --> 47:57.280
on every Linux cloud and DevOps topic.

47:57.280 --> 48:00.280
And now in the month of April,

48:00.280 --> 48:03.920
they are launching more than 70 new courses.

48:03.920 --> 48:07.700
They got to do challenges and learning activities.

48:07.700 --> 48:09.160
Wow. Wow.

48:09.160 --> 48:10.800
I mean, that's a lot of new stuff.

48:10.800 --> 48:13.840
Yeah, they're refreshing old content as well.

48:13.840 --> 48:16.280
They're looking at all kinds of,

48:16.280 --> 48:17.360
you think about Linux Academy,

48:17.360 --> 48:18.840
they're always looking at all kinds of ways

48:18.840 --> 48:20.320
to update the old stuff too.

48:20.320 --> 48:22.840
So I often talk about the new content they're adding,

48:22.840 --> 48:24.040
but I think just as valuable

48:24.040 --> 48:25.680
is they're going back and retouching.

48:25.680 --> 48:26.920
You always know you can go there.

48:26.920 --> 48:29.080
You'll find stuff that's up to date.

48:29.080 --> 48:29.920
That's nice.

48:29.920 --> 48:31.280
Some refreshes across the course

48:31.280 --> 48:33.280
where 50 new cloud assessment courses,

48:33.280 --> 48:36.680
hands-on learning activities, and new challenges,

48:36.680 --> 48:39.840
as well as they have a new real-time grading platform.

48:39.840 --> 48:42.920
So you can get feedback as you're working on the lab.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.640
You don't have to wait till the end.

48:44.640 --> 48:45.460
That's great.

48:45.460 --> 48:46.300
That's amazing, really.

48:46.300 --> 48:47.140
That's so cool.

48:47.140 --> 48:49.760
Fast feedback when you're learning easy resources.

48:49.760 --> 48:50.740
It's just...

48:50.740 --> 48:51.920
Yeah, and a seven-day free trial

48:51.920 --> 48:54.560
when you go to linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

48:54.560 --> 48:56.440
They have study tools as well that you can download

48:56.440 --> 48:58.000
and listen to and use offline

48:58.000 --> 48:59.720
if you need to go offline for a little bit,

48:59.720 --> 49:02.240
and a community stack full of Jupiter Broadcasting members.

49:02.240 --> 49:05.040
linuxacademy.com slash unplugged.

49:05.040 --> 49:06.760
That's linuxacademy.com slash unplugged

49:06.760 --> 49:07.840
for that free seven-day trial,

49:07.840 --> 49:12.040
and to support this here podcast.

49:12.040 --> 49:13.760
So I want to talk about Plasma Vault.

49:13.760 --> 49:18.040
This is our official KDE corner, if you will.

49:18.040 --> 49:21.160
And Plasma Vault is an applet

49:21.160 --> 49:24.000
and a set of services and backend services

49:24.000 --> 49:27.440
that create encrypted vaults that are easily accessible

49:27.440 --> 49:29.000
from the Plasma desktop.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.440
Now, I do have a disclaimer that I have to make.

49:32.440 --> 49:35.180
Before this episode started, about 10 minutes,

49:35.180 --> 49:38.320
I updated to resolve another issue I was having on Plasma,

49:38.320 --> 49:42.300
and after I did that update, I lost access to my desktop,

49:42.300 --> 49:44.880
and I lost access to being able to add Plasma widgets.

49:44.880 --> 49:47.280
Alls I have is a black screen,

49:47.280 --> 49:49.440
and you can see my mouse cursor.

49:49.440 --> 49:50.880
Oh, that's all you need for a nice desktop.

49:50.880 --> 49:53.480
I can't right-click, I can't add widgets, so...

49:53.480 --> 49:54.600
So minimal.

49:54.600 --> 49:55.800
I was gonna tell you about this.

49:55.800 --> 49:56.760
This is a really cool application,

49:56.760 --> 49:58.600
but at this point, I actually would not be able

49:58.600 --> 50:00.300
to access the vaults I'm about to get to.

50:00.300 --> 50:02.520
So just so you guys are aware,

50:02.520 --> 50:05.960
there may be some issues that could...

50:05.960 --> 50:06.800
Why are you laughing?

50:06.800 --> 50:09.160
The hackers are dropping malware into your system.

50:09.160 --> 50:10.980
No, I don't think I was, I was not hacked.

50:10.980 --> 50:12.880
It was an update, it was an update,

50:12.880 --> 50:15.300
and it was my bad.

50:15.300 --> 50:18.360
And I've been told it's related to my Nvidia binary driver.

50:18.360 --> 50:20.080
No, say it ain't so.

50:20.080 --> 50:21.960
It appears to be so.

50:21.960 --> 50:24.000
The Plasma applet, though, called Plasma Vault

50:24.000 --> 50:24.840
is pretty cool.

50:24.840 --> 50:26.960
It doesn't really use anything that you couldn't bust out

50:26.960 --> 50:29.080
on the command line and solve yourself.

50:29.080 --> 50:31.000
It can do an overlay encryption file system

50:31.000 --> 50:32.640
or it can do a whole volume.

50:32.640 --> 50:34.680
And it's this UI that you add.

50:34.680 --> 50:37.100
It can be a little icon down in your dock,

50:37.100 --> 50:40.360
or it could be, or actually, I'm using a dock right now,

50:40.360 --> 50:43.660
but it could be your regular Plasma desktop.

50:43.660 --> 50:45.240
Or it could be a new widget on your desktop.

50:45.240 --> 50:47.560
So you click on the widget.

50:47.560 --> 50:49.520
You can say create new vault.

50:49.520 --> 50:51.320
When you do that, you give the vault the name.

50:51.320 --> 50:54.640
So like in this case, it might be, you know,

50:54.640 --> 50:56.400
like LUP secrets or something like that.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.240
Oh, so secret.

50:57.240 --> 50:58.520
And you can choose your encryption.

50:58.520 --> 50:59.920
I'm gonna do inc fs.

50:59.920 --> 51:01.760
You could actually, I'll do cry fs.

51:01.760 --> 51:03.880
Cry fs, which is kinda neat when you hit next

51:03.880 --> 51:05.840
in their wizard, it comes up with a security notice.

51:05.840 --> 51:09.640
It says cry fs, C-R-Y-F-S, encrypts your files

51:09.640 --> 51:11.680
so you can safely store them anywhere.

51:11.680 --> 51:13.600
It works well together with cloud services

51:13.600 --> 51:16.240
like Dropbox or iCloud or OneDrive and others.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.880
Unlike some other file system overlay solutions,

51:18.880 --> 51:21.200
it does not expose a directory structure

51:21.200 --> 51:23.580
or the number of files nor the size

51:23.580 --> 51:25.560
through the encrypted data format.

51:25.560 --> 51:27.960
But one important thing to note is that

51:27.960 --> 51:32.400
while cry fs is considered safe,

51:32.400 --> 51:34.440
there has been no independent security audit

51:34.440 --> 51:35.280
which confirms this.

51:35.280 --> 51:36.320
So they give you that disclaim.

51:36.320 --> 51:37.160
Well, yeah, that's nice.

51:37.160 --> 51:38.920
I think they know what you're getting yourself into.

51:38.920 --> 51:40.880
You know, you put your super secret secure password

51:40.880 --> 51:45.160
in there, so farts, and then you confirm that, farts.

51:45.160 --> 51:50.160
Then next, and oh, I guess next is not a farts.

51:50.440 --> 51:52.640
Type it in again because that's what I do, farts.

51:52.640 --> 51:55.600
Hit next, and then you tell it where you actually want it

51:55.600 --> 51:56.880
to store the volume.

51:56.880 --> 51:57.720
Nice.

51:57.720 --> 52:00.320
In this case, the encrypted data location

52:00.320 --> 52:04.160
will be slash home slash chris f slash dot local,

52:04.160 --> 52:05.360
so it's a hidden directory,

52:05.360 --> 52:10.360
slash share slash plasma dash vault slash secrets dot enc.

52:10.940 --> 52:13.540
So that'll be the actual path of my encrypted volume.

52:13.540 --> 52:16.760
It'll be at a hidden directory in the dot local folder,

52:16.760 --> 52:19.000
which is, and then it's pretty nested down.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.120
You know, it's all the way,

52:20.120 --> 52:22.400
it's down to a plasma vault folder.

52:22.400 --> 52:27.400
And it mounts now to slash home slash chris f slash vaults.

52:27.400 --> 52:29.840
So it's gonna make a vaults folder in my home directory,

52:29.840 --> 52:31.360
and then in there, it will make a folder

52:31.360 --> 52:32.360
called lup secrets.

52:32.360 --> 52:35.240
And anything I put in that folder called lup secrets

52:35.240 --> 52:36.800
will actually go in this encrypted volume.

52:36.800 --> 52:37.640
Sweet.

52:37.640 --> 52:40.100
Yep, so I do next, and I say go ahead and create,

52:40.100 --> 52:42.180
oh, this is something else that's kinda cool.

52:42.180 --> 52:44.300
But it'll allow you to limit the activities,

52:44.300 --> 52:46.060
which is a plasma desktop function

52:46.060 --> 52:47.920
that this vault is even available to.

52:47.920 --> 52:50.080
I don't wanna do that, so I'm not gonna choose that option,

52:50.080 --> 52:51.740
so I just choose create.

52:51.740 --> 52:53.240
When I say open in my file manager,

52:53.240 --> 52:55.280
it asks for the password, I put it in,

52:55.280 --> 52:56.140
and it opens the vault.

52:56.140 --> 52:58.160
It's now mounted as a regular folder.

52:58.160 --> 53:01.240
I can use it, I could leave it mounted my entire session.

53:01.240 --> 53:04.520
I'm impressed with this, you know, a few extra steps,

53:04.520 --> 53:06.400
and it feels a lot more integrated

53:06.400 --> 53:08.200
than some hacky encrypted folder

53:08.200 --> 53:09.600
that I have a bash script somewhere for.

53:09.600 --> 53:11.840
Yeah, and I also like and appreciate the fact

53:11.840 --> 53:13.920
that they're not inventing their own encryption.

53:13.920 --> 53:15.360
Yeah, right, it's not all hand-rolled,

53:15.360 --> 53:17.720
it's using just reliable primitives,

53:17.720 --> 53:19.280
sticking it together in a reasonable way

53:19.280 --> 53:20.520
with a lot of disclaimers.

53:20.520 --> 53:21.840
Yes, I do appreciate that.

53:21.840 --> 53:23.640
That seems perfect, yeah.

53:23.640 --> 53:25.120
So plasma vaults is nice.

53:25.120 --> 53:27.600
You know, you could use incfs, you can use cryfs,

53:27.600 --> 53:30.400
but here's the other great thing about it.

53:30.400 --> 53:32.880
This is coming from Ivan's blog here.

53:32.880 --> 53:36.240
He's talking about adding a new functionality

53:36.240 --> 53:38.700
to plasma vaults that I think is great,

53:38.700 --> 53:41.300
and it's really in light of Meltdown Inspector.

53:41.300 --> 53:43.520
He says, we've recently seen that even CPUs

53:43.520 --> 53:46.360
can sometimes be used as attack vectors.

53:46.360 --> 53:48.620
It's common for the web browser to be,

53:48.620 --> 53:50.640
and obviously through social engineering,

53:50.640 --> 53:52.480
for a user to also be used

53:52.480 --> 53:54.640
to gain remote access to the system.

53:54.640 --> 53:58.920
For this reason, starting with the next plasma release,

53:58.920 --> 54:01.400
if you have extremely sensitive data,

54:01.400 --> 54:06.400
you can mark a vault as offline only.

54:07.540 --> 54:10.760
This means that networking will be shut down

54:10.760 --> 54:14.880
as soon as you open the offline only vault.

54:14.880 --> 54:19.360
Any potential remote access is inhibited.

54:19.360 --> 54:21.700
Nice, I mean, you know, not complete,

54:21.700 --> 54:24.300
but hey, one more step, that's real handy.

54:24.300 --> 54:25.140
I like that a lot.

54:25.140 --> 54:26.440
I mean, if you're using Network Manager

54:26.440 --> 54:28.120
to manage your network connections anyways,

54:28.120 --> 54:29.560
and this can interface with that

54:29.560 --> 54:31.040
and shut down your network connection,

54:31.040 --> 54:33.860
so you're essentially air-gapped for a limited time,

54:33.860 --> 54:36.320
you're right, it doesn't prevent things

54:36.320 --> 54:37.520
that have been loaded on your system

54:37.520 --> 54:39.240
while you've been connected to the network.

54:39.240 --> 54:41.760
It's more of an immediate solution,

54:41.760 --> 54:44.520
but it's a one more peace of mind solution.

54:44.520 --> 54:46.040
And I like that integration,

54:46.040 --> 54:48.400
and that's where the Plasma Desktop often comes in,

54:48.400 --> 54:50.300
is that total suite integration,

54:50.300 --> 54:55.000
where your vault mounting mechanism can actually stop

54:55.000 --> 54:57.040
the networking, and it's not through some sort of hack,

54:57.040 --> 54:58.960
but through some sort of elegant communication system.

54:58.960 --> 55:01.460
It feels like a cohesive designed desktop.

55:01.460 --> 55:03.640
Yeah, so anyways, that's what's coming down

55:03.640 --> 55:05.120
the pipe for vaults.

55:05.120 --> 55:07.440
I wanted to also mention this week, LatteDoc,

55:07.440 --> 55:10.640
which I have started using on one of my plasma systems.

55:10.640 --> 55:13.880
I had this other bug recently with the Plasma Desktop

55:13.880 --> 55:15.840
where my panel stopped updating.

55:15.840 --> 55:17.480
Is that, do you think a fair description, Wes?

55:17.480 --> 55:18.720
Yeah, definitely. You've seen it.

55:18.720 --> 55:21.200
And it's just, it like freezes in time.

55:21.200 --> 55:23.800
The individual like applets, like Dropbox,

55:23.800 --> 55:25.720
and TeamViewer, and whatnot still work.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.340
And I think even the Bitcoin price thing still worked.

55:28.340 --> 55:29.800
But the clock would stop,

55:29.800 --> 55:31.840
like the seconds wouldn't tick anymore.

55:31.840 --> 55:36.240
And more importantly, the task bar would just be frozen

55:36.240 --> 55:38.760
at whatever I was at when it locked up.

55:38.760 --> 55:42.680
So if I had say, console, and Kate, and Firefox open,

55:42.680 --> 55:44.960
they would always show as open regardless.

55:44.960 --> 55:46.440
And say that I opened Chrome,

55:46.440 --> 55:47.640
and that was the only app I had open,

55:47.640 --> 55:51.200
it would never be in the task manager.

55:51.200 --> 55:53.940
It was kind of a little challenging when I was live on air

55:53.940 --> 55:55.800
and trying to switch between applications.

55:55.800 --> 55:59.200
And so I heard that an update would come down the road

55:59.200 --> 56:00.280
and let me fix it.

56:00.280 --> 56:03.000
But I thought in the meantime, until that update arrives,

56:03.000 --> 56:06.080
maybe I'll try LatteDoc.

56:06.080 --> 56:09.520
I gotta say, I'm not Mr. Doc.

56:09.520 --> 56:12.340
I don't really appreciate docs.

56:12.340 --> 56:16.200
I think they're usually just trying to be a Mac ripoff.

56:16.200 --> 56:18.440
And I tend to askew from them.

56:18.440 --> 56:20.540
This, however, did it right.

56:20.540 --> 56:24.840
Because one of the default layouts is called Plasma.

56:24.840 --> 56:27.800
And it's essentially a Plasma bar,

56:27.800 --> 56:31.160
but implemented as a doc, and it's done well.

56:31.160 --> 56:33.660
And it has a lot of functionality

56:33.660 --> 56:35.080
that I do appreciate from docs,

56:35.080 --> 56:38.100
like intelligent hiding, being able to change it,

56:38.100 --> 56:39.980
being connected to the left side of my screen,

56:39.980 --> 56:42.600
or the right side of my screen, or the bottom of my screen.

56:42.600 --> 56:45.920
You know, just the one icon for applications

56:45.920 --> 56:47.240
that are running, or for the launcher.

56:47.240 --> 56:49.240
I don't need to have an icon for the launcher

56:49.240 --> 56:52.080
and the running task, you know, those kinds of things.

56:52.080 --> 56:54.180
It does what I like in a doc,

56:54.180 --> 56:56.680
while not feeling like it's ripping off the Mac.

56:56.680 --> 56:59.520
And it's native Plasma stuff here.

56:59.520 --> 57:00.360
Yeah, it looks clean, well integrated.

57:00.360 --> 57:01.840
It's using Plasma technology.

57:01.840 --> 57:03.640
Yeah, it's very well integrated.

57:03.640 --> 57:04.540
Smooth.

57:04.540 --> 57:05.380
It is.

57:05.380 --> 57:07.520
And I think I'm gonna put it

57:07.520 --> 57:09.440
on all of my Plasma desktops slowly.

57:09.440 --> 57:13.260
It's pretty much available, and in all of the repos too.

57:13.260 --> 57:16.000
This is not a new application.

57:16.000 --> 57:17.240
Producer Michael's come on the show

57:17.240 --> 57:18.300
and told us about this before.

57:18.300 --> 57:20.680
But it's all based on Plasma framework,

57:20.680 --> 57:22.880
so it provides an elegant and intuitive experience,

57:22.880 --> 57:25.680
and I completely agree with their description there.

57:25.680 --> 57:27.680
And you can add regular Plasmoids to it.

57:27.680 --> 57:30.640
It animates or doesn't animate, depending on what you want.

57:30.640 --> 57:33.380
It's got a really easy to understand configuration,

57:33.380 --> 57:35.880
and you can, I don't know, it's just nice.

57:35.880 --> 57:38.500
And after having some troubles with the standard Plasma panel,

57:38.500 --> 57:40.000
I thought it may be worth mentioning.

57:40.000 --> 57:42.840
This has been my favorite part of your Plasma journey.

57:42.840 --> 57:45.160
You're finding all the apps I didn't even know I needed

57:45.160 --> 57:48.600
and hadn't found in the KDE world, and now I know.

57:48.600 --> 57:49.740
So, thank you.

57:49.740 --> 57:51.500
And then one more before we just get out of here.

57:51.500 --> 57:54.440
I see though that Mr. Noah Chalaya has joined us.

57:54.440 --> 57:56.760
I may ask him about his Plasma experience here in a moment,

57:56.760 --> 58:00.000
but one more little plug skis before we get out of here.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.940
You might remember, I think it was like Quapzilla.

58:03.940 --> 58:05.320
Was that the name of it, Quapzilla?

58:05.320 --> 58:06.280
Oh, that sounds familiar.

58:06.280 --> 58:07.800
An old, cute web browser.

58:07.800 --> 58:11.720
Well, it was renamed back in 2017 to Falcon.

58:11.720 --> 58:13.520
Falcon.

58:13.520 --> 58:15.040
There you go, Falcon.

58:15.040 --> 58:21.480
And it's flying like an eagle now.

58:21.480 --> 58:23.720
It's a cross-platform, cute web browser,

58:23.720 --> 58:25.320
and it's now called Falcon.

58:25.320 --> 58:30.820
And it's my experimental, I want something that's not Firefox.

58:30.820 --> 58:33.200
Like, I want to be logged into a different Google account.

58:33.200 --> 58:35.640
I just want it on a different process or whatever.

58:35.640 --> 58:37.480
I want to be able to just Alt-Tab really easy

58:37.480 --> 58:39.520
to a different set of sessions.

58:39.520 --> 58:41.180
That's where I'm trying it out right now.

58:41.180 --> 58:42.760
And I've been looking for things that are

58:42.760 --> 58:44.280
Qt-based for the Plasma desktop.

58:44.280 --> 58:47.480
So if you have any Falcon tips, linuxunplug.com slash

58:47.480 --> 58:48.320
contact, let me know.

58:48.320 --> 58:50.800
But Mr. Noah Chalaya, are you there?

58:50.800 --> 58:51.560
Are you live, sir?

58:51.560 --> 58:53.960
And are you still on the Plasma desktop?

58:53.960 --> 58:56.840
I am, I am, and I am.

58:56.840 --> 59:00.980
Have you tried it out on any NVIDIA systems recently?

59:00.980 --> 59:01.720
I have, actually.

59:01.720 --> 59:04.960
Our brand new XPS Edit Bay.

59:04.960 --> 59:06.120
No.

59:06.120 --> 59:07.960
Yeah, it's running Plasma.

59:07.960 --> 59:08.460
Really?

59:08.460 --> 59:09.760
Do you want to tell people about that?

59:09.760 --> 59:11.320
Do you want to have you talk about that?

59:11.320 --> 59:12.360
Spill the beans.

59:12.360 --> 59:13.440
Yeah, we can spill it.

59:13.440 --> 59:16.320
Honestly, the only reason I didn't spill it earlier

59:16.320 --> 59:18.840
was I didn't know, you know, it's your popsicle stand.

59:18.840 --> 59:20.480
I didn't know how you wanted to tell the popsicles.

59:20.480 --> 59:22.360
That's a little LinuxFest Northwest tease,

59:22.360 --> 59:24.560
because behind this, this actually maybe gives people

59:24.560 --> 59:26.880
a better idea of what we go through behind the scenes

59:26.880 --> 59:28.560
to prepare for LinuxFest Northwest.

59:28.560 --> 59:30.840
You should tell people about this new machine.

59:30.840 --> 59:33.920
Well, yeah, so I think there's probably

59:33.920 --> 59:35.460
a public perception that all I do

59:35.460 --> 59:37.480
is complain about wireless on 16.04.

59:37.480 --> 59:38.520
That's not the truth.

59:38.520 --> 59:41.040
The truth is I actually do a lot of things.

59:41.040 --> 59:42.920
I actually fight for the Linux desktop a lot.

59:42.920 --> 59:44.840
And so one of the things that had came up

59:44.840 --> 59:46.360
was we were talking about what we're

59:46.360 --> 59:47.240
going to do for LinuxFest.

59:47.240 --> 59:49.420
And I was like, listen, we can do a lot of different things

59:49.420 --> 59:51.840
for LinuxFest, as long as we're all doing them on Linux.

59:51.840 --> 59:52.760
I said, well, here's the thing.

59:52.760 --> 59:55.180
We've had some issues, some production issues in the past.

59:55.180 --> 59:58.000
So how can we make sure that we have an absolute rock

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.560
solid machine that's going to work perfectly

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:04.640
the entire time, as if it was a broadcast grade device

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.060
that you would buy from a company?

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.080
So that's not a problem.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.560
What we have to do is we have to buy a brand new,

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.760
top of the line Dell XPS performance

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:17.400
system with the eight core i7 in it and dedicated graphics

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.200
and a dedicated capture device.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:20.800
That's PCI.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:21.600
So it's on the bus.

01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:25.480
We have four individual 1080p, 60 frame per second capture

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:26.860
device that's inside of this box.

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:28.440
We built it.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.600
And I actually really like that system

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.480
because a week before, I had started editing the AS NOAH

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:37.060
show and actually purchased another one of these systems

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.360
to do all of the editing on it.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:43.400
And so it's the Dell XPS desktop, not the laptop.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.160
It's a desktop version, but it's just

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:46.880
a powerhouse of a machine.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.280
And that currently is loaded with KDE neon

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.640
and of course has the dedicated Nvidia graphics card in it.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:58.880
So I am fascinated by the amount of hardware

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.680
that is going into this year's Linux Fest Northwest.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.600
But I think it's also interesting that we're

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.480
doing a full plasma deployment.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:08.400
It's one of these things, NOAH, where

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.680
by the time Linux Fest lands, 1804 will have been released.

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.240
You know what I mean?

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:15.880
We have to do all of this pre 1804.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.880
The other thing is, and maybe this

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:22.480
is a bad way to go about this, but my plan up until this point

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:26.480
and continues to be really, I'm just hanging out on KDE neon

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:27.680
until it burns me.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:29.320
And then once I get burned or when something happens,

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.600
then maybe I'll re-evaluate that.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:31.920
But I was thinking about this.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.920
When 1804 comes out, as a responsible person in the media,

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:38.200
I feel like it's our job to evaluate the stuff.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:38.720
Try it.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.800
All the flavors, really.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.480
I want to try as many as I can.

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.400
But at the same time, I still have

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.480
to be able to get work done.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:48.260
And neon has been so rock solid good to me.

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:51.760
I've had zero, not a couple of things that I could work,

01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.960
zero problems whatsoever with it,

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.400
that it's just going to be very difficult for me

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.640
to wipe it off my computer.

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:01.880
Maybe I can partition it out and live in the LTS

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.200
for a little bit just to play with it and stuff.

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:07.280
But at this point, my plan was to just blow it completely away

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.400
and go back to 1804.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.440
No, I'm having a really hard time,

01:02:10.440 --> 01:02:12.480
if I'm being honest with myself and you,

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.040
I'm having a hard time convincing myself to do that.

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.640
We've never really had an experiment go like this before.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.920
I mean, not like this deep, right?

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.200
I mean, we're like, hey, let's try this.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.800
And then it just changes the way we work now.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.200
I was just saying on the pre-show,

01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.400
I've had two out of six systems start

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:31.140
to develop issues, which isn't a bad batting average.

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:33.840
But it's enough where I'm at yellow alert right now,

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.760
and I'm like, oh, what am I going to do?

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.320
But other than that, it's not too bad.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.520
And those both are my two Nvidia rigs.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.760
So it's kind of interesting, those are the new systems

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.560
having problems.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.320
That's why I was asking you if you tried it on Nvidia.

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.000
Yeah, and to be fair, both of those systems, one,

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.440
so one of those doesn't have, the Linux first rig

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.160
actually just got here yesterday, the day before.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.920
And so it's sitting apart because we're

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:58.040
putting hardware in it.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.280
The editing machine, it's been running two,

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:02.280
whatever it has been, two, three weeks with Nvidia.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:07.240
However, I've only used that machine an hour or two a week.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.840
If I reboot or even just log out and log back in,

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.560
the problem tends to go away, the locked panel problem.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:15.680
This time, I've lost my desktop and all of my widgets

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:18.120
and the ability to add new widgets.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.040
But that tends to actually get resolved too.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.520
So let's change gears.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.440
Do you want to mention what you're doing in LA

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.920
and why you're going to LA soon, or do you

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:26.960
want to just keep that a behind the scenes thing?

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.200
No, sure.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:30.040
No, I think it's cool.

01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.700
So one of the things that we had talked

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:34.160
about for Linux Fest Northwest is when you guys come out

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:39.200
to the conference, we want to change the dynamic that exists.

01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.840
Because a lot of times, we'll be in, quote unquote, show mode.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.720
And then people are either afraid to approach the booth

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.080
or they approach the booth at the wrong time.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.640
We're trying to set something up.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.480
And it creates an unfriendly dynamic.

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.640
And so we want to change that.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.240
And so what we're looking at doing

01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:53.800
is we're trying to create a cool exhibit.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:55.320
So it's not just the place that we're

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.400
setting up and broadcasting.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.000
There's going to be cool things for you to look at,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.680
cool things for you to see, cool things for you to play with.

01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:04.440
And basically, we're going through,

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.120
and we're like, how can we get the best of everything

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.440
and make it something kind of cool to see?

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.040
And one of the things that we wanted to do from the audio side

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:14.960
is have all digital audio so that there is no buzz,

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.800
there is no hum, there's nothing like that.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.600
It's all digital.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:20.360
So I started looking for a board that we could use

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.040
that was all digital.

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:24.120
Which is not cheap.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.840
Once you say those words, you're in a certain price category

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:27.400
right there.

01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.400
Yeah, boy.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.160
Yeah, usually you're in a couple grand each.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:34.600
And if anybody is in the broadcast industry

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.520
or in the voiceover industry, you guys

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.760
may know the name Joe Cipriano.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.640
And Joe grew up on the air.

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:42.480
He grew up, and he wrote a book about how

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.880
from the time he was 12 years old,

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:46.280
he was in a radio station doing on-air stuff

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.560
and eventually turned it into a voiceover career.

01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:50.880
And he's one of the most, next to Don LaFontaine,

01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:54.360
probably one of the most successful voiceover actors

01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:54.840
out there.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.880
If you've listened to Fox News, or I'm sorry, Fox, The Simpsons

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.320
or anything like that, he does all of the promos for CBS

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.720
and Fox and stuff like that.

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:03.960
And heard about what we were doing,

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:06.440
heard about the budget constraint

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.120
that I'm working under and stuff like that.

01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.320
And I just reached out to him.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.320
I said, I know you have this board.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.840
I know that you're looking to transition out of it.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.960
He's upgrading a system.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.040
And I said, could we work out a decent price?

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.160
And I don't know if I want to go into the pricing,

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:22.400
but he gave me an insane deal, so insane

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.400
that I am flying out to LA at the end of this week

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:28.320
to go pick the board up from his studio.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:31.600
And then I'm going to go straight from his studio,

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:34.400
next flight the very next day, to Seattle.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.560
I'm going to bring it there.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.920
And then we have a week to set it up and try it and play

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.280
with it and make sure everything's going to work.

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:42.040
But we're going to be using Joe Cipriano's board.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.880
My thing was simple.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.200
If it's good enough for CBS, it's

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:46.400
probably good enough for us.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:46.960
I hope so.

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.040
Yeah, otherwise we're doing something wrong.

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.520
If the Tiffany Network says it's good,

01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.320
then we should be able to do a live stream.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.840
I didn't really work on open source.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.360
Yeah.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:59.520
The whole thing, so it's a real process to do this.

01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:04.080
But it is, if you have a small budget

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.560
or you have a large budget, I think

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:08.840
this is what my takeaway is.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.560
And it's not really this show's legacy,

01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:14.760
but a big legacy of last was us struggling with,

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:17.880
can we do our passion on Linux?

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.480
And our passion was live production of shows.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:25.520
And now the question more is, what range

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.040
do we want to do this at?

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.600
What grade?

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:32.760
If we wanted to spend $700, we could do this.

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.640
And if we want to go full Noah, we

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.000
could spend money that we probably

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.240
shouldn't mention on this and do this.

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.280
There's a range available to us now, Noah.

01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:43.840
You know what I mean?

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:46.720
Really, the best two examples of that,

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.480
or go-to examples of that I can think of

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.320
are going to be this year at Linux Fest Northwest.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.840
I think is safe to say probably the most elaborate setup

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.120
that we've ever done.

01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:58.080
In fact, I would go as far as to say this.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:01.160
I'll put my name on it and say that I challenge you

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.480
to find another conference.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.800
Not just a Linux conference, but any conference

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:07.320
that isn't exhibiting media stuff specifically.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.200
So NAB would be out, stuff like that.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.520
But anything that's a conference that's

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.280
outside of the media industry that

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.080
is going to have as elaborate of a setup

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:16.920
as we're going to have.

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.240
So we've got that this year.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:20.880
But then you compare that to what we did at System76

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.160
a couple of years ago, where we literally didn't show up

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.240
with a single piece of equipment.

01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.000
I mean, we showed up, and we just hodgepodged it together.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.440
People were bringing in parts from their house and stuff

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.160
like that, and we made a production system out of it.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.800
And that just shows the flexibility,

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.800
the scalability of Linux.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:37.640
The fact that I can just take a box,

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:39.640
get all the software and necessary stuff up,

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:41.800
open the Google Docs, put all the stream keys in,

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.800
boom, we're on the air.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.160
Yeah, I think it's going to be pretty cool.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.600
I can't wait to start playing with this stuff.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.960
And if you follow the timeline there,

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:53.400
no one's going to be out here damn near way

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.560
before Linux Fest Northwest, because we're

01:07:55.560 --> 01:07:56.960
going to be testing this stuff.

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:59.080
We're going to be working with this stuff.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:01.240
It's our passion, and it's so cool

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:03.280
to be able to do this under Linux now.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.920
And to be able to go to a Linux event now for years.

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.200
This isn't our first year.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:10.560
This is not our first rodeo anymore.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.040
We've been doing these events, covering them

01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:18.120
from beginning to end, full spectrum, using Linux.

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:21.240
And now this is the most professional implementation.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:23.280
We're not going to be throwing together systems

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:23.840
until the last minute.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:24.920
Finally getting good at it.

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.120
Yeah, it's kind of fun.

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.800
It's fun to be at this position, so I'm really excited.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.720
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:31.080
It's pretty cool and crazy, Noah,

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.800
flying all over the place to do it.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.080
I don't even know what that guy's up to.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.520
That's just nuts.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.760
I actually think our setup at the Linux Fest Northwest booth

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:42.320
might make me just want to do shows from there from now on.

01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:43.520
We'll just do it there all the time.

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:44.920
That's it.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:45.720
I'm done.

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.240
I don't need any of that.

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:48.120
I'm sick of it.

01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:50.240
We'll just do all our shows from there from now on.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:52.400
Anyways, links to everything we talked about today,

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:56.200
linuxunplugged.com slash, what is this, 2.44?

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.320
Yep, 2.44.

01:08:57.320 --> 01:09:02.320
And if you come over on Tuesdays to the jblive.tv stream,

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.600
you can catch this show.

01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.960
We start at 2 PM Pacific.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.960
Actually, really, the live show usually kicks off around 1.30

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:08.880
Pacific.

01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:11.160
All of that is converted to your local time

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.840
at jupiterbroadcasting.com slash calendar.

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.240
You come for the Unplugged program.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.200
You hang out with us.

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:17.160
We have some pre-show.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.040
We have the main show.

01:09:18.040 --> 01:09:19.200
We have the post show.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.240
And then just a little bit after that,

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.160
it's that crazy Ask Noah program.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.720
And he's taking your live calls.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.440
He's answering your questions.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.240
And he's talking about all that kind of stuff.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.320
Hang out with Noah.

01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:29.440
It's a Linux sandwich.

01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.040
I really think you'd probably like it.

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.480
And plus, you've got the chat room going.

01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.040
There's the mumble room you can participate in.

01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:35.560
You can join our virtual lug.

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:38.000
You see, any simple model of human nature

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.400
is going to be wrong.

01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:43.360
And you can debate things like human nature, I guess,

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.200
if you like.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.520
Anyways, all of that is happening at jblive.tv

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.560
every single Tuesday.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.960
And we'd love to have you there.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.880
You can get links to everything we talked about

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.960
at linuxunplugged.com slash 244.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.920
Email us at linuxunplugged.com slash contact.

01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.760
And that's all of the meat and potatoes.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:58.920
So much meat and potatoes.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.400
Meat and potatoes are everything we need to cover.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.160
But I think that'll pretty much bring us

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.960
to an end for at least our portion

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.620
the Ask Noah program will take over soon.

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:09.160
But in the meantime, go check out the TechSnap program.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:12.880
TechSnap.systems, where Wes and I are breaking down stories

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:15.800
that are really kind of focused on the whole IT

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.940
and sysadmin market.

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:18.560
So it's like, if you've got to live in that world,

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.200
you need to know what's coming up.

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.340
If you have systems you have to manage,

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.840
or if you have systems you have to manage

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.280
and that's not your primary day job,

01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:28.920
TechSnap program can be very valuable.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.720
TechSnap.systems, go get a little more.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:31.540
Me and Wes.

01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:32.380
Go join us.

01:10:32.380 --> 01:10:33.480
Or at Wes Payne for his Twitter.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.300
Do it.

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:35.140
I'm at Chris Elias.

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:37.320
The network is at Jupiter signal.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.040
We also have the subreddit, linuxunplugged.reddit.com

01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:41.520
and linuxunplugged.com.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.640
Thanks so much for being here.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:43.960
See you right back here.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:44.800
Next Tuesday!

01:10:44.800 --> 01:11:13.800
Missing Artists.

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:23.560
The Unplugged program, wrapping up 2.44.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.560
Feel it.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.560
Feeling good.

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.560
That was a long one.

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.560
That went a little bit longer than I expected.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:28.560
Out of control.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.560
It's really your fault, Wes.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:30.560
You just don't ever shut up.

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.560
I know.

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:32.560
I was egging you on all day.

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.560
And Dan.

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.760
Dan comes in here, you know, running his mouth.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:38.400
And hey, Citizen, I don't think he ever shut his mouth either.

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:39.400
You guys.

01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:40.400
Unbelievable.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:41.400
Gotta get hyped.

01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.400
Linux hype.

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:43.400
2018.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:44.400
Linux hype.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.400
So let's see here.

01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:46.400
Let's get some titles.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:47.400
We got titles thing.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.400
Noah, what's coming up on the Ask Noah program, bro-ham?

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.400
Let's go.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.400
Holy cow.

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:59.120
We are asking so many crazy flame click baity questions like, is Apple destroying the computer?

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.680
We got a really cool guest that is starting a business, and so we're going to talk with

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:06.320
him about what's coming up in his business and the challenges that you face when you

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.720
start a small business and how you can do that on Linux.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:09.720
That's lovely.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:14.920
Hey, did you officially change the intro tagline?

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920
I did.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:16.920
Yeah.

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.920
Well, yeah.

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:18.920
Do you mind giving me a read again?

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.920
Because I know it's new, but I forgot what it was.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.440
I mean, I know the music's not going.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.440
I know.

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:25.440
It's a big ask, but.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:26.440
Hold on a second.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.440
You know what?

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:29.120
It was like way simpler and less confusing.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.400
You know what's great about this new system here?

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:32.400
What?

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.400
I have this touch screen.

01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:34.400
As long as I turn it on, there we go.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.400
Yeah.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:36.400
Sure.

01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.400
Look at that.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.400
I just pushed the button and it happened.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:39.880
It's going to back forward right to the music.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:40.880
Oh my gosh.

01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:41.880
The show you've been asking for.

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:42.880
It won't get a thing to start again.

01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:43.880
It will not start again.

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:44.880
This is a false start.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:45.880
It's going to get me flagged.

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.880
It's going to get me flagged.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.880
You're going to get me flagged, dude.

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:51.280
It can't get flagged because it's custom written.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.280
Good.

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:53.280
All right.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:54.280
Good.

01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:55.280
Okay.

01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:56.280
All right.

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.280
Yeah.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.280
Because I don't know.

01:12:58.280 --> 01:12:59.280
A lot of multi-speed technologies.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.280
The Ask Noah show starts right now.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:03.680
This is the show where we do all the things on Linux they said that couldn't be done and

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.080
take your calls on how to do the same.

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.080
Damn, that's good, dude.

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.080
That is good.

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.080
Much better, right?

01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.080
I like that.

01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.080
I like that.

01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.080
I like that music better.

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.080
I like that slogan better.

01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:16.120
Because, you know, your tech and tech business tech questions didn't make any sense to me.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.120
I know.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:18.120
And you know what?

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.120
Here's the problem, though.

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.120
You didn't tell me that until New York.

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.120
Do you remember?

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:22.120
We were having dinner.

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:23.120
Oh, really?

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.120
Yeah.

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.120
We were down eating.

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.120
We were eating Indian food in the basement of the train station.

01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:27.120
I do remember.

01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.840
And you're like, what does that mean?

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:30.340
I'm like, what does what mean?

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:33.820
You said taking your tech questions and business in tech question.

01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:34.820
What does that mean?

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:35.820
And then I explain it.

01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:36.820
And you're like, okay, well, once you explain it, it makes sense.

01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:38.280
But when you say it, it doesn't make any sense.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.860
And I'm like, well, we're 54 episodes in.

01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:41.860
Why am I just hearing about this now?

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:42.860
I know.

01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:43.860
I'm too nice.

01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:44.860
I just didn't make it from episode one.

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:45.860
I know.

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:46.860
I am too nice.

01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.860
You got to be stern from the start.

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:48.860
J-Bot is...

01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:49.860
By the way, nice new...

01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.860
By the way, nice new rock music.

01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:51.860
Yeah.

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:52.860
Thanks to him.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:53.860
It only took four and a half months and a lot of money.

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:54.860
But now you have it.

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:55.860
It's perfect.

01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:56.860
Turn it up.

01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:57.860
Yeah.

01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:58.860
And 52 YouTube flags.

01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.880
Actually, no, it's double because there's a live stream.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:07.100
So JB Titles is not working because J-Bot is written in Ruby and not Rust.

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:08.100
Oh, yeah.

01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:09.100
Should I...

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:10.100
I guess I can...

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:13.780
We ought to talk about maybe soliciting a community project to rewriting J-Bot because

01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:19.100
J-Bot doesn't handle people going to JBtitles.com super well, I'm noticing.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:20.100
It's just...

01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:21.100
It has a hard time.

01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:27.540
And I think it's just maybe because it's Ruby, but that's just maybe me being a Rust lover.

01:14:27.540 --> 01:14:29.580
I don't know.

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.580
I'm all Rust.

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:31.580
I'm all Rust.

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:34.620
I go to bed at night watching Rust YouTube videos.

01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:35.620
Yeah.

01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:36.620
Anyways, what are we going to...

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:37.620
What are we going to title this thing?

01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:38.620
Because I've got to get out of here so Noah can do a show.

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:39.620
So we've got to come up with a title, guys.

01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:41.860
God, this is always harder than it should be.

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:45.900
Too bad we don't have Popeye in here cursing and yelling at people to give us a title because

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:46.900
that would be...

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:47.900
Ha ha ha ha.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:15:03.180
Ha ha ha.
