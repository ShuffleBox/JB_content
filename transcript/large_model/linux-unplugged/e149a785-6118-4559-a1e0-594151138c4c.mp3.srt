1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
You know, some weeks, I mean, most of the time, really,

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,080
let's be honest, but some weeks, it really

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,800
feels good to be a Linux user.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,600
And on its 30th birthday, it's kind of one of those weeks.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,320
Did you hear about this Razer mouse driver issue?

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,840
I did not hear about this.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,100
All right, well, Brent, say that you need local admin

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,240
on a Windows box, and you have physical access,

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,040
but of course, you weren't given the admin password.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:26,140
Don't ask why you need this on a Windows box.

11
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,480
Don't ask why it's a Windows box.

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,640
But all you have to do, get yourself a Razer mouse,

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,040
or even just the dongle.

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,680
Windows Update, the second you plug that sucker in,

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,600
will hopefully download and execute the Razer installer

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,520
to get those drivers going for you.

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,800
Sounds great, until you realize that program downloaded

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,960
from the internet, yeah, that's run as system, which

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,520
is like super root on Windows.

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,680
And because it's Windows, well, you

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,400
get to choose where you install some stuff,

22
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,240
and that opens up an Explorer window.

23
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,000
If you right-click in there, you can open PowerShell,

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,200
which inherits root privileges.

25
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:09,600
Oh, this is Unplugged 420, a sophisticated episode

26
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,480
that will be making no pot jokes, no references, none

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:14,800
at all.

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,120
Hello, and welcome in to your weekly Linux talk show,

29
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,880
a sophisticated program this week that is brought to you

30
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,360
by our friends at a Cloud Guru, the leader in learning

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,800
for the Cloud, Linux, and other modern tech skills,

32
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,960
hundreds of courses and thousands of hands-on labs.

33
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,080
Get certified, get hired, get learning at acloudguru.com.

34
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,780
Coming up on the show today, we are

35
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,880
riding high on a community rush in the Mile High City

36
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,680
this week and sharing some of our meetup adventures,

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,960
featuring some great emails that have come into the show

38
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,240
recently, and a spot of Linux news for you

39
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,280
all that you can use.

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,040
So we'll tell you about that, and we'll

41
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,960
tell you about the time we recorded a Linux

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,200
podcast from a golf course.

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,320
But we have a special arrangement today.

44
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,520
Wes is back home in the Seattle area.

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,360
Hello, Wes.

46
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,480
Hello.

47
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,360
I hate to tell you this, but it's mid-70s and very cool

48
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,120
today.

49
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,720
You do just exactly how to needle me

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,000
at the very beginning of the show.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,400
That's well done.

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,320
That's well done.

53
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,600
And Brent has joined me in Colorado Springs,

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,080
so we're just down a couple hours

55
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,120
from Denver in the lovely Colorado Springs.

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,720
Hello, Brent.

57
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,440
Welcome back.

58
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,960
Hello, Chris.

59
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,120
It's nice to have you here.

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,240
It's like an ongoing adventure.

61
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,080
And you were there for a lot of what went down.

62
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,840
We had the meetup.

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,240
We had our big Denver meetup.

64
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,920
We just had such a great time.

65
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,680
We want to tell you a little bit about that.

66
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,320
We got a couple of quick chats from there.

67
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,480
All kinds of stuff, but you have now moved out.

68
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,680
You're out of the RV now.

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,960
You're staying here in Colorado Springs for a while.

70
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,160
Also, the kids flew home.

71
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,200
It's real quiet here.

72
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,680
I don't even see a Levi today.

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,320
No, Hadia and Levi, the wife and the dog,

74
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,280
are out with a friend visiting Boulder.

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,920
They're going to be back probably some point during the show.

76
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,080
But yeah, I went from this place being packed.

77
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,280
And we were off grid for eight days,

78
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,600
and we had the slides in for eight days.

79
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,800
We had all slides in, so it was really cramped in here.

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,480
Now we're down to the KOA in Colorado Springs.

81
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,640
I got full hookups with water.

82
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,920
I got air conditioning.

83
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,000
My slides are out, and I got the entire RV to myself.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,560
It feels luxurious.

85
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,120
And so I'm like, let's get some Linux podcasting done.

86
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,160
And then after this, we are moving on.

87
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,440
But before we leave the Colorado Springs area,

88
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,520
we are going to do a micro meetup.

89
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,040
If you're listening live today, if you're in the Colorado

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,520
Springs area Tuesday, August 24, 2021,

91
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,120
join us at 4.30 local time at the view house in Colorado

92
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,640
Springs.

93
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
There are several of the view houses.

94
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,440
We're going to the one in Colorado Springs right off 25.

95
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,840
And then we'll have a dinner.

96
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,040
We'll say goodbye to our friends in Colorado Springs,

97
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,360
and then we head off to Tucson.

98
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,320
Tucson, that sounds exciting.

99
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,480
Also going to be hot, I'm sure.

100
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,640
I'm sad to say I'm not going to be joining you.

101
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,640
I know.

102
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,680
I know we're going to have to say our goodbyes at that point.

103
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
Who's going to make you brunch?

104
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
Maybe you could make me a few brunches,

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,480
and I could like seal them up.

106
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,200
Pre-brunches.

107
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,320
Yeah, like heat them up.

108
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,680
You know, you just leave me a little instructions.

109
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:09,880
All right.

110
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,880
Don't forget them, because they get nasty in that fridge.

111
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,720
That's what Hadia does when she leaves.

112
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,920
She leaves me little sticky notes that tell me,

113
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,040
like, this goes with this.

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,760
You combine these things.

115
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,040
She leaves me a little map.

116
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,720
It's like putting Ikea furniture together.

117
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,520
You're totally an adult. Totally.

118
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,520
Yeah, no, totally.

119
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,720
So then after that, yeah, so we're going to Tucson,

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,200
because there is a shop down there of room slide system

121
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,560
that Colonel in our mumble room found, and it's experimental.

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,720
I can't find anybody that's done it before,

123
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,280
anybody that has a testimony except for the guy that

124
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,120
did it to his own rig.

125
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,840
But it looks solid, but it's a risky move for sure.

126
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,120
So we're going to be working out a recording schedule

127
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,760
for next week.

128
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,240
It's probably not going to be live.

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,680
It's probably going to be pre-recorded next week.

130
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,240
But we'll still have a show for you.

131
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,120
But it's just going to be kind of all up in the air.

132
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,480
Well, yeah.

133
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,600
I mean, if we did it live, you'd just

134
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,840
be a nervous wreck fretting about your slides.

135
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,080
We don't want that.

136
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,880
Yeah, and I also think every now and then,

137
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,520
Wes has got to be let out of his house.

138
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,000
He's got to get outside.

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,880
You know, you've got to walk your Wes from time to time.

140
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,520
Yeah, that's right.

141
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,320
Really, it's my fault.

142
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,680
I'm going on a camping trip.

143
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,360
Well, and I'm using that opportunity, too,

144
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,240
to get in there and get some slide work done.

145
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,760
So it's a win-win for sure.

146
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,840
Now, let's get into a little community news.

147
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,360
And the story that we've been trying

148
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,120
to figure out when to kind of fit it in that we just haven't

149
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,120
gotten to yet is one that kind of underscores

150
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,360
the entire reason why we like to talk about ButterFS

151
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,440
here on this show.

152
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,720
And obviously, we recognize it's a multi-file system world.

153
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,640
I mean, you're talking to a guy right now that's

154
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,000
got XFS, ButterFS, and ZFS on one system.

155
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,120
It's a multi-file system world out there.

156
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,960
But we've argued for a while now that ButterFS

157
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,680
should be taken seriously in the workstation context,

158
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,000
especially in the single SSD laptop kind of situation

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,880
or like your desktop workstation.

160
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,440
There's a lot of features there that

161
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,400
make it a real competitive file system compared

162
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,400
to what commercial desktops offer now on Mac and Windows.

163
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,120
Yeah, we definitely love ButterFS.

164
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,960
But there's an interesting kernel feature

165
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,640
that just landed with Linux 5.12.

166
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,760
And up till recently, ButterFS, well, it was missing out.

167
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,720
My name is Christian.

168
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,320
I'm one of the organizers of the Container Step Room.

169
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,920
I'm also one of the maintainers of the Lexi and Lexi projects

170
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,880
and mostly work on the kernel side of things

171
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,280
on the low-level stuff.

172
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,960
And today, I want to talk about something

173
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,600
that we've been working on for quite a while, namely,

174
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
the ID map mounts concept.

175
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,760
ID maps are a fascinating idea.

176
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,240
They allow for different mounts to expose the same file

177
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,120
or directory with different ownership.

178
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,560
It makes it possible to easily share

179
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,920
files between multiple users or multiple machines,

180
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,320
especially in some complex scenarios.

181
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,400
I could imagine why, too.

182
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,560
This is probably pretty critical in a container workload.

183
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,400
Maybe I could even see a use case in this for something

184
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,680
like Flatpak as well.

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,600
Oh, yeah, definitely.

186
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,600
I mean, even if you've just got multiple OSes on your machine,

187
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,440
if you've installed, say, Pop OS in one area

188
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,080
and Fedora on another, maybe you've

189
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,640
got multiple users involved and the UIDs and GIDs

190
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,720
don't map up, we've all been there, right?

191
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,100
You mount something, you want to go grab some files

192
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,200
from the other file system, and, oh, I've

193
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,560
kind of elevated to root privileges

194
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,160
because I'm a different user and I don't own these files.

195
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,080
And then when you add in containers,

196
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,840
it just gets way more complicated

197
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,000
because, of course, containers often use username spaces,

198
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,040
which is a way of mapping different UIDs and GIDs

199
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,160
inside that process.

200
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,800
You can have a whole new set of users isolated

201
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,720
in that container that map to real users on the host system.

202
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,440
Maybe you've run into this where you're

203
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
doing some stuff in a container.

204
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,280
Maybe you've got it downloading files or doing backups.

205
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,680
And you've also got to deal with these darn permissions.

206
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,200
Now, a lot of people come into contact with this

207
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,560
if they're using some of those great Linux server I.O.

208
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,880
images because they've done some stuff where you can specify

209
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,160
P, UID, PGID stuff to customize what UIDs and GIDs get handled

210
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,560
in the container.

211
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,520
And that works, but it takes a lot of planning.

212
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,640
You've kind of got to orchestrate it.

213
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,040
You've got to have a consistent set of IDs.

214
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,800
And that just doesn't work for everything,

215
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,560
let alone fancier use cases like systemd homed,

216
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,720
which has some ideas about decoupling

217
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,360
these hard-coded UIDs and GIDs from the actual user identity.

218
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,680
We just can't do that today.

219
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,080
Yeah, and so practically speaking,

220
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,280
so you're running a Plex app or MB or something like that,

221
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,960
Jellyfin, in a container.

222
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,800
And you add a bunch of files as one user to your file system,

223
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,400
but that UID doesn't match up with what

224
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,200
the user is inside that container.

225
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
And so you just get a permissions error.

226
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,440
Your files don't show up.

227
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,600
I think this is a super common problem for new users that

228
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,640
are hosting their files or people that are trying

229
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,080
to execute applications that have

230
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,840
to interact with the host file system in some crazy scary way.

231
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,160
This is going to be a no-brainer,

232
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,880
but I thought we would let Christian

233
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,080
explain sort of why it matters.

234
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,400
And this is hopefully going to be

235
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,380
pretty useful for the container use case

236
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,480
when you want to share the same root

237
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,400
of S between different containers,

238
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,640
when you want to share with different ID mappings,

239
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,160
when you want to share data between privileged and

240
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,120
unprivileged containers, so containers making

241
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,680
use of username spaces and containers not making

242
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,360
use of username spaces.

243
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,320
Or you want to have something that SystemD

244
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,440
has been working on, portable home directories, where

245
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,040
you can expose the same USB stick with different UID

246
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:32,680
and GID to multiple owners, basically decoupling the file

247
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:38,520
ownership, file ownership, making it more flexible.

248
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,120
And you don't need to have a fixed UID or GID

249
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,200
when you log into a system anymore.

250
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,880
While we are on the subject of containers,

251
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,240
Fedora not too long ago made the move

252
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,840
to cgroups version 2, which has been around forever.

253
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,780
And it appears 2110 will also be making that transition.

254
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,920
And they'll be setting cgroups version 2 as enabled by default

255
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,600
in Ubuntu 2110.

256
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,760
It should make a lot of these complicated container

257
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,640
scenarios a lot easier to deal with.

258
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,680
ID map mounts came with support for ext4, XFS, and FAT32

259
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,400
by default. But ButterFS, well, it just wasn't in there

260
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,440
because they've already made the changes to the VFS

261
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,960
layer in the kernel, but you also

262
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,520
needed changes per file system.

263
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,880
So finally, coming soon, full ID map mount

264
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,040
support for ButterFS.

265
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,240
Dun, dun, dun, dun.

266
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,760
Yes, and it looks like in Linux 5.15

267
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,280
is probably when we can expect that, so that's great to see.

268
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,920
Fedora 35 has added a nice feature

269
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,360
that I'm kind of surprised wasn't in there, actually.

270
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,180
In Fedora 35, user services will be restarted

271
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,640
on package upgrades now.

272
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,100
I mean, that's nice because it's going to allow user services

273
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,680
like PipeWire to seamlessly restart when upgrading rather

274
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,520
than needing to reboot the entire box.

275
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,600
And I always wondered why Fedora seemed

276
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,440
like the most insistent distro on rebooting after an update.

277
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,240
I mean, I figured it was good hygiene.

278
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,800
I never even stopped to think about it

279
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,400
was a service level thing.

280
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,080
Now, Fedora currently allows restarting system services

281
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,160
automatically when upgrading the packages for those services,

282
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,520
but that's only at the system level.

283
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,800
There really hasn't been that capability for stuff that

284
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,280
runs at the user level, like Pulse or PipeWire or anything

285
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,520
that's not running in the system instance of systemd.

286
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,440
Why did this support take so long?

287
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,840
Well, Fedora wanted to have it, but the technical details

288
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,640
behind the scenes are not trivial

289
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,160
because when you're running these upgrades as root,

290
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,280
you've got to reach from that privileged context

291
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,480
way down into the unprivileged user-managed instances

292
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,840
of systemd.

293
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,640
That finally got added upstream in systemd,

294
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,080
so Fedora can do this in a non-hacky manner.

295
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,640
That's kind of the key thing when

296
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,200
I think about what I like when I use Fedora.

297
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,680
And when people ask me about Fedora,

298
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,640
I have a hard time putting my finger on it.

299
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,600
I can say, oh, they have leading edge packages,

300
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,360
but it's actually this stuff.

301
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,120
When they want to do something like this,

302
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,000
they build it in at the system level.

303
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,760
One route would be to just do some sort of hacky post script

304
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,640
that you execute, and maybe you ask a user

305
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,920
to put their pseudo password in or something like that,

306
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,320
and you could get it done with something like that.

307
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,360
But what they've done is they've taken the route

308
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,360
of going all the way upstream, so that it's

309
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,360
baked into the system now.

310
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,280
And that's going to be maintainable.

311
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,520
That's going to be supportable.

312
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,920
It's going to be obvious to other developers.

313
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,560
And you're right.

314
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,960
This is exactly the kind of correctness thing.

315
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,000
DNF might be slower than I'd like sometimes,

316
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,680
but it really makes me happy that I feel confident

317
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,200
I can do an upgrade, maybe even a new release of Fedora type

318
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,960
upgrade.

319
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,880
And all this stuff, it's been thought of,

320
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,280
taken care of very carefully.

321
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,320
This is something that's been really

322
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,960
wanted for a really long time.

323
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,280
Because some years ago, we decided

324
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,440
to start migrating the GNOME user session

325
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,640
from running in its own privileged context

326
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,280
than it would do its own user session management

327
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,160
to using system to user.

328
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,640
This actually also happened with Fedora Linux 34 for KDE Plasma

329
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,600
as well.

330
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,120
And that change means that when you

331
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,840
do upgrades of the desktop environment,

332
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,440
we actually can't do anything to make sure everything,

333
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,680
like services get restarted in an orderly fashion,

334
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,440
especially desktop services.

335
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,600
And even with all these changes that have been now,

336
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,800
like it's still not entirely the best.

337
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,440
Because again, we're reaching down from root

338
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,240
down into individual users.

339
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,120
And while the logic is very good, it is not perfect.

340
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,680
The whole idea of doing offline updates and those kinds of

341
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,480
things is basically to guarantee, as much as we can,

342
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,880
consistency between transition states of software.

343
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,800
Because then we're not running the user services

344
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,880
when we're doing the offline update,

345
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,040
because we only go up to just enough

346
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,160
to start PackageKit and Plymouth to print out the output.

347
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,520
And then when it's done, we start back up again.

348
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,600
And this even includes not bringing up network

349
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,160
during offline upgrades.

350
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,880
So a lot of like sensitive finicky things

351
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,960
that tend to break when you're doing an online upgrade

352
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,320
are just simply aren't running.

353
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,760
And while this does definitely improve

354
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,120
like some of the individual cases,

355
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,840
like if you're just doing a DNF upgrade,

356
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,280
when you're running in your desktop,

357
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,960
a lot of those services will restart correctly.

358
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,600
It's still not perfect.

359
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,960
And we're probably not going to roll back

360
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,640
using offline updates by default,

361
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,200
because we wanna provide a consistent usable experience

362
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,320
rather than kind of crossing our fingers

363
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,320
and hoping that we play whack-a-mole properly.

364
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,720
Right, right.

365
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Yeah, it's nice to see it landing.

366
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,360
And it's a great example of some of the thought and care

367
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,200
and intentionality that goes into Fedora

368
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,520
and how that stuff lands upstream.

369
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,720
And then it's how it is done.

370
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,080
And that's what I like about being a Fedora user.

371
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,520
Lino.com slash unplugged.

372
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,720
Go there to get $100 in credit

373
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,760
for 60 days on your new account.

374
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,320
And you go there to support the show.

375
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,800
Linode is how we host everything these days.

376
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,760
Everything we've built in the last couple of years, Linode.

377
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,000
And this episode right here

378
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,200
marks our one-year anniversary of going independent.

379
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,160
And Linode was one of the very first companies

380
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,560
that jumped in to make it possible.

381
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,800
And they are still here with us one year later,

382
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,360
and they helped make the meetup possible.

383
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,720
This is a special company.

384
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,240
And I've had a chance now to work with them

385
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,480
on a business level.

386
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,600
I've had a chance to meet them individually here in town.

387
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,880
And I had a chance to put on a party with them.

388
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,560
But also they've been there supporting us

389
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,400
as we've grown now over this last year,

390
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,840
now that we're independent.

391
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,520
And a huge part of that is you participating in this

392
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,720
by going to linode.com slash unplugged,

393
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,600
or by linking somebody to that when they need to sign up,

394
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,800
taking advantage of our sponsors' offer

395
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,480
and telling them there's value here

396
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,280
in supporting these guys.

397
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,200
Every step of the way since 2003,

398
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,000
Linode has been dedicated to building

399
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,560
awesome, awesome cloud hosting.

400
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,120
Really, if it runs on Linux,

401
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,520
you can run it on Linode.

402
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,440
Recently, we started experimenting

403
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,400
with just offloading, just build jobs.

404
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,560
When I say build jobs, I don't mean software,

405
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,600
like I'm like building some sort of software project,

406
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,880
although I could see doing that actually.

407
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,680
I mean, our projects, like our production projects.

408
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,840
We will upload as a team,

409
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,840
we'll put all of our clips for the day up on object storage.

410
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,600
So we've done that on this trip,

411
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,680
is use Linode S3 compatible object storage

412
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,600
as a way to stash stuff and exchange files around it.

413
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,400
There was a point in time where we were mixing cameras

414
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,480
and mics with the Linode guys who were down here

415
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,720
capturing some stuff for their YouTube channel.

416
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,920
And it just made sense to just put it all up

417
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,000
on Linode object storage.

418
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,960
And it's a quick, easy way to collaborate.

419
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,520
And they really have made their dashboards

420
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,800
simple and easy to understand.

421
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,720
So if you've been using server stuff like forever,

422
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,600
you're gonna be fine, like you're gonna love it.

423
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,440
But if you're brand new, don't feel intimidated.

424
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,760
It's actually really approachable

425
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,360
and they've got great guides and they have fantastic,

426
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,160
well, really the best customer support in the business

427
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,040
by phone or by ticket.

428
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,320
And long timers like us,

429
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,400
we can tell that the people that build this product,

430
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,480
they're Linux enthusiasts.

431
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,160
You know how you can kind of just like suss that out

432
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,480
by using something, yeah, Linode's one of those things.

433
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,160
And so go see how much you can do with a $5 a month rig

434
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,080
or go see how much you can do with one of their fancy

435
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,720
AMD Epic dedicated CPU systems,

436
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,320
because you're gonna get $100 to kick the tires.

437
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,920
You can really try this thing out.

438
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:24,480
You can really put it to the test at really no cost to you.

439
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,160
And it's a great way to support the show.

440
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,360
So that's linode.com slash unplugged.

441
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,960
Go there, sign up, get $100 in 60 day credit

442
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,560
and you support the show, linode.com slash unplugged.

443
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,160
Well, we did all get together here in Denver

444
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,000
and it was a great time.

445
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,480
And we wanted to share a little bit of that experience

446
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,960
with you because I don't know,

447
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,200
it felt like after something monumental like that happened,

448
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,640
we needed a way to like convey it to the audience

449
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,600
and share it a little bit.

450
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,640
It was an unbelievable time, I gotta say.

451
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,280
The number of people we met,

452
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,120
the broad range of people that we met,

453
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,760
I guess is one way to put it.

454
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,600
That is true.

455
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,440
Like a lot of characters,

456
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,440
and you know what's funny too, Brent,

457
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,480
is like some people just wanted to only talk about Linux

458
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,320
and other people were like,

459
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,120
I'm not talking about Linux at all while I'm here tonight.

460
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,520
It's true.

461
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,480
It's very true.

462
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,040
You and I were kind of bouncing around

463
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,720
and with the rest of the team, which was super fun,

464
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,600
but yeah, you never really knew what to expect

465
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,840
when you would kind of lock eyes with someone

466
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,040
and be like, hey, we haven't quite met yet.

467
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,880
How are you?

468
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,720
You know, it's funny.

469
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,120
I think there's an element that we all know we're nerds.

470
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,720
Like we're here, we were at that meetup for a reason,

471
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,200
following Linux, open source,

472
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,280
didn't really matter your experience level.

473
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,560
I think just knowing you have that common base

474
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,680
makes the rest of just interacting with people easier.

475
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,560
Yeah, it's totally it.

476
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,200
It's sort of like you have the shows to go to,

477
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,640
you have the hosts you could have a laugh about,

478
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,240
or you have Linux you could talk about.

479
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
So there's a lot of,

480
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,800
it's really easy to get a conversation going,

481
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,200
even for people who aren't great

482
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,320
at getting a conversation going.

483
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,560
So before we tell you the story of the meetup,

484
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,000
I want to tell you a story that took place eight days

485
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,800
before the meetup-ish.

486
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,600
And we had left Cheyenne, Wyoming,

487
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,020
but we ended up with like an extra day in our schedule.

488
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,920
And we weren't ready to get down into Denver

489
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,140
because of the noise and the parking situation

490
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,200
and tank capacity, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

491
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,540
And our campground reservations in Cheyenne were over

492
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,160
and we weren't gonna spend any more money

493
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,160
at this campground, we were done.

494
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,000
So we thought, let's be bold, let's set off,

495
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,780
we will find some place along the way to camp

496
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,480
and to record Linux action news.

497
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,600
And so we did just that,

498
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,120
we got about 20 miles down the road

499
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,480
and then we stopped at a rest stop

500
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,200
and Brent and I broke off into the car

501
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,320
and we went and did some reconnaissance searching

502
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,600
at a popular camping area, which was totally packed.

503
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,040
Packed and kind of off road.

504
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,340
Yeah, it was a little rough.

505
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,680
I mean, it was nice.

506
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:52,160
It was like a choice spot in Nebraska,

507
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,440
but it just wasn't gonna work for us.

508
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,620
And so we were a little concerned

509
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,960
because what you gotta do

510
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,300
is you gotta get a nice mix of solar.

511
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,220
We have to have a decent spot to record,

512
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,280
so it needs to be quiet,

513
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,520
ideally quieter than we're at right now.

514
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,040
And we have to have good cell signal

515
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,140
because we're doing some of this stuff live

516
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,880
and you need enough bandwidth to be able to live stream.

517
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,160
And so it was looking pretty rough.

518
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,240
We weren't finding anything in Western Nebraska

519
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,600
and we just didn't want to admit

520
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,240
that we were getting pretty desperate.

521
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,960
But we're totally desperate now.

522
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,360
We are just kind of driving down the road,

523
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,980
scouting for places to pull off

524
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,800
or anything that's clever.

525
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,760
I'm looking at every dirt patch we can find.

526
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,480
We're gonna go look at the next town.

527
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,900
We're just desperate to find a quiet area

528
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,480
and Brent's a man on a mission.

529
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,400
I'm trying my best to make things better,

530
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,200
but I can't will these spots to just appear.

531
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,400
And he's also a role in the tunes for us.

532
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,960
He's our tune master.

533
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,920
So I'm curious, what was going through your head

534
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,200
as we're not finding anything

535
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,920
and we're driving the empty roads of flat Nebraska?

536
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,320
Did you think we were screwed?

537
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,960
Well, it was gorgeous out there, I gotta say.

538
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,120
I think my job is to try to calm you down

539
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,080
in those situations.

540
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,320
Well, you're managing me?

541
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,840
Amazing.

542
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,320
And so I was secretly thinking,

543
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,760
oh man, this is like how much further are we gonna drive?

544
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,240
This just doesn't make any sense.

545
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,640
Hadid was checking us on the find my friends thing

546
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,040
and she said, she was like, where are you going?

547
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,320
Why are you guys still going?

548
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,520
You're going the wrong direction.

549
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,360
We're just going.

550
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,200
Bye, Hadid.

551
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,800
And I'm like, I know we're gonna find something.

552
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,200
I know we're gonna find something.

553
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,720
And actually, we got lucky.

554
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,440
We found a golf course and it looks like they allow RVs

555
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
to park here and camp here.

556
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,440
It's quiet, it's beautiful.

557
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,720
And that's a cell tower right there.

558
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,120
Sure, it's like 200 feet that way.

559
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,640
So hopefully, we're walking in right now,

560
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,800
we're gonna go ask them if they're cool with us parking here.

561
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,320
So Lady Jups wasn't there yet.

562
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,960
So we were in the reconnaissance car,

563
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,360
just trying to figure out if it's okay.

564
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,840
And normally, I don't just go walking into some golf course

565
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,040
that I've never been to and ask them

566
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,240
if I could park my RV there.

567
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,320
But I had Harvest Host in my pocket.

568
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,160
Oh man, this would be a good sponsorship opportunity,

569
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,580
but I just am a big fan.

570
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,580
Hey there.

571
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,580
Hey guys.

572
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,580
I'm a Harvest Host member

573
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,580
and I saw that you guys are part of that program.

574
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,580
Yeah.

575
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,580
I've got a rig.

576
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,580
I wouldn't mind parking here.

577
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,580
I just wanted to check with you first.

578
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
Yeah, of course.

579
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,580
See, what the deal is.

580
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,580
So, can I get a name?

581
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,580
Yeah, Chris Fischer.

582
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:26,580
F-I-S-A-G-R.

583
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,580
That's a good phone number.

584
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,580
I'll give you my wife's, because that's probably the truth.

585
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,580
Which you'd think I'd have memorized.

586
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,580
So with the rig, I'm gonna have to get a name.

587
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,580
I'll give you my wife's, because that's probably the truth.

588
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,580
Which you'd think I'd have memorized.

589
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,580
So with the rig, there's this truck parking.

590
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,580
Yeah, we saw that pulling in.

591
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,580
Yeah, just anywhere in that lot you can park.

592
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,580
Awesome.

593
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,580
Looks like a beautiful place.

594
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,580
Our rig is just a little bit down the road.

595
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,580
We thought we'd just head out and just check it out.

596
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,580
It looks great.

597
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,580
All right, we'll be back in just a little bit.

598
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,580
Thanks guys.

599
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,580
Have fun guys.

600
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:02,580
Well, I think that's gonna work freaking perfect.

601
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,580
It's just when I thought we were out of luck.

602
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,580
I know.

603
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,580
It was just we were going down the road and I'm like,

604
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,580
you know what, I'm gonna open up the Harvest Host app

605
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,580
and check our location and just see what pops up.

606
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,580
And it was five minutes down the road from where we were

607
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,580
at almost the point of just giving up.

608
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,580
That's perfect.

609
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,580
Yeah, this is gonna work though.

610
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,580
And it's gonna be quiet.

611
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,580
We should be able to record land.

612
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,580
No problem.

613
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Look at us solving problems.

614
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,580
What was that?

615
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:30,580
Oh, that's just a golf ball hitting juice.

616
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,580
It turned out to be a really nice spot.

617
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,580
It was hot, but that first night,

618
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,580
I mean, how would you describe that first night?

619
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,580
It was like Nebraska was giving us a show.

620
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,580
Yeah, I didn't quite know what to expect from Nebraska,

621
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,580
but we parked and it was a little, you know,

622
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,580
it was early enough that we could just relax

623
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:49,580
without needing to get to, you know, setting everything up.

624
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,580
And then-

625
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,580
That amazing sunset we had.

626
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,580
We just, yeah, turned into the sunset

627
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,580
and it turned out it was like nothing I've ever seen.

628
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,580
And then it turned into a thunder and lightning storm

629
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,580
that sort of formed a U shape around us

630
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,580
and it was far enough away we couldn't hear the thunder.

631
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,580
So we just saw lightning all night long

632
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,580
in a U shape around us.

633
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,580
And then where the clouds were not,

634
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,580
there was the sky and it was so bright.

635
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,580
You could easily, just easily see the Milky Way.

636
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,580
And we saw several shooting stars.

637
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,580
The moon was out as well.

638
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,580
And I think we even spotted Jupiter.

639
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,580
Yeah, that's right.

640
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
Yeah, I forgot about that.

641
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,580
Yeah, that was sort of symbolic in a way.

642
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,580
It was, Jupiter was bright.

643
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,580
It was unbelievably bright in the sky.

644
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,580
It was so bright we brought out the apps to double check

645
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,580
actually what we were seeing.

646
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,580
It was like it was Jupiter was shining down on us.

647
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,580
It was a really, really nice time.

648
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,580
We spent a night there.

649
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,580
We spent a day there working.

650
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,580
Brent and I did, Dia took the kids back to Cheyenne

651
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,580
to entertain them while Brent and I got some work done.

652
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,580
And then it was time to wrap up so we can get into Denver.

653
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,580
I just had to take one more walk

654
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,580
to just soak in this Nebraska view.

655
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,580
You know, online people have been mocking Nebraska

656
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,580
for being flat, but I'd say it's kind of roly-poly

657
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,580
where we're at.

658
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,580
Lots of hills.

659
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,580
It's beautiful.

660
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,580
And in the evenings, it's just incredible.

661
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:14,580
I mean, the temperatures today were harsh.

662
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,580
I think it may have gotten up to 120 degrees in my front cab

663
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:20,580
where I was recording Linux Action News today.

664
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,580
But it's so much better now.

665
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:27,580
And we're packing up to head into Denver.

666
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,580
I could have waited an extra day

667
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,580
here in our golf course.

668
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,580
But we do have to press on.

669
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,580
We have much to do.

670
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Denver is going to be very busy.

671
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,580
And Brent has a lady he'd like to see.

672
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,580
And I think it's been hard waiting here in Nebraska.

673
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,580
And he's ready to get in there.

674
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,580
So we're going to pull together and do an evening drive

675
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,580
as a crew.

676
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,580
It'll probably be dark by the time we get to Denver.

677
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,580
But it might mean the roads are clear.

678
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,580
Oh, man.

679
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,580
They were clear, but those were some rough roads.

680
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,580
Yeah.

681
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:05,580
We had nice sailing for the first maybe quarter of the drive.

682
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:09,580
And then it just got worse and worse and worse.

683
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
Yeah.

684
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,580
It got really, really, really, really bad.

685
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,580
I think we took some damage to our slide that's already damaged.

686
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,580
Now, what was it about the roads, Chris?

687
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,580
It's the cement.

688
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,580
And it's the way the cement sort of settles down.

689
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,580
And then the snow plows come.

690
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,580
And because the cement has settled, the plow hits that bit of cement

691
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,580
that's sticking up.

692
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:36,580
And bam, creates a huge, huge rivet in the road that my tires hit.

693
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,580
Not that I've been listening to the Idaho Road Podcast or anything.

694
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,580
Never.

695
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,580
But we got down there to System 76's office at like 11 o'clock at night,

696
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,580
11, 30, noon.

697
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,580
Brent took off.

698
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,580
And it was just the kids and Hadia and I.

699
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
And it was toasty.

700
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,580
But we woke up that morning to hugs from the System 76 crew.

701
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,580
We got the cheese tour.

702
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
Then I did COTA radio.

703
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:00,580
And it was just a blur.

704
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,580
We spent some time at Emma's, which was amazing.

705
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,580
Emma is an incredible hostess.

706
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,580
Really made everybody feel like they were at home.

707
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,580
And her home was everyone's home, which was amazing,

708
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,580
especially when we've been in a small RV for a few weeks.

709
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,580
That was really just great to see her, too.

710
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,580
And the whole System 76 crew.

711
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,580
And it went by.

712
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,580
It felt like two days.

713
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,580
I didn't even spend a single night at the Airbnb.

714
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,580
The rest of the crew did.

715
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,580
I know you had the intention.

716
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,580
But it was just there was so much going on and balancing all the things.

717
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,580
Well, and Wes and I have that feud going.

718
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,580
Yeah.

719
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,580
I mean, it's hard for us to be in the same room for very long

720
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,580
without awkwardness coming up.

721
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,580
You guys got to solve that.

722
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,580
Yeah, I know.

723
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,580
I know.

724
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,580
But in the meantime, I just stayed in the RV.

725
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,580
But Denver's real kind of treat for it.

726
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,580
Well, there was two things, actually.

727
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,580
I think I have to give a special shout out to Listener Mike,

728
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,580
who took as many of the crew up in his Cessna that asked to go.

729
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,580
And we got an aerial tour of Denver from Listener Mike.

730
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,580
And he was so chill about the whole thing.

731
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,580
He just, oh, yeah, next crew.

732
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,580
Bring them up.

733
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,580
There's a storm coming.

734
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,580
No problem.

735
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,580
Let's bring up another crew.

736
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,580
Yeah, yeah.

737
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,580
And I got to go up with Dylan.

738
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,580
He only did two of us at a time, so it took a few times

739
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,580
because a lot of us wanted to go.

740
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,580
And so I got to go up with my boy.

741
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,580
And we just have a great memory of that now.

742
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,580
And then I think the other great memory for my son and my daughters

743
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:26,580
as well, actually, was Carl, Carl Weschel from System76,

744
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,580
took him for a spin around the block in his Tesla.

745
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,580
And that was Dylan's first Tesla experience.

746
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,580
You know, I still haven't had one, so he's beating me to it.

747
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,580
I got the full demo.

748
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
I got the self-driving demo and everything.

749
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,580
I heard there's rainbow road mode.

750
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,580
There is a rainbow road mode.

751
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,580
There's also a whoopee cushion mode.

752
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,580
What?

753
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,580
Dylan wouldn't be interested in that.

754
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,580
No, no, no.

755
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,580
They just found it immediately.

756
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,580
But really, it was about Friday.

757
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,580
That's why we were there, right?

758
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
It was Friday after work.

759
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,580
We had a meetup at Pindustry.

760
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,580
And we didn't really know what to expect.

761
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,580
I think there was like 50-ish on the meetup page maybe.

762
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:59,580
And, you know, with Delta variant and stuff,

763
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,580
I know some people are concerned, and they were worried about that.

764
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,580
And especially in the Denver area,

765
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,580
people are a little more concerned about that right now.

766
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,580
And it wasn't like super well-structured.

767
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,580
It was a little bit like walking in and just

768
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,580
not knowing what you're going to hit.

769
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,580
But what did you walk into, Chris?

770
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,580
Well, like the rock stars that we accidentally were, we showed up late.

771
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,580
We sure did.

772
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,580
To our own party, because we were the ones getting the donuts.

773
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,580
And we had to get 150 Voodoo donuts.

774
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,580
And it takes a while to get 150 donuts.

775
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:29,580
We just don't know about the traffic.

776
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,580
Oh, my god.

777
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,580
It was so bad.

778
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,580
And, you know, oh, and then there was, of course,

779
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,580
the situation where they couldn't find our order,

780
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,580
even though there was a stack of 150 donuts

781
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
right there on the counter.

782
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,580
How many giant orders do you have today?

783
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,580
I mean, come on.

784
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,580
Right?

785
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,580
But we got that sorted.

786
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,580
We showed up, and holy crap was it a party.

787
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:55,580
Linode and our crew that was there got cracking immediately

788
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,580
on getting all the swag set up and getting the pizza deployed.

789
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,580
And Linode picked up drinks.

790
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,580
And so people were getting their orders brought to them

791
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,580
and just like, who do I pay for this?

792
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,580
And we're like, Linode paid.

793
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,580
They were great.

794
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,580
Yeah, and it was just a blast.

795
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:13,580
I think Emma counted somewhere between 80 and 90 people

796
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,580
that showed up.

797
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,580
That's impressive.

798
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,580
Very, very impressive.

799
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580
And thankfully, the way the pinstri is laid out,

800
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,580
they have those big garage doors that opened up

801
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,580
into an outside seating area with a DJ.

802
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,580
So we could kind of sprawl.

803
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,580
And that worked out really well.

804
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,580
Yeah, what I loved is that anywhere you looked,

805
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,580
there was a crew of just our kind talking.

806
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:36,580
So you could just sort of move on to the next conversation

807
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,580
and see what's happening over there.

808
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,580
It was really nice.

809
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,580
My favorite moments, well, there's a couple of them.

810
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:46,580
My favorite moments are when I meet people,

811
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,580
and then it clicks with them that they should probably

812
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,580
tell me what their online handle is.

813
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,580
And then they tell me their IRC or their Telegram or whatever.

814
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,580
And then it's like, oh, I know you.

815
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,580
Oh, hey.

816
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,580
I got to meet Optimus Gray.

817
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,580
Really?

818
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,580
Yeah, that was great.

819
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,580
And he's like, hi, I'm John.

820
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,580
I'm like, OK.

821
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,580
He's like, oh, Optimus Gray.

822
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,580
I'm like, oh, hey, man.

823
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,580
But my favorite moments on this one,

824
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,580
because it kind of happened a few times,

825
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,580
is I would meet somebody, and they would be very nice.

826
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,580
And we'd have our exchanges.

827
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,580
And I kind of have a series of questions

828
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,580
that I've been asking people so I could kind of collect

829
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,580
some anecdotal data in my head.

830
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,580
And then after that gets all done,

831
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,580
they say, have you seen Wes or have you seen Brent?

832
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,580
And then I'd go over to one of them

833
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,580
and be like, there's somebody over there

834
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,580
who would like to see you.

835
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,580
And it's so neat that people are like, I want to meet Brent.

836
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
I want to meet Wes.

837
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
And then I would come back like 15 minutes later,

838
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,580
and Wes would still be talking to them.

839
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,580
And I was like, wow, you really stuck there, Wes.

840
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,580
Well, that's the thing is you just get trapped in a great way

841
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,580
in these amazing conversations.

842
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,580
And with 80 or 90 people, there's just too many to meet.

843
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,580
I got to say, though, that really stands out to me

844
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,580
because everyone is really respectful.

845
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,580
People value that you're caught in a conversation

846
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,580
and are really polite about coming up

847
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,580
and also wanting to say hi.

848
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
Yeah, indeed.

849
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,580
I guess my favorite moment,

850
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,580
and I think you guys are probably going to agree

851
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,580
because it's really hard to top this,

852
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,580
is Listener Jose came out.

853
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,580
Listener Jose, which we're going to have more on him in the future.

854
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,580
Brent did an interview with him.

855
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,580
He has started a company that focuses

856
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,580
on accessibility development for Linux.

857
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,580
Yeah, his business is Blind Penguin,

858
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,580
which I thought was kind of clever.

859
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,580
And he's working really hard to try to make

860
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,580
his own little dream possible,

861
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,580
which is to improve accessibility on Linux,

862
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,580
which for him is essential.

863
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:44,580
And he flat out said is kind of in bad shape

864
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,580
and needs a lot of attention.

865
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,580
Yeah, and Jose himself is blind.

866
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,580
And he flew up by himself from Puerto Rico to the meetup.

867
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,580
He came to Denver for the meetup.

868
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,580
I still can't believe that.

869
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,580
That's amazing.

870
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,580
Thank you, Jose.

871
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,580
And so I'm glad we had a chance to chat with him.

872
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,580
But the other thing that happened that was just perfect

873
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:06,580
is that Linode brought three Raspberry 4 kind of kits

874
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,580
that include everything from the case to the keyboard

875
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,580
to the power, everything, right?

876
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,580
And they had three to give away.

877
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,580
And Jose won the first kit.

878
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,580
And it was kind of a special moment

879
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,580
because I think, Wes, you read it for him, didn't you?

880
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,580
I didn't see it go down.

881
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:27,580
But I think you were involved with Jose actually finding out

882
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,580
that he was the winner because he couldn't tell

883
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,580
because he couldn't read the ticket.

884
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,580
Yeah, I had the privilege of already being, you know,

885
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,580
chatting with Jose there when the raffle started.

886
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,580
And yeah, it was absolutely my honor.

887
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,580
Sure, I was a little disappointed I didn't win,

888
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,580
but this is almost as good.

889
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,580
How disappointed his cheese was.

890
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,580
He was like one number off.

891
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,580
But yeah, so Wes reads it for Jose.

892
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,580
And yeah, sure enough, Jose won the first kit.

893
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,580
So here he is.

894
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
He travels from Puerto Rico.

895
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,580
And he does it blind.

896
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,580
I don't think I could do it myself.

897
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,580
I mean, I would want like somebody to fly with me

898
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,580
just for a companionship and managing that travel.

899
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,580
Then he wins the Raspberry Pi.

900
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,580
But then also what was really special

901
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,580
is Emma hosted an after party for some of us.

902
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,580
And Jose was invited to the after party.

903
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,580
And he just really, he just kind of came to life there.

904
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
And he became the life of the party.

905
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:20,580
He was hilarious.

906
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,580
He was making jokes in four different languages.

907
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,580
I don't know if it was four, but it felt like four.

908
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,580
And he was switching between them

909
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,580
like a polished comedian.

910
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
Such a wonderful guy.

911
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,580
If everybody gets to meet him, I hope

912
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,580
that you take the time to do so.

913
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,580
He's just wonderful.

914
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,580
And then did you guys make sure he got home?

915
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,580
Is that how that went down?

916
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,580
Well, Heather and I and Wes, we were all

917
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,580
getting in the car together.

918
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,580
And Jose got there with us.

919
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,580
And we thought it only responsible to get him

920
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,580
back to where he was going.

921
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:51,580
And so we drove him back all the way downtown to his hotel

922
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,580
and had some amazing conversations.

923
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,580
I kind of, it was late night.

924
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,580
But I didn't want that ride to end.

925
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,580
Amen.

926
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,580
So the meetup itself was fantastic.

927
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,580
And we wanted to share a couple of conversations,

928
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,580
just a couple.

929
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,580
But there will be more in the future.

930
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,580
We're going to have some content from the road.

931
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,580
That'll be exclusive stuff we have soon.

932
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,580
But in the meantime, I wanted to share two chats.

933
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,580
The first is with Canonical's community manager.

934
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,580
And Brent, you had a chance to pull her aside

935
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:21,580
and chat with her about creating friendships for life.

936
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,580
Yeah, this is Monica Madden.

937
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,580
And she, well, I met her in our JB Telegram chat.

938
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,580
And she's been in there for a long time.

939
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,580
I know she's a massive foodie and a big, huge friend

940
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,580
of many of ours.

941
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,580
And I got to sort of meet her and have a conversation.

942
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,580
We met at System 76 and shared like some glances.

943
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,580
And then at the meetup, she was like, oh, your Brent.

944
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,580
Giant hugs and everything, which was really great.

945
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,580
But she was kind enough to get on the microphone with me.

946
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,580
Well, hi, Monica.

947
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,580
Here we are at the Jupiter Broadcasting meetup in Denver.

948
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,580
And I know you've come quite a ways to be here.

949
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,580
Tell me, well, first introduce yourself

950
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,580
and tell us where you're from.

951
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,580
I'm Monica Madden.

952
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,580
In my day job, I'm the Ubuntu community representative

953
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,580
at Canonical.

954
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:17,580
And in everyday life, just a Linux fan,

955
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,580
thanks to my husband, who is here with me,

956
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:24,580
but is pool sharking the Linode guys as we speak.

957
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,580
We came from Atlanta.

958
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,580
We flew out to Kansas City, though,

959
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,580
where we met up with Tyler Brown.

960
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,580
And we had a rather epic road trip yesterday.

961
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,580
Took us about eight hours to get here.

962
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:42,580
But it's been an incredible day.

963
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,580
And I got to meet one of my new coworkers at Canonical,

964
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:50,580
who lives in the springs, and she drove up.

965
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:55,580
So this has been my first Linux meetup in person.

966
00:36:55,580 --> 00:37:00,580
And the energy and the excitement

967
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:03,580
and just the genuine friendship and care,

968
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:08,580
I see why people miss these things so much and do them.

969
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:13,580
Yeah, there's this real passion and care

970
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,580
that you get out of everybody here.

971
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,580
Everyone has this project they're passionate about

972
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,580
or this community they're passionate about

973
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,580
or some people they're passionate about meeting,

974
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,580
which I find super contagious.

975
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,580
And I have to say, I find your energy super contagious

976
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,580
in terms of community stuff.

977
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,580
So thank you for doing all of that.

978
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,580
You're welcome.

979
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:34,580
One thing I wanted to ask was,

980
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,580
how is it meeting folks in person versus,

981
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,580
because I know you've built these rich relationships online

982
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,580
through Jupiter Broadcasting's Telegram, for instance.

983
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,580
You've built these rich sort of relationships,

984
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:51,580
and yet now you're getting to sort of blend those into faces.

985
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:52,580
How's that?

986
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:56,580
Well, I think a lot of the interactions we've had today

987
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:01,580
have just shown that those relationships

988
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,580
aren't just superficial and aren't just online.

989
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,580
Today, she's invited us to System76 for a tour.

990
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,580
And we walk in the building and everyone's like,

991
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,580
okay, hi, and we're like, hey, we're here for cheese.

992
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:20,580
And he came out and we just hugged like we had known each other

993
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:25,580
in person for years instead of online for years.

994
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,580
And when we were doing the tour,

995
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,580
we went to the little beer garden area

996
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,580
and there all of you were.

997
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,580
And as soon as we heard your voices, it's like,

998
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,580
and it's funny because I think I asked you all to talk

999
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,580
so I could identify you by your voices.

1000
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,580
Like, I could tell Chris,

1001
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,580
you're exactly like I thought you would be.

1002
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,580
And I'm like, you know what, you and cheese are, and you,

1003
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:53,580
you're exactly what I thought you would be,

1004
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,580
unless you're living some duplicitous life

1005
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,580
and you're hiding it really well.

1006
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,580
Well, that's so wonderful to hear.

1007
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,580
And thank you so much for making the trek out here.

1008
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,580
It's been a real pleasure meeting you in person.

1009
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,580
And I'm sure all of these relationships

1010
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,580
will just continue and get richer.

1011
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,580
So thanks for being a part of all this.

1012
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,580
All right.

1013
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,580
Well, thank you.

1014
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,580
And thank you for putting this all together.

1015
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,580
It's wonderful.

1016
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,580
We're not even really done yet.

1017
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,580
We still have another micro meetup to do here in Colorado Springs.

1018
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,580
I'm curious how you bumped into Derek

1019
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,580
and discovered the little device you brought with him.

1020
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,580
Well, you know, I hadn't discovered that little device yet,

1021
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,580
but when I walked in,

1022
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,580
he was the guy with the biggest smile in the room.

1023
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
And so for me, that's like,

1024
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,580
oh, this person's got to be pretty interesting.

1025
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,580
So I walked up to him and had a great little conversation.

1026
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,580
I was like, wait, wait, wait, stop.

1027
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
We got to get this on the microphone.

1028
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,580
And it just so happened you were there too.

1029
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,580
So we are here at the meetup.

1030
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,580
Tell me your name and where you're from.

1031
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,580
I'm Derek Parks.

1032
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,580
I'm from Denver, Colorado.

1033
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,580
Great.

1034
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,580
And then I see you have this wonderful gadget in your hands

1035
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,580
that you're super excited to tell us about.

1036
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,580
Go ahead.

1037
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580
Tell us all about it.

1038
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,580
So as part of the pandemic, you know, stuck at home,

1039
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:06,580
I've been working on my current sensor.

1040
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:12,580
So it's an ESP-01 and it runs ESP Home.

1041
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,580
It's got completely assembled boards.

1042
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:19,580
I have no affiliation with these fabs out of China,

1043
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,580
but it is amazing what they will make

1044
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,580
and send to your house in three weeks now.

1045
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,580
So I won't say their name,

1046
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,580
but I will post all of this at some point.

1047
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:30,580
And it's pretty crazy.

1048
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:33,580
So it has a clamp current sensor.

1049
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,580
I put it on the hot tub.

1050
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,580
I put it on the dryer and on my desktop.

1051
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:43,580
It all comes into Home Assistant and MQTT, all of that.

1052
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,580
So then you can like show the wife how much power

1053
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,580
that the hot tub is using.

1054
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,580
And she says it's worth it.

1055
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,580
So, Chris, I see you getting very excited about this.

1056
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,580
Tell me what's going through your head.

1057
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,580
I mean, what's going through my head

1058
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,580
is monitoring my solar generation

1059
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,580
using a clamp system like this.

1060
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
This is something Alex and I have been talking about for weeks.

1061
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,580
And I've been missing the piece of like

1062
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:05,580
what piece of technology to use to actually monitor it.

1063
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,580
I knew it would be a clamp of some form.

1064
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,580
And how long did it take you to kind of dream this up

1065
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,580
and make it all happen?

1066
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,580
So it's been, it was probably only actually a couple weeks,

1067
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:16,580
maybe a month of dev.

1068
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,580
I wrote a ton of software on my own,

1069
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:22,580
and then I was like, oh, ESPM does it way better

1070
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,580
than I ever did and everything.

1071
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,580
So that's kind of like the whole route or whatever.

1072
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,580
But yeah, I need to post it all

1073
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,580
and make it so that other people can use it.

1074
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,580
I told my wife, I was like, you need to sell these things.

1075
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:41,580
And I was like, I'll make tens of dollars.

1076
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:44,580
This must be a scratching your own itch kind of project.

1077
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:47,580
So what solution did you solve?

1078
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,580
So this was more just like trying to figure out,

1079
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,580
I have solar at home too,

1080
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,580
and trying to figure out where the power is going.

1081
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,580
And like, okay, you know, is it the hot tub or is it the AC?

1082
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,580
What are we doing?

1083
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,580
It's both, yes.

1084
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,580
It's all of the above.

1085
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:07,580
So yeah, it's very much scratching your own itch

1086
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,580
and also learning.

1087
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,580
So just like learning how to use KiCad,

1088
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,580
how to, KiCad, I don't know how to say it.

1089
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,580
Whatever one.

1090
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:17,580
Just like learning, you know, scratching your own itch

1091
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:20,580
and then learning how to get stuff made.

1092
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,580
And it's crazy what they will assemble

1093
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,580
and send to your home for you.

1094
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:28,580
And so if you had to sort of describe physically

1095
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,580
what we're looking at for the listeners, could you?

1096
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:34,580
Yeah, so it is an ESP-01,

1097
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:39,580
which is like a standard ESP-8266 board

1098
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,580
that you can get wherever.

1099
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,580
And it has headers coming out of it,

1100
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,580
going into a board that I had fabbed in China

1101
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:50,580
that has a USB header on it

1102
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:56,580
and an ADC thing

1103
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,580
and a clamp sensor plugged into it.

1104
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:02,580
And so tell me a little bit about what was the motivation

1105
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,580
to come here today, to the meetup,

1106
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,580
and what you're getting out of it.

1107
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,580
So I've been listening to Chris in my ears

1108
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,580
while I'm writing code for, I don't know,

1109
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,580
10 or 15 years now,

1110
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,580
and it was just like so weird and kind of crazy

1111
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:22,580
of like, oh, I've known this person in my ears for 15 years,

1112
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,580
and I feel like I know so much about him,

1113
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,580
but he's never met me before.

1114
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,580
It's kind of a weird feeling,

1115
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,580
but it's so nice to actually meet him in person,

1116
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
and he's such a great guy,

1117
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,580
so happy and lively in person.

1118
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,580
It is just a really great experience.

1119
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,580
Chris, you're blushing over here.

1120
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:42,580
Just saying it in front of my kid is embarrassing.

1121
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,580
And so I would imagine you're getting to meet

1122
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,580
a bunch of other great people as well.

1123
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:47,580
Is that feeling nice?

1124
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,580
Yeah, it's so great to just show up somewhere

1125
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,580
and get to meet people.

1126
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,580
I walked in a little bit early, and it was like,

1127
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:58,580
oh, okay, that person, I know that's a JB person.

1128
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,580
And just go up and you have kind of this shared background

1129
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:02,580
and relationship.

1130
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:04,580
You can just start a conversation with somebody,

1131
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,580
and it's really fun.

1132
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,580
Yeah, that to me feels like a relief

1133
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:12,580
for the last year or two that we've had.

1134
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:15,580
It's so nice to see people in person

1135
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,580
and be able to put faces to the names and voices.

1136
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,580
And so thank you so, so much for making your way out here.

1137
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,580
We really appreciate it.

1138
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:24,580
Cheers.

1139
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,580
It was really amazing to meet you too, Brent,

1140
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,580
and so fun.

1141
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,580
As we were listening to that,

1142
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,580
I was just reliving the whole thing.

1143
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,580
It was really nice.

1144
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,580
Yeah, you can hear the music going in the background.

1145
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,580
The band's there.

1146
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,580
There is a bunch of tables

1147
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,580
where people are just sitting and chatting, eating pizza

1148
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,580
or stuffing their faces with donuts.

1149
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:46,580
And then there was a glass balcony area up above,

1150
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:49,580
a rooftop area,

1151
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,580
and you could watch the freaking gorgeous sunset

1152
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,580
as it set behind the Rockies.

1153
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,580
I mean, it was like,

1154
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:56,580
just a lot of us had to go upstairs

1155
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:57,580
and just watch it for a bit.

1156
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,580
Yeah, Colorado certainly has some of those,

1157
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,580
and they're breathtaking.

1158
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,580
No camera ever makes it the same as just standing there,

1159
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,580
taking it in.

1160
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,580
Yep, for sure.

1161
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,580
And everybody was really great.

1162
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,580
Everybody was really nice.

1163
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,580
It was a great meetup,

1164
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,580
and the journey does continue.

1165
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:18,580
The Colony Tracker will stay up for a bit longer.

1166
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:20,580
In fact, I'm going to make my way down to Tucson,

1167
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,580
then back up to Colorado is the plan now for a bit,

1168
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,580
and then I'll start making my way home,

1169
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:26,580
and knowing me,

1170
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,580
I'll probably end up swinging through Montana

1171
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,580
because I just love it there.

1172
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,580
So the ColonyTracker.live is where you want to go.

1173
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:33,580
ColonyTracker.live,

1174
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,580
that's where you can find the map

1175
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,580
and the micro meetup link

1176
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,580
if you want to grab lunch, breakfast, or dinner at some point.

1177
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,580
I'm not exactly sure what I'll be doing while I'm in Tucson.

1178
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,580
I might, I don't know.

1179
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,580
I guess I'll have a car.

1180
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,580
I'll have a car, so you never know.

1181
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,580
I guess we could probably make something work.

1182
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:48,580
If you'd like to email the show,

1183
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:51,580
contact us at linuxunplug.com slash contact,

1184
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,580
and the conversation is always rolling

1185
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:56,580
at jupitabroadcasting.com slash Telegram.

1186
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,580
That is our Telegram community.

1187
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,580
You can go there, join us,

1188
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,580
and a lot of our hosts are in there,

1189
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,580
popping in all the time,

1190
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,580
and then don't forget about the love log.

1191
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,580
If you're feeling like you could use

1192
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,580
a community connection right now,

1193
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,580
this Sunday and every Sunday,

1194
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,580
noon Pacific in our Mumble Room.

1195
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,580
You can get details at linuxunplug.com slash mumble.

1196
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,580
It's the love log,

1197
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,580
and it happens every single Sunday,

1198
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,580
and it's a great way to connect with people,

1199
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,580
and then you never know,

1200
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:22,580
you may actually end up meeting them in person one day

1201
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,580
when I finally convince you

1202
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,580
to come out to one of these crazy meetups.

1203
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:30,580
Well, it's time for some feedback.

1204
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:34,580
Our friend Squirrely Dave is tiling plasma.

1205
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,580
Hey, Chris and Wes.

1206
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,580
I know Chris has occasionally mentioned

1207
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,580
that he does kind of like KDE Plasma

1208
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,580
as a desktop environment,

1209
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,580
you know, just from time to time.

1210
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,580
Who me?

1211
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,580
I'm with you, Chris.

1212
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,580
I do, however, wish Plasma

1213
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,580
had native tiling functions built in,

1214
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,580
just because I prefer using a single,

1215
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:55,580
very large display over multiple smaller ones.

1216
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,580
And I know Chris has mentioned something in the past

1217
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,580
that, you know, Papa Wes has really introduced

1218
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,580
this sort of casual, easy tiling.

1219
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,580
I'd like that on Plasma.

1220
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,580
Well, in my hunt for a solution,

1221
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,580
I came across a KWin script

1222
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:10,580
that allows for basic tiling.

1223
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,580
And while it's not as robust or comprehensive

1224
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,580
as something like Awesome or i3,

1225
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,580
it gets the job done

1226
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,580
and doesn't require giving up Plasma

1227
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,580
or breaking up all the nifty little things

1228
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,580
that work together to make Plasma

1229
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,580
such an awesome experience.

1230
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:25,580
I thought I'd share it with you,

1231
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,580
just in case you haven't come across it yet.

1232
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,580
It's over on GitHub under kwin-scripts at kwin-tiling.

1233
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:34,580
You know, these KWin scripts sometimes

1234
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,580
actually make their way into genuine features.

1235
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:38,580
Like we're seeing that happen right now

1236
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,580
with any overview functionality.

1237
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,580
So you never know.

1238
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,580
I actually checked this out back in 2019,

1239
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,580
and I didn't end up sticking with it.

1240
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,580
And I was looking at the GitHub,

1241
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,580
and it looks like the last release

1242
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,580
was on July 29, 2020.

1243
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,580
There were some commits eight months ago,

1244
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,580
but nothing too substantial.

1245
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,580
So I'm not sure how active it is anymore.

1246
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,580
But here's what I want, Wes.

1247
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:00,580
You ready?

1248
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,580
Because like Papa Wes got me so close.

1249
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,580
I've now, I have recognized

1250
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,580
there is a place in my life

1251
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,580
and in my heart for tiling.

1252
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,580
And maybe in your studio?

1253
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,580
Definitely.

1254
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,580
And definitely when I'm on the road too.

1255
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,580
I mean, I tell you what,

1256
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,580
on every single machine I use,

1257
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,580
if this one thing were possible,

1258
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,580
I got to have this one thing.

1259
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,580
I got to have it.

1260
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:23,580
And it's tiling,

1261
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:26,580
but on a specific virtual desktop.

1262
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,580
So desktop two and three have tiling,

1263
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,580
but desktop one and four are free floating.

1264
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,580
I got to have it that way.

1265
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:35,580
And if I could get tiling

1266
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,580
just on desktop like two and three or whatever,

1267
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,580
whatever it is,

1268
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,580
and have free floating on other windows,

1269
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,580
perfection.

1270
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,580
And I feel like it's going to happen on Plasma first,

1271
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,580
or I just say this over and over again

1272
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,580
that maybe the guys over at System76

1273
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,580
will just build it into their tiling.

1274
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:52,580
Yeah, you know,

1275
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:54,580
we need like a letter writing campaign or something.

1276
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,580
Yeah, like a save Star Trek style letter writing campaign

1277
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:01,580
to get tiling on one specific virtual desktop at a time

1278
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,580
or a couple at a time.

1279
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:04,580
I think you know some people there.

1280
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:07,580
Maybe you can like expedite some features.

1281
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,580
I'm just sending good vibes to Jeremy.

1282
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,580
I'm just sending good vibes.

1283
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,580
Look, I'll buy a whole bunch of launches

1284
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,580
if I can get this one feature.

1285
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:17,580
Oh, I can almost hear it now.

1286
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,580
Mini Mac, I bet you're going to tell me

1287
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,580
Enlightenment can do this, aren't you?

1288
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:24,580
As far as I know, Enlightenment can do it.

1289
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,580
I never tried it,

1290
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,580
but as far as I know, Enlightenment can do it.

1291
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,580
You can desktop and manipulate independent.

1292
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,580
You can decide which desktop,

1293
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,580
and that should work.

1294
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,580
And you can do it with the key press.

1295
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,580
You can do it.

1296
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,580
The answer is always Enlightenment with you.

1297
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:41,580
Yeah.

1298
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,580
Just give it a try.

1299
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:43,580
All right.

1300
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,580
I really should.

1301
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:48,580
If anybody else knows a way to do it with Plasma,

1302
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,580
do let me know.

1303
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:53,580
Otherwise, our next email comes in.

1304
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,580
Hey guys, seems the road show is going well.

1305
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,580
I'm writing from across the pond.

1306
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,580
I think his name was Chris, if I recall.

1307
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,580
And I wanted to acquire as to your thoughts

1308
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:04,580
on the topic of careers in Linux and cloud admin.

1309
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,580
Have you in the past or will you consider in the future

1310
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,580
making this a topic on a JV podcast?

1311
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:13,580
I'm specifically considering a rather late career change

1312
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,580
transitioning from mostly network telecom

1313
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,580
and project management

1314
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,580
over to Linux and cloud service administrations,

1315
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,580
aka maybe an SRE.

1316
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:25,580
I have some trepidation at 50 years plus making such a leap,

1317
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,580
but I need a change for nothing more than my own sanity.

1318
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,580
And I liked this question a lot

1319
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:34,580
because I think this is a really hard thing to do.

1320
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:38,580
I made the transition from my IT career in my 30s,

1321
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:42,580
and I can only imagine how stressful it must be

1322
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,580
to try to do it in your 50s.

1323
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:47,580
So I have a lot of respect for our listener attempting to do this.

1324
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:50,580
And Wes, I wanted to kind of bounce it to you

1325
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,580
because you, as a bit of a hobby,

1326
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:56,580
just are always kind of monitoring the job postings.

1327
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:59,580
You're always kind of looking at job requirements

1328
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,580
as just sort of a point of interest.

1329
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,580
And I'm curious what you think about

1330
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,580
where somebody might want to focus.

1331
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,580
If they've got some project management background,

1332
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,580
if they know a little bit of Linux,

1333
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:12,580
but they want to transition more into cloud services

1334
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:14,580
or maybe some sort of Linux job

1335
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,580
where they're doing site reliability stuff,

1336
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,580
do you have any tips from what you've been seeing

1337
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,580
in the postings and whatnots?

1338
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,580
You know, it is definitely tough.

1339
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,580
There is certainly some ageism in the tech community, right?

1340
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,580
If you're not in your 20s and willing to work 70 hours a week,

1341
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,580
there's this impression that it can be hard

1342
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,580
to get the right job out there.

1343
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:36,580
But I think our listener has a lot of things going for him.

1344
00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:38,580
If you've got project management experience,

1345
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,580
you've got experience being able to manage yourself,

1346
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,580
you know how to run these things,

1347
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,580
which means you can get work done, maybe not day one,

1348
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,580
an independent operator, that's super useful.

1349
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:50,580
And in the era of the cloud,

1350
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,580
those networking skills are pretty much invaluable.

1351
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,580
I mean, you're going to be using a VPC.

1352
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,580
You're going to have to be dealing with load balancers

1353
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:00,580
and firewalls and IAM permissions.

1354
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,580
So, you know, pick some cloud technologies.

1355
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,580
Definitely get familiar with stuff like Terraform.

1356
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,580
Throw in something like Ansible

1357
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,580
if you're curious about configuration management.

1358
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:12,580
And then, yeah, just stress the skills that you do have now.

1359
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:15,580
You can pick up all the little Linux details as you go.

1360
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,580
Yeah, I agree.

1361
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,580
I think there's a differentiator between somebody,

1362
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,580
if you primarily are working with cloud services,

1363
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,580
there's differentiator between somebody

1364
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,580
who understands and appreciates the Linux fundamentals

1365
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,580
and doesn't.

1366
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,580
Like, that's one of the things I really like about Wes

1367
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,580
is he's very current on what a lot of the cloud platforms

1368
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,580
are doing and how to interact with them

1369
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,580
and how to build services on top of them.

1370
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,580
But Wes also has a deep understanding

1371
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,580
of the Linux fundamentals.

1372
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:43,580
And so that kind of makes him a special kind of unicorn

1373
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,580
because he's kind of more rounded.

1374
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,580
But I think what you have to do is,

1375
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,580
and I sent you an email in this regard,

1376
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:52,580
is I think you need to focus on some certain areas in training

1377
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:55,580
which you and I already talked about via email

1378
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,580
and pursue those.

1379
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,580
And then, like Wes said, fill in those details.

1380
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,580
Like, listen to the show when we talk about something

1381
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,580
like WireGuard or when we talk about Nebula soon.

1382
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,580
Tune into that kind of stuff and build something off of that

1383
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,580
and go use that as a learning opportunity.

1384
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,580
We're kind of there with you to do it, right?

1385
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,580
You can kind of write in and tell us about your experience,

1386
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,580
and we can be there to kind of cheer you along.

1387
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:16,580
So consider that as well.

1388
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:17,580
It's a great way to learn.

1389
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,580
And maybe if you come up with some ideas,

1390
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,580
some areas you want to play with

1391
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:21,580
that you haven't heard us talk about,

1392
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,580
well, suggest it and maybe we'll feature it

1393
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:24,580
on an upcoming show.

1394
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,580
You never know.

1395
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,580
Yeah, very much so, very much so.

1396
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,580
I just wanted to mention we do have stickers up

1397
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,580
on the JupiterGarage.com.

1398
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:34,580
We made stickers from the, what do you call it?

1399
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:36,580
What is that high-resolution vector stuff called?

1400
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,580
SVG.

1401
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,580
That.

1402
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,580
I thought Brett would know.

1403
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,580
He's a graphics guy after all.

1404
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,580
Well, photo guy.

1405
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,580
It's rasters versus vectors here.

1406
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,580
Come on.

1407
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:46,580
Well, we took them vectors and we said,

1408
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,580
hey, you know what we could do

1409
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,580
is we could make some real nice stickers with them.

1410
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,580
And so we took the album art for the shows

1411
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,580
and we went and made stickers up at JupiterGarage.com,

1412
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:56,580
and it's great.

1413
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,580
I at first was like, no, that's dumb.

1414
00:53:58,580 --> 00:53:59,580
We shouldn't do that.

1415
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:00,580
We should come up with brand new stickers,

1416
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,580
which we still will.

1417
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,580
But then I thought, well, why not?

1418
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,580
I mean, this has been published on every episode.

1419
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,580
Now you can have a sticker of it.

1420
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,580
It's a pretty great way to go.

1421
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,580
JupiterGarage.com.

1422
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:10,580
You can find our friends.

1423
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,580
We're at a Cloud Guru on social media.

1424
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:17,580
They're pretty much just slash a Cloud Guru anywhere,

1425
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,580
like the YouTubes, the Twitters, the Facebooks.

1426
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,580
If it's a social platform, they're probably there.

1427
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,580
It's slash a Cloud Guru.

1428
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:23,580
You can go find them there.

1429
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,580
Brent, where would you like people to find you?

1430
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,580
Oh, I think Twitter is a good place to find me.

1431
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,580
I'm at Brent Jervais.

1432
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,580
And what about you, Wes Payne?

1433
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:32,580
I'm at Wes Payne.

1434
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,580
Don't worry if you can't spell Brent's last name.

1435
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:36,580
We'll have a link in the show notes.

1436
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,580
That's true.

1437
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:38,580
That is true.

1438
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,580
I'm over there.

1439
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,580
I'm at Chris LAS.

1440
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,580
Mostly, I just tweet sparingly.

1441
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,580
I'm not going to muck your timeline up,

1442
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,580
but I'm also not just 100% AFK.

1443
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,580
You know, you tweet at me.

1444
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,580
I might do you the honor of a reply.

1445
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,580
Especially if it's a Rust pick.

1446
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:55,580
Boy, they're all over me these days with the Rust picks.

1447
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,580
I tell you what.

1448
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,580
No, I love them, actually.

1449
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:58,580
It's a great way to send them in,

1450
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,580
because then I can sneak them to Wes.

1451
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,580
Although, he often reads my Twitter feed,

1452
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,580
so I can't always sneak it past him.

1453
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:04,580
You never know.

1454
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:05,580
I might be able to sneak it past him

1455
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,580
if you send it to me at Chris LAS.

1456
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,580
The network is at Jupiter Signal,

1457
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,580
and this here podcast is at Linux Unplugged.

1458
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,580
But I got a pro tip for you.

1459
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,580
You could join us live.

1460
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,580
We do this show on Tuesdays at noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern.

1461
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:20,580
See you next week.

1462
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,580
Same bat time, same bat station.

1463
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,580
And man, here's the thing.

1464
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:25,580
Here's the thing.

1465
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,580
If you're not catching Linux action news,

1466
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:28,580
you're missing.

1467
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:30,580
You're missing what's going on.

1468
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,580
You're missing on the news.

1469
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:34,580
You're missing out on stuff that impacts your gerb.

1470
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,580
Come on, stay informed.

1471
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,580
Jeez.

1472
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,580
LinuxActionNews.com for that.

1473
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,580
But as for us, LinuxUnplugged.com is where you can find links

1474
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,580
to what we talked about today.

1475
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,580
This is episode 420.

1476
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,580
You can also find our subscribe link over there,

1477
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,580
that contact page.

1478
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,580
We'd love to hear from you.

1479
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,580
And our Matrix server info.

1480
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,580
I don't mention that enough,

1481
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:54,580
but the community is still growing over on our Matrix,

1482
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,580
and we'd love to have you there.

1483
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,580
Seems like elements going in a good direction.

1484
00:55:58,580 --> 00:55:59,580
Why not come join the party?

1485
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,580
Maybe leave a voice message.

1486
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:02,580
Maybe.

1487
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,580
Eh, maybe not.

1488
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:33,580
Either way, see you back here next Tuesday!

1489
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:49,580
I don't want to tear down my setup.

1490
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:53,580
You know, cause like every time I record on this road trip,

1491
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,580
we've been moving and the kids need to sleep here.

1492
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:00,580
And so I've had to tear down my setup after every single episode.

1493
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:03,580
And so yesterday's coder was the first time I did a show

1494
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:04,580
and didn't have to tear down afterwards.

1495
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:08,580
And now I have to tear down again because we're moving on soon.

1496
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:12,580
And I don't want to, I want to build a permanent setup

1497
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,580
in the RV for podcasting so bad.

1498
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,580
You know, I hear Brent's pretty handy.

1499
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:18,580
That's true.

1500
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,580
You can take advantage of me for another two weeks.

1501
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,580
Yeah, yeah.

1502
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,580
I did hear when you were at System 76,

1503
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,580
you were starting to dream a little bit.

1504
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:26,580
Some possibilities.

1505
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,580
I actually think one of my genuine mistakes

1506
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,580
on this road trip was I should have ordered

1507
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:32,580
one of their little BB Thalios,

1508
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:34,580
you know, those tiny little Thalios.

1509
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,580
I should have ordered one of those,

1510
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,580
like when we were days out at Denver

1511
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,580
and then on the last day, see if they could have given it to me.

1512
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,580
Like if they could have,

1513
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,580
if they could have built it that fast,

1514
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,580
I'm not saying they could have,

1515
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,580
but if they could have, I could have just taken it with me.

1516
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,580
What I really kind of want those,

1517
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:48,580
I want something I can mount to the wall.

1518
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:50,580
So it has to be really kind of probably even smaller

1519
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:51,580
than the baby Thalio.

1520
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,580
And then I want a screen that folds down

1521
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,580
and I want a mounting spot for a microphone

1522
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,580
and I don't ever want to have to tear down

1523
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,580
and set up a laptop and a mixer

1524
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,580
and the tablet screen and the microphone stand

1525
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:02,580
and all the cables.

1526
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:04,580
I feel like you also need one of those, you know,

1527
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:05,580
feeders they have in like a rat cage,

1528
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:32,580
but there's just beer in it.
